This Week in Tech, the show that covers the latest tech news with journalists from across  the world and around the nation.  Starting with in the upper center square of the block, it's Baratunde Thurston.  Hey, Baratunde.  Good to have you back on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good to be here from Brooklyn.  Thanks for having me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's representing Brooklyn from Baratunde.com.  He's also the web editor, political editor for The Onion Magazine and host of Popular  Science's Future of show on the Science Channel.  And always glad to have you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have a show?  Do you have a, you don't have a show tonight.  I don't have to rush to get you out of here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm good to go.  I've got a Web 2.0 talk later this week, but hopefully we'll be done by Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I know that feeling.  Jarvis is stuck around, which is very nice from the This Week in Google show.  And he's well, well pickled.  Fresh as a daisy.  It's good to have you, Jeff, from BuzzMachine.com, one of the really great commentators on the  future of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For that, do I get a book plug, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a book.  We forgot to plug the book on the Twig show.  Yeah, you can plug the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's okay.  I got trouble there, but this is a new bunch of sufferers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The book is What Would Google Do?  And available at Better Book Stores.  Also it's an audible book.  And on the Kindle?  Yes.  On the Kindle, too.  That's fantastic.  Great to have you back, Jeff.  And in the lower right-hand corner, to block, it is Mr. John C. Dvorak.  Is that a twit hat you're wearing?  No, I don't think so.  I couldn't be so blessed.  What are you wearing there?  What's that hat?  Just a hat.  It says, alumni for the Evergreen State College.  Well, that's great.  Apparently they don't know the difference between alumnus and alumna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And why would they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't do Latin at Evergreen.  Great to have all three of you on the show today.  Don't forget, channeldvorak.com.  See, I almost forgot the plug.  Can't do that.  Channeldvorak.com.  Boy, this was the week.  One of you must be a gamer.  I'm guessing, Baratunde, you might play a game or two.  You as the youngest person on the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I play a little bit.  I just got an Xbox 360 a few months back, and I play Left 4 Dead and Burnout.  I haven't played the Modern Warfare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to go get Modern Warfare, too, baby.  Join the crowd.  The largest, according to at least to the Infinity War, the creator of the game,  the largest media launch of all time, 4.7 million copies sold.  I mean, huge revenue, $310 million.  Bigger than any movie launch, bigger than the biggest movie of all time, Dark Knight,  which was last year, twice as big as the Dark Knight first weekend.  And this is in one day, by the way.  One day sales.  Bigger than the biggest record album out there, even bigger than the last big video game,  which was last year was Grand Theft Auto IV.  A huge $310 million sale in one day in the UK and North America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you finish the sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wanted to talk about these numbers because it's always very popular for people to say  video game releases are bigger than movies.  But what's always left out of those stories, at least in the lead of those stories,  is that they cost $60 a pop.  Right.  If you're just talking revenue.  Like Dark Knight did, I don't know, at least three times as much  because the movie tickets aren't yet $60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Dark Knight is a two-hour commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this, what, a 40-hour commitment?  It's like a job, right?  The rest of your life, it's like a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, you guys at The Onion...  The job's paid to do.  You guys at The Onion did a very funny Modern Warfare 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, ultra-realistic Modern Warfare game features awaiting orders and repairing trucks.  It was about five minutes of that.  It just shows guys fixing their Humvees and waiting for the orders to come down, guarding Green Zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was really a very, very funny piece.  I think that The Onion News Network is so realistic.  Are those real news people that they use on those?  That's a great question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of them are.  So we've had Bobby Bautista, a former CNN reporter, reporting for us.  The most realistic people come for the morning show, which we call Today Now,  which parodies Good Morning America, the early show,  all these sunshiny people who are creepily happy.  And we found that actors couldn't be creepy enough.  They just had to have a real morning news anchor to get that disconcerting sense of positivity.  Only someone trained to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to be a trained professional.  It's not acting.  It's something else.  I don't know exactly what it is.  It's just being.  It's truly amazing.  Hey Leo, can the two of us get on that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we could be creepily happy.  What do you think, John?  Oh yeah, hey.  Hey.  Happy talk news.  I think that's a good idea, John.  Maybe we got something.  It's really funny because it's uncannily.  It looks like the real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Be careful or Onion will do a version of Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not.  That's how you've made it.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not well known enough.  Exactly.  They haven't already?  No, no.  Yeah.  When that happens, I will say, man, see, Mom, I'm in the Onion now.  Anyway, huge success, but you made a very good point.  If you talk about unit sales, it's not close to the Dark Knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But still.  I think it speaks to people's desire to kind of be in the story more than watch somebody  else's vision of a story unfold.  It's interactive.  It's collaborative.  You're playing with your friends.  All these things are harder to do in a movie theater.  You're just sitting there watching someone else's vision unfold.  This, you get to be a part of that unfolding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really pissed off PC gamers, though.  I had a PC gamer call a radio show saying, you got to dance with the one that brung you.  We made Call of Duty the successful franchise it is.  And on this one, Infinity War decided not to have dedicated servers, which is something  apparently PC gamers really count on.  Infinity War's response to this was, well, first of all, that's a small number of people.  And in fact, I guess the success of the sales shows that it is.  And we decided that we wanted to improve the experience of the participants.  They said, given the choice between making this small number of kind of hardcore gamers  happy and improving the overall experience for everyone, we're just prioritizing the  player experience above the modders and the tuners.  Jason West was one of the heads of Infinity Ward.  He says the cheating, the insular communities, the skill level disparities were making the  game fractured.  It's true.  When you go on one of these dedicated servers, you die immediately, instantly.  He said, maybe we thought maybe it'd be cool if the fans could play the game.  But boy, there's a petition online, 200,000 plus people sign it saying, bring back the  dedicated servers.  I don't know if that's too inside baseball for us to discuss.  Every time I've tried now to talk about this three different times and each time the PC  guy said, no, you're getting it wrong.  You're getting it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, from the link that you had on the delicious feed, it sounds like the big benefit was A,  you could have a private match going on.  Right.  But more importantly, you could modify the game and create your own rules.  And that level of kind of user generated innovation and kind of building on the platform of the  game is where a lot of these web tools tend to take us.  You can do whatever you want on top of their system.  These were all violations of the terms of service, of course, and apparently it reduced  the quality of the gameplay for some other people.  So the people who own the game were like, sorry, hardcore fans who made us who we are.  We're big now.  We don't need you anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the other issue that they don't bring up is that it prevents piracy because if you  control the servers, you block people who don't have legitimate copies.  They say 60% of the players were using illegal copies.  But maybe this is the real reason.  And this is from an article that Fopo Gigi just sent me from computerandvideogames.com.  Activision says you should expect paid for online models such as those in World of Warcraft  where you pay a monthly fee to make the transition to other games, including Call of Duty.  So it may be what they're saying is we don't want you to run servers because we want to  charge you a monthly fee to play online.  You're already paying that with Xbox Live.  I mean, they make a monthly fee off of it.  So it makes sense that they do the same thing to PC players.  That's really what's going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Money, money, money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I guess in one way you can't blame them because, you know, that's their  business.  But on the other hand, you made three hundred ten million dollars in the first day.  Maybe you should just let them have that was that's old news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, that's last week's news.  We want to make money this week and next week and the week after.  We can't sell the game again.  So we just slice it up into monthly installments.  It's like a layaway plan for the game.  Yep.  Pretty soon they'll charge interest on these monthly plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I want to take a break.  We're going to come back in just a second to talk about why text ads work better than  all those blinky ads you see.  But right now I want to tell you about my car, my Ford Mustang.  Do you guys see it out front?  Isn't that sweet?  Isn't that sweet?  OK, but actually the ad is not for my car.  It's for the stuff in the car.  It's for the Ford SYNC.  This thing is amazing.  Microsoft showed this, I remember, a couple of years ago at CES.  At the time I thought, well, that's kind of cool.  But when I started using it, I realized, wow, this is incredible.  It's a hands-free system for not just for your phone.  I mean, yeah, you've got, of course, all the Bluetooth features you look for, but it also  lets you talk to the car.  And it's like Kit Knight Rider.  I feel like David Hasselhoff when I get in that thing.  I say things like, I press the button on the wheel, by the way.  You don't need to look down.  You just press a button on the wheel, and I say, directions.  And it says, directions.  Where to?  And I'll say Starbucks.  And it'll tell me the way to the Starbucks.  There's no screen.  There's a little LED screen.  But this is not a GPS, like the big GPS system you pay thousands of dollars for.  This is the Ford SYNC system.  You can say, read text messages.  And if you have a compatible phone, it'll read you your text messages.  You could say, read me the front page of the New York Times.  It'll read you that.  It has, I mean, I can go on and on.  It has 911 assist.  So if you get in an accident, the airbags are deployed.  It calls 911.  It plays a recorded message.  It gives you the chance, of course, to override it if you decide you don't want to make that call.  And then it turns the microphone on in the car so you can talk to 911.  If 911, and more and more of them aren't able to do this, has GPS capability,  it will send them the exact GPS location so the emergency crew can go right to where you are.  Vehicle health report.  I have it set to send me one every 5,000 miles, but at any time I could just say,  send me a vehicle health report.  The car tells me the status of all the systems.  I can just go on and on.  You get personalized sports.  If you've got a fantasy league, you actually get your fantasy results,  all of it without looking away from the road, with your hands on the wheel, both hands on the wheel.  It is amazing.  Even personalized traffic reports because it knows your route to school or work.  You can say play Twit.  And you have to, of course, have Twit on your device.  But if you've got Twit on your MP3 player, it will play it.  I mean, it's amazing.  This thing is like Knight Rider.  The future is here.  I want you to take a look at it.  The next time you're at a Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealer, say, I want to see the SYNC.  And here's your chance to win a free Nano or Zune by visiting the website, syncmyridepodcast.com.  Just go there.  Just go there, syncmyridepodcast.com.  Or if you're on Twitter, everybody in the room now.  We've got a big audience, big studio audience today.  Just tweet something like, listening to Twit.  I'm in the Twit cottage listening to Twit with Baratunde and Dvorak and Jarvis.  And then put the pound sign and SYNC My Ride podcast, all one word, pound SYNC My Ride podcast.  And you're automatically entered to win a free Nano or Zune, your choice.  They're giving away 15 of each between now and December 8th.  And all you have to do to enter is tweet.  See, he's doing it. Look at that.  He's a smart man. He's doing it on his Android.  And you're using the keyboard. That's interesting.  Yeah. You find that keyboard usable?  No. He's saying no.  SYNC, but get it right now, S-Y-N-C-M-Y-R-I-D-E podcast.  And we thank Ford and the great SYNC.  By the way, I bought the car. Ford did not buy the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you get a good price, I hope?  No. I paid less.  Silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I went to a Mercury dealer and asked to see the sink and they sent me to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You spelled it wrong. You guys say S-Y-N-C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So all these extra capabilities, does the car still function as a vehicle to transport you from A to B or is it just everything else in life?  I don't need to. You're so happy.  Exactly.  You're just in the parking lot all day watching television.  It's like a giant inverse of PC. You're inside of it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. It's so cool.  The one I got, not all of them have this, but the one I got has a hard drive in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get the Shelby 500?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I almost did, John. I came close, but I got the next one down.  The G-T...  The Cobra?  No, I didn't get a Cobra. I got the G-T Premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Shelby 500 I think is better than the Cobra and then there's the G-T.  No, they're the same. There's a G-T 500 and there's a Cobra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a plane Cobra and there's the Shelby 500.  It's not my midlife crisis, Jeff. I want to be very clear about this. It's my second childhood, okay?  Is it a convertible?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, man, you're disappointing me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's bright candy apple red. John, I'll take you for a ride.  All right.  It's beautiful. It is so beautiful.  That's the ticket getter.  I know. It's insane. Come here. I'm here. But it's got a V8. It's got so much power and it's so much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a V8? Wait a minute. Leo. V8. Leo. Green Leo has got a V8 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I got 20 miles to the gallon when I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't even get the V8 Lexus engine when you had a Lexus.  No, I know.  Now you're getting a V8? What changed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't commute anymore, John. I just drive it.  He just sits in it and doesn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I just sit and listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You start the engine up and gun it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. I have to admit when I pull up, just to make the staff crazy, I gun it.  And you know, we got the license plate. I've ordered it. It hasn't come yet. It says Twit TV on the license plate.  Yay.  Yeah. It's going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  What?  We're talking stalkers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody knows. Four people are in the studio. Just showed up.  Stalkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just showed up. How did you find it?  I understand one of the couples there is on their honeymoon and they're in the studio for that reason alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ben and Chris Patterson got married two days ago. Can I say who you work for, Ben?  I work for Pint Air.  You work for who?  Pint Air Pool Products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why does it say Salesforce?  Because I'm the administrator for our company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I've been saying Salesforce. It's for... What is it? Pint Air?  P-E-N-T-A-I-R.  Pool Products in North Carolina. And his poor wife... No, she's a geek too. They're both here and it's great.  On their honeymoon...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you drum the secret bedroom upstairs? Maybe they could like take a break during one of the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do have a futon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want a bed and breakfast over there too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There used to be a bed and breakfast. There's a claw foot tub. Next time you... When you come out, Jeff, I've got to show you.  There's a claw foot tub upstairs. Just made for honeymooners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Honeymooners... I just want to clarify. They took their honeymoon to Twit?  Did you...  It's a detour.  It's a detour from the honeymoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like that would be great for Twit.  It's a little weird for them, is what you're saying.  Yeah, weird for them. Great for the show.  We'll tell everybody that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are not the first honeymooners to come here, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are we going to do any news today? Just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo pulls the plug after 14 years on GeoCities. Founded in 1995. Yahoo bought it in 1999.  Seven million of the internet's first websites lost forever. Are we sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we know how much they paid for it originally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then we need to know how much they paid for it and then how much money they lost running it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is another one of those great Yahoo moments, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't want to plug the book in, but I say in there that Yahoo is the last old media company  and they asked the question, what are we really? And they gave the wrong answer.  They said, we're showbiz!  What they really were, and AOL too, was Facebook before there was Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  At this point they had an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They drop the ball more often than punchline.  Come on, comic.  Come on, comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't follow sports involving balls of any kind.  Here's the number 3.6 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They paid more for GeoCities than they did for broadcast.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. 3.6 billion. That's why both people is a happy guy.  And more than Google did for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. More than YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These companies pissed away more money than it's unimaginable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they were spending funny money because it was, you know, their stock IPO, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan reported in February 2, 1999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3 billion. Unbelievable.  3.6? Don't forget the .6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of money there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  600 million here or there. Does that really matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I was talking about in the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got a friend in grad school at CMU and we've been talking about how do you document the Internet's history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you're looking, you know, 10, 15 or a hundred years from now, how will we record this period and how will we share it?  Will there be installations?  And I think the sad part for me, which is a little tragic, is that they just deleted it.  It's not like storage costs anything.  There's no technical reason why this can't just sit there.  You know, as part of our collective history of this new fantasy and crazy medium.  Buy a 1.5 terabyte drive for 112 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could have it. We don't have our own copy of Geocities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it couldn't be more than a terabyte and a half.  I mean, those those sites, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it can't be that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's I think you make a good point.  We could have our own Geocities or somebody could have just said she could have just turned it over to some, you know, like archive.org  and kept the thing going forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's people were upset.  So how did that happen?  I mean, this is we're in the age of transparency and everybody knew this was coming.  Nobody ran over with a thumb drive to the Geocities headquarters and just said, wait a minute, let me copy that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put it on a thumb drive.  Seven. All right. Seven million sites.  Let's assume that the site, the average site is a megabyte, right?  Probably most are smaller.  That's too low.  Oh, smaller.  Oh, yeah, smaller.  You know, more than a megabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People say they say there are photos and there's a lot of ways.  Okay.  So I assume a gigabyte, then still only seven terabytes, which you can buy at Costco

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for fifty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seventy five bucks a terabyte.  So I mean, it's not that much.  You're talking about five, six hundred bucks forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just lowered the price of their storage.  You put it on your Gmail account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You really could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just set up a bunch of Gmail accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is they're telling me in the chat room, there is this site called Rio cities, our EO cities dot com.  Here's here lies.  It says what we could salvage from the ashes of Geocities.  So maybe apparently they've saved some of it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The question is, do we want to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think no matter how ugly it's part of us, John, like we have to look back and learn from our history and say never again.  Never again.  Never again.  Never again.  And take a look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HTML one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HTML one.  Is that what it's written in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, I'm sure most of the sites are in HTML one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they all gray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gray background, that great Netscape gray background.  Remember that?  Oh, that was ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I thought it was all ugly.  Geocities is probably all better looking than MySpace.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of MySpace.  Should we bring up the Rupert Murdoch story, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch, the paragon of brilliance in the media, the old media has decided that Google is just a bunch of plagiarists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're stealing my content.  And get off the lawn, you kids.  Get off of my lawn.  I'm trying to write a newspaper here.  And what are they doing?  They're nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's decided that when is this going to be?  Next year sometime?  Yeah, sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pull himself off the Google?  They're going to pull the paywall and then they're going to threaten to pull out of Google.  See you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  I'm going to pull out.  Let's put a pool together on bed on that one.  Yeah, there's no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give you one penny on that one.  It's not going to happen.  It's just macho sword waving.  Posturing, posturing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Negotiation tactics here.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they are renegotiating the $300 million deal for MySpace that Google did.  And MySpace didn't earn their end of the bargain.  What was the deal?  Was it a search deal?  It was an ad guarantee deal.  And so if they got a certain amount of traffic they had to get, they'd get $300 million from Google.  And I wish I had this in front of me.  I don't.  I think it came in something like $100 million short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  MySpace is just dying on the vine.  It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They don't know what to do.  I'm going to take MySpace behind the paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is the time?  I went through Murdoch's Collier disaster on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I worked for Delphi Internet, which was actually the first consumer service to bring the internet  to anybody.  And then that morphed into something called iGuide, which was a terrible disaster.  Millions of dollars.  It was a loft space in Manhattan, now empty.  And everybody forgets Murdoch has had many disasters on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember that iGuide.  He built a newsroom that was stunning.  It was beautiful.  Did it ever go online?  I mean, did anything ever happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did, but briefly.  Then they changed strategy about 10 times.  I think it became TV Guide Online.  That's a good idea.  And then died a terrible death the way the whole company might now.  I'm being bitter.  I worked for them.  They were fine.  And they were smart people.  But they don't know the internet.  Michael Wolfe said that Rupert Murdoch a year ago had never used Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I doubt he starts now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, it's great.  What?  Now that Strom Thurmond is gone and some of the other paragons of earlier centuries are gone,  we need somebody like that.  We don't have Senator Stevens to kick around anymore.  The internet needs people like Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are my pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the idea of pulling out of sort of blocking Google's crawler that they will make a deal with another search engine or that you'll have to go directly to the property?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's what Jason Calacanis and then Michael Larrington in turn speculated about, arguing that the New York Times and News Corp should pull out and make a deal with Bing.  But the New York Times also owns About.com, which gets 80% of its traffic and 50% of its ad revenue from Google.  So I don't think it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, a funny thing you mentioned, Jeff, do you realize that in 1993, Delphi, which was the first internet connection, was sold to Rupert Murdoch?  I think he does realize that.  I guess he sold it. I guess he couldn't deal with it.  And he sold it.  Apparently in 1996, I'm reading the question from a dubious source, was down to less than 5,000 by some accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I had a Delphi account. I loved Delphi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Delphi was great.  Delphi was one of the big three.  They were trying to create their own AOL prodigy like GUI. It was a disaster.  I remember.  And I was there just at the moment when Netscape was released.  And I was among those who said, you know, I think you might want to try this web thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they kept going for a long time, and then I quit.  Just go on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when did you, Jeff, when did you kind of start seeing the look? Because you're an old media guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm an old guy, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like me, an old guy.  Or an old, old media guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When did you start seeing the light? Were you working at Us Magazine?  People.  I'm sorry, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one inch above in the evolutionary scale of slime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you said it very quickly. Don't know. Not us. People.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got my Osborne 1 in 81. And I was on the source and all that stuff. And I saw it coming.  And when I was a TV guy at News Corp, I was, you know, going to Usenet groups to talk about TV shows.  Wow.  Yeah, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So yeah, you earned your credentials.  I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Devorak's been around at least 30 years longer than I have.  Well, he was a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was in the internet in 45.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, you were on the source, I remember. I was on Compuserve. And I think I used Delphi and Genie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had both the source and Compuserve.  Compuserve, I remember.  Yeah, I liked Compuserve.  The source was kind of the disappointing one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  1183, I think that was my number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  75106, 3135.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know there were never any 8s or 9s in any of those numbers because all the computers were octal machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They weren't born yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I actually created the internet, so I got that going for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you're siding on it again. Unplug and plug in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pull out, Baratunde.  They're all octal machines to the end.  Pull out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here we go.  That is just...  Pull out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're coming through your laptop, Mike. You have to set the... Sometimes when you would pull out...  Now it sounds better.  There it is. It's all better.  Okay.  Sometimes when you pull out, the laptop pulls in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these local BBS systems, and then I found a way to hack into the open internet through the Montgomery County Public Library system.  Oh, wow.  So I go in through their card catalog. You could dial into their card catalog, and then if you hit the right links, you'd find this open door.  It was just a prompt. And then from there, I could tell that into wherever I wanted to end up. This was in maybe mid-94, and I was so proud of myself.  I felt like such a little hacker.  Look at the credentials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you using Gopher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was using Gopher. I remember Gopher from...  Gopher.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had this kind of a similar experience. I was on the Well, which was...  The Well.  The Well, the Whole Earth Electronic Link, and that was started by the Whole Earth folks.  And the Well, you could drop out of... They had forum software, basically. Very primitive.  It was green text on a black screen, but you could drop out of it to a shell prompt, and then you could use links to browse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I remember very well the first time when I got on... I was using mostly Gopher, which was a menuing system.  But the first time I used links... And there were probably not very many sites, and this must have been roughly the same time, 92, 91, 93, somewhere around there.  But I got, for the first time ever, that experience that, wow, there's a lot of people out there.  And now, of course, it's commonplace. But that first experience of, wow, there's a lot of people using this is pretty transformative, I think.  Yeah.  Do you remember your first experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a fascinating story, Leo. What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We missed you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that... You remember, was it Trinit... What was the one? Trinity? That predated prodigy was called something else.  Trinit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, prodigy, wasn't it based on the Minitel stuff that France did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's this... But they had another name for it. It was something Triton or Trin-ton.  You don't think of quantum? Quantum, like...  No, no, no. It's just the name of the thing before they changed it. This is when the first investor... I don't remember.  Somebody can look it up and pass it along.  Somebody will tell you.  But I remember that they were going to do that system, and they were going to put ads all over the place, and everybody was upset.  Oh, they were so upset about these ads. And now, we're doing podcasts with ads.  Well, thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's your segue.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to tell you a little bit about our good friends at Citrix, the makers of GoToMeeting.  Should I do it? I should do it. Why not? We're here.  We're here. You put us here, John. But I do want to talk a little bit about when the National Science Foundation...  I think it was 95 when they said, okay, now you can run commercials on the Internet. Before then, you couldn't. So we'll talk about that in a second.  You guys remember telephones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was a kid, we only used rocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to talk about the folks at GoToMeeting. I mean, these guys have been around since that very... those early days.  Citrix is one of the first Internet remote access companies. They kind of invented the product.  Microsoft licensed it. I mean, you probably experienced it in Windows. In fact, you can still run Citrix Server.  They do a whole host of consumer interfaces to this incredible remote access technology, including GoToMeeting.  Let me tell you a little bit about GoToMeeting. It is the way, if you're going to do online meetings, to do it.  There are other products out there. I'm well aware of that. But this is the one we use. We use it sometimes on the podcasts,  so that people can show us their screens while they're on Skype. We use it for meetings all the time.  In fact, sometimes people say, oh, I want to use... I won't say any names. I want to use XYZ technology and I'll say, sorry,  can we use GoToMeeting instead? And I'll start the meeting and say, okay, and I'll give them control.  I'll say, now show me your PowerPoint or your keynote. Now show me the slides or the presentation.  It's for collaborating, for training, for product demos, for sales. There isn't anything better.  It's the best and it's really good. It's secure, 128-bit encryption. You'll save money.  It's only $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want. And that includes free voice over Internet protocol  and free teleconferencing. Why waste time and money going to meetings, flying across the country or driving across town?  Save money. Save stress. Use GoToMeeting. I want you to try it free.  I love our sponsors because they're really great on giving you a chance to try it.  They trust that you will... They know you want to see it and they trust that you will, if something's really good, that you will buy it.  So try it free for 30 days. Go to GoToMeeting.com.  GoToMeeting.com. Somebody sent me an email saying, I bet there's a lot of people going to Meeting.com and MyPC.com  because it's always go to. Sometimes I say, go to GoToMeeting.com, but that's even more confusing.  So just the website is www.GOTOMeeting.com.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit. Give it a try today. I know you're going to love it. GoToMeeting from the folks at Citrix.  Thank you for that segue. What was it? Was it 94, 95? Do you remember the National Science Foundation said,  okay, you can now send commercial traffic over the Internet? It was that recently, I'm pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody? It had to be by 94 because that's when the first, I think, ads went up on HotWired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was probably right then. John and I were doing the radio show when it happened.  I remember very well when the NSF said, okay, we relinquish kind of our non-commercial rules on the Internet  and we'll allow, boy, that's, and at the time I remember thinking, this could be really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody was against it. I still remember when businesses decided it was okay to announce that they had a website  and so they go add these little taglines to their commercial with the URL, but they would just mess up the whole syntax.  It would be HTTP backslash backslash www.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like, what? Like you just broke something. What are you typing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When we started doing this site, which was the MSNBC show we started in 96,  they would, on all of the graphics they put on the screen, they'd have HTTP colon slash slash  and I said, you know, you guys, you probably could leave that off. No browser requires that.  You're wasting a lot of space. And then I remember at Tech TV a couple of years later saying  you could also leave out the www. Let's simplify this a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a period of time there where for some reason if you didn't set your server right,  if you didn't put www on it, it would die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I still see people who set them up wrong, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's completely possible to set it up that if you don't do that, and in fact, every once in a while I'll find a place like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking, what are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's your name? I'm a guy who wrote FidoNet.  I had friends who were SysOps and SysAdmins and they gave me privileges but I never operated one myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy who wrote FidoNet was Tom Jennings. You remember him, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually we gave him a Dvorak award one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was quite a character. He was a real...I wonder what he's doing.  FidoNet. Yeah, he was a little wack.  Google him. Well, he's on Wikipedia.  Oh, wow, he's gained an age.  He's now...  No, I look exactly the same. He's gained an age.  He's on the California Irvine.  I think he might be.  He created FidoNet. I ran a FidoNet clone called MacQ in 1984.  It was a Macintosh BBS in the early days of the Mac.  So we've got to get a hold of him. He works at the University of California Irvine.  I wonder if he does any programming. But that was a very empowering thing.  This is before the days of the internet. I had two modems.  They were 1200 Baude.  Blazing. Blazingly fast. What was the point?  Two modems, two lines. I was very sophisticated.  You were taking stuff in?  I was running the BBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a cheap guy you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John used to write for Boardwatch Magazine.  I remember when Seagate came out with their 20 MB MFM drives.  Not gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, this thing cost a mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think my awkward one had 96K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a 9600 Baude modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also the memory. What did the original 5 inch disc take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Single sided, single density was 120K.  There was a trick where you would punch a hole in it so you could flip the floppy over.  Oh yeah. That's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all foggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Format and verify.  Chateram says 78K, 160K, 180K.  The first Mac floppy, the hard diskettes, those were 400K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was luxurious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The crazy one that Steve Jobs tried to put on the first Lisa, what was that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hole for the data read where the head went was right where you would hold the disc to put it in.  It was so stupid.  I don't know how we got off on this tangent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chateram says it's this week in old farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How'd you get here Barrett?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been on since 1994.  I have links credentials.  I've got some hacker skills.  I used to be able to telnet directly into the mail port on a domain.  I used to use Yale's email system to fake emails.  I used to manually type out the headers that you wanted that email to see.  Most people didn't know how to expose full headers at that time to verify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can still do that.  You can telnet to port 25.  If you know what to type, you can type the whole session.  This is the problem with email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no authentication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can telnet into port 25 if you know the right things to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were at Harvard when you were doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were you faking Yale emails?  This is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me get back on the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually kind of interesting.  Jacob Nielsen is a real expert on web usability.  They have a new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never heard of anything other than SH asteris T.  Everybody holds them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're asking me why a site doesn't look like it was designed in 1989?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's hideous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sounding like Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're sounding like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wrote the book on industrial design.  His site is not so hot.  They have a new book.  They have a new book on eye tracking web usability.  What they do is track eye movements using cameras.  They have some cameras that do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is old.  I remember seeing this site in 1999.  Most of the sites were doing eye ball tracking.  They had all this crazy data about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the surprising, maybe counterintuitive, but very important result.  Participants in the study looked at 52% of the ads.  52% of ads that contained only text.  52% of ads that had images and text separately.  51% of sponsored links on search engine ads.  They're tracking the eye movements as they're looking at these ads.  Ads that got less attention included those that imposed text on top of images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the ads that had text only did as well as the ads with images.  Isn't that really a Google factor?  It's an issue not of the design but of the relevance.  They don't take that into account.  They sell the old media model of messages and impressions and scarcity.  Here's something that Mike confirmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Jarvis is on to something here.  The fact of the matter is if you're in an environment where text is like the primary mode of communication,  obviously people are going to be attracted to it.  It's not like Punch the Monkey was up there.  It was an obvious ad and it was annoying.  If you got into a very media rich site that had lots of pictures and photos and little captions to the photos,  I think you have to study that separately.  Typically the advertising feels like the magazine does.  People who don't have the right kind of publishers will let anybody advertise anything.  There's nothing worse than going through a magazine and you find some ad that looks like a cheap ad that doesn't belong in this magazine.  It makes the company look like a cheap company and you wouldn't ever buy their product in a million years.  There's a lot of variables here which aren't being discussed.  I think that's probably as important as the notion that text is great.  If you can slip in a paragraph in the middle of a news story saying to go buy a product, it's probably pretty effective.  That's the way to do it. Or like the ads we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to be in the same type font.  The ads we do are kind of indistinguishable from the content.  We say we're going to do an ad but it kind of blends in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I pile on with Jeff and John, which is they're assuming that this is trying to assess click per action or cost per action,  direct response ads rather than branding.  You can't brand with a text message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right, it's about click but they're watching what eyeballs are looking at.  I get this on my Facebook page. I don't know, maybe it's just me.  Busty woman on the right hand side. Have you noticed that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's targeted, Leo. It's targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get Yale dissertations on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a woman in here.  I'll go to my Facebook page.  I mean, not normal.  Me, you mean?  I get dusty women. Is that a difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got Mark Benioff's book on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop with the busty woman. Jarvis has got nothing.  Unfortunately, it's not working right now.  I'm getting a tomato can label and being asked to donate to Muriglian.  But I used to get busty women. Let me refresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are the advertising sweet spots for the onion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The types of people that come to our site, they want our age group, which is slightly younger, a little bit more educated and smarter.  You have to be that to get the material.  We get a lot of entertainment, new TV shows, movie releases, game title releases, a lot of alcohol, unsurprisingly.  Liquor companies and beer companies come through.  Not so much with software. We've had Yvonne Lines been on the site a whole lot.  That's like a sex thing, right?  No, Yvonne Lines is a massive multiplayer video game that has to do with sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm looking at my Facebook page and it's an ad for soup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like soup. Not too much to chew.  I'm going to eat you tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, I used to get busty women. I must have crossed some line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to double check your cookies. We have to look at your web history and see why that is.  They tested these ads.  According to Time Magazine, the guy came across a dating service ad.  The woman's face and chest once and then the surrounding text five times.  In that case, the text was better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about if it was a can of soup? Would that happen?  Maybe he's looking at the woman and saying, wow, this girl is hot.  She's living near me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not kidding. Look at Campbell's soup.  I've seen these ads from the Friend Finder group.  This woman is not living nearby.  This is bogus.  She doesn't live around here. She's a model or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's an onion story. A woman who wants sex with you doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you something else creepy.  We do have a lot more ability to track what happens with advertising than we've ever had.  In one of the segments for the Future Show that I was working on, we visited this company called Neuro Focus.  They track your attention to the 30-second spot,  your retention of what you saw, and your emotional engagement with what you saw, plus eye tracking.  They have millisecond level understanding of just how you respond to that ad.  Then we'll tweak it for future reference to have even more effective impact on your brain cells.  I can imagine them putting sensors in other places too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Philip K. Dick wrote about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That had nothing to do with John's comment. It was just a coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We let it go, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wrote many a story where ads are on every surface and they're targeting you.  In fact, Cory Doctorowd has a story where the ads know everything about you and they're on everything.  They're moving ads on the packages and they sense who you are.  I think this is just a matter of time.  Moving along, the Space Shuttle Atlantis launch will be twittered.  NASA is sending 100 of its Twitter followers to Cape Canaveral for tomorrow's launch of Atlantis.  They awarded tickets to the first 100 people to register on the site.  It's a tweet up at the launch site.  It's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a big fireball. Oh no, the humanity!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did they pick the people who get to go?  They picked a tweeter to go up in the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be new.  They should load up the ship with a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just get them off the planet.  NASA has used its astronauts to tweet from space in May.  Astro Mike.  That's so sad that they make the astronauts have handles to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could have put NASA. That would be less corny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Astro Jeff and Astro Nicole are also on the list of tweeting astronauts.  They're tweeting astronauts.  I'm a tweeting astronaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It never was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm peeing in my diapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about the 19 year old  who was arrested and put in Rikers Island for  robbing two men in Brooklyn who has been exonerated by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so cool.  It's cool and disturbing.  This kid was in jail for 12 days.  They let him out once they verified that he sent this Facebook message from his father's house in Harlem.  That's a great observation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is bar turn day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a hacker bar turn day. Couldn't you have hacked it to make believe you were in your father's house back in the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you just gave me a great criminal enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the new Facebook ad. Forget the busty girls. You need an alibi?  There's an app for that.  I'm getting a different ad.  Bring back the busty girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bugging me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm happy for Rodney Bradford. I feel bad that he spent 12 days at Rikers Island which is no picnic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most of our commentary about status updates and location tools and all the data about us that's available,  usually we're afraid of it.  We're like this is a privacy violation that's going to have negative consequences.  In this case, it was the opposite. It was because he was using these tools that showed where he was and what he was up to that he was exonerated.  In fact, maybe we should be publishing more of our hacks. It's a constant live stream just in case someone accuses us of a crime and we end up in Rikers.  Did you see where Britney Spears tweeted that she follows Satan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She follows Satan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On her account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Her account got hacked. It's not the first time Britney's account has been hacked. In fact, it's at least the second time to my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because her name is Britney and her password is Britney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My name is Britney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet her password is password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room says Britney Spears is Satan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guess how many Twitter followers Britney Spears has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3.7 million perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She didn't just build to that. She had to do hardly any when she started.  Then the corruption that takes place in the Twitter world of Twitter, they gave her a boost. She's got all kinds of people.  She should be paying them for that many.  Well, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that they knew this because other people on the suggested user list included Whole Foods. I know everybody wants to follow Whole Foods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I'm always interested in what cans of soup they're buying tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Del Owlett.  Britney also lost her MySpace account roughly the same time, which lends credence to the idea that maybe her password was password.  Password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This keeps happening. We keep having these stories of Twitter hacks, these direct message hacks. People send you things.  I saw you last night. It's very embarrassing.  They spread for a few hours and then people issue these apologies. I'm sorry my account was hacked.  So I guess it's probably just a sign of Twitter's popularity that they're now the target of scamsters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even though it's annoying, it's a good sign.  I'm getting direct messages now. And these are people I follow, right? Because you can't get a direct message from somebody you don't follow.  I'm getting direct messages from a guy who's a spammer. He says, LOL, this is hilarious.  Probably not hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then another one, Hey, can't believe I found out my IQ score with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get direct messages that are spam?  This isn't spam. If you click on these links, various things happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The show is going to end as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here it is. Welcome to the IQ Quiz.  Amazing fact subscription sent to your cell only $9.99 a month.  So what you do is I followed that link.  I just press the button start quiz and all of a sudden I'm going to get a $10 a month bill on my IQ.  Yeah, forever.  I've had one that sends you to a page that looks like a Twitter login page.  And of course your immediate reaction is, Oh, Twitter screwed up again.  And you start typing your name and password until you notice it ain't Twitter.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It reminds me of Britney Spears' password being password.  So I was borrowing somebody's computer and they had it.  People like to put a sticky note on the monitor and they write their password on it.  So they got a sticky, it says password equals password.  It was like, you can't even remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, but my staff said, can we password our computers?  Because I said, I don't want to password because I want to be able to get in on them.  And then I found out what they're using. It is the most rudimentary, stupid.  It's like better to not password than you use that password.  But I can't tell you what it is because then you'll be able to get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not even a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's ASDF semi-colon LKJ.  Guess what that is?  That's the first four letters on the left hand.  That's good. Now they have to change it.  Now did Google buy Gizmo or was that just a bad rumor from TechCrunch?  No, no, they bought them. They actually did. 30 million I think.  That's not a bad price given that Skype is kind of rocky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess the Skype thing is over now. They've settled right.  It wasn't about just out and out competing with Skype. This is for Google Voice.  Give them John.  Gizmo has an area code to itself and a whole bunch of links into the POTS system that will actually save Google money  because they're doing it by hand now. They're doing all these separate deals.  Apparently Gizmo's done all the deals. They got their own area code and they got a bunch of stuff like that.  So the people who use Google Voice, which is a terrific product by the way, now Google can save a little dough  and they can actually have a better system and a better infrastructure to link into the regular POTS system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense.  It also means they could terminate calls to your computer if they wanted to, which they don't quite have the ability to do right now.  I like Gizmo actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I never liked about Gizmo is that it installed a crap load of spyware on your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Michael Robertson always does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He loves to do that.  Every time you booted your machine, Gizmo would be loading all these DLLs and everything else.  It was a pain in the butt so I just took it off and never used it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I have to say Google Voice doesn't do any of that stuff. It's essentially all a web-based thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Years ago the family decided that we're going to go to a long-distance plan that bypasses AT&T, which is hard to do in California.  So you have to have a calling card.  So we as a policy within the family dial in this huge number to make long-distance calls to wherever we call.  It's actually a lot cheaper than AT&T's service.  But meanwhile, with Google Voice, it bypasses that too and it's just all free phone calls. It's dynamite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't get Google Voice on the iPhone, of course. Apple wouldn't let it happen.  But the Android operating system supports it and that's on my Droid phone from Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can still have Google Voice call the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you tell Google Voice on the iPhone, you say, I want to make all international calls through Google Voice.  I don't know how Verizon allowed this. I want to make all international calls through Google Voice.  On the G phone. On the Droid. On the Droid. On the Droid, yeah.  I'm stunned that Verizon allowed this. They probably haven't figured it out yet.  So you could say make all calls through Google Voice. Of course, I guess it still costs minutes, right? So they don't care.  But it does save on the long-distance calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they had to differentiate themselves from the closed system of Apple.  Well, they have. I think this was a very reluctant embrace on their part.  I recently reluctantly switched to the iPhone because I was using the G1 and the My Touch and they just couldn't handle my usage.  They crashed. They were slow. There was no headphone jack.  I was sick with iTunes. So I went over and I missed that Google Voice app.  I will tell you though, one of my friends, he tried to sign up for Google Voice and Google is run by engineers and they're not necessarily good at people and instructions.  And so he signed up and basically said, work with my existing number instead of getting a Google Voice number.  And there's no way to undo that decision. Right. It's permanent. You can't go back.  He searched the official help and it sent him to a forum on Google of everybody complaining about how there's no way to do this.  To do what? I misunderstood this.  He associated his existing cell phone number with Google Voice rather than getting a new number from Google itself, rather than provisioning a number from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is something they just started doing a few weeks ago. They support number portability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's a one-time offer. The only way to undo it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm not mistaken for a fee of $10, you can undo that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you can't undo it. You can only change an existing new number.  So you've got you can't. OK, so you're still screwed with your wheel or get a Google number or get a Google number, then change it.  Right. But you can't add a Google number after you've already decided to use your current one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's frustrating. We pay $10, John, because we join Google Voice before they started doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you pay $10. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if I wanted it to be my home phone number, but then but I didn't know there was no way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's it. Oh, yeah. No, you want to try to get a better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just keeping the number. I have twenty five, twenty five. Hey, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twenty five, twenty five. Hey, Leo. Yeah. What do you think?  Terrible. That's what I call it now. Hey, Leo. I mean, it sounds like something from the 50s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard to get a number that spells something. Do you have one that spells something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, either. I just it's a number. It's not supposed to. It's just numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always just look at the numbers. I see which ones might be memorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's memorable. Yeah. Hey, Leo.  It sounds like a catchphrase. The H is the cartoon. The X is the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's sites you could do that.  But when you when you when you pick a number, they'll tell you.  So I try, you know, they give you some like choices when you sign up for Google Voice.  So I'm just kind of keep looking for choices till I find something that could spell something.  That was the closest. Thank God. Hey, Leo.  Now I've given it out, by the way, and I don't know what I'm going to do with it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a mistake. That and the password. You're just transparent man tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, let's take a break.  We're going to come back a big, big break for Apple and bad news for Apple Hackintosh users.  But first, a word from audible dot com.  Audible is the place where we get our audio books.  We when I say we, I mean, me. Do you any of you guys listen to audio books?  Yeah. Oh, good. Oh, yeah. I'm listening to Under the Dome by Stephen Cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I saw that on your Twitter. Yes, I love it.  I love it. In fact, I'm going to as soon as this is over, I'm putting it back in and I'm just going to make excuses to listen to the book.  Once I get in, I'm like, I'm going to walk an hour home instead of taking a 10 minute subway ride just to add more book time to my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you need to because this thing is what is like 40 hours.  40 hours. It's like a job. It's a full time job.  It's just like World of Modern Warfare. Modern Warfare 2 or Stephen King's Under the Dome.  I give you your choice. Is it good? I'm dying to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually great. So far, I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea is what is a Midwest town that suddenly is like under like the Simpsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. Stephen King deals with one state and that's the state of Maine.  OK, he deals with what is a small town in rural Maine and an invisible force field has trapped the town.  And it's exactly the Simpsons. It is the Simpsons.  But you can't dig under it in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually talked about this on the Windows Weekly show and Paul Therot remembered that Homer said, we're trapped like rats.  And the guy said, no, rats could tunnel out. We're trapped like carrots.  There's no way out. Under the Dome, a novel by Stephen King.  Thirty four and a half hours of goodness. And it's yours free.  In fact, I'm feeling generous today.  So I want you to go to audible dot com slash twit to and sign up for the platinum account, which gives you two books a month.  And if you do that, you can get Under the Dome, a novel.  And what would Google do by our great Jeff Jarvis? You get two books. Thanks for the second plug.  Two plugs in one show. Two books for free. You can cancel it anytime the books are yours to keep.  But I don't think you're going to want to cancel because I'm with you, Baratunde.  I love my Audible book so much that I spend extra time in the car, extra time at the gym.  It's really good for your health.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find myself taking lunch alone. I'm listening to my book. I don't want to talk to people.  People that hang out with Stephen King for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so pathetic. But I'm with you. I do the same thing. Audible dot com slash twit to get your two books free.  We love Audible. We know you will, too. Why don't you give them a try?  We thank them so much for their support of the This Week in Tech network, the whole network.  They're all over it.  In fact, Jason is always saying, just tweet, thank you Audible. It's at Audible underscore com.  Thank you Ford. It's at Ford sync, I think.  And thank you Citrix for sponsoring Twit and Twitter that.  And it makes them even happier. They really do like that.  Let's see. We got to get going here. We only have a few more minutes to do the show.  Poor Jeff. Thank your wife, will you, for me, Jeff, for letting her...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I already got the spousal's stare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh. She came in and looked at you?  Yes.  When's it going to be done? It's like Michelangelo and Pope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When will you be done, Jeff? When I'm finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One more story, then we'll run. And that's the PsyStar decision has come down.  It went down on Friday. Apple suing a company in Florida called PsyStar that was selling Macintosh clones.  PsyStar said, no, you know, look, we're not saying don't buy the operating system.  We're just making the hardware. You buy the operating system. You put it on the hardware.  What could be wrong with that?  Apple said to the judge, well, it's violating our EULA that says you may not run OS X when you buy it.  You may not run OS X on non-Apple hardware.  In this case, the judge agreed and said, you're absolutely right.  We uphold the EULA. We uphold Apple's right to say you may not run OS X on other hardware.  And that pretty much puts PsyStar in the... and not just PsyStar, but the clone makers completely out of business.  It's over for the Hackintosh clan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wonder how long Apple will be able to get away with all this brand love they get.  You know, people still have this idea of Apple as an underdog, that they're somehow intrinsically good, that they have these human qualities of virtue.  They're a business trying to make money and they have some horrible policies. Their app store approval process is ridiculous.  They're, you know, stance on this particular clone thing. I understand it, but it also, it's anti-freedom and it's irritating.  And it's not consistent with their image, which they make billions of dollars off of.  They have been this way since 1977.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple, but they were little then.  Yeah, they actually were little.  Let me... the company is Florida, but the court case came out of California because that's where Apple does business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember the pineapple? They sued them. Franklin Computer, they sued them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first thing Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple was kill the clones, because Apple had quite a few clones by license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, legitimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  A SciStar said that its conduct was protected by something called the first sale doctrine,  which provides that the owner of a particular copy or phono record,  which tells you how old this is,  phono record, lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled,  without the authority of the copyright owner,  to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phono record.  In other words, that's what allows you to sell your phono records at a used phono record store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But here's a question for you.  When Jobs came back and did get rid of the clone strategy, was that the right thing to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question. I think if you look at Apple's most recent quarterly results, you'd have to say, yeah.  Yes, indeed.  Yeah, but John, you said this on the show before.  Look at the size of Bill Gates' wallet versus Steve Jobs' wallet.  Bill Gates made all his money not selling hardware, but selling the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the argument, you can take the argument from either perspective, and I think both, you can,  and they're both valid, because, you know, we don't know for sure,  but I think they would be extremely successful if they sold an OS X to just, you know, like the way Microsoft does or licensed it.  And I don't think it would hurt their business, because their business is selling a machine that is, that has other things going on.  It's gorgeous. It works well.  Or like those laptops, for example. A lot of PC users are buying those things, because the ones with the solid aluminum, I mean, it's a terrific product.  So even if they were licensing, I think it would just be icing on the cake there, which is probably making even more money, which maybe we don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what's interesting to me about Apple is that they don't care about the benefit of being a platform that people can build on top of.  You know, iTunes has been still a relatively closed, stupid, simple media library and player for a long time.  There's no social features. They're not doing any of the cool web stuff that everybody on this show probably tends to like,  and the trend of openness and APIs, and it just doesn't apply, and they can get away with it.  You know, that's what's frustrating to me is that they don't have to, because clearly they're making more than enough money,  but they could be satisfying many more people if they were a little more lax with some of these policies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so glad you said that, Baratunde. So now John can call you a bleeding heart liberal, lefty, pink-o socialist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's about innovation. It's not about politics. It's about creating an opportunity, right?  What about business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're answering a million questions. That's what Apple is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, what were you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say that Apple is the grand exception to all rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not to get a third plug in my book, I went through all these rules about how Google operates,  and it came to the end and said Apple violates every damn one of them.  And?  It's so damn good.  It does very well.  Yeah, it's just I love my iPhone. I hug my iPhone. I have my Mac, I'm talking to you on my Mac. I'm a fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oppression feels really good and it's very convenient.  Oh, yeah.  There you go. He's right. This guy nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, I made an argument.  Steve Jobs yoke around me. Yes, I know.  Which is Steve Jobs is a meditator and the only reason he's so successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? Is that a secret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he learns something when he went to India. Some dirty trick. I don't know how he does it,  but he actually wills success to the Apple company through some meditative practice.  And?  And?  You've been doing no agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been talking to Adam Curry far too long, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I had this theory when I was at InfoWorld. I proposed this theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be true.  The only thing you can explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sucks to be hypnotized just to believe it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Barton.  Randy Too Cool in the chat room says Steve Jobs is going to sue all of us tomorrow, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not over for PsiStar. That's just the first part of this trial.  There will be a damages hearing in a couple of weeks and continued trial on breach of contract,  induced breach of contract, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, trade dress infringement,  state unfair competition under California Business Profession Code 17200, and common law unfair competition.  So there. I wouldn't want to be PsiStar right now.  Remember, John, we had the theory that there was some rich guy, maybe Michael Dell, funding PsiStar to figure out if the courts would allow this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a good theory. I like it.  We never saw a PsiStar, did we?  No.  It just seemed that it was built to be sued.  Made to be sued. Oh, that's my story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, folks, we're going to wrap it up because Jeff's wife is giving him this.  I can see he's looking over his shoulder now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, Fred Wilson just tweeted that he wants to get the sleeper hoodie he saw on a flight last night.  And I love it. It comes with an inflatable neck pillow in the hoodie.  Oh, wow.  News from Snuggies.  We need those.  I love that vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, we're going to, I think for your holiday gifts, all the Twit panelists will receive free neck pillow inserted Snuggies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the Twit logo on it, please.  No, you're not sending me the pillow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want a slanket. I want a hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a slanket with a pillow.  Never. No, no. Oh, God, we're talking about slankets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't wear it on the airplane. You look like a complete idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or a terrorist.  I look like a terrorist. What do I look like? There's a bomber on your neck.  A terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have any of you ever seen anybody in a slanket or a Snuggie on an airplane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not yet.  I would be used to answer any questions involving either of those two items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's when the end times will be here.  It's already people are wearing, you know, track suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it'd be something interesting about it for surreptitious sex on the plane.  Oh, you need a double slanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. Maybe an extra large.  Would you have four sleeves on one?  And two neck pillows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably only need three sleeves if you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another Twit has definitely hit the fan.  We're so good. We closed on Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Baratunde Thurston is at baratunde.com.  Catch him at The Onion and of course where he is the politics editor.  And of course on that great show on Discovery Science.  What is it? Popular?  Popular Sciences Future Of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm speaking at Web 2.0 in New York this Wednesday.  Around 1.1.30 they're live streaming it and talking about fun things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go watch him. That sounds great. Web 2.0 on Thursday.  Thank you Baratunde. Always great to have you on.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, thank you for sticking around after an extremely long twig.  Thank you for having me.  I really appreciate your giving us...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm speaking at Web 2.0 Tuesday about 4.20 and I think I'm going to try to,  as a comedian would do, try out material for what might be the next book called Beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See?  Wow. That's great.  I'm going to do a speech again on many of their MyTalks. It's going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And John C. Dvorak is at ChannelDvorak.com.  Anything else you would like to say for yourself, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog. Why not?  Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.
