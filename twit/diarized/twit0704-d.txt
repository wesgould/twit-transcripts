And so there's there was all of that. But yeah, I mean, that'll be interesting to watch.  I was like the halftime shows, but I'm not going to pretend to be a fan of the sports ball.

End time: 373.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what a big deal that was. Yeah. Was it a dot com? I think so.  I mean, they were there was that first year.  And obviously that puppet, you know, the sock puppet, they spent all that money on.  And then, you know, it went out of business.  And so somebody smart like paid for the pet stock com sock puppet to make an appearance in their ad for like everyone deserves a second chance or something.

Start time: 377.51
End time: 432.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This year. Now, back then, a Super Bowl ad cost a couple million dollars.  This year it will be five and a half million dollars for a 30 second ad.  The highest ever. In fact, it's been flat at five million for the last three years.  So this is I guess because the Patriots and a big Los Angeles team, the Rams, you know, this is going to be a big market and they expect big audiences.  Here's an article eight dot coms that spent millions of Super Bowl ads that don't exist anymore.  That's dot com epidemic dot com. I don't even remember them.  I don't either. Life Miners.  I sell an epidemic. Yeah. Yeah.  They must have been really good, really good ads.  Our beginning dot com. I think that was a dating site.  Net appliance. E-Stamp E 1040 on money. EDS.  The hurting cats ad and the survivors.  I don't I don't remember any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. This in 2000, which was the height of this dot com, the dot com bubble and the burst was like right after that.  Nineteen startup spot Super Bowl advertisements.  Now, this year there's going to be a lot of high tech on the Super Bowl.  Amazon will be back. They've they've done some fun ads, haven't they?  In previous years. I'm not going to show you any of these because I know spoilers.  Right. No spoilers.  But look for Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker, Ilana Glazier.  I don't know who that is. And Abby Jacobson.  Those are from Broad City. Yeah. Yeah.  That's nice. That's good.  That's almost like a podcast and an astronaut twins Scott and Mark Kelly.  They'll all be in the Echo ads.  ADT Google will have ads again to commercials.  Your company, Microsoft, they're going to take it looks like they're going to take that holiday ad and do a sequel to that.

Start time: 499.12
End time: 511.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did. They they released the extended version a couple of days ago.  And I'm not I'm going to say this is unbiased as I possibly can.  But I was I was I saw it when I was in Milan. I was like, this is a good ad.

Start time: 511.24
End time: 533.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love the Christmas ad. I loved it.  It was a beautiful ad about a kid, a special needs kid who had this special accessible controller for the Xbox and all his friends.  He's going to do it. He's going to do it. They were all running over and they saw him whatever it is.  Break his high score or whatever. And they were all cheering for him.  It was a great ad. So we're going to see the I guess the sequel to that.

Start time: 534.62
End time: 539.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 540.16
End time: 585.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, Mint Mobile will do an ad.  That's one of those MVNOs. Simply Safe, who I should mention, is a sponsor of our content, T-Mobile, Verizon.  So look for I'm not going to show any of these because I want you to enjoy your Super Bowl free of knowledge.  Spoilers for ads. No ads. We're in now.  You know, Tivo, I didn't know this. They've done this a couple of years in a row now.  Tivo has a game skip button now.  So I love it. I love this idea.  You can if you're watching the Super Bowl for the ads, not the game, you Tivo it and then which I am doing.  And then you could just go watch the ads. I like that idea.

Start time: 586.24
End time: 590.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be YouTube-ing later. Just want to watch the worst and the best. That's it.

Start time: 591.41
End time: 652.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like to watch them in in in Vivo. I like to watch.  Do you? Yeah, I like to watch them in the ambiance.  In fact, I'd like to be going to get a sandwich and see the ad out of the corner of my eye.  So then I really know what real people are seeing of this five and a half million dollar production.  Was that Jeff Bridges? I thought that I think that was Jeff Bridges. And that's all I know.  Anyway, so we will. That's all we're going to talk about the Super Bowl. It's over. It's done.  Somebody won. Somebody lost.  There were probably bad calls and there was probably a wardrobe malfunction.  Maroon five. Their clothes fell off. I don't know. I'm just saying.  First quarter results are in for Apple. This was going to be Apple's no good, very bad quarter.  Tim Cook, remember a couple of weeks ago, downgraded their estimates for profit.  You know what? They didn't have such a bad quarter. They did all right. Right.  Any takeaways from this?  84 billion is OK. Yeah, that's a lot of money.

Start time: 654.52
End time: 659.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to survive. I think they're going to survive.  They'll be fine. Maybe. I'm just calling that.

Transcript:  Not going out of business.

Start time: 662.58
End time: 665.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we have international sales of 62 percent. I guess that's OK.

Start time: 667.64
End time: 675.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, this is the first one where they're not breaking down the individual sales for products, especially for the iPhones. Right.

Start time: 675.60
End time: 687.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, this is the first time that they are not saying number of units of iPhones sold, which I don't love that move.  I mean, I get it, but I don't love it. I don't love it when any company does that.  But, yeah, I mean, it is what it is.

Start time: 689.14
End time: 696.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's clear you're hiding something. Right. And what shame is being hidden right now?  Is it lower iPhone 10R sales? We don't know at this point. Yeah.

Start time: 698.00
End time: 796.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, in fairness, they never actually broke out by like the model series.  Like they would never say you sold this many models of this or this or this.  So you would usually what would happen is the mix would be extrapolated based on the, you know, like the margin on the devices.  And that's how you would figure out. Well, they sold more of the newer devices than the older ones.  But the fact they're not breaking it out at all.  I mean, I think what it what it indicates, as a lot of people expected and as their own, you know, pre quarter, you know, I guess declaration said is that they're selling fewer phones.  And they used to know I think that's OK, just because smartphones, we've reached a point where we're at saturation.  And, you know, the growth period is basically gone. Right.  Like, and so I understand that if if what you if you think the market is going to be basing its valuation of your company on certain growth percentages, you know, in sales and you start to see a decline,  not because your product isn't so popular, but because everyone has a phone and because ownership cycles are becoming longer and longer.  Then I do understand the idea of saying, well, we would rather not break out these numbers.  But I think that, you know, when people were trying to say, oh, well, that's not what it's about.  And then, you know, they have to, you know, lower their their earnings estimates because things did not sell the way they were anticipating for,  whether it was China or pricing or what the reason may be that just adds credence to the idea that, well, you know, this is a convenient time to maybe not paper over the problem.  But as you were saying, kind of hide something or or make it less less obvious what's happening.

Start time: 796.00
End time: 830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there's multiple things going on, too.  Like as you're saying, phones are lasting longer and they're getting better.  And we also know like Apple's been trying to push up that average sales price with the, you know, the tennis and the plus and everything.  So I think that there may be some pushback to that as well.  Like things are getting so expensive.  I still have my 10 from last year and I felt no real need to upgrade.  I'm also seeing people go from the 10 last year to the 10 are this year, which in many ways is a step down other than screen size.  So there's a lot of confusion in the product line, too, I think.  So maybe this year with a full fledged redesign, we'll we'll see something better.

Start time: 831.06
End time: 841.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cook was asked specifically about the theory that one of the reasons iPhone sales were down 15 percent this quarter.  By the way, this is the quarter that you would see a big jump.  This is their big quarter, right?

Start time: 842.30
End time: 843.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. This is the holiday quarter.

Start time: 844.08
End time: 935.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. He was asked specifically, is it prices?  And Cook said no. But his answer was kind of odd.  He said the iPhone XS matched the price of the iPhone 10.  The 10 are was right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and the entry iPhone plus had been priced.  So actually, it's a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year.  But actually, if you look at any individual phone, it's definitely more expensive.  Nobody buys the average price phone.  They buy a phone and even the 10 are was more expensive than the base model 8, which was itself more expensive than the iPhone 7.  So Apple has look at they've been ratcheting the price up.  But Cook seems at least in public to be fairly clear that he doesn't think that the drop in numbers is due to that.  He does say the price was high in areas where the exchange rate wasn't so good like China.  They also look at Maistre.  Their CFO highlighted the installed base.  And this is something I think you're going to hear more and more from Apple because what Cook said was, well, you know, we make our phones to last a long time.  So what that means is when somebody buys a new phone, they hand down the old phone.  And as a result, the installed base is high.  And for the first time, they gave a number 900 million actively used iPhones up year over year in all five geographic segments.  In fact, they say it grew almost 75 million in the last 12 months.  That's this is very typical of a company, which is we're going to highlight the stat that makes us look good.  Right.

Start time: 936.74
End time: 1022.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here what this also indicates and what they would kind of push towards is to say, OK, this is saying two things.  One, look at this huge number that makes us look good.  But number two, the big thing that Apple has been focusing on, I guess I'd say about the last 12 quarters, it's really been a lot about the last three years.  They've been doing this massive push into services is that if you're looking at services and they've said, you know, it's going to be, you know, a 20 billion dollar business on its own or, you know, by this date and whatnot.  Then that is going to you.  You can say, well, if we have nine hundred and fifty eight million active install base, then you can start to extrapolate the potential of service revenue based on that number.  And if that number continues to go up, then that's an indication that service revenue will continue to climb and will continue to grow because you have that that install base where you can attach Apple Music or iCloud or Apple Pay or whatever else you're wanting to kind of put on the table.  Or, you know, put on it.  You you have that that user base to go after.  So I think that is both the big number that says, oh, this look at how great this this big number is.  And also, it's also kind of an indicator to analysts to say, and this is this potential huge target number that we have to get additional money out of because they're in our ecosystem.  And as a result, you know, we have the ability to attach, you know, X percentage of services onto this number of people.

Start time: 1023.24
End time: 1044.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also why Apple goes after privacy, because I think that is more and more people are caring about privacy.  They're going to be heading down to Apple because Apple just has a better track record for that.  And so they're going to be doing more and more services that are going to be on the Apple ecosphere.  So I think that this revenue is actually going to increase a lot more as people are more aware of what's happening and how companies are misusing their their own data.

Start time: 1046.40
End time: 1048.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was probably a bad week to double that.

Start time: 1048.94
End time: 1074.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just going to say, yeah, because of course, they're they're they're talking about the FaceTime flaw that allowed people using group FaceTime to eavesdrop on other people, at least briefly until they either didn't pick up or picked up the call.  Did Tim Cook I didn't listen to the analyst call and I didn't read the notes.  Did he say anything about the FaceTime flaw in that call?  They did apologize.

Start time: 1075.46
End time: 1088.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they apologized and removed the feature until they're able to roll out a software update.  But yeah, I mean, look, Apple rightly, I think, has a really great reputation for privacy.

Start time: 1089.06
End time: 1091.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this doesn't this doesn't ding.  This is a bug.

Start time: 1093.27
End time: 1093.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a bug.

Start time: 1094.00
End time: 1122.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't get caught doing something wrong.  Facebook did. That was a purpose.  They made a mistake.  They tried to fix it as quickly as possible.  You know, they might have given a little bit of a run around.  I get that. That's not great.  And it's a really big deal.  But this is really different from them choosing to sell your information and trying to be sneaky about it.  Apple, again, wants to keep your business.  So it makes every sense that they're going to try to make sure they're as secure as possible.

Start time: 1122.57
End time: 1127.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did respond quickly.  Well, they responded quickly to the nine to five next story.

Start time: 1128.00
End time: 1129.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they got caught, they were really fast about it.

Start time: 1130.14
End time: 1132.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's fair to say caught either.  I mean, no, no, no.

Start time: 1133.00
End time: 1137.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when they were when the issue made it to their to their account, I mean, people tried.

Start time: 1138.02
End time: 1188.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, there's a family of people.  Michelle Thompson, who's a 14 year old, discovered this a week before it was revealed.  A nine to five Mac, a security researcher found it later, tried to get through to Apple.  But she's, you know, not a developer.  She's not somebody Apple gets security reports from on a regular basis.  So she says she never received a response from the company.  She actually went to Fox News to tell them, look, there's a serious security privacy flaw in FaceTime.  Apple did in its apology say we thank the Thompson family for reporting the bug.  And we're going to improve our process by which we receive and escalate these reports in order to get them the right people as fast as possible.  All she got was a note saying you should join that if you want to report bugs, you need to join the developer program.

Start time: 1188.34
End time: 1226.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of a tough thing to like coming from the IT side of things.  Right. It's it's hard to tell when to take these things seriously and when not to.  So that's understandable.  It's just a shame that this was the one missed, you know, support ticket that was one of the most egregious privacy flaws.  Like, I know this was not purposeful, but, you know, the people who signed up for Facebook's privacy and information sharing thing,  they they at least knew like Facebook was doing this and they were getting paid for it.  It was like a contract. This is an insane bit of like spy tech.  Basically, like this is something that I know, like spy agencies have been trying to cook up things like this so that they can listen on your conversation.

Start time: 1227.24
End time: 1250.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But how useful would it be if you were the NSA or the CIA?  You knew about this. This only happened when Apple released group FaceTime, which was just a couple of versions of iOS 12 ago.  It was like twelve point one. So it hasn't been around that long.  But let's say you're in the NSA. You're not saying rubbing your hands with glee saying, oh, finally, I can I can listen in on Putin's conversations because it's only it rings the phone.

Start time: 1250.00
End time: 1257.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And it only is calling and says you're not answer the phone.  Yeah. So it's not that useful.

Start time: 1258.74
End time: 1272.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, it's just it's embarrassing. Apple did respond once the United Five Mac report came out.  They responded immediately by turning off group FaceTime.  It's still off. And as you said, Christina, they'll have they say they'll have a patch this week and group FaceTime.

Start time: 1272.22
End time: 1320.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, totally. And I mean, in terms of bugs to have, I think you point out like it's not good at all.  It could be embarrassing, but it could be way worse. The phone is going to ring.  So the longest you're talking about, you know, maybe 20 seconds that you might be able to hear something.  And and and I mean, it's not great. I think the video aspect was probably worse than maybe even the audio stuff.  The fact that you could maybe see people, that's not great. But they fixed it.  And I think that the good news here is that because they were able to fix things server side because of what this was, they could put a stop to it.  You know, they on the server side level, they just disabled the group FaceTime feature and now they're going to issue a patch.  So this wasn't even I mean, this could have been really bad if this was something where they would have had to release an update that everybody's phone would have to be updated, you know, to anybody who's ever had an eight minute voicemail message from a but dial.

Start time: 1322.14
End time: 1326.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that much going on. Have you ever sat and listened to all eight minutes?

Start time: 1327.52
End time: 1337.36

Transcript:  Yeah, about you. Yeah. Well, this is what I'm saying.  That's what happens is this is like the worst case scenario where somebody is talking smack about you and unknowingly calling you.  This is where voice assistants I think can be very dangerous because you can imagine if you're talking about someone you accidentally invoke the voice assistant that then calls that person and sort of leave a long message, you know, talking poorly about that person.  No, I mean, I've maybe listened once like the eight minute ones usually just to leave.  But you might hear a few occasional things like, oh, so that's what they think about someone.

And he was talking to his wife about his boss and the boss heard him say negative things and he didn't like it.  So he so he fired him. And and now there's a lot there.  Well, not now, but I guess. Yeah. Now there's a lawsuit because he continued to listen and violated his privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's really violating your privacy. I don't know. I don't think that's going down, though, because there's no way like you call someone else.  You sent me a message, dude. And I'm just listening to your message.  Listening to the message. It does not sound like a violation of privacy.  And I didn't think you could say it's an unlawful dismissal because, you know, you say something bad about someone, no one's going to want to work with you after that.  So.

Transcript:  All right. Let's talk about you brought it up.  I think, you know, as we should talk about it, both Google and Facebook were spanked by Apple this week because they were using their enterprise certificates in a way that Apple said that's that's not appropriate.  Apple has restored Facebook's I imagine by now they've restored Google's.  The problem is that when you disable an enterprise certificate, you disable also in-house apps.  The Google bus app, the G bus app stopped working.

End time: 1501.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From what I'm hearing, it was a research app.  I haven't fully covered the story, but it was an internal research app.  And it was something where Facebook was paying people basically to give them full access to everything on their phones.

Start time: 1502.32
End time: 1514.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  $20 a month. They gave root network access to the Facebook for all data, not just Facebook data, but all data.  All data. But they were told they were told, right?  They were told.  These are 13 year olds. This is not fair.

Start time: 1518.26
End time: 1528.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't really give access.  They like, you know, if you're happy, if your teen child had breakfast, like they can't make these big decisions.  They don't get it. They're like 20 bucks.  Even if you accept that, right?

Start time: 1529.71
End time: 1552.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could argue like if that's a worthy thing or not.  But I think the really egregious part is that this is a continuation of something Facebook had before.  It was a VPN app called Onavo, and they were using that app to track user behavior and track things that were happening on their phones.  They were, you know, that was swatted down.  This research app is basically a rebadge of that technology, which Apple has already said no to.

Start time: 1554.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is so Facebook, which is you break the rules, you get caught, you apologize, then you do it again.

Start time: 1560.50
End time: 1692.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, and what they did, I mean, and partially I'm kind of happy that this whole instance happened.  I obviously feel terrible for anybody who any employees who worked at Facebook or Google who lost access to their stuff because, you know, I work at a big tech company and we have, you know, like internal enterprise apps.  And some of them are really important and it would be really frustrating to not have access to those things.  But this has been a really common way around the app store for a long time that has kind of gone under the radar that hasn't had a lot of reporting around it where, you know, Apple won't allow certain types of applications in the app store for whatever reasons.  They say it violates, you know, collection information or, you know, maybe it's an emulator and we don't support this sort of thing or whatever.  And so instead what happens is people get an enterprise certificate and, you know, they pay for one of those accounts or they just get a regular dev certificate or you can now have even more, you know, testers and they issue, you know, copies with this around, you know, kind of in back channels and people install them.  They install, you know, the certificate on their phone and then they're able to, you know, download the app directly from the developer.  And people use that as a way to, you know, do stuff that otherwise wouldn't be there, whether it's, you know, pirated, you know, sort of stuff or, you know, maybe something that again, like in Facebook's case is rebadging an app that the app store wouldn't let in.  And in some cases it might be legitimate. It might be like, I really want this SSH type of scenario or some sort of code editor on my phone.  This won't be allowed at the app store, but I can get an enterprise certificate and release it to however many thousands of people. Cool.  So this has been happening, but nothing's been done about it.  And so if anything, I'm kind of glad that this is kind of drawing attention to the fact that there is this whole shadow like app economy using these things.  And there and especially in other countries where, you know, people have to go around things, maybe to get around censorship or other stuff like we should acknowledge that this is happening because Apple really loves to talk about how safe and insecure its store is.  And by the most part it is, but this is a really easy hole, like a really easy in run around those policies.

Start time: 1692.04
End time: 1713.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's an important point. You can laud Apple for respecting privacy.  But the minute you put any third party app on your iPhone, you're being monitored in some way or other, whether it's location monitoring and you give them permission.  I understand. But Apple's privacy policy only extends up to the point of Apple's apps.

Start time: 1713.10
End time: 1772.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And after that, it's anything goes. Well, also it's the difference between the apps that are being available within the store and these apps that we're talking about.  These are far worse. I understand. So let me just...  There's nothing wrong with that. Like that's the thing. I don't, it sounds like we're getting to the point where it's like, oh, all these enterprise certificate apps are bad.  No, no, not at all. That's the way we have to like when I see apps early, this is the process I have to go through to see something before it's on the store.  There are certain loopholes there. It's more like, yeah, what Facebook did.  And to be clear, this is a Navo VPN I'm talking about. I covered them when they launched like several years ago.  And it was a really interesting app idea because it was supposed to be this little app that would basically compress your data and save you like cell phone bandwidth and stuff like it'll save your bandwidth cap.  When Facebook bought it, everyone was like, oh, they're going to do something terrible with this.  And not long after that, they did something terrible with it.  So this is all an example of Facebook being the worst and trying to get away with being the worst like again and again.  Yeah, at some point you have to say, oh, this is intentional.

Start time: 1773.44
End time: 1806.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get away. Yeah, they keep on doing it. And people like, again, it's like these companies too large to fail because Apple is going to take a whole bunch of heat if they just cut them out and say, listen, we can't trust you.  We're going to have to check everything that you do beforehand.  But the worst part is Facebook was doing this, got caught for it.  They're already, I think, back in. I think that they've already said, okay, you're all restored to that.  But they were doing this in order to catch what was the wave with the young generation and then be able to buy out whatever applications were important to be able to do it so that they could.  Exactly.

Start time: 1808.08
End time: 1911.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let me, by the way, a lot of credit to John Constine and TechCrunch because they broke the story and they did a lot of great reporting on this.  Constine had written, as you did, Devinder and many others, about the Onavo Protect.  Apple changed its policies to prohibit the way Onavo Protect worked.  So Facebook, that app was taken out of the store.  Facebook took it out of the store where Apple blocked it from the store, but it was gone.  It looks like, according to Constine, they got somebody to look at the code and the Facebook research app is basically, he says, we found it featured tons of similar code and references to the Onavo Protect program, which meant Facebook was intentionally disobeying Apple's privacy policy.  Now, the idea of an enterprise certificate is completely normal.  Many, many companies have internal apps that they want to put on iPhones.  Absolutely.  In order to do that, they have an enterprise certificate.  Apple certainly allows this.  There also is a test flight app that you can use if you want to test apps.  This is normal.  And in fact, Facebook's enterprise certificate was used for seeing the day's lunch schedule, coordinating office collaboration, commutes.  They used it for pre-launch internal testing versions of Facebook's own app and Instagram.  So Apple, which could have simply said, okay, Project Atlas, which is this app, is yanked.  You can't do it anymore.  Instead, they spanked.  I'm sorry.  They spanked Facebook by yanking this enterprise app, knowing that this would be completely disruptive, as apparently it was.

Start time: 1912.04
End time: 1961.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they revoked the certificate.  In this case, again, I think you could make the argument that the only way Apple knew that they could shut down access to the app was to revoke the certificate.  Don't they have a kill switch for the app?  No, the kill switch is the certificate.  The kill switch is the enterprise certificate.  Honestly, the biggest mistake that Facebook made, if you're doing this, you know you're violating the App Store rules.  You're using this enterprise certificate as a way to distribute apps outside the App Store, which is not the way it's supposed to be done.  It's supposed to be for internal purposes, whatnot for testing.  It's not supposed to be.  We have a research project and we're paying people $20 a month, and we're getting this information for our business.  This is not how you're supposed to be using these types of tools.  Rather than signing up for a new enterprise account, which would have been the best thing and having a different certificate to use it, they used their existing enterprise certificate.

Transcript:  You're not wrong, but I also feel like at this point, if you know, was there some punitive stuff to it?  I'm sure there was, but I think you can also make the argument that says you've already banned this type of content from your App Store.  You've already said this sort of thing isn't allowed.  Yeah, they spanked them.  Yeah, but you have proof that this is doing it.  I'm not saying it's inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they did, but I'm sure that you could make the argument where they could, I guess, claim that they're not being punitive by saying, well, the only way we can guarantee that this isn't being used anymore is to revoke the certificate.  And if that has, you know, like collateral damage with other apps that use the certificate, so be it.

This looks bad upon us and we're going to punish the whole system to that because it does.  It ends up looking bad upon Apple because people don't really understand the difference between what they have on their platform.  It's a really big issue and it was really embarrassing.

Transcript:  Here's what Apple told TechCrunch.  We design our enterprise developer program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization.  Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple.  Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users in their data.  And oh, by the way, they did it to Google, too.  Shortly after they did it to Facebook, they TechCrunch discovered Google's ScreenWise meter surveillance app, very much like the Facebook research app, was doing the same thing.  Apple canceled that enterprise.  And that's when Google's G bus program and others stopped working.  Now, this is another case of Google telling people.  Here's the here's the message.  You'll see the ScreenWise meter app collects information on your Internet usage from how long you visit a site to the apps you choose.  It also manages your participation in a panel.  It's kind of like and I do this the the the Google app to earn Google opinion rewards program to earn payments.  And I do that once in a while.  I answer a survey screen wise, like the Facebook research app was open to users as young as 13.  Constine on TechCrunch says about five percent of the users were underage of the Facebook app.  So it wasn't particularly aimed at teenagers, although it was 13 to 35.  So it was aimed at younger users.  And it's clearly Facebook's intent to figure out what the hell are the kids doing?  Because because they ain't using Facebook.  What is TikTok?

Like really within a week, you're all back up.  And again, it's a lot of money when you do it.  But in the large run, it's really, really tiny.  Like this was like I don't think it was a big stick.  I think that it was a small.  It's a shot across the bow.

Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm going to disagree just because as somebody who, again, I have enterprise apps.  I'm sure Microsoft uses this to you.  Yes, we do.  And and and we have both our own system.  We bought hockey app, which is similar to test flight.  But obviously how that works is using an enterprise certificate.  And that controls things like my VPN access.  And that controls things like, you know, if I can connect into my corporate network on my device and that connects, you know, certain, you know, certain profile information.  And then I have other things like certain versions of my email client or certain things that are only internal.  And yes, could I get my work done without it?  Of course.  But it's a lot more frustrating.  And if stuff were just to break, I'm not going to discount the fact that if you look at the, you know,  20, 30,000 employees, you know, at each of these companies who were probably using at least one of these devices, one of these apps that now isn't working, that this isn't a big deal.  Do I think Apple was justified in doing it?  Absolutely. But but I don't I think this was a lot more disruptive than than people might thinking.  And they might be rolling their eyes and saying, oh, well, you can't see what's what's for lunch.  But what if this was something that was tied to your email or was tied to, you know, some sort of data entry app or some sort of other kind of data entry app?  Or some sort of other custom app that was really crucial to your day job.  And now you don't have access to that information.  And when you do have access to it again, you have to reinstall each app, redo the certificates.  I mean, it's it's, you know, people lose time and it's it's frustrating, especially when the reason for this is because the company you work for decided to go around the app store rules.

Transcript:  So how bad is Facebook suck?  I mean, they said, no, wait a minute.  You know, this is their response.  Key facts about this market research program are being ignored.  I'm going to do this in a Tony Soprano voice, if you don't mind.  Despite early reports, there was nothing secret about this.  It was literally called the Facebook Research App.  It wasn't spying, as all the people signed up to participate, went through a clear onboarding process, asking for their permission.  And he was paid to participate.  Finally, less than five percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens, all of them with signed parental consent forms.  You said you wanted to do this.  That twenty dollar gift card.  We was given that to you.  I mean, after all, if this is kind of the foundational question, if you know that a company is invading your privacy and you're willing to trade it for some benefit, whether it's a Gmail or twenty dollars,  what's wrong with that?

Start time: 2367.38

End time: 2401.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I understand. Apple could be pissed off.  They shouldn't have used an enterprise certificate.  Is there any other mechanism, though?  By the way, both Google and Facebook's programs are still available on Android because they don't need any permission.  I should point out you can still do it on Android.  I mean, you could also say, well, look, this is the only way we can do it on Apple.  And we think we should have access to people and their information.  Apple says, no, you can't have any of this.  Only we can have this.

Start time: 2402.40

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's more due to like the way Facebook does business to.  Right. I think was it this week or recently there was the lawsuit about Facebook not doing anything to stop kids from buying things from like buying an app purchases from within games?  Yeah, they actively encouraged it.  Just ignored it. They're like, whatever. Sure. Let's not put any speed bumps.  I think like it's that mentality, you know, that mentality of a company that would allow something like that, no matter the harm it does to its users.  That's what really bothers me about Facebook.  Like selling Twitter does this, too, which is not great.

They're saying, please set yourself on fire and we'll pay you twenty dollars to do it.  Like, to me, that's where it kind of goes a little different. It's like one thing to be like, do whatever you want.  It's another thing to be like, we're going to actively encourage you to do this thing, you know, because we want to we want to see we want to do a research project on on, you know, what temperature flesh burns.

Transcript:  Even like the amount of media literacy that's out there right now.  People don't really understand what they're selling off their information to or how far that information goes.  If, you know, Facebook comes off in this cute little app that we're going to kind of track you versus some creepy guy that's staring in on my window, writing down my every single move.  When you really understand how this is not as invisible as what you think it is, then maybe you could make an informed choice.  But it's the thing is that Facebook tries to come off as this front of a cute way to chat with people when really all they're doing is they're trying to be a conduit to influence public opinion to the highest bidder and be able to gather as much information to be able to do that as efficiently as possible.  And they really don't care for what purpose or cause that is.  And that really bothers me about the way Facebook goes about business.  I have no sympathy to them. And really, they got handled with kid gloves.  If this was a small dev that got caught, you know, making use of something.  They'd never be on Apple's platform.  They'd never be seen again. They'd be buried in the back with the trash and Apple wouldn't feel bad.  It is only because Facebook is so big that they can get away with unabashedly making use of and just trying to like just destroy people's privacy, trying to hide things, being caught constantly and no one really does anything.  Only now do I hear people really kind of getting upset and being like, oh, Facebook is not that cute and friendly as what I thought it was.  But it's taken so long. We've been talking about it in tech for a really long time.  But now it's getting mainstream.

The same reason that Facebook survives. Facebook actually has increased in numbers.  What is up people? Why do they have a larger numbers now? People using Facebook? I don't know.

Any of these things is that it's really hard to cut any of an Apple for sure, too, even though Apple, you know, like step is better about certain things, you know, than other companies.  It's really hard to extricate your life from any of these these big places.  And I would argue that you don't necessarily it's not necessarily beneficial to you know what I mean?  Like, I don't know if my life would be better if I didn't have YouTube or if I didn't have, you know, Google Maps.  Like, I actually think it would be better if you didn't have Facebook.

Transcript:  I've been told that that attitude is really first world privilege speaking.  There are many countries where you have to have WhatsApp.  You're right. You're right.  You have to have Facebook.  I don't know if anybody has to have Instagram, but anyone have Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I disagree. I agree with you.  I think this is a first world privilege problem.  I think it's easy for us to say we can not have these things because we have the money and the privilege to communicate with people in other ways.  If you live in a country, for instance, WhatsApp, where this is how people communicate because the alternative would be really expensive phone systems where they charge you per SMS message and where you might have to have multiple phone services because of how rolling systems work.  And you don't have electricity all the time because of rolling outages.  So you're using the Internet and you're using these tools to communicate.  And for better or worse, the main methods of communication are owned by these big companies.  Facebook, for instance, in India refused to let them do this, but they go into places and they say you can have access to the Internet and will subsidize a certain amount of it.  If we're going to try to I'm not going to tell another person in another country that they can't have access to the Internet, even if it's through Facebook's browser or whatever, because Facebook is evil.  But the alternative is they have no access whatsoever.  Like, I'm not going to say that to someone.  I'm not going to make that decision.

Transcript:  Let's say that real places where we're talking about first world problems, they probably can't afford to have a phone or to have Internet access at all to that.  So it's already a huge issue.  There's people in the middle of the digital divide.  There are other ways to be able to do this.  And in the end, the only way that our privacy will actually be secure is if instead of giving Facebook a slap on the hand, which is like a small fine that's really pocket change for them, would be if if they invade other people's privacy without being clear and concise with that matter would be criminal charges to that.  Truly, if people if Citizens United and corporations are people, then they should be tried as people as well.

Transcript:  It's all wrong.  That doesn't like I don't like that argument to say that, you know, everyone else does it.  So this makes it OK.  I think that people.  But it means if you're going to hold one company to criminal account, you should do all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't disagree with that.  I agree.  I think it's hard to do.  I also feel like it's hard to say again, as us in a position of privilege to say what should be what other people who don't have our means, what decisions they should make.  And and I feel also weird encroaching.  And, you know, I got an argument with with someone at a conference I was speaking at back in November who was kind of talking about like we should all get rid of our smartphones and stop doing these things.  And and I said, OK, well, what about people in other countries who their lives have been demonstrably made better because of this technology?  And his argument was, oh, well, it's fine for them.  And I find that really condescending for us to be like, well, we have the means and we're good enough.  We should get rid of this because, you know, it's better for our privacy and our means.  But for people who don't have access to anything else, oh, we should let them continue to be exploited.  Like, I feel like that's I don't know.  I have a problem with that kind of mixed message.  It's either it should be OK for everybody or it shouldn't be OK.

Start time: 2943.22
End time: 2983.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the bigger problem, though, is that Facebook basically has a monopoly on social networking on like these big groups.  Right. So you're going to use the service where your friends are, where your families are.  I think it's easy for, you know, especially like Western first world folks like to just give up on Facebook and you'll have other ways to interact.  But, yeah, if you're in India and everybody's on WhatsApp, you can't really not be there.  Otherwise, you're missing out on a whole lot of like social like social conversations.  We need more real competition for Facebook.  Like, that's the biggest problem because Facebook's power is the it's a superpower.  Like, it has the power of a country, you know, and I think that's kind of scary seeing what they do with it.

Start time: 2985.23
End time: 3025.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In some ways, they have more power than a lot of countries.  And that's the thing is these these companies are too large to fail.  That's a huge problem for everyone that's out there, like all of us.  That becomes a really huge problem to that, especially when they are have been caught doing such nefarious things.  I think the EU has done a better job of trying to take a look into this and police that.  The cutest part was when Facebook got caught with their emails and they're like, no, please don't read our emails.  Those are private. They did anyways.  Thank God. But I think that we need to have that discussion.  I think that we need to be going into it.  And I think that we really need to take a look at, you know, how do we be able to police companies that, you know, have huge lobbyists and they end up being able to control the governments that want to police them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's one thing that would be great. Right.  But it's I think time and again, what what has helped us looking across like so many other industries, how you know, how is driving regulated?  How is alcohol regulated? How are like a lot of the major things we deal with?  It's regulation. It's it's not the solution for everything.  I think it's a combination of regulation plus competition that creates a healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's I don't know if it's hard. I think that we need to talk about it.  We need to educate people that are that are becoming lawmakers.  I think that again, like an education in technology and how is it used and why is it used is really important because a lot of maybe older lawmakers or people that are not that technically literate are then writing laws for this, which doesn't make sense.

Transcript:  Yeah, and definitely even younger people don't know India's choice, which I thought was very interesting not to allow Internet dot org.  Mm hmm. Facebook's attempt to provide access to areas that were completely non served or underserved.  The government of India refused them that license.  I was I was yeah, I was told by some that it was seen almost as as as if the Raj had come back if the English oppressor had come back and said, it's OK, let us handle it.  Because, of course, the problem with Internet dot org was it was pretty much just Facebook.  You had Wikipedia, but it was like, what provides you with Facebook?  Well, and also they're tracking everything, you know, I mean, so it's going to I thought that was interesting that they could do though that they had the guts to do that is telling.

Start time: 3126.16
End time: 3161.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. 1000, especially since since Facebook, they have done things like that in other countries and not to the extent of what they wanted to do with Internet dot org.  But they do do it other places. And, you know, a lot of phone carriers in other countries, you'll pay a certain amount of money for access to data and the data you'll get free Facebook.  But other types of data will charge money. And so that's a huge incentive, obviously, for people to use Facebook and Facebook.  I mean, at the time there were there was a lot of incredulity that India would turn it down.  But I agree with you. I think it's a really ballsy move to say, no, we're not going to allow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But I think that I think that a lot of that is on Snapchat, too. Is it? Yeah.  Yes. I think I think they've been I think their product hasn't kept up.  I think that a lot of they had famously very bad privacy and security issues they weren't really focusing on.  And look, did Facebook blatantly copy did Instagram blatantly copy stories? Yeah, they did.  And made no qualms about it. I actually kind of appreciate the honesty in that.  But I feel like, you know, snaps decline, while certainly not helped by the fact that Instagram's product was a copy.  The reality also is that Instagram not just copied the feature but made it better and continued to do things that others wouldn't.

Transcript:  As Snapchat to compete against something as integrated as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram. Right.  It absolutely is. And in fact, according to The New York Times last week, they're planning to integrate the platforms completely so that an advertiser could buy all three.  So the information they glean from one will help the other.  That is that is exactly in fact, one California legislator said this is why we should have been much more cautious about allowing Facebook to buy WhatsApp and Instagram.

Start time: 3256.00
End time: 3290.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, completely. I mean, I think that it would have been impossible to make an argument, an antitrust argument for Instagram.  You know, it was a billion dollars. The best billion dollars Facebook ever spent.  But at the time that it launched, you know, it didn't even I don't even think the Android app had officially come out yet.  It wasn't even fully done when the acquisition happened. It was small.  You know what I mean? Facebook was actually working on its own competitor that it released a few weeks after or a few days after it bought Instagram.  That was terrible. I remember this because I wrote a story in the headline with something like, you know, Facebook, whatever proves why Instagram is worth a billion dollars.

Start time: 3290.16

Start time: 3302.02
End time: 3353.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But what I mean, though, is that like, so you're not wrong.  But I think that Instagram, I will. But I was going to say that was like Instagram.  I don't think there was any antitrust thing at all.  But I do think that for WhatsApp, when you know, when you're spending twenty billion dollars and a big reason they spent twenty billion was because Google.  Well, no, because Google was going to buy it and they had to outbid Google.  I mean, that should have been looked at with a lot more scrutiny when you looked at the overlap that Facebook messenger,  which hadn't been separated in the same way and was already gearing up to compete with WhatsApp before they even bought the product.  Like, I think the lawmaker is right. That's when the time for some of these things has passed us.  And if we want to prevent this sort of consolidation in the future and this sort of overarching stuff in the future, then then you have to look at when when you're approving M&A stuff.  You know, but nobody nobody cared what happened and it didn't understand it.

Start time: 3354.22
End time: 3386.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they didn't. Yeah, they didn't have enough knowledge to be able to make a viable argument and discuss that properly.  And I think that that's a problem with a lot of the lawmakers that are out there.  They just don't understand enough to be able to make really good laws and good arguments when they're up there looking at it and taking a look.  And again, Facebook pays them a lot of money.  Like, if you take a look at how much money Facebook has given to different people in the government, it's a lot of their money.  And there's a reason for that. Let's take a break. Great panel.

So I'll give you I'll give you credit now. But we just love having you on all three of you.  You're always great on fire today. Always fun.  Our show today brought to you by thousand eyes is a brand new sponsor and one I'm so happy to be on.  Because I really think thousand eyes offers a solution that a lot of you don't even know exists.  If you run a network, if you are online, I'm not this is not a consumer product.  This is a business product. But if you have a online presence and stuff goes wrong, it's often impossible to figure out where it's going wrong.  And I think many of us just say, well, we'll never know what's going on. What's happening in the network?  It's a puffy little cloud. I don't know.  Thousand eyes knows with thousand eyes, you get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks, all the dependencies that impact your users digital experience.  The problem is they should have named it a million eyes because it isn't a thousand.  It isn't a thousand. It's many hundreds of thousands of sensors at every point on the network from the edge on in that can tell you exactly where your traffic is and where it's going and what's going on.  As we as we move to the cloud and I think cloud is so great for business. So many people are moving to the cloud.  There are a lot of benefits to the cloud. You gain in agility, but you increase in risk.  You lose some control. And as I said, it's kind of mysterious sometimes when your cloud or app or service goes down, do you know really what's going on?  As you scramble to find the root cause of the problem, you're losing revenue. Your employee productivity goes down. Your brand is damaged.  You need thousand eyes. You need instant visibility into the entire service delivery path from the cloud to your end user, including the portions you don't own or control.  I think I am kind of on a mission because I am a believer in thousand eyes.  I know these guys well and I think you need to know about them. It's unlike anything you've seen before.  It's cloud based software built to help organizations like yours do the cloud right.  A massive array of vantage points spanning the global Internet everywhere.  China to cloud providers, even the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop.  This is not passive old school IT monitoring, which basically lives in a silo, can only see inside the data center.  Thousand eyes unique path tracing technology expands beyond boundaries, allowing you to see, understand and improve the experience for all your apps, services and websites.  Regain control, ensure the best possible digital experience for your customers, employees.  You've got to find out about thousand eyes. Big banks know about it.  SaaS companies, enterprises, the world's largest, fastest growing brands rely on thousand eyes to do the cloud and do it right.  But maybe you don't know about it. That's why I'm on a mission.  Visit thousand eyes all spelled out.  T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D-E-Y-E-S dot com slash twit to see what you've been missing.  They're offering right now a handy book that everybody should have.  If you're thinking about cloud migration, five cloud migration challenges you shouldn't ignore.

You're going to hear more about them on our shows in future because I'm kind of a thousand eyes buff, a fan.  I didn't mention this, but I should probably mention it.

The worst thing in the world would be a super efficient government.  Right? The founders knew that.  That's why we have three competing branches.  There's oversight.  I mean, it's intentionally deliberate, which means it's a little bit of a mismatch to a very fast moving world.  Not just, by the way, not just info tech, but get ready for the genetic revolution.

I still think it's worth it.  The words, the New York state taking a look at this and just being like, you're doing the rundown, seeing how this happened and how Apple didn't notice.  I have no problem with that. We should be doing this for every security flaw, for every data breach.  I'm still like reeling. What was the widespread one that was shutting down?  Want to cry like after all the want to cry stuff to you, which revealed that hospitals across the UK just had bad I.T.  And that left them vulnerable to a lot of this.  Like those are those are problems we could fix.  Like those are like, well, that's what I'm saying.  I don't think like regulation is the fix for everything.  But I think like ensuring that a company is keeping their software up to date, you know, is securely patched as much as an OS maker has available.  I think that sort of thing should be standardized.  And if somebody is involving, that should be punished for it because otherwise, yeah, you have secure.

The court is supported by 22 state attorneys general say the FCC lacked a sound legal reason for scrapping the title to regulations.  The government will argue, it's expected, according to New York Times, that the rules were repealed because of the burden they provide.  They imposed on broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast.

And I think now that this conversation is happening in the government, maybe more people are paying attention to what this future infrastructure is and what it means and where it comes from.  Maybe now they'll pay more attention to net neutrality and what that means too.  Let's talk about Huawei because the news is bad.

There's a Polish Huawei executive has been arrested in Poland for spying.  Huawei, which is a Chinese maker of, it's the number two, although it goes back and forth with Apple.  I think they're number three this week, manufacturer of smartphones after Samsung.  So it's at Samsung, Apple, Huawei, sometimes Apple is third, sometimes second.  So they're a big, this is a big Chinese company founded by a former member of the Chinese military.  And the government, the US government is saying has already told two of the big US carriers, I think Verizon and AT&T, they cannot, they may not use Huawei gear.  In their 5G network.  What?  This is, I just, I find this fascinating.  This is a very difficult challenge because no one else is making 5G, 5G gear as good as Huawei, as well as Huawei is inexpensively as Huawei.

This cuts back to the cyber, the sort of like cyber cold war we've been having with China and a lot of other countries for the past decade.  You know, this goes way, way back.  And I think the main worry now with Huawei is that, yeah, is this just another arm of the Chinese government trying to just have its tendrils there, maybe not actually doing anything, but having the capability to read data if they wanted to or have a certain amount of knowledge around what's happening around the world.  That's a, it's a legit fear.  I was, I was skeptical.

The US unsealed the indictments against the Huawei chief financial officers being held in Canada among Juan Joe.  And among the accusations, prosecutors say Huawei stole trade secrets, including technology behind a robotic device T-Mobile used to test smartphones, TAPI.  Huawei engineers secretly took photos of the robot, measured it and tried to steal a piece of it from the lab.  Okay.  Well, maybe.  There is no allegation in the unsealed documents that Huawei is working at the behest of the Chinese government.  Right.

Whereas this seems to be more about like, are they capturing secrets or this or that?  What's actually interesting, and it hasn't been got, it hasn't had as much traction, but I work with a number of Canadians who used to work,  you know, worked in the Canadian telecom industry for a long time and with sort of kind of interesting wrinkle to the whole fact that the the arrest happened in Canada is that a lot of people from the Nortel days in Canada have are angry about what would they perceive of Huawei's role in the downturn of the fall of Nortel.

Britain says, British Telecom says they're going to strip Huawei equipment from its 4G network by 2021 and won't use it in 5G core.  But see, this is the issue. It's everywhere.

So I think right now Intel is like, we don't want that to happen ever again.  So there's going to be a big push by Intel. Who knows how well that works out.  But they've been pushing like modems. They've been doing LTE modems.  And that's worked out well for them so far.

Transcript:  Well, it's because it's a Chinese company doing that to a US company.  And there I think there are a lot of reports about US companies like visiting and trying to partner with some Chinese companies.  All of a sudden, their tech. There were some really good I think it was like all things considered had a good chat with with some folks.

Start time: 4319.16
End time: 4367.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I listened to that. There's a guy who wrote a book about this and it was interesting.  Look, it's clear what the threats could be. If you have if your network is built on your infrastructure, network infrastructure is built on gear from a company controlled by the government of China.  And it doesn't even have to be currently controlled because it is a Chinese company.  At some point, the government could say, OK, fine, thank you.  We'll take over from here or we'd like access to that network. So that's legitimate.  There's both industrial espionage threats and national security threats because if that if our if our entire if we start to rely on 5G infrastructure, our entire autonomous fleet is using 5G to communicate.  And all of a sudden, the Chinese government flips a switch and it stops working. That's not good.  Sure. That's cyber war.

Transcript:  It isn't. There's a lot of pressure on Canada to ban Huawei.  I think Canada has. Oh, they haven't.  They have not. There's a lot of pressure on them, too, because, you know, again, there's a lot like the big five are kind of looking at us as well, because if our infrastructure has Huawei, like you go through us to be able to get information anyways.  So that kind of compromises everyone else to be able to deal with it.  But, you know, Huawei's already said, like, they deny that they're spying for the Chinese government or that they are using their technology for spying in any way.  They didn't say that they couldn't or that they wouldn't, which is like also they were not really strong in their statements to that.  And in Canada, they're still looking into it and they're going to make a decision dependent on what they they find for for security.  Like we're lucky Trudeau actually has a good knowledge of technology and how it's used.  And he did hire a whole bunch of people that work in the government that really are in the field, like the agriculture minister actually works in agriculture.  So we'll actually get some good answers to that.

Transcript:  Yeah, show off.  So the person that was on Fresh Air is named David Sanger.  He's a tech security correspondent for the New York Times and has written a book about cyber warfare called The Perfect Weapon.  So his point, which was kind of interesting, is that these switches that Huawei is selling are basically not hardware, they're software.  So if in the old days when switches were hardware, a company could buy them and presumably inspect them in such a way to make sure that they were safe.  But the problem is it's software. Not only is it software, it's software is updated fairly regularly.  So there's there's no way to be sure that that software at some point won't be modified in such a way that it could be dangerous.  There's just no way to guarantee that.

Start time: 4491.00
End time: 4497.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you put any safeguards in place to be able to deal with that?  Right.  So it's not hardware. It's important to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't disagree with that. I mean, I think that's a valid concern.  I guess the only thing I would push back on is you could make that claim about any provider, right?  Well, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. And which which I guess is kind of my point, which is that I don't doubt that there are real concerns.  I just wonder in some cases how much there is a xenophobic component and an anti-China component that may not be warranted.  And that bothers me. Exactly. Totally.  Like, yeah, like that bothers me. Exactly.

End time: 4559.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's that's that's that's where my unease comes from.  Exactly. Christina, is this a product of xenophobia and trade war or is is I mean, there certainly is legitimate cause for concern.  I don't know. Is Ericsson, I guess Ericsson, we can trust them because they're not right.

Start time: 4559.06
End time: 4585.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. Well, right. That's the thing is like, are we putting the same scrutiny against Ericsson against Nokia and against others that we're doing here?  I think we should. Right. Like, I think that we should.  But if we're not, then we need to start. We need to discuss and have a real conversation about why.  And when we're talking about holding people and arresting people in different countries and extraditing them, you know, again, like you need to have an understanding.  And again, like you need to have, in my opinion, very, very good reasons for that, you know.

Transcript:  All right. Let's take a little break. We've lots more to talk about, including a DNA company giving its data to the FBI.  Oh, but first a word from so as long as we're talking cybersecurity, Sophos, we use Sophos here.  Everybody loves Sophos. Many is the time I've told people use Sophos is online scanner to check your system.  Sophos understands that it is a battle between the black hats and us.  And it is a seesaw battle. And the and the hackers are getting smarter all the time.  That's why Sophos cybersecurity uses machine learning.  They call it deep learning to interpret data and respond to threats better than any any network protection can.  Hardware and software Sophos recently ranked number one by an independent security test done by SE Labs with the best protection ratings across the board, both for large enterprises and small businesses.  It's why we use Sophos here.  They have actually now does something kind of interesting. And I've been using it. I find it very, very fascinating.  They took the same the same deep learning software technology they're using in these big enterprises now.  And they've made a premium version available for home users for Mac and PC.  It's called Sophos home. And it is it's not an antivirus.  It's something so much more sophisticated. It delivers real time protection from the latest ransomware attacks, malicious software, hacking attempts and more.  Very easy to use, always up to date. It's the first time I've ever seen anything that's faster than the bad guys.  It's up to date faster than the bad guys because it's cloud based.  And oh, I love this feature. And I know some of you are responsible for family and friends and their security.  It's a cloud based protection you can use to keep your relatives secure no matter where they are, even if they're thousands of miles away.  You can remotely manage their security, clean up threats, keep them safe.  One account can protect all the Macs and PCs in your home and your family, too.  It's easy to use whether you're just securing a single laptop or managing the security of multiple devices around the world, because that's Sophos.  That's how they work in enterprise. And that's how they work with Sophos home.  Sophos tagline is security made simple. And that's exactly what you're going to get.  You're going to work with your browser interface. So you start securing your systems right now.  Whether you're a large enterprise or a home user, Sophos has you covered.  Some of the largest businesses in the world use Sophos to protect their systems from ransomware.  Third party reviewers consistently rank Sophos among the best cybersecurity providers.  And I love it that synchronized security means you manage all your Sophos products from a single cloud based console for your family as well as for yourself.  Get a free trial right now. Sophos home at Sophos dot com.  Actually, you can also go there and get that security scan, too.  And we've always recommended that as a great way of making sure your system is up to date and safe.  Sophos dot com. Great product.  So you're going to we're going to have to tease the facts out on this one because it's it's not clear.  You may remember the Golden State Killer case, which was a long, cold case, serial killer, never caught him until the feds went to a database, a DNA genetic database run by family tree DNA.  Now, at the time, this didn't bother me when I read about this, because what had happened was relatives of the guy they eventually arrested.  But this happened fairly recently. Had posted they had DNA tests done, posted their data on the forum in an attempt to find other family members.  The feds apparently were scanning through the forum. They had the DNA of the Golden State Killer.  They just didn't have a suspect. They noticed the similarity and they actually were able to track down the relatives, say, tell us about other people in your family.  And they actually arrested the guy, which is remarkable.  Portland police tied a this is a 40 year old case. So they arrested him.  This was in April. But what we've now learned since is something more disturbing.  See, that didn't bother me. That was voluntary. Right. People put their DNA information up. So you're putting it public.  You know, the FBI uses that's fine.  What we're finding now is family tree DNA is also providing this access to people who haven't posted it publicly.  The company, which was one of the first, I think they say they were the first to offer direct consumer test kit told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that they have a relationship with the FBI, that they will help law enforcement agencies solve violent crimes faster than ever.  Not a contract. But and this is the thing that is disturbing.  The firm has agreed to test DNA samples, upload the profiles to its database on a case by case basis.  They've been doing it since the fall.  And they say that, you know, the only way to stop this, if you are a family tree DNA customer, is to turn off family sharing that by saying, I want to find other relatives, you are giving them permission to share this information with law enforcement.  Of course, if you're doing family tree DNA, that's the entire point of it. Right.  Finding possible relatives through DNA testing.  So family tree says you if you opt out of any familial match matching notice no no FBI in there.  Any familial matching, then we won't be able to we won't the FBI won't be able to search your files.  But if you say, oh, yeah, I'm looking for family members.  That also means the FBI can look through your stuff.  What do you think?

Transcript:  But the problem in Alex in the chat room actually mentioned it is that these companies don't fall cover any HIPAA kind of covered entities.  And so you don't have the same kind of legal protection.  And even if they say they're not going to cover it, if the FBI comes after them and says, listen, we want this information, we know for some reason this person's come to you, it becomes one of these really big issues to that.  And I think that that Christine is absolutely right.  Like you give this as a gift to someone else.  It might not be that much of a gift unless you think they've committed a crime.

I've done 23andMe and Helix, both of which were sponsors.  Actually, 23andMe is still a sponsor in the ratio.  I like the stuff I get from it.  So what do we need?  Some sort of HIPAA?  What do we need?  Yeah, we need a lot more than what we have.  All right. And let me play devil's advocate.  Look, if you didn't do anything wrong.

This could be used against you in many different ways versus the benefits.  And you heard about the twins.  Two twins ended up doing their DNA for your genetic ancestry and they only test one percent of the bloody DNA.  So they ended up getting ancestry of like being in two different parts and they are identical twins.  So their DNA is identical and they got to completely divergent.

Transcript:  That CBC story was kind of BS.  I want to say before you go on, that CBC story was BS.  It was statistically exactly in line with what you'd expect.  But what people don't understand is that these DNA tests are not in fact testing every strand and comparing head to head.  What they do is they take your DNA and they compare it to a statistical sample.  And within that limitation, this is exactly correct.  But people need to understand that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I understand.

Start time: 5136.00
End time: 5154.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not really giving you what you think that you're getting from that.  They're hoping to find out where they're for them.  They were trying to find out where their ancestry was from.  And this is one percent of your DNA. It's like truly nothing.  So you end up with an idea that is inaccurate for what you're getting and you're giving up your DNA.  Yeah.

Start time: 5155.32

But this, but I think if people think, oh, no, this is an exact science, they're going to be disappointed by the results.  But it's not. It's a statistical database.  The bigger thing is, it's creating a database of people's DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it should also be pointed out that when we've shown this, this has happened before where you it's not about you have nothing to hide.  It's that, you know, DNA can be transferred across things.  People found DNA where people have never been in locations before.  And now all of a sudden you have a database of individuals and you can have people framed or, you know,

People often say, well, you got APOE.  They're going to get Alzheimer's. No, no, no.  But that is there. There is a relationship, a statistical relationship between that marker and Alzheimer's.  If an insurer then said, well, for what? I don't care.  I'm not going to give you a long term care insurance. Exactly.  That would be bad. Yeah. No, totally.

Transcript:  Oh, please. That's the same thing that the insurance companies say about like yours. Yeah.  Yeah, they lie. They're just saying that because they want the information to it.  And insurance companies are not there to help you out.  I'm sorry. They're there to make profit.  And so the more people they can say no to, the nice people get fired from insurance companies.  And the more people that they can say no to, they actually have a quota to that.  Then that's how they get move up in the company.  So, OK, but on using it on your watch, they're like, you know what?  If you're healthy and doing all of these things, you'll have less chance of needing to use the insurance company, which is true.  But you end up finding out you have some sort of arithmetic, arithmetic.  And they find out they could also say, you know what?  Actually, now that's no longer covered.

But this is the sort of thing where you need HIPAA, where you need other sorts of regulations.  It needs to be done very seriously because you're potentially talking about yes, you could maybe catch a killer, which is great.  But you could also conceivably ruin people's lives.  Right. And someone could be put in jail for something that they didn't do.  And that's not a far out thought.  You know, like the implications are really, really dangerous.

So, you know, I'm already in a database, but it's, you know, just one other thing where you do worry about, OK, this is a private sector thing controlling these things.

Transcript:  There's huge benefit to DNA testing.  Yes. Women who have the BRCA gene, for instance, that could be very if done properly.  By the way, the BRCA tests by most of these consumer DNA tests are not very useful.  But if you went to your physician, got a prescription and got a real BRCA genetic test, that is hugely valuable information.  It's at that point protected by HIPAA.  So I think the key is to extend the privacy protections of HIPAA to these DNA tests.  Why not? Yeah.

But I think 23andMe, I think that's a great point, is that they, you know, were faced with that critique and other than shutting down, they went through the loops, the hoops.  And I almost feel like if you're in this space, look, it's great.  It's great.  Disruption is great, but you need to follow the same rules that any other medical company would follow.  And they're just simply saying, we're tech.  We can break things.  I mean, that's how.

Transcript:  I'm also thinking of Theranos, too.  Like it's they didn't they didn't go through the FDA.  I think there was like a loophole where they didn't have to.  So, yeah, these are all things we need to fix because they could have been a really interesting company.  But we could have also stopped them much earlier if somebody just took a look at their tech and was like, hey, well, it could have been an interesting company that wasn't all alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is interesting that because the FDA overhauled this process for medical devices because of Apple, because of demand and made it easier.  So that's that's the there's been this demand to do that so that we can do this because we want to because tech moves fast.  And we don't want these slow, expensive processes to hold us back.  But then there's the other side of it.  Well, there's a good reason for this to be slow and expensive.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The only problem is even once, you know, if they get covered by HIPAA, like think about a data breach for your DNA.  Right. You can change your credit card numbers and your passwords.  You can't change your DNA.  And once that's out there and it's known fact, then insurance companies can say it's a known fact and it's no fault of your own.  And it's been covered by anything.  So even with that, there's still a discussion to be made.

Transcript:  Yeah, I tried to do they actually didn't accept me.  But some years back, there was a project started in 2005, the personal genome project, which I think was a great benefit to mankind.  I think it was out of Harvard.  Yeah, I applied for this.  You had to pay like fifteen hundred bucks because this is back when DNA testing was very expensive.  And what they said at the time was, look, we're going to collect all your DNA.  We're going to actually you're going to fill out long questionnaires about your medical history, your health history, your family health history.  And we do not promise to keep this private.  In fact, we're going to identify it with your name because we know we can't keep it private.  People like Esther Dyson, who did this, said, yeah, this is good.  And I said, yeah, fine.  Have my name.  They never made a promise of privacy because they said that's going to be impossible.  It will get out.  So participants are invited to publicly share the genomic and trait data in an integrated publicly accessible format.  But you have to sign a fairly significant waiver.  It's not anonymous.  The risks of participant reidentification are addressed up front as an integral part of the consent and enrollment process.  Neither anonymity nor confidentially confidentiality of data is promised.  Period.  And actually, I would have been happy to be accepted.  I don't know why they didn't take me.  But that's that's the difference that by doing that, I'm an astrodisant and the people who've done it are giving to society.  And it's up front about it.

Japanese government approved a law on Friday that would allow government workers to hack into people's IOT devices.  They're trying to survey them to see if you're using default passwords, you know, to find out if you're secure,  or if you've got something like the VPN filter on your router, that kind of thing.  The Japanese government's decision, according to ZDNet, to log into users IOT devices has sparked outrage in Japan.  Many have argued it's an unnecessary step.  However, the government plan does have its technical merits, because after all, IOT devices and routers particularly are notoriously insecure.

Like, hey, by the way, you just, you know, you have this thing on your system.  They made you like a system-wide ping to just look for default usernames and passwords.  I think that's a pretty simple, harmless thing.  That's what they're going to do.

But, you know, it's like I would not mind if ISPs were doing this because it would help a lot of consumers who aren't super technically savvy.  And there's like less of a problem for them.  There's certainly the worry, though, that all of a sudden you'll have these ISP specialists who know they can get into certain systems and who knows what happens.

Start time: 5867.24

Transcript:  Well, yeah, the idea here is they're going to make a list of devices that use the default passwords or monkey one, two, three.  They send that to the Internet service provider who then contacts the customer and says, fix your device.  The Olympics are coming.  What are you crazy?  You could do this in Japan.  That's a very different kind of society.  You do this in the United States.  Insane.  Insane.

Start time: 5890.44

Transcript:  Also, what I think the problem in the United States is that in many cases the router is actually provided by the ISP.  Right?  Like a lot of these in-home devices, a lot of these things are actually controlled by the ISPs.  Which to me does kind of open up the idea of, yeah, to Vindra's point, maybe they should be doing some of these scans or maybe we should just, you know, as consumers or as people require that these things ship with better default.  I don't know.  But I understand both concerns.  But I mean, I guess I understand both sides.  I think this could potentially be a good thing if you could actually enforce this.  But I also like you're right.  This wouldn't work in the US.  A, the outrage.  And B, the reality is that most people are getting their insecure router with their password or whatever from their internet provider.  Or in some cases, you know, now you're seeing apartment complexes who are forcing people to install smart locks that could be hacked and have other things.  It's like, what do you do in those cases, you know, where some of your IoT things that might be insecure have been provided to you or you're forced to use them because they came as part of something else that you didn't even knowingly put in your home, you know?

And I want Taytay to be safe.  Same. But I like I couldn't get as outraged about that just because it is in a private place and it is not one of those instances where you're in the public and they're doing this.  Like, do I understand why people are creeped out?  Yeah.  At the same time, I also understand why, like when someone has legitimate stalkers, you know, why they might do something like that.  You can be concerned about what happens with where those databases are being stored and that sort of thing.  But again, you're entering a private event.

This shouldn't even be about politics when it comes to people's health.  Your country is deemed on how you take care of the people that are the sickest, the weakest, the most needy to that.  And it's you know that it's actually more affordable because the more that you access health care earlier,  the less chance that something big and expensive actually comes down the road to it.  And then the more that you can stay into the workforce, the more that you contribute, the more taxes that you can pay.  So I think that it's workable. And I don't think that it should be a political issue.  I think that everyone should be able to not have to think about if they have to take care of their sick child or pay the mortgage payment to that.

I'm Leo LaPorte.  I'm Megan Maroney. I'm Jason Howell.  Oh, we're all here. You see, it turns out at Twitch, we get a lot of gear, always get a lot of gear to review laptops, phones, VR gear, stuff like robots.  Robots. This thing.  And so we thought it'd be fun, whatever that is. You don't even know, do you? No.  So we thought it'd be fun to take some of the stuff we get and give you reviews.  But instead of doing a regular review show, we're just going to review everything when it comes in.  They might be short reviews, they might be long reviews, but it'll always be a number of different reviews every week.  So if you subscribe to the Hands on Tech channel, you'll get the latest reviews and you can always Google your favorite product, find out what we think of it.  The best way to get ready for Hands on Tech, episode one's coming soon.  In fact, it's going to be a review of the new Jaguar I-Pace electric vehicle is to go to twit.tv slash hot.  That stands for Hands on Tech. Is that robot making noise at me? Yeah, it's perping at me. I'm sorry.  We'll see you soon on Hands on Tech. Bye bye.  We've got all this stuff. We review them on our individual shows.  Why not just make it possible to get just the reviews? Just the reviews. And Megan's on it.  So we always love that. And actually, anybody wants to do a review?  I mean, you're already doing it for Engadget, Evendra, but but Christina or Georgia?  Let us know. We'll send you the product. You can review it.  We've got a lot of stuff, far too much stuff for us to review.  I just sent out Dr. The little handheld Osmo.  I mean, how many people are reviewing products at Engadget? Probably a dozen, right?  It's crazy. But honestly, our reviews may also sync up.  So let me know. We'll probably get it and we can do it.  I mean, I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do it.

Transcript:  We will be feeling our tech up on hot.  This week at Tech brought to you by Quip.  Actually, this is a hot device.  Lisa and I just went to Vegas and we brought our Quips.  So I love an electric toothbrush, but the Quip is the best electric toothbrush ever.  By the way, the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American Dental Association.  So that's a pretty nice thing.  Brushing right, of course, is very important.  The Quip is a great affordable electric toothbrush that's an effective clean.  It's gentle in your sensitive gums.  In fact, sometimes people go, oh, it's too gentle.  That was my first reaction.  It turned out I've been brushing too hard.  My dentist said, no, no, please use the Quip because it's just right.  You get a built-in two-minute timer, which pulses every 30 seconds to remind you when to switch sides  and help you clean your whole mouth evenly.  Everybody around here started to use the Quip.  Debbie started using it.  Her dentist said, I don't know what you're doing, but keep up the good work.  It's because most of us don't brush for a full two minutes or clean evenly.  And I love the Quip.  It's great for travel because it's got a AAA battery in it.  There's no charger.  So I just pop the Quip in my suitcase and I'm good to go.  It's great at home too because you see that little Quip holder.  It sticks right on the mirror so you'll never forget the brush.  It's staring you right in the face when you go into the bathroom.  It works as a stand or you can mount it to mirrors.  You can slide over your bristles to pack.  You turn it in upside down and so it's perfect.  It's got everything it needs to pack.  And what's great about the Quip is you automatically get new brush heads,  new batteries delivered on a dentist recommended schedule.  Every three months, just $5 and a friendly reminder when it's time for a refresh  so you'll stay committed to your oral health.  Most of us, whether using electric or regular toothbrushes,  about 75% of us use brushes that are worn out.  They are no longer effective.  Quip is the way to do it.  One of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the American Dental Association  backed by over 25,000 dental professionals,  thousands of verified 5-star reviews,  and a lot of people at Twitter who are happy to use it.  One million happy healthy mouths.  Quip. Oh, did I mention it starts at $25?  Go to getquip.com slash Twitter right now.  Get your first refill pack for free when you purchase any Quip electric toothbrush.  I got his and her toothbrushes.  I'm copper, she's gold.  So we know the difference and we love them.  Get your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash Twitter.  G-E-T-Q-U-I-P dot com slash Twitter.  We love Quip!  Let's see, I jumped, sometimes this happens.  I jumped to an earlier episode and I have all the old stories.  But here's one that gave me a little, you're all podcasters,  so maybe this will give you a little thrill.  Spotify, according to Recode, is in talks to buy Gimlet Media for $200 million!  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.

Didn't it win a Golden Globe? It certainly was nominated.  It was a scripted podcast, which they turned into Amazon Netflix, not Netflix, Amazon TV.  I watched the first three episodes.  Is it worth continuing?  I hear it's very good.

Transcript:  It's slow.  So Gimlet did raise money, you know, startup in 2017.  A funding round valued the company at about 70 million dollars,  which even then blows my mind for a podcast network.  But according to Recode, a person familiar with the deal says  Spotify will pay more than 200 million cash, cash for the company.  And the reason it's worth so much to Spotify, I think, is pretty clear.  Any company like Spotify that's kind of at the mercy of the record industry  is desperately looking for another place for content. Right?  Spotify has 200 million users.  They listen to music, but the royalty rates aren't in their control.  They don't know how much it's going to cost them.  I know it's all practically put Pandora out of business.  Pandora, by the way, doing the same thing.  In fact, they're wooing podcasters saying we want an exclusive.

Start time: 6717.03
End time: 6744.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I was going to say that's that would be the interesting thing.  If Spotify does by Gimlet, is do they continue to let Gimlet distribute this  to Apple Podcasts and to Google and to other places?  Or do they make it a Spotify exclusive?  Because if you're making that much of an investment,  you could understand why you might say, well, we want to be the exclusive home.  But you could also say, well, your reach is going to be significantly more limited  if you cut off Apple Podcasts as an example. Right.

Start time: 6747.33

End time: 6796.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could see. Yeah, I think that's like the dream of podcasting, right?  Because it's a spin off of RSS.  It was about distributing audio everywhere. Right.  But I do think like we are feeling the end of like whatever that tech is so archaic.  The way of distributing a podcast is very it's just kind of insane.  It's kind of hard to get. You have to treat you have to train people.  And if it's within the interface that people already use and understand,  I don't listen to podcasts within Spotify.  But I think a lot of regular casual users, I've talked to folks where that's where they listen to podcasts,  because that's just where they are. So it makes a certain amount of sense.  They just need to fix that interface. Because like I was going to say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Transcript:  Yes, same. Rocket is also on Spotify.  And I don't have a lot of direct analytic information about that.  And that's actually one of the problems. Right.  But there's the problems of podcasts all up is that your analytic information is kind of a black box.  Because it differs from platform to platform.  And you have to extrapolate a certain amount of information from that.

Transcript:  Our number one downloads, I think, is Pocket Cast. Maybe iTunes, then Pocket Cast.  But that worries me because Pocket Cast got bought by public radio.  And I don't know what the future is for non-public radio podcasts.  So I guess Apple is doing their thing where they're doing measurements and trying to sell that to advertisers.  But you have to use an Apple product to get that an Apple podcast app to get that information.  I hope you're wrong, Devinder.  I hope that RSS and the completely democratic method of distributing audio shows remains.  Because I think it's really important.

Transcript:  It's just we've seen, I think, for so long because I've been our podcast just passed 500 episodes.  We've been doing it for over 10 years. You know, the last film cast.  We've seen this tech for so long. Yeah.  The fundamental tech has not changed. I think that's a big problem.  Like analytics, doing something more interesting.  What I like about Spotify, too, is that when you're playing music, occasionally a video will pop up, too, on your phone.  And like maybe lyric info, like maybe there's some stuff from Rap Genius or Genius, right?  There's more potential to do more with that interface than just have somebody listen to an audio file and let the screen be kind of useless.  I've been looking forward to something like that, too.  Like better use of metadata. Maybe throw up a link.  Maybe throw up a video as we're talking about it.  That can be really cool and really interesting.  So at least Spotify could innovate on that front.  I want RSS to succeed, but, you know, even Google Reader couldn't do it.  So who knows how long this will last.

Transcript:  Well, you know, it's really been interesting for podcasts.  And I don't know if it's made a difference to you guys.  I don't have any numbers to back this up.  But the fact that you can ask Amazon's Echo or Google Home or Siri to play a podcast for you and just by name and you get the latest episode.  That to me seems like a very nice way for consumers to listen.  It's nice. It's hard to control.

But if anybody is going to, it's going to be Gimlet.  And, you know, I mean, it came out of this American life and people who have really helped pioneer this format in terms of making money off it and getting mass, mass, mass audiences, you know, general audiences, not our more niche, you know, tech and film and, you know, culture things, which are great, but are not the same level of something like, you know, a cereal.  And so if any, if anybody is going to get that kind of money, it makes sense.  It would be them.

And this is as much about creating future content as it is about the existing lineup  and saying we're going to have exclusive access potentially to these producers.

It seems low.  I could tell you.  I mean, we're public.  We made nine million dollars last year, ten million the year before in 2017.  So but I wonder.

Start time: 7203.24
End time: 7215.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the question is, is it based on hype?  Is it based on realities based on actual revenue?  One of the things that Gimlet does we don't do is they will make they make shows for  brands.  Right.  And that's got to be a much better revenue.

Start time: 7216.00
End time: 7229.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I would think that your brand stuff that you're doing there, you could.  Yeah, you could very easily convince a brand to give you a million dollars to create a  20 episode or 10 episode show.  Yeah, I could see that company.

And you know why it works is because a lot of people call back and then they get fed.  They don't want to have the RCMP or police coming after them.  And so they pay.  But everyone's doing that once for the amount of people that do it.  They're making enough money to keep these robocalls in action because they cost them almost nothing.

T-Mobile is going to turn on something they call Shaken and Stirred.  We talked about this earlier, which is a caller authentication system.  AT&T Verizon Sprint said they're going to do it too.  The FCC is endorsing.  This will limit caller ID spoofing.  So it will.  Everybody has to do it or it's not going to work.  But if it does it, then when you get a call with a caller ID, it will actually be the  number of the caller.  That would be nice.  FCC has done nothing about this.  They say they're doing stuff.

Anybody who watches Twit for any length of time knows I'm a complete LastPass advocate and fanatic.  I've been using LastPass for a decade, ever since it started.  You may remember, it was about five years ago now, we had Steve Gibson interviewed the creator of LastPass.  Joe Segrist showed him the code, explained how everything worked.  Steve Gibson, our security guru, said, this is awesome.  He started using it.  And then something happened.  One of our engineers posted all of this company's passwords, the database, the website, everything on a public website because he couldn't remember them.  And we said, you know, maybe we should use LastPass here.  We got LastPass Enterprise.  If you have a business, you know, breaches are the worst thing that can happen to your reputation, to your company, to your bottom line.  It's the worst.  But where's the weak spot?  Well, it's your employees and it's frankly, it's your passwords.  That's why we use LastPass Enterprise.  Reduce the threat of breach with organization wide password management.  A hundred policies that you can set for your employees.  For instance, we require two factor.  You can set master password requirements so it can't be monkey one, two, three.  You've got password resets.  You can restrict access of employee leaves.  They can share passwords.  And we know we know employees share passwords, not just with them, with other employees, but with other people outside the company.  They can share passwords, but they don't know the password.  So they just see dots.  So you can actually set it up so that they can log into the, you know, QuickBooks or the bank accounts or the databases.  But they don't even have access to the password.  We use shared folders, which is a nice feature of Enterprise that lets our ops team have all the passwords they need.  We don't have to individually share it.  Our business office has all the passwords they need.  It's more than passwords for me.  I put everything in LastPass database logins, SSH keys.  Yes, I put my SSH keys in there.  Software licenses, my driver's license, social security number and passport is in LastPass because I know I have it everywhere.  That's the beauty of LastPass.  On every device, every operating system, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS.  The first thing I do when I get a new phone, I put LastPass on there.  It helps me set up everything else.  In fact, now, thanks to iOS 12 and Android Pie, it's very easy because it just auto fills the password.  LastPass sits there.  And when you get to a site that needs a password or an app that needs a password, just fills it in.  And it uses Face ID or Touch ID.  So all the security is there.  LastPass's password generator makes it easy for people to generate real long, strong, random passwords.  You don't have to remember them.  You don't have to write them down.  It stores them for you.  It even has a security check to look for passwords, places where maybe you've used the same password more than once and helps you change those automatically.  It's just the best.  You've got to have LastPass.  True trust no one, zero knowledge security model.  The data in your vault is never decrypted anywhere except on device.  It's encrypted and decrypted at the device level.  LastPass doesn't have access to it.  No one does.  Just you.  If you're an Active Directory user, and I know a lot of people use Microsoft Active Directory, you can use your AD credentials to log in a single sign on.  Whether your team just needs to share passwords or you're worried about a data breach, LastPass scales to fit your business needs.  So if you're an individual, LastPass premium, great choice.  The family, we use LastPass for families because that allows me to share with Lisa very easily.  And they all use LastPass, even the kids.  LastPass for teams is for a smaller enterprise, 50 or fewer.  And of course, we use the big boy, LastPass Enterprise.  LastPass Enterprise.  It's the first app I install on any device.  It's the first app you should be using to protect yourself.  LastPass.com slash twit.  If you're not using it, you're nuts.  LastPass.com slash twits.  Streaming Observer.  Counted.  They say Amazon Prime has four and a half times as many movies as Netflix.  But look at that.  Seventeen thousand movies.  Netflix only three thousand eight hundred.  Hulu two thousand.  HBO no, eight hundred fifteen.  But if you look at fresh rotten tomatoes, Netflix certified fresh movies.  Five hundred ninety six compared to two hundred thirty two on Amazon.  Two hundred twenty three on Hulu and thirty eight on HBO.  Fifteen percent of all the Netflix content is certified fresh and rotten tomatoes.
