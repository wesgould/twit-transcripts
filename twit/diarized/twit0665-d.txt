Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't say I made money.  So I got signed to the Global Gaming League before it was I think what it is now or what it became now.  It was the very first iteration of GGL and I got signed for a one year contract to play Unreal Tournament.  I know that they were kind of looking for women gamers and it was me and another girl whose handle I think was Wabi Sabi.  I'm pretty sure that was her handle.

Start time: 200.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh I remember. She was great.

Start time: 200.98
End time: 228.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. She's great.  I love Wabi Sabi.  That stint in global gaming led to my very first job in games journalism because I was interviewed as a pro gamer for Play Magazine.  And they liked my answer so much that I was offered a job.  So they were like, do you want to just be an associate editor?  And I was like, yes, that sounds like the best thing ever.  So that's how I started in in games journalism, which is pretty cool.

Start time: 251.93
End time: 277.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was really weird.  It was like it was a tournament that happened right next to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.  And it was some sort of weekend festival.  And so they put on this exhibition match where a whole bunch of us were on stage.  There was like, I think, eight of us on stage.  And we we all played a couple of rounds of a death match for Unreal Tournament.  And so we're everybody's out there waiting for Jane's Addiction to come on.  And here comes these losers like playing on real tournament.

Start time: 278.50
End time: 284.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 285.96
End time: 292.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, everybody was very supportive.  And I will say I have to give credit to the people of Cleveland for not completely booing us off the stage.

Start time: 292.90
End time: 298.39

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he stalked me.  He basically stalked me all the way through Japan.  No, I really appreciate it.  Because he's a great photographer and I really appreciated your feedback.  And I noticed, though, you didn't say anything about this picture I brought back.  This is a literally a product in Japan, the Sharp EL428.  Right about the same time Ashley is playing video games for a living.  This came out.  It's an abacus and a calculator.  That thing is awesome.  Incredible.

Start time: 379.19
End time: 437.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Happy to be here.  Anything happened while I was gone?  I literally was not following the news at all.  I saw some dim things about Elon Musk insulting an analyst on a conference call.  I saw Apple.  I was actually watching with interest because the...  I have to say, I'm going to stop following the financial news.  Because there was...  Why?  For the last two or three weeks, people have been saying the iPhone X is a flop.  You're going to see the supply chains, analysts, everybody said the iPhone X, it's not selling.  And Apple comes out and said, yeah, actually it sold pretty well.  In fact, it was the number one smartphone in Q1 in the US.  And by the way, we made a little money.  Another record quarter for Apple.  Well, I'm starting to realize that when you read these stories about Apple not selling  iPhone X, it's probably short sellers, right?  Trying to depress the stock or something?

Start time: 439.60
End time: 483.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's one of the theories there, how much those things interfere.  And it's fascinating.  I end up transcribing these financial calls for iMore.  And so sitting through and hearing these things as I'm typing them out furiously and getting  those all put together, it's like, oh, you sort of have to do that.  It's like, oh, you sort of check off different boxes in your head.  Oh, yeah, we saw the story about how this was failing or this was failing.  And then Tim Cook just sort of quietly and very calmly reveals that the iPhone X sold  incredibly well and Apple's doing well here and here and here.  It's incredible how much there's differentiation, I think, between the financial area and then  sort of what Apple ends up announcing.

Start time: 484.18
End time: 491.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never liked Apple rumors, but that really can lead you astray if you start to, as we  did, I think, saying, oh, maybe the iPhone X is not a success.

Start time: 493.60
End time: 505.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it always the case, though, with the financial analysts, they seem to have broader  expectations regardless of the company, not just Apple, just most people in general?  Yeah.

Start time: 506.26
End time: 577.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Revenue up 14% year over year on the iPhone.  That's, I guess, a gain.  That sounds like a gain.  Device sales.  Now, part of the reason the revenue is up because it was a much more expensive phone.  Device sales were also up 3% year over year.  Quarterly down 38%, but you expect that.  This is the Q2 for Apple.  This is not their big selling quarter.  This is the quarter following the announcement of the phone.  Mac sales down, and some people attributed that to the really horrible keyboard choice  that Apple made on the MacBook Pros.  I would.  3% drop in Macs sold.  It may also be that people are waiting for the next Mac Pro or something like that.  What's really interesting is that services have now eclipsed iPad and Macintosh.  In fact, service revenue, $9.2 billion, was bigger than the two combined.  It is now Apple's number two revenue generator.  Micah, so that's apps in the App Store and Apple Music and iCloud.  Is that the three things that contribute to that?

Start time: 578.31
End time: 593.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I believe so.  Those are at least the ones that they certainly touch on, especially Apple Music,  sort of takes the front lead there, and they always talk about the App Store selling really well.  That's where they make the most.  I would imagine the bulk of the money.  I think Apple Pay falls in there too.  Apple Pay.

Start time: 593.96
End time: 616.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Micah, do you, I was going to say Micah, do you think Apple Pay is one of the things that is sort of a quiet Trojan horse of an earner?  Because it feels like more and more people are jumping on Apple Pay and then, you know, they get a,  I'm sure they get a small percentage of whatever gets charged from card companies.  So that's got to be over time.  I would imagine that's like a real nice chunk of change for them.  I can see that coming.

Start time: 617.19
End time: 657.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can see that coming.  I mean, you know, it's because it's not so user facing that it is sort of the secret thing because we sort of see Apple Pay as just this,  oh, I hold my phone up.  It does this thing.  Where does the money come from?  But yes, Apple is getting a little bit of a pull in that.  And we've got, especially in China, the transit systems are now getting involved with Apple Pay.  And I'm not sure if there's any financial gain in that.  But I mean, that's a huge thing.  So we continue to hear about them announcing, oh, you know, Apple Pay is available here.  It's available here.  It's available for these different things.  And I think we're going to continue to see that grow as a real earner for them in terms of services.

Start time: 658.56
End time: 667.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a that must be a huge win for them to own the I guess that's a touch touch to pay for the underground in China and things like that.  And buses and so forth.  That's got to be huge.

Start time: 669.25
End time: 681.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make it so easy.  Yeah.  I'll just say I always have my phone out for everything.  So it's like I mean, just in general, anything that's tapped to pay with my phone just makes life so much easier.  And it's like they get a cut of that every time.  That's crazy.

Start time: 682.04
End time: 704.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny in Japan.  I didn't see a lot of that.  They were still swiping cards in a lot of places.  But most places in Japan, it's cash.  Really?  That's interesting.  I know Japan is cash.  Little rules.  Yeah.  Japan is such an interesting country because it's both in the future and in the past at the simultaneously.  There's still a lot of cash going on.

Start time: 705.56
End time: 709.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It took a long time for them to adopt smartphones to write those a lot of flip phones there for a long time.

Start time: 710.12
End time: 716.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they had that eye that I pocket or whatever they called it.  That was really a full service.  It was a computer in a phone.

Start time: 717.06
End time: 721.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like it was and they loved it.  Yeah, that was a huge deal there.

Start time: 722.02
End time: 749.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I didn't see a lot of iPhones in Japan.  However, I see nothing but iPhones here in the United States.  Clearly, clearly a big success.  So much so that Apple has announced also that they're going to buy back $100 billion worth of their shares.  People were wondering what is Apple going to do with their giant cash trove?  $270 billion at last count.  And I think there is somebody sitting in a vault somewhere like Scrooge McDuck counting it.  It's a dragon.

Start time: 750.90
End time: 754.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an actual dragon.  Yeah, they bought an actual dragon and that guards the money.

Start time: 755.98
End time: 760.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That guards all the money.  Exactly.  It must be a rather large.  It's a hired smog.

Start time: 760.90
End time: 842.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, smog hoard.  They are going to spend some of it buying back stocks.  And that is actually good news for shareholders.  In fact, Warren Buffett seems thrilled.  Warren Buffett announced at their Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings that they're going to buy even more Apple.  They purchased 75 million shares of Apple during the first quarter.  So they obviously, the Oracle of Omaha is not yet convinced that Apple is done.  He sees a lot more growth.  He says the $100 billion, I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares.  I love the idea of having our 5% or whatever it is.  Oh, come on, Warren, you know exactly what it is.  5% or whatever it is.  Maybe growing to 6% or 7% without laying in a dime.  That's what buybacks do for current shareholders.  It's the reverse of dilution.  I guess concentration of the value.  So Berkshire Hathaway has $44 billion worth of Apple stock, 240 million shares.  And by the way, that was really good news for Apple.  Tim Cook, the stock price when Berkshire Hathaway announced that went up and Tim Cook said, I'm thrilled that Buffett is a major investor.  I'm thrilled.  I'm thrilled.  That's a huge stake.  Huge stake.

Start time: 842.98
End time: 851.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of amazing.  I also saw where Buffett said that he was wrong about Google and Amazon and he didn't invest in them.

Start time: 852.22
End time: 898.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A shareholder asked him, they have this annual meeting in Omaha and people come.  It's kind of a hoedown and very friendly.  A shareholder said, because Bill Gates is in the audience.  He's good friends with Warren Buffett.  He said, Warren, how come you buy all this Apple?  You've never bought Microsoft.  And Buffett said, well, I didn't buy in the beginning because I was stupid.  And I don't buy it now because I'm friends with Bill.  And I feel like that that might people might take it the wrong way, which I thought was of course, of course.  Yeah.  But he does say Google.  He didn't buy Google stock because or Amazon stock.  He's going to buy Amazon stock because Amazon is a miracle.  And I don't bet on miracles.  Wow.  Like Amazon success is, I guess, a one off like an amazing.  And it's true.  I mean, you look at it and you go, it's an anomaly.

Start time: 898.90
End time: 902.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, you can't knock him.  He usually knows what he's talking about.

Start time: 903.16
End time: 944.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, he didn't dis Amazon.  He just said it's not the kind of thing I invest in.  He did dis and so did his partner, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  Oh, yeah.  Saying it's like gold.  It isn't a producing investment.  He suggested producing investments, not investments that the price is determined by merely by what people are willing to pay for it, which I thought was interesting.  And he also said there are a lot of kind of shady characters involved in Bitcoin.  And I don't think they didn't like that.  I think his partner was even more dismissive of cryptocurrencies calling them.

Start time: 945.26

And our show today brought to you by women.  Hold on.  I have to I just have to say hello to Windows.  For those of you listening at home, I had to actually duck down behind my computer so that the camera could see me.  And I knew this show was going to be awesome.  Because I'm jet lagged.  Is that what you're saying?  I'm just a little teeny weeny bit.  I'm still on Tokyo time.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  I'm happy to say Quicken Loans now the number one lender in the nation.  And I have to say, I think we take a little bit of credit for that.  Quicken Loans has always been number one in your hearts.  Number one in customer satisfaction, according to J.D. Power, for the last eight years running.  That's in mortgage origination.  They're number one in customer satisfaction for mortgage servicing for the last four consecutive years.  I mean, these guys are winners.  And Quicken Loans ought to be a winner because I just think it's a great company.  They've completely renovated, revitalized the inner city in Detroit.  Dan Harmon and his team do a great job.  And I think that they looked at the mortgage approval process and said, this is a little antiquated.  This is straight out of Charles Dickens here.  We have to go to a bank, hat in hand and say, please, sir, I'd like some money to buy a home.  And they say, home?  Here's your application.  You got to go home and get all sorts of information.  For us, it meant not only that, filling out this long application, giving it to them.  But then they'd come back and said, we need this and that.  You got pay stubs from your last job?  Fax them to us.  And I not only had to find the pay stubs, I had to find a fax machine.  This is crazy.  Along comes Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, a completely online mortgage approval process that takes around, well, maybe even less, 10 minutes.  Ten minutes.  You could do it in an open house.  No more paperwork.  No more even going to the bank.  You don't have to get up from the couch.  Just go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit to answer some simple questions.

So let me see if I can find the videos for Steve Jobs.  It was on this day 20 years ago.  It's kind of hard to believe that Steve Jobs introduced the Mac and I Mac.  Now you got to remember Apple at this time.  Steve had been back about a year.  Apple fired Steve, right?  So that's the first thing is he was unceremoniously, you know, shown the door by John Scully.  He did a few things quite well subsequently, including buying Pixar for pennies on the dollar.  Let me let me find this part of the intro.  But the very famously the thing that he did is he went in, sat down with the Apple team and said we have too many products.  Remember, this was an Apple was doing clones.  They had let other people make Macintosh.  They had way too many confusing brands.  He drew a plus sign on the whiteboard and said we're going to make four products.  Consumer professional desktop portable.  That's it.  They of course, the Macintosh was a desktop.  The power book was the laptop for pros.  And then he decided we're going to update the consumer desktop with something that at the time was quite revolutionary.  And this is the I Mac.

Transcript:  By the way, we should mention that that this introduction, this product intro was almost killed, according to Walter Isaacson in the jobs biography, because when Steve first saw this the day before, he said, what?  That's supposed to be a slot for the CD-ROM.  What's this button?  What's this drawer?  John Rubinstein said, well, Steve, you approved that.  He said, no, I want a slot.  And he almost killed almost killed it.  And the team was able to get the I Mac introduced by saying, well, the next one will have a slot.  Is that OK, Steve?  So I guess so he's looking at that slot right now in this speech and going, but he but he but he gritted his teeth and they released it with stereo headphone jacks.  By the way, that's weird, but it has two headphone jacks in front.  Not sure why.  And then get ready for this coolest mouse on the planet.

He was so proud of the I Mac jobs showed him the I Mac and Markkula was impressed.  And then jobs showed him this.  The Apple I Mac and Markkula said, that's terrible.  Nobody's going to want that.  And Steve said, no, it's the best mouse we've ever made.  The worst mouse ever made.  And Apple really hasn't improved much on it.  I'm sorry to say I still use Microsoft mice on my Macintoshes.  But wasn't that the worst mouse?  It didn't fit your hand.  It was too.  If you hold it in your palm, your finger was going off the edge.  You couldn't.

Transcript:  I was doing a dramatic reading from Walter Isaacson's book in which it turned out that the ads that  Cheyenne Day had taken out the magazine ads for this new.  And by the way, let's not forget how awful PCs looked in 1998.  I mean, this really was a revolution.  Yeah, this was a revolution.  But Steve was very particular about the color blue, this translucent blue.  And he said, the magazine ads not the same blue.  And Clow from Cheyenne Day said, no, it's the same blue.  No, it's not the same effing blue.  And he's yelling and screaming at the guy.  And finally, Clow gets him to go look at the pictures and actually hold them up next.  And it's the same blue.  It's the same.  Anyway, more.  Let's show some more, Steve.  This is pre-Turtle Neck, Steve.  A year later when he introduced the iMac MacBook, he's wearing a black turtleneck and a little bit of a beard.  But in this one he's wearing a white shirt with no tie.

Transcript:  It's not bad.  I'm really enjoying it.  And I like the glow that's coming from behind.  Almost like a Bondi blue iMac.  Lit from behind.  Makes you just want to reach out and punch me.  Right in the face.  Interesting.  Let's take a break and then we'll talk about Cambridge Analytica.  Because GDPR,  the European Data Protection Regulation,  goes into effect  now in just a couple of weeks.  And already we're starting to see some side effects.  Including a lawsuit  in England by a US...  I don't want to say customer of Cambridge Analytica.  Victim, maybe a better word.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Our show today  brought to you by FreshBooks.  If you're a freelancer,  I know we've all done it.  We've all been there.  Where you have to send out invoices at the end of the month.  It's the worst.  It's wonderful to have your own business.  The worst part of having your own business  is having to send out invoices.  I hate it at the end of every month.  Thank goodness in 2004  I discovered FreshBooks.  The ridiculously easy to use  cloud accounting system.  FreshBooks is more now than just getting fancy invoices done.  Although it does make it really easy.  It also makes it easy to get paid faster.  Because as soon as you're using FreshBooks  you're able to take credit cards  as payments on those invoices.  And you know what? Your clients love that.  They're going to get the credit card points.  And you love it because you're going to get paid  on average  twice as fast.  Because it's easy for clients to pay you.  FreshBooks does more than that.  It's not just invoices.  By doing the invoices  with FreshBooks, the expenses,  because yes, the FreshBooks app, you take a picture of a receipt.  It goes right in the invoice.  So it's easy to bill for expenses.  It also keeps track of hours.  So if you bill for a time,  it does that as well.  But in the process of doing that,  you're also effectively, without even knowing it,  doing accounting.  So you'll know in the FreshBooks dashboard  exactly how much money you've made at any time.  Your total profit. You can see what your spending is.  Your outstanding balances.  You can see which invoices haven't been paid yet.  You can even automatically  set out reminders.  Create proposals.  They are always adding features. So they've now got proposals.  Rich text content, images,  customizable sections.  And request your client's e-signature as they accept proposals.  So it's really extending its capability even more.  There's great FreshBooks app for iOS and Android.  They automatically connect to your bank account  and update expenses daily.  You can use CSV file import  for importing in bulk or take a picture of a receipt  and upload it.  Let FreshBooks automatically do the rest.  You can manage team member rates.  You may get paid one rate, but your team members  may be getting paid another rate.  You can manage that from the My Team page.  Add team members in different roles.  So they have different permissions.  You can also track income that doesn't come from invoices.  Online sales and ads can be tracked  by logging them as other income.  So really, you get all the accounting you need done  simply without really doing any accounting.  I love FreshBooks.  10 million people,  since I started using it in 2004 now,  10 million people use FreshBooks.  To painlessly send invoices, track time,  capture expenses, and get back to doing what you love.  Here's the deal.  Try it free for 30 days.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  Try it free for 30 days.  And if you do me a favor when there's a little  form that says, how'd you hear about us?  Just put this week in tech in there if you would.  The guy in the tie.  The guy in the tie.  The guy in the tie.  The guy in the tie.  The guy in the tie.  FreshBooks.com  FreshBooks.com  It's very Hunger Games.  I like it. I think that it's  gone out though. The light has gone out.  Oh, I know why.  I put the adhesive on the light.  UK regulator  orders Cambridge Analytica  to release data on US  voters.  This is a very  interesting, almost a test case.  David Carroll is an associate professor at Parsons  in New York.  He actually tried  to get Cambridge  Analytica to tell him  what it knew about him.  Cambridge Analytica  refused  and told the  UK ICO,  Carroll was no more entitled to make a so-called  subject access request  under the UK Data Protection Act  than a member of the Taliban  sitting in a cave in the  remotest corner of Afghanistan.  Come on, there's no need to take that tone.  The ICO, however,  on Friday,  this is the UK  Information Commissioner's Office, this is part of GDPR,  told Cambridge Analytica  in a landmark decision  that you need to  tell David Carroll everything you know  about him, the information  you got  from Facebook, and failure to comply  is a criminal offense.  So Carroll was doing this  almost as a test case.  He wanted an opinion.  Now anybody in the United States who wants to know  what did Cambridge Analytica know about you  as an American voter, and  where did it get the data, and  what did it do with it, who did it sell it to?  Just go to the UK  Data ICO, and  thanks to the UK Data Protection Act,  you can get that information.  That is a very big deal.  Yeah.  And we're going to, you know,  unroll me, remember those fine fellas?  The email service,  I actually used it for years,  not knowing that  this was the idea,  they would unsubscribe you from  newsletters you'd subscribe to,  and then automatically send you  a summary if you wanted.  Turned out, they didn't really care about that.  They were just mining your Gmail  and selling the information to companies like Uber.  Well, thanks to the  new GDPR,  they're closing their doors in EU.  They say, you can't use us because we can't comply.  Wow.  Can't or won't is unclear.  Ech.

Transcript:  Yeah. That's an interesting  point. The ICO said, no,  just because you live in the US,  it doesn't mean you're off the hook.  You have 30 days to comply  or appeal.  Interesting. Carol had applied  to Cambridge Analytica  previously  and got stuff that was basically  useless.  He said  Cambridge Analytica sent him a profile  they'd created about him, but no information about how  they created it. They had given me scores  for different issues, but I had no idea what they  based this on, so he decided to go to the British  courts.  I mean,

Start time: 2860.61
End time: 2985.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do you feel like a little  grateful that  the EU and the British courts have laws  in place? These data protection laws?  Why so frustrating  that we don't?  We talk about this all the  time on Twitter. Whenever I  come on the show, there's always some privacy  story that we talk about, some  data breach, something like that.  When will  lawmakers  finally  stand up for consumers as opposed  to these companies?  I feel like they just won't.  It's up to,  I don't know, coders, developers.  I find it really interesting  that I read this  tweet storm, and you might  have seen it. It was a while back right when the Cambridge  Analytica stuff broke,  which was, and I  apologize, I wish I remembered the name of the  person who wrote this tweet storm. It was  so good. He talked about how  different verticals in  physics and chemistry have had their reckoning  with ethics, with ethical  quandaries where  physics had the bomb,  and chemistry had dynamite  and also chemical warfare.  These are things that  chemists and physicists have  to think about when they get into these fields,  when they're developing things. They have to think  what is the worst  possible way this could be used against  people? That has never actually  happened in the computer science  industry. That has never been  a consideration until now.  So, will  it be that in the future,  and this person who wrote the thread  said, I hope in the future and going forward,  younger developers will keep these  things in mind and actually design  products with  nefarious intent in mind.  What is the worst possible use of  this product? Because there's so much  kind of starry-eyed idealism  in Silicon Valley that  it's easy,  a lot of times, for them to overlook  the bad uses  of their products.

Like I said, I apologize  to the person who wrote it because you were absolutely  fantastic, and I retweeted it all over  the place for a while  there. It was a really good  kind of indicator as to  where we are right now  with technology, and will we  ever see this sort of moral  reckoning happen in that  industry? I feel like it needs  to.

Start time: 3015.94
End time: 3079.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You asked that question.  It seems like we're living through that.  It seems like we're living through that right now.  I'm sure there were probably people  when we were going through  things like, okay,  the nuclear bomb exists.  What are we going to do about that?  Hopefully, this is the period of time where we're doing that.  I think  one thing that has  been good,  well, there are many things that have been good about this  GDPR thing happening, but one thing that's  made me happy about it is  it seems like companies  are maybe too lazy  or too concerned about  potential blowbacks  to not just go ahead  and roll out these GDPR protections  across their entire  board. Those of us in the United States  thank God  that we're also getting included in  many of these things, and we get the benefit  of that. If our own  lawmakers aren't going to fix it,  I'm glad there's someone out there who  is and that we get to reap the rewards  of that.  But also, how do we

Start time: 3079.92
End time: 3098.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  insist to these companies that  they adopt those  policies without  laws having to be passed?  How come we cannot, as consumers,  demand that these companies  hold themselves to those stricter standards  for consumers because  we are their product in a lot of the  cases?

Start time: 3100.63
End time: 3147.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, though I remember when GDPR  happened, and of course before that, the right to be  forgotten, a lot of us were concerned  that it might break the internet.  That some of these technical  requirements that the EU is putting  on companies like Google would be  impossible to implement without kind of  fragmenting. Don't you worry  that at the internet it might be fragmented?  By the way, I'm a little bit playing  devil's advocate because I am kind of grateful  that we have some privacy regulations.  At the same time,  is it possible  that just the nature of the internet  and attention-based economies  means that it's a pipe  dream that privacy is just  we're not going to be able to do. And by the way, it's hard to believe  that you're listening to a guy who's wearing  a blinged  necktie.  Well, Ant was just

Start time: 3151.90
End time: 3175.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it, and I hate saying it this way, but  I think of something like Mr.  Robot and Daniel Suarez's  demon where  the right people have to get affected  before something is going to happen.  Some big  wig is going to have to have  his or her data breached  and then they're going to be up  in arms and be like, why did this happen?  But on that note,

Start time: 3191.92
End time: 3243.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they did. And you're right. If it had been  a congressman's credit card that had been breached  thanks to Equifax breach, we might  hear about loss. But I have  to say, I don't have any confidence that  U.S. Congress can do anything  effective to regulate technology.  And I still think the jury's  still out on GDPR and what  havoc that might wreak.  See, this is the problem.  And here I am channeling Jeff Jarvis now.  But this is the problem is the internet  does bring us such  incredible benefits.  There is absolutely a cost.  And I don't know if it's  possible to separate the two. I don't know  if it's possible to  create an internet  where, you know,  the privacy that you're looking for  can be enforced.  Certainly not by governments. I think I like  your idea, Ashley, that maybe these companies  need to do it themselves.

Start time: 3244.10
End time: 3313.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that  privacy, as we used to know it,  is not a thing that we can expect  going forward. I understand  that there are tradeoffs I make every day  when I use my Amazon  assistant, when I use  Gmail. Yeah, I wonder if it's even possible to be private.  I know that there are  very specific tradeoffs for that.  Like, I get that. And I think going forward  the next generation of  coders, users, like,  will have and sort of  they'll be raised in it. And so they  will not think twice about, oh, well,  this is a thing where you give up, like, information  that you don't feel is important to you. But  I just, I really  wish that this, we lived in  a more opt-in  society  online as opposed to an opt-out.  So I wish that they would have  more stringent  rules. And, you know, like Facebook  is a really good example of that. You know, when you  start your account up, it's  all opt-in. You have to opt-in to all of  the privacy stuff. It's not by default.  Like, this is the type of stuff that is  not difficult to implement.  Make it easier for people to  keep their privacy intact if  they would like to. Then also

Start time: 3314.06
End time: 3330.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  allow them to opt out. Let's look at Facebook  because Facebook pays for  itself  by collecting  this information and selling it to advertisers.  I mean, the other choice  would be to have a paid Facebook. Is that going to happen?  I don't think so.

Start time: 3331.90
End time: 3337.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would pay for a Facebook, much like I pay for  my iPhone because it's encrypted.  My iMessages are encrypted.

Transcript:  Yeah, but you're getting hardware with an iPhone.  I appreciate that, but

Start time: 3342.26
End time: 3363.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd be willing to pay a monthly subscription  if I knew my data wasn't going to be  sold. Like, I am okay with that.  But then you run into issues with  socioeconomic levels of people  not being able to enjoy a service.  Do you say that poor people  have to give up their data to be able to enjoy  a service equally as somebody with money?  Then it's not equal.  It becomes an unequal situation.

Start time: 3363.90
End time: 3378.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I was going to say. Because there's so many people out there  using Facebook that  it's their internet  basically and they can't really  afford much else.  I can't see them paying  ten dollars a month for privacy.  No.

Start time: 3379.92
End time: 3447.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a week of groceries for some people.  That's right. Congress asked that.  When he was asked this question, he said  and this is perhaps a paraphrase,  but it's pretty close. There will always  be a version of Facebook that is  free. And to me, that  says that they have at least  considered making a version of Facebook  that does cost.  If there will always be a version of  Facebook that is free, that is a version of Facebook.  So I could see  this option.  Certainly,  the fact that people do use  Facebook as the internet,  that is a very real thing  that we have to keep in mind.  But at the same time, this still is  a company that has been  invented and brought to life  and that people have flocked to.  And so it makes  sense that we would give people  the different options that they want  to have available. And if you cannot  go with those options, then there  are others available to you that include  the possibility  that advertisers  can pay to market to you.  Because that's one of the things  I think is important to note.

Start time: 3447.90
End time: 3501.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do you feel like that is disadvantageous  to people in lower socioeconomic  status? I mean, the thing is,  a family of  four who makes $35,000  a year somewhere,  that can't afford for all of  them to have privacy locked  Facebook pages, still need  to use that service to do things like buy  and sell in the marketplace. I have neighbors  who constantly are selling things like  kids' clothes and furniture  and things like that to make a couple extra bucks.  They're not particularly well-off.  And to ask those people  to give up their privacy  because, oh, sorry, you can't afford it.  It's just  a really hard problem. And to  me, the answer is to force  Facebook to, again, make things  opt out as opposed to  opt in. When you  log into these services,  by default, you should be much  more protected than you are right

Start time: 3502.04
End time: 3587.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  now. Yeah, I think  that's completely fair. And I think that you're  right about that. That, you know,  if we're going to go with  this version that always remains free,  then it makes sense that, yes,  you sort of, okay, yes, I do want to turn  on facial tracking because I like it  whenever I know that someone has posted  a photo of me online. Or I want to try.  As opposed to the other way around. Yeah, or yeah,  give it a try. And the fact that I can go on  and delete anything that I want to,  that's what's most important  to me. And I want to give an example.  I had talked about this earlier in the week  on different podcasts, but  there's a Walmart that's  nearby, and they just upgraded  a bunch of their self-serve  kiosks where you can sort of go through and  get your groceries and you don't have to...  There's no one there. You just swipe  it through and then pay and everything.  Well, they upgraded these kiosks to  include a webcam that's  built into the monitor that's looking  at me. And I've gone there  a couple times now going, what?  There's no... It doesn't tell you what it's being  used for. It doesn't tell you where  those videos are being sent. It doesn't tell  you what's being done to those videos. It doesn't tell you  how they're being protected, how long they stay in the  system. It's genuinely  like... There's a part of me that wants to  track down whoever I need to talk to and figure  that out because are they doing  emotional tracking on me?  Are they trying to tie my face to my  credit card number and then be able to market  to me better? I mean, these are things that we have  to think about going forward. Are they building a shopping profile

Start time: 3588.16
End time: 3643.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for you and then selling it to advertisers?  I'm sure they are. Yeah.  That's the nasty thing. Are they looking for certain people who they  believe might have shoplifted previously  in the store? Are they looking for...  I mean, there's a million questions and I think  this is where it comes back to like  transparency is such a problem.  We have such a problem in this industry with  transparency. These companies just don't want  to tell people in plain  English, like yes, read your terms  of service, your EULAs and everything,  but at the end of the day, nobody's reading those  and it should just be  a very plain and simple like, this is what  we use your stuff for. We sell it.  This is how we do business.  I believe that if they are honest about that and upfront about it,  as opposed to trying to like,  oh, it's an uncomfortable conversation that we don't want to have  with our users because they don't like being spied on.  I hate that. It's just be upfront about what you're doing.  You know?

I mean, I've given up Facebook, but Ashley, you said that might be difficult.  It would be a lot harder for me to give up Google  and there's hundreds of other companies that I don't even...  I'm not even on my radar that are collecting information.  Frankly, these days, every time I install an app,  I figure that company is, besides giving me what the app's giving me,  is selling information about me, including location information,  to the highest bidder.

Somebody, a family member of mine was like,  I just don't understand how we're ever going to get away from...  Recognize it like being fooled by it, right?  So, and I said, I feel like, and I have to trust people enough to know that  going forward, much like Nigerian Prince email scams and IRS phone call scams,  we will, as a society or as a global society,  we will get better at recognizing these things, at combating these things,  but it will just take time.

Part of the deal in ad-supported is that we tell the advertisers this information,  and they gave you a list of whatever it is that they're going to sell of yours,  and maybe you could turn some stuff off.  Your age, your demographic, your sex.  Which you can do now on Facebook with apps.  And then you said, but I agree to this, and this is the deal I'm making.  If it were all explicit, you wouldn't be against that, right?

I mean, but my problem is when we're having our data,  and Cambridge Analytica is sort of its own thing because it was inappropriately acquired data,  and that's a whole basket of monkeys that I don't even, that's crazy.  But generally, if you're playing by the rules, if these companies play by the rules,  then you should be able to, as a company, tell people exactly what you're using their data for.  And say, look, this is how we make our money.  Like we sell your information to third party services in order to turn a profit.  And that's why we can offer you this for free.  And here are the companies that we sell our data to.  And here's how you can get a copy of the data.  You'd feel okay with all of that, right?

Then our old friends from middle school, our mom, our ex, and our boss  joined forces to wish us happy birthday.  And we discovered our uncle used to play in a band  and realized he was young once too.  And we found others just like us.  And just like that, we felt a little less alone.  But then something happened.  We had to deal with spam, clickbait, fake news, and data misuse.  That's going to change.  From now on, Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your privacy  so we can all get back to what made Facebook good in the first place.  Friends.  Because when this place does what it was built for,  then we all get a little closer.

Transcript:  A societal thing that we need to really work on.  Much like what we were talking about before the show, right?  And Micah and Ant, we were all talking about trolls, right?  So like this sort of societal kind of understanding that like that's dishonorable.  It's shameful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what I was talking about is in Japan,  which is a very, very orderly country,  and there are a number of reasons for this,  not the least of which is it's a completely uniform company, a country.  There are no black people.  There's no Hispanics.  It's just they're all ethnic Japanese from almost for entirely.  But there's also this very strong social pressure to conform.  And as a result, there's no littering.  I didn't see any graffiti.  They have crime, but it's pretty much organized crime.  There's no kind of general low petty crime, as far as I could tell.  And it seems to me, now somebody's going to tell me you're completely wrong,  but it seemed to me that that was really a result of a strong societal pressure  that people cared about what other people thought of them.  And they didn't want to be, you know, you don't speak loudly in the train.  And they enforce that because somebody looks at you and you go and you just shut up.  And that works to me.  And Jeff Jarvis has always said this, that that's what we need.  We need norms to protect us from the worst of the Internet, not laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think there is something to be said for obviously,  we are a very different culture than Japan and for better or for worse.  And, you know, some of that is for the better.  You know, we are here in the U.S.  We're excellent salespeople like kids are taught from a very young age to present themselves, ideas, homework, projects.  I mean, it's just a constant thing.  And that's something that I know a lot of other cultures look at.  And they say, you know, like we talked about Steve Jobs being a great salesperson.  This is like a big thing.  And other cultures, they look to, you know, a lot of Western countries or presentation sales abilities to like kind of put yourself out there.  But on that same note, it's like it's so hard because it's like we're never going to be that culture.  So we have to find a way to do that sort of for ourselves.

Transcript:  Hey, by the way, you were talking and actually this resonated with me about how maybe if technologists thought about the impact of the technologies they created, I would love to see that.  I think we as geeks need to create a societal norm that if you're going to be a programmer, an engineer, a designer, you need to think about how a product will be used or misused.  And one of the things that came home to me, one of the two of the places we visit in Japan were Nagasaki and Hiroshima, of course, Nagasaki, as they put it, the last city that hit by an atomic bomb.  Let's hope it stays that way.  Hiroshima, the first.  And there's very much that sense of technologists need to consider what they're building.  I mean, and at the same time, Robert Oppenheimer and all the people worked on the Manhattan Project, including, by the way, my maternal grandfather, worked on it because they wanted to save the world.  They want to make the world a better place.  They wanted to stop the Nazis.  And they knew if they didn't do it, the Nazis would, et cetera, et cetera.  And there's even a very cogent argument, I'm not sure I agree with it, about why they had to drop an atomic bomb on a city and destroy it, two cities and destroy them.  I met a guy who we met a guy who was a survivor of Hiroshima.  He was 13 working in the Mitsubishi arms plant.  And he was there at the Hiroshima Memorial.  And he just wanted to meet Americans and thank them.  Talk about a gracious person.  Thank them.  He survived it.  He said everybody, you know, it was me and one other guy survived.  The rest of them were died.  He was he's in his 80s now, of course.  And he said, but we were starving and we and the Americans came and they brought us food and they and and you know, it's true that MacArthur kind of remade that country.  Wow.  So it's complicated.  And I think it's complicated to have a moral compass that says this is going to be okay.  And this is not going to be okay.  It's very difficult.  I'm sure Ashley.

Start time: 4388.00
End time: 4470.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's really you.  You mentioned how there are some people who make the argument that that a city needed to be destroyed or a place needed to be in order to save lives.  And, you know, I think that we've sort of brought that up in a very different way, of course, because having a congressman's credit card revealed is not the same thing as dropping an atomic bomb.  But in the sense that it does seem like any of these sort of big these these things that we maybe don't don't do enough thinking about, we do have to have these atomic bomb style realizations that take place, these rock bottom moments in order for these things to to actually happen for the changes to take place.  They need to take place.  And so I don't I don't know if we've gotten there yet.  I think Facebook feels like it has maybe while they're going through this whole Cambridge Analytica thing.  And I am interested to see how Facebook continues to hopefully hold to the promises that it is made thus far and how that might affect other companies that are, you know, Twitter, Google, et cetera.  So we've got GDPR and then this whole Facebook saga all happening at once.  And maybe we're sort of moving through that period right now where we're going to see the changes take place.

Start time: 4470.92
End time: 4536.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's an excellent point, Micah, because you can argue about the merits of, say, dropping an atomic bomb endlessly.  The point at this point, having had it happened is what lesson can we learn from it?  And where do we do going forward?  You could argue about Facebook's privacy invasions in Cambridge Analytica and et cetera, et cetera.  That's done. That's water under the bridge.  What lessons do we learn and what can we do going forward to make it right?  I think that's a very good, very good attitude.  And actually, it is, interestingly, the attitude of the residents, the current residents of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  That's really their focus is not ascribing blame or guilt on either side because there's plenty on both sides.  But but really saying let's not have her happen, have this happen again and turn our backs on the residents and so forth.  Yeah, isn't that that's a that's a big thing to say.  Yeah. Let's take a little bit of a break.  We got more coming up with a great panel.  Ashley, you're doing a podcast.  What is it called? Streaming? Tell me.  Tell me about this new thing.

And so, yeah, we treated it a little bit like a finance show, but it's for your fan investments across pop culture.  And it's really fun.  The very first episode, I took a pie to the face.  OK. Only right.  It's only only right.  And then this last episode, we snuck around at Disneyland and I tried to get into Galaxy's Edge, which I did not do.  But it was really fun.

Let me tell you, coming home last night, knowing my Casper awaits didn't take me long to fall asleep,  but it probably wouldn't.  I could have been sleeping on a rock.  It wouldn't have taken me long to fall asleep.  But it was so nice after when you travel and you sleep on a lot of different mattresses to get back to the Casper.  The Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses.  I don't even care that they're a fraction of the costs, but they are.  They're revolutionizing the mattress industry and they know how they get the cost down, not by making a cheaper mattress.  No, it's a premium mattress.  It's a fantastic mattress by eliminating the middleman.  No more resellers, no more showrooms.  You save great prices on amazing mattresses.  The original Casper, and that's the one we've got, it combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface that has what Lisa says is soft and hard.  Just the right sink so you get on it and you feel like, oh, I'm sinking into a cloud.  And then it's firm.  Just the right bounce.  It's hard to describe until you try it and it's breathable.  So you're never hot.  You sleep cool and it helps you regulate your temperature through the night.  These are things you need.  Something that gives where it's supposed to and holds you where it's supposed to and keeps you cool.  And by the way, you can buy it online easily and completely risk free because Casper knows without a showroom, you're going to say, well, how do I know which Casper to get?  How do I know if I'm going to like it?  Well, you have 100 days to try it out.  Or should I say 100 nights?  Free delivery, painless returns within 100 day period.  If you don't like your Casper for any reason the first 100 days, you call them.  They'll come and get it and refund you every penny.  Casper mattresses, of course, uphold the highest environmental production standards.  Actually, that's one thing I know about Casper because other mattresses have had to air out for days or weeks before I even wanted to sleep on them.  They smelled funny.  The Casper comes out of the box fresh as a daisy.  So I know they're doing something right.  They're made in the USA, but you get free shipping and returns in the US, Canada and the UK.  Get that Casper today.  I'm telling you, it makes coming home as hard as it is coming back from vacation, it makes it OK.  Because I know my Casper awaits.  Get $50 towards select mattresses right now.  If you go to Casper.com slash twit and use the promo code twit at checkout.  That's Casper.com slash twit promo code twit to say $50 on select mattresses, terms and conditions apply.  Casper.

And by the way, Alex Lindsay on Tuesday complained about the NPR app.  On Wednesday NPR bought Pocket Casts.  Which kind of surprised me.  That's the number two app people listen to Twitter with, by the way.  It's very big.  He uses Pocket Casts.  I love it.  I love it.  iOS, Android.  Shifty Jelly out of Australia does it.  Everybody uses it.  Well, I guess NPR realized that.  It makes me a little nervous.  As always, the Shifty Jelly folks during an acquisition, people always say, oh, nothing's going to change.  We're going to keep the same app.  But you've got to think that there's a reason.  It was purchased actually not just by NPR, but by kind of a coalition of NPR, WNYC, WBEZ, Chicago and This American Life.  And I guess the question I'm going to, you know, it's great if there's, you know, they just put money into it and make it better and better.  But you got to think it's going to become an NPR app, not a general podcast app, or at least favor NPR.

I think he did a really good job of sort of mixing humor and hopefully, you know, getting people a little chill about everything as it all as we figure it all out.  And, you know, it's my understanding that they are being as true as they possibly can be to what that FAQ says, which is that things are not changing as they are.  And of course, over time, there will come changes.  But it's important for them to sort of hold on to that base and that this is more of an opportunity to, you know, we're seeing continuing to see sort of the podcast industry as it continues to kind of leech into these other sort of things.  And I think that sort of startupy and big money opportunities, we're seeing kind of the base fall away, which is networks like Twitter and smaller networks like Relay FM.  And these people who are genuinely at the forefront of podcasting who are, you know, down in the down in the trenches doing it themselves.  And that openness, that open nature that anyone can go online and start a podcast at any time I know is very, very, very important to Russell and the rest of the team.  And that is something that NPR I think sees is like, let's keep this an open field and not have these sort of siloed off places where you have like ads automatically filtered in and all the other stuff that can come with some of these different big companies kind of trying to take over the podcast industry.

Transcript:  And I agree with Russell and Philip and Chris and the team.  But with all due respect, they're not going to have a choice.  The company's been purchased.  So I understand their honorable intentions, but I can guarantee you NPR did not buy Pocket Cast to leave it exactly as it makes no sense at all.  Right.  And of course they're going to start putting stuff in there.  I don't know what. That's the question.  You know, the good news is just as podcast are open, so are apps.  And if I were somebody like Marco Arman who makes Overcast, I would just say, well, here's an opportunity.  I think we need independent.  I think here's what I think is happening because iTunes, Apple did this thing with iTunes now where they offer metrics to podcasters because really what's really happening, in my opinion, is and I know a little bit about this, is that advertisers want to know more about you.  Oh, surprise, surprise. What's the biggest threat to podcasting?  Google and Facebook, because they sell your information to these companies.  We don't. We don't know anything about you.  We don't want to know anything about you.  We do a niche podcast.  And the point of it is we can say, well, anybody would listen to any of our shows or tech enthusiasts.  So that's what you're buying.  And that's all we tell them.  We do a survey, voluntary survey once a year that gives us some more information.  But it's but it's voluntary.  It's self selecting.  We don't consider it statistically important and we don't collect information in any other way.  But but advertisers want that.  And so Apple with iTunes is now doing that.  And if you use the good news is nobody uses iTunes to listen.  But what I think advertisers would love and I know NPR would love is an app that reports back on you that tells them what you're doing, what you're listening to, how often, how long, what you subscribe to, where you are when you subscribe and more and more.  And so, you know, I'm sure Russell does not like this idea, but I also know that Russell got a check and that NPR now owns it.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I do.  And I think they've done a great job.  I love Pocket Casts.  And as long as it continues to remain Pocket Casts, I'll continue to use it.  It is my also my choice for a podcast player.  But the minute advertisers start using it or broadcasters start using it, because I know I'll get an email in six months or a year saying, hey, would you like to buy the would you you know, would you like to use pocket?  We want you encourage you to tell all your listeners use Pocket Casts.  And by the way, we'll share those insights back with you just as Apple has done.  Of course.  So and what I would urge people to do is to continue to use podcast apps that don't spy on you.  And as long as Pocket Casts is one of them, it's a good one to keep using.  I love it.  I think it's a great app.  And I'm glad that they did well.  Philip and Russell deserve success.

Transcript:  Hey, speak.  We were talking about Apple supply chain analysts.  This wasn't, I didn't notice this, but Mi Chin Kuo has left.  Ming Chi Kuo is the Securities Analyst, KGI Securities, who seems to have the inside track  on Apple stuff.  He's left.  He is no longer KGI.  Left on Friday, according to the China Times.  So I don't know what he's going to do.  Mark Gurman, who knows everything, says he's reportedly moving on to cover innovative non-Apple  companies.  I'm sure there's a party going on in Apple.  Apple, of course, remember a couple of weeks before I left, released a memo to its staff  saying, don't leak.  The memo was immediately leaked to Mark Gurman.  And I think now I'm of the opinion it was leaked to Mark Gurman by Apple because it  turns out that all of the incidents of leaks mentioned in the memo were leaks to Mark Gurman.  Oh, interesting.  It was, I think now reading between the lines, you know, they said employees have been fired  for doing this, this and that.  Yeah, fired for leaking that information to Mark Gurman.  I think they leaked the memo to Mark Gurman to say, you see what happens?  You see what happens when you get calls.  Don't look what you do.  The irony.  Yeah, the irony of it.  Anyway, I'm sure Apple's happy about that.  Speaking of leaks, you know, Apple's WWDC is coming up.  I think a lot of people are waiting to buy Mac stuff, hoping that Apple will announce  especially new Macbooks in June, according to...  People really hate that keyboard, man.

So talking about Apple and acquisitions, Apple of course bought Texture, which is a sponsor.  Well, they were.  I think we just got a message that they don't want to buy anymore ads.  What a surprise.  The rumor was they were going to fold Texture into their news app and maybe this is starting to happen.  They just shut down Texture's Windows app.  Still on iOS, still available for your iPad, but not for Windows.  The Android app, the Amazon Fire app, and the iOS apps will still be supported.  But you have to think Apple is basically going to fade that out and do something else.

Transcript:  You know what?  I use Texture.  Texture, we should tell people who haven't seen our million ads for them, is kind of like Netflix for magazines.  You pay 10 bucks a month, you get 200 magazines.  It was created by the magazines, Condi, Nast, and Hearst, and I think Meredith,  because it was a great way for them to distribute magazines digitally.  They were all in on it.  But Apple bought them recently, we think for around $100 million.  I'm not sure exactly what Apple gets.  I don't think it's the app they're looking for, but it ran great on the Fire.  It made Fire a really useful little magazine reading tool.  So I don't know.  I think, I seem to remember, I probably shouldn't say anything, but I think that they said,  yeah, we're done with advertisements.  I think they said that, but I'm not sure.  If you hear another Texture ad, then I'm wrong.  And that's good news.  That's good news.  You're doing something right.  You still hear another ad.  Well, I don't know, but I really think that the Texture, they always said,  oh man, we get a lot of subscriptions from Twitter listeners.  I think we were very helpful for them, as we are for all of our advertisers.  There you go.  Google I.O. is this week.  Any expectations?  Anybody excited about, will they announce a new phone?  I don't think so.  Maybe a Chromebook?  I don't know.  We'll hear more about Android P, of course, the next version of Android.  That's what Jason Howell was talking about on All About Android.

Transcript:  I've come to a somewhat skeptical point of view, which everybody I know tries to talk me out of,  that there is no such thing as artificial intelligence.  That everything we've seen to this date is exactly the same as every computer program you ever used before.  It's merely somebody writing down what to do when.  And that's all this is.  They're trying to make out like Echo is some sort of magical assistant, but it isn't.  It's just a bunch of stuff.  They're doing all the legwork.  It's pre-programmed.  You'd be better off just putting it on a piece of paper.

Log into your Twitter account and you'll get a little warning or maybe you'll see it on  your email saying, oops, actually it doesn't say oops.  It should start with oops.  It should start with oops.  It doesn't.  It should say oopsie.  So Twitter did the right thing.  Everybody does this.  They encrypted your passwords.  When you create a password to your Twitter account, they even salted and hashed it, which  sounds like something for breakfast.  Delicious.  But they also kept a log as they did this of every user and their password in plain  text.

Transcript:  Now Twitter is quick to say, as far as we know, nobody's downloaded this log.  But anybody who ever worked at Twitter probably had access to it.  I'm guessing a few people who used to work at Twitter have a USB drive with some passwords  on it.  So take this as warning.  You should change your password.  I didn't worry too much even though I was overseas.  I couldn't change it very easily because I knew I had two factor turned on and that would  probably be a good idea.  Although for all we know, right next to the password and the Excel spreadsheet with everybody's  password, right next to it is the secret number that is the authenticator.

Start time: 6517.16
End time: 6580.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like your backup code or whatever.  That's one of the main things.  Everybody who's going through right now and updating your Twitter password, if you don't  have two factor authentication turned on, go ahead and get that turned on.  And please, if you can, to the best of your ability, try and get a two factor authentication  app, an app that will actually generate the code for you.  Don't do the text messages.  Yes.  Getting it sent to your phone.  We've seen time and time again how people who are very, very clever are good at spoofing  things like your phone number and doing social engineering against carriers to be able to  get access to those codes.  And so it ends up not doing you a good service, especially because companies treat these two  factor codes as as sort of a sacred form of being able to tell that it's you.  Yeah.  And so it's important.  Like once once someone has that, then they can do a good job of pretending that they're  you and companies are like, oh, yeah, must be you.  Let's let you have access to everything.  So get that turned on.

Start time: 6582.80
End time: 6597.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, if you reuse passwords, two factor ain't going to help you.  It'll only help you with Twitter.  And so that's another thing not to do.  Don't reuse passwords.  If your Twitter passwords used anywhere else, you now have to change that, too.  Don't forget, change it all.

If you're using a password vault, you know, the very first thing that does is it lets you  have new, fresh, very good passwords for every account you set up.  And most of them will have a security check.  I know LastPass does where it'll say here's where you've reused passwords.  Let's change those.  And it will somewhat help you automate the password change.  I like it.

I guess this is what he does these days.  And the former CEO of Microsoft, besides owning the L.A.  Clippers, he bought about 4 percent of Twitter in 2015, which means his money is doubled.  Gosh, dang it.  Dang it.  He sold it all.  He said, I still remain bullish about Twitter in the long run, whether it's an acquisition  or something else.  He's happy to be out of it.

Snap.  Terrible stock results.  Net neutrality vote coming up May 9th.  Want to talk a little bit about that.  California is now the world's fifth largest economy.  I don't know.  I should do a victory lap.  I don't know.  Let's let's take a break.  We'll talk a little bit more as we wrap things up with our great panel.  First, though, a word from WordPress.  I'm very proud of my daughter.  Years ago when she was born, she was a great woman.  Years ago when she was born, 26 years ago, I bought abbylaporte.com because I knew someday  she would want this.  She never wanted it.  She just she's just Friday called me in Japan saying I want it said Abby, I'm in Japan.  I'll handle this when I get home.  But she had just set up her WordPress blog and I'm so proud of her.  So that's awesome.  If you are setting up a blog, whether it's a personal blog, she wants to put her portfolio  up there.  Some of her best work.  That's a great idea.  You know, put your if you don't put your name up on the web, you're letting others  control your online presence.  No, you need to have a website.  If you're a business, twice as important.  Every business, it's you know, used to be you had to have a Yellow Pages listing or  a phone listing.  No, you need a website.  You need a website.  WordPress.com is the place to go.  It gives you flexibility.  It takes away all the technical stuff.  And so you don't have to be a coder or designer.  They give you all the tools.  It was so great.  Abby was so thrilled.  She chose from the hundreds of beautiful templates.  She got her site up and running literally in minutes.  And of course, if you ever any questions, the customer support team is fantastic.  They're there, by the way, Monday through Friday, 24 7.  And even on weekends, they're there so you can always get help.  If you want to sell something, if you're a business and you sell something online, they  have great e-commerce options, including a simple buy button to a complete online store.  Plans start at just four dollars a month.  And when you're ready to expand your online reach, WordPress makes it easy.  Built in SEO, social sharing, specialized plugins.  I have the business plan.  I use the the app plugin.  Of course, it's HTTPS.  You know, there's a good reason why 30 percent of all the websites in the world run on  WordPress.  You should, too.  If you're letting Facebook represent you on the Internet, stop.  Get your website up.  WordPress dot com slash twit.  Create your own website.  They'll even help you get a domain name if you need one.  WordPress dot com slash twit.  Fifteen percent off your brand new website.  WordPress dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  I've been a WordPress customer since practically day one since the early 2000s.  I hope Patrick Delahanty got his baby's name.  Patrick, if you didn't register Caitlin, get that name right now.  Because 26 years from now, Caitlin is he's going to come to you and say, Hey, Dad, did you  register my domain name?  Congratulations to Patrick.  He's our engineer.  He and Svet had a baby boy on was it Friday, Thursday or Friday?  Nine pounds, seven point seven ounces.  It's a healthy baby.

Anyway, congratulations to a little family, a little family announcement.  I wanted to pass along.  How do you guys, what do you guys think about the T-Mobile sprint?  Merger.  First of all, is it going to get regulatory approval?  Who knows?  Perhaps.  It's kind of a mystery.  You know, it was Tom Wheeler at the FCC who last time, and this is five years ago, said that it's not going to happen.  But things have changed a lot in the five years.  First of all, neckties have been replaced by blinged mice.  True.

End time: 7247.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's kind of almost, it's kind of almost over.  They have huge debt.  They're way behind in quality.  This is a good article.  Mark Lowenstein wrote for techpinions.com, why regulators should approve the deal.  And his, you know, the big issue for me, of course, is competition.  I like the idea of four big carriers better than three big carriers.  But sprint is no longer a competitor.  A stronger T-Mobile would be a good thing.  And he brings up the point that we're going to see a lot of competition from Google, from, you know, other companies who are going to become, you know, the best.  You know, other companies who are going to become wireless providers.  Dish, for instance, has a ton of spectrum.  So he also says it's good for 5G because it's expensive and you need you need strong, powerful companies to make 5G happen.  And Sprint probably would not have the horses to do it.  T-Mobile and Sprint together perhaps would.  There's also, this is a very important point, the issue of spectrum.  The FCC has been selling spectrum and the idea has been to make as much money as possible.  But that's eliminated participants, including big companies like Google and Comcast who said, oh, it's too it's too rich for our too rich for our purses.  It's just a lot. Yeah.  It's just too expensive to buy this spectrum.  And and that we maybe need to solve in some other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll find Dish though did buy. Yep.  This did buy a lot. May 9th.  The Democrats are hoping to get Congress to vote on a new bill that would overrule the FCC with net neutrality.  We're all hoping they get to you might want to write your member of Congress.  They probably heard a lot from you lately over this.  They've got to they've got to get enough signature.  Well, I see. I guess they have enough.  They do. They have enough signatures on a petition.  And it looks like Ed Markey has introduced a formal Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval.  Democrats will force a floor vote to restore the rules on May 9th.  Kind of a last ditch attempt to save net neutrality.  Still, we got a long way to go, including if any bill would have to get a signature from President Trump, which seems unlikely.  Very unlikely. So it's not it ain't over. But just keep keep writing.  And of course, California has its own many states now are talking about their own net neutrality bills.  Apparently, New York is now getting into the act as well.  But anything else we should flip cart. Amazon was trying to buy it.  It's India's Amazon. In effect, looks like Wal-Mart has put together a deal to acquire flip cart for about 15 billion dollars.  Stealing it, snatching it.  By the way, Google will be involved in this as well. They're one of the partners snatching it out of Amazon's hands.  Don't know that probably means more to people in India than it does to me.  But I think Amazon has stuff to worry about.  Yeah, no kidding. But Amazon's big problem right now is that they don't have a good international presence, do they?  Alibaba and others are beating them. And India is a big economy with a lot of customers.  I'm sure Amazon would like to have a big coup for a big coup for Google.  Yeah, they love to get there, of course.  And finally, there is we have a new cyber commander.  So the Pentagon has elevated their cyber warfare unit and in charge, Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone.  He will be also the head of the NSA. It's a dual leadership role.  He is now leader of U.S. Cyber Command.  On Friday, it was elevated to an independent unified command.  According to Reuters, a bureaucratic change that for the first time puts it on a par with nine other U.S. warfighting commands.  This is an acknowledgement, according to Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan,  that this new warfighting domain has come of age.  Here's a little scary rhetoric from the deputy director of the Cyber Command.  We are ready to unleash our cyber mission forces.  This will be defensive, but it will also be offensive.  Nakasone, the new director, appeared to favor a more robust response to cyber attacks,  such as those by Russia in March when he testified at his confirmation hearing.  Our adversaries, he said, have not seen our response in sufficient detail to change their behavior.  They don't think much will happen.  Cyber Command includes military units trained to both defend against cyber attacks and to initiate them.
