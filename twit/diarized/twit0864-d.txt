Notice we are blue and gold here  in solidarity with the people of Ukraine who are suffering at the hands of a madman who has  decided just unilaterally to invade that country. One of the things that there really are a bunch of  tech stories associated with this war in Ukraine. First of all, Ukraine is the home of many, many  very good tech companies. Some of our sponsors, in fact, Grammarly, one of our sponsors was  founded in Ukraine. The dev team is mostly in the Ukraine. Still our hearts and prayers go out to  everybody in Ukraine who are, I think, doing a great job defending themselves surprisingly  against the Russian menace. I also want to say, I'll mention some other companies, but before I say  that, I also want to say I know we have many listeners both in Ukraine and Russia and I think  they're suffering on both sides all because of this guy Putin. I think the Russian people are  great people, but you've got, as we have had in the past, you've got a bad leader. All of the  reprobation from my end comes from Putin and his henchmen and the oligarchs, not for the people of  Russia. They're suffering too. Grammarly, Skylum, do you ever use any of the Skylum products with  your photography, oh doctor? They do Luminar, some really great tools. Scott Bourne was their

It says Skylum was proudly founded  in Ukraine. Our core development center is based in Kyiv. Here's the thing that both touches me  and breaks my heart. At this harrowing time, unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the on-time  delivery of updates to Luminar Nero. Nio, dudes, chill. It's okay. You've got more important things

They also said, because you don't know how many  people don't even know that that's where they're based at, people just get on the internet and  complain about things like, oh, that's why they have no idea. So you put that statement out there.  So at least when somebody goes to check, it's like, oh, okay. Yes, I get it. You know, yes.  Just for the grumpies that get grumpy before they realize why they're grumpy.

Transcript:  Lot of tech companies use programmers in Ukraine. A lot of companies found in Ukraine.  And I know we have listeners in Ukraine. So we're thinking of you. We really are.  The supply chain shortage we talk about, it's going to be more than Girl Scout cookies, both in Russia and Ukraine.  The big export curves and then the shutting down of Swift, both are going to impact Russia hard  in terms of technology. The thing that concerns me, and this was a story from NBC I saw earlier this week  that actually really scared me. Biden has been presented with options for massive cyber attacks.  Against Russia. And this comes from NBC sources, two intelligence officers with the US, one Western  intelligence official, and another person briefed on the matter. Biden was presented with now,  I guess I would imagine in a case like this, the president is presented with many, many options,  not all of which are, you know, serious or on the table or not meant not all of which he would  actually consider. I'm hoping he doesn't consider these, including an attack on the Russian internet  to disrupt internet connectivity across Russia, shutting off electric power,  tampering with railroad switches. That did happen in Belarus. An individual hacker shut down the  Belarus railway system last couple of weeks ago. A person briefed on the matter said you could do  everything from slow the trains down to have them fall off the tracks. My concern is if we allow this  conventional warfare to become cyber warfare, the damage goes worldwide and it comes right back to  us. Lisa, does it seem to you that this is a war that we should not be fighting as a cyber war?  I think it's important to sort of reframe the war in general and to understand that if you talk to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a lot of people in the tech security space, they're going to argue that we've been at war  with Russia for quite a while anyway. 75% of all ransomware comes out of Russia.  You have to remember Russia has been actively interfering in US elections,  on national and local levels, since at least 2014, if not earlier. I've been going to RSA  every year since I want to say 2015, 2016. And this is something that I've heard in private one  on one conversations with sources. This is something I've heard when I've sat in on sessions,  something I've heard in keynotes, which is that the nature of the internet is not just a  cyber warfare, it's a cyber warfare. And it can be anything from destabilizing elections so that  the population loses belief in the legitimacy of elections. It can be creating memes and  monkeying with sources of information so that people don't know what sources of information  to trust. And that helps erode the information that's being used to create cyber warfare.  And that helps erode a chance of a national dialogue where everybody is working from the  same definition of reality. You do have state sponsored agencies that have hacked into US  companies across all sectors from transportation to utilities to retail, to private security.  These efforts have been ongoing for quite some time. What's a little unusual right now,  I think, is that we have a story which has hit NBC. And I would suggest that the Biden  administration has probably been floating it out there as a PSI ops thing too, that says,  you know what, we're going to take this war to cyberspace because that is where 21st century  warfare is. I think it's a shift in how we are defining and looking at war. And I think that  war, but these are activities that have gone on for quite some time already.

Transcript:  saying, hey, don't forget, we've got nukes. Well, they always say that though. I'm not  trying to belittle. So fun fact, my dad worked on nuclear subs through the 70s and 80s.  Oh, really? Interesting. Yeah. And no, it was, and I grew up,  I'm a Gen Xer. So, you know, we grew up with the threat of nuclear war. And Leo, I'm sure you  remember in the 80s when they had the day after, remember that TV movie, the whole thing. So at the  time we were living in Tidewater, Virginia, and I was a kid and I was completely freaked out about,  oh my God, what if the Soviets nukes in our baths? How would we survive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I lived my whole childhood in the fear of that. Yeah. Ducking cover.  I was born in 56. So we had ducking cover drills, the Cuban missile crisis. We came very close to  nuclear war in 1963. In fact, I remember visiting McGeorge Bundy, who was the national security  advisor to president JFK. At that time, he's the guy who woke up Kennedy and said, Mr. President,  we found satellite photos of missiles in Cuba. And was went through that. And I remember visiting  his house, his apartment in New York City. And he had a really interesting thing on his coffee  table. It was the month of October with some little pins in it. I said, what's that? He said,  oh yeah, JFK gave all of us that. That's the 10 days in October that we were coming, we came  within inches. He gives credit to his wife, Mary, because he came home one day from the White House  and he said, we're this close to nuclear war with Russia. And she said, McGeorge, you can't let that  happen. You have to go in there and you have to fight for peace. You cannot let this happen.  I don't think anybody knows, he talks about it in his memoirs, how close, but I remember talking to  him about it, how close we came. And I feel like cyber warfare has the, it's not as bad as nuclear  warfare. You're not going to get a scorched earth, but if it escalates, if we are-

Transcript:  If you take a look at how things unraveled in the early days of the shutdown in 2020,  that did expose a lot of weaknesses in how the US and the companies that live and work in the US  have chosen to structure supply chains in transit. But if you do a little bit of reading,  and one of the things I would love to recommend to everybody who's listening or watching this,  Brad Smith, who is a president of Microsoft and it's chief, and Microsoft's chief counsel,  wrote a fantastic book a couple of years ago that has, it's basically a primer for what's going on  right now. And it's called Tools and Weapons, The Promise and Peril of the Digital Age.  And in a couple of chapters, he lays out the surveillance that Microsoft as a private company  has been doing on the Russian government for years because Russia's state-sponsored agency  has been doing things like trying to register domains that it can pass off as Microsoft domains  to capture user information, sift through it, and then use it to break into places.  Cyber warfare has proven super effective in some ways already. I mean, you take a look at the  election 2016, 2020, you take a look at the Senate elections in 2018, there was evidence of  interference there too. And we did include this link later in the show, but Russian meme factories  and disinformation campaigns have been super effective throughout the pandemic as well.  When you're talking about siloed realities where people get together based on affinity  rather than geographic connections or even a sense of national thing, that weakens a nation,  and it's been super successful so far. After seeing how poorly, surprisingly,

Start time: 1148.92
End time: 1175.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  poorly Russia's fared in Ukraine, I feel like that maybe they will turn to this cyber war where even  a small nation like, say, North Korea can hire enough hackers to be really disruptive in the  world. We've got China, we've got North Korea, we've got Russia. I hope, I assume that we have  capabilities, similar capabilities in the United States, but I would also hope that we would  be careful about using those because of the risk to civilian populations.

Start time: 1175.58
End time: 1223.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the flip side of cyber warfare is it affects civilians on such a  greater scale. And in ways I don't think anyone who hasn't been part of it can wrap their brains  around because it can affect everything from your ability to hit your bank balance, to whether or  not you have money in retirement, to whether or not you're able to get gas, to whether or not  you're able to have the power on. It's an astonishing scope compared to street to street  geographic warfare where people have the option to flee. We live in such a heavily networked  international economy at this point that there will be people affected all over the place who  are nowhere near where the fighting is. If you were to take this to a purely computer networked

Start time: 1223.88
End time: 1331.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  or a data first fighting angle. Atlantic had an article that talked about a 1993  RAND memo, RAND report called, this is 1993 remember, Cyber War is Coming! The authors,  I'll read you a little bit of it. The thesis of this think piece is that the information revolution  will cause shifts both in how societies may come into conflict and how their armed forces may wage  war. And they talk about cyber war, which is the kind of warfare we're talking about bringing down  a power grid or bringing down the water system, both of which, by the way, Russia has already  done to Ukraine in what looks like a kind of a test of their capabilities. But they also talk  about net war. We don't use that term nowadays. We call it disinformation. Societal level  ideational conflicts waged in part through interneted nodes of communication. This was  written in 93 before there was a Facebook, before there was a Twitter, before there were these mass  disinformation campaigns. But these guys really kind of understood how this could be used against  a population. You know, they say that one of the reasons the Nazis had such success is because  Joseph Gebel's the minister of propaganda understood and used radio, the new technology of radio so  effectively. It could very well be that a country that doesn't, you know, Russia's got an economy  the size of Texas, it's not, it does have nukes, but it also, you know, it doesn't, you don't have  to be this great economic power to have a very powerful cyber army in effect. Georgia, tell us

Start time: 1331.44
End time: 1402.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  something to reassure us. Please. Well, my thought is, like, really, they have to do something, you  can't allow countries to just invade. I agree. And expect it to be okay. And if you don't  want to get your people directly involved in a war, then you have to find other ways that are  going to be able to stop this as quickly as possible with the least amount of people lives lost. So I  think that attacking their infrastructure, you know, through the internet is probably a safer bet  than bringing people in. And the fact that that anyone uses the fact that they have nukes as a  shield, that is, you know, horrific, that of course, they're going to do that, they're going  to do that for anything they they want to make this as fast as effective as possible to be able  to take over as much land as they can. So I think that they should put every single card that they  have, that would be the safest and that would, you know, just be able to shut it down as quickly as  possible. So I think that if they can do that through, you know, just shutting down the internet,  like, you know, that will be a better option than having to send in troops and it might be

Start time: 1402.46
End time: 1408.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1408.36
End time: 1421.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they already doing that, like, yes, like, let's just say it, like, they're not they've already,  like, Russia's already threatened nukes. So like, it's not like they wouldn't choose to do this  anyways, like, you know, like nukes, oh, and we'll shut down your internet. And then everyone's like,

Start time: 1422.00
End time: 1427.04

Transcript:  And they just said, and there was just something that came out that said Russia has just made it  so that if you're a foreign investor in Russian markets, you can't exactly pull your money out  of the Russian market right now. Yeah. So that's the action of a government that knows there's a  huge run on banks today, there's going to be no more money tomorrow. Monday is going to be crazy.

Start time: 1454.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  effectively being fenced in. So they're going to be cut off from the internet, they're going to be  cut off financially. And since Putin's power rested primarily in flexing some financial muscle,  all he has left to negotiate with our nukes. But, and again, not diminishing the terror.  I just worry, you know, we not diminishing the terror, but I think you can't like,  this sounds awful. The US has professionals back in the State Department, and they've always had  a deep bank of professionals and talent in the Pentagon. And I would not be surprised if they  haven't gamed out all of the scenarios that are likely to happen and have figured out a way to  let Putin and Sable rattle about the nukes and say, fine, this is what he's going to negotiate with.  He has nothing else to negotiate with after that. Or to threaten with, and the US has plenty, and

Start time: 1517.48
End time: 1558.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we're not even officially involved yet. So the banks open in Moscow in about five hours,  it'll be very interesting, we shall see. My fear is, you know, we have the thing that kept us from  blowing each other up in the 60s, was something called mutual assured destruction, MAD,  which was the threat that if you did it, they would do it back and we the whole world would blow up.  There is some deterrent that if we are too aggressive in pushing a cyber war against Moscow,  that they will do it back to us. I'm hoping, I wonder if there should be a Geneva Convention,  should be Geneva Accords. It's funny you say that because Brad Smith, again, to get back to the

Start time: 1559.08
End time: 1607.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  recommendations I came in, Microsoft's Brad Smith has been traveling the world giving a speech for  the last six or seven years, arguing that what we need is a new digital Geneva Convention.  I think so.  Which lays out the rights of every person in the world to be able to connect online with other  people, to transact business online with other people, and most importantly, takes the responsibility  for their own safety off of the shoulders of the individual and forces it onto the shoulders of  government. So in other words, instead of Microsoft or Google being responsible for your internet  safety, it becomes something where governments are held accountable if you're not safe online.

Transcript:  Putin has essentially escaped responsibility for what I think we're starting to believe now  really is at least tacitly a tacit approval of the ransomware epidemic. This was back in 2017,  I think, that Smith talked about a digital Geneva Convention, no targeting of tech companies,  private sector, or critical infrastructure, and limit offensive operation to avoid a mass event.  Commit to nonproliferation activities to cyber weapons, exercise restraint in developing cyber  weapons. I don't think we are doing any of those things on our part because the other argument is  the mad argument, which is well-operated from strength, the only deterrent to somebody,  clearly a madman like Putin, is to have enough strength to say, yeah, well, don't mess with us.

Transcript:  No, it's not even that it's no. It's just in a broad scope of an idea, I'm against war in general.  Of course.  It always amuses me how mighty and how high-horst we get when it's something we don't like. But when  America does things- I'm just as mad when we do that too, believe me.  I know we are, but I'm saying in general, I'm saying like, I've been overseas when we were at  war for decades and the rest of the country is looking at me like, oh, you're an American.  The concept of how we get so high and mighty, like, oh, you want to do a cyber war? Go ahead,  open Pandora's box. The real problem is you can have a gene recognition all you want to.  America has been caught in the past doing things that are criminal against international law.  And to think that Russia or any other agitator is going to listen to any kind of thing that you put  out there, that's what the CIA is for. That's what the government- we don't negotiate with terrorists.  How do they get our weapons? How do they get these trucks? All these things behind it.  I'm like, you're driving a US tank. How did you get them? Because we make these deals behind  closed doors and when it blows up in our face, we're like, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.  I was trying to do this. So when I listen to all these things, let's see what happens if they go  broke tomorrow and figure it out from there. But the whole-

It's just going to be a rough situation because it only takes five dudes in the closet  to shut down a city or shut down a block anywhere. That's the other thing I think is interesting is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  warfare is completely different than it was even 20 years ago because of technology. For instance,  there's a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey,  Jeffrey Lewis, who with his team of students was monitoring Google Maps, Google Maps in Ukraine.  And before we even knew the invasion was happening, he knew because he could see on Google Maps,  road closures and the movements of Russian artillery from Russia into Ukraine because of  Google Maps. I mean, there are independent people using satellite photos to identify  Russian convoys, tank movements. I'm reading from the Washington Post,  by combining Google Maps traffic information with a radar image that showed troops,  Lewis and his teams realized that invasion was underway hours before the news became public  and from thousands of miles away in California. So technology, which is ubiquitous,  technology is now the palantir, the all-seeing eye that we all to some degree more or less have  access to. So I think this changes things a little bit. We are a little bit, look at the video we're

I think warfare changed when you had  folks like Snowden and other people who chose to share information during a war and could  disseminate that information quickly along multiple nodes. There was no way to shut it down,  disappear somebody. What is the name of that young woman? She's got that really great first name.

Transcript:  great first name. Well, there's that. The minute it occurred to people that they could dump  information on the internet and let folks pick it apart and do with it what they would, that  dramatically changed warfare, especially when you contrast it with how information was guarded  through World War II, through all of the US's many, many, many, many, many imperialist skirmishes  after that. We don't have that kind of presumption of a cone of silence around intelligence anymore.  And that's a big thing too because wars are won and lost on intelligence. I mean,  you could argue that getting a hold of the Enigma machine is what won World War II.

Transcript:  Right. You could also, and by the way, it's interesting because the vice  premier of Ukraine has tweeted that he wants hackers to come on over and help him.  But then he asked them to do it on Telegram and somebody should have explained to him,  signal might be a better choice in that case. So I'm not sure why Russia didn't completely shut down  the internet in Ukraine. Usually when you invade a country, at least it's been my experience,  in the old days you would shut down the newspapers, radio stations, you shut down

They're shutting  down Twitter and Facebook in Russia because they don't want their own people seeing what's going  on, which is telling. Elon Musk says, I don't think Russian people want war. I mean, no,  I think not. In fact, I think the best hope for peace at this point is that they overthrow Putin,  which would come at a great, I'm sure great bloodshed and loss to Russian lives.

Transcript:  that's what happened in Ukraine. Putin had a strong man in there. Remember he was horrifically  corrupt and built this palatial mansion and there was a revolution and they threw him out.  He fled to Russia. He's still living in Russia. Zelensky was elected and that was the scenario I  think Putin was most afraid of is exactly that. Apple Pay is unavailable in Russia. Now we're  talking hardship. No Google Pay, no Apple Pay. One Ukrainian leader, this puts Apple in an  interesting bind. One Ukrainian leader called on Tim Cook to block Russian users from the app store.  What do you do if you're Apple or Google? Do you pull out of Russia?

Transcript:  That's a slippery slope. Again, we've been at war for as long as I can remember. I didn't agree  with those wars. You're going to turn off my internet or my service because the government  wants to go do what they want to do. I didn't get drafted. I didn't sign up. I didn't apply.  So me as a regular citizen who now is struggling economically, struggling for food and all the  necessities I need just to keep my family safe and alive. Now I can't even download happy flabby  burgers. Give me through tonight. I'm making a joke about it. As a regular citizen, they shouldn't  get involved. They should leave it alone. Again, it's a very slippery slope when you start getting  into what you should shut down, what you should not, especially when we get so mad and so upset  about things like TikTok. People don't like TikTok because America didn't make TikTok.  When you look at the way that they use the platform in other countries versus here,  I get it. There's manipulation, there's games, but it's not up to them to change things and shut  things down for the regular common people. If you want to shut down Putin's account, sure. You got  his number. I'm sure he's logged into the app store. Shut them down directly. No flappy happy birds

He's been very active  on Twitter calling on, he's the guy who called on Apple to shut down the app store. He asked for  help from Elon Musk, who said, okay, Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals  on route. Talk about instant response, right? He's called on YouTube to turn off monetization of  Russia today. They did. He's the one who said, we're creating an IT army. We need digital  talents. All operational tasks will be given here on Telegram. IT army of your rain. I don't know why  you are our AI and E, but that I checked. That's the actual address. There will be tasks for everyone.  We would continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialist.  This is really interesting how important cyber warfare has become in this. Twitter just made  the decision to block Russians, the opportunity to register new accounts in the Russian Federation.  And then of course the Russians retaliate by shutting Twitter down.  Ukraine's asking for Bitcoin donations, cryptocurrency donations, Ethereum, Bitcoin,  and Tether. He posted the wallet addresses for the three. Russia may be forced to rely on Bitcoin.  Now that Swift is shut down, the banks are getting cut off. Bitcoin may be the only hope for Russia.

Transcript:  Crazy. War is such a weird thing, right? Because at the end of it, you always go back and you look  at the finances, you know, what military company built all the bases, who made all the ammunition.  When you're Russia and you cut off all their money, no matter how they get money, who are you going  to pay to do anything? Because if you need something, it's just like here, we had to make  stuff, we had to do things on our own. If they're doing things, they don't need to pay anybody.  They're just taking over companies and small businesses, like, go make us a car, a tank,  a plane, or ammunition. I don't feel like they're going to be paying anybody to try and fund their  war. It's just a weird game to be playing. Like I said, tomorrow, we're going to find out how  economically strong Russia thinks they are because Bitcoin ain't going to save them. I'd say that  right now. There's going to be a whole lot of people siphoning the money into your own bank  accounts where they go pay for a new tank or a new plane. I imagine there'll be a run in the banks.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. But that's where shutting down, like if the people in Russia get angry enough to say,  you know what, this is affecting me and we're really upset, it may make Putin think twice about  what he's doing and perhaps decide to go into negotiations with a little bit more seriousness.  Like if people can't get their flappy bird and they're angry enough and then Putin's like,  oh, wait a second. This might create like the only thing that he cares about is his own power  and being able to take as much control as he can as quickly as possible. If the people in Russia  are angry enough because they don't get flappy bird, well, maybe they'll put a little bit more  pressure and maybe Putin will be like, they can't get flappy bird. Now it's serious because that's  what's going to cause pressure to him. Like he's expecting this to be like, he thought going into  this, that this was going to be regular warfare, but someone's doing a country and it's not the  people they don't deserve this. I'm fully aware of that, but it's a small price in comparison to  how many lives it could save if we end up being able to shut down so that then they decide to  negotiate a little bit soon. Hit them where it really hurts. Yeah. Where the people,

Like other people,  we see other bad things happening to other people. We're like, that's horrible for them,  but we don't usually think about it. When it starts to affect us, we're like, oh, wait a second,  I can't get flappy birds. Now I'm upset. Let's do something that you better stop.

There's also the issue of the International Space Station,  which is half owned by Russia, is supplied by Russia, rockets launched from Russian territory.  There's some real legitimate concern. NASA says, don't worry about it.  I would hope that Roscosmos, the Russian NASA, would act as if this is a non-political issue,  but in fact, the director of Roscosmos has already started to do a little saber rattling. They've  suspended Soyuz rocket launches. He's saying, we're going to withdraw our staff from the  Guiana Space Center where the Soyuz rockets are launched. I don't know how this will affect the  ISS, but it's pretty serious. Rod was very concerned about this.  In all seriousness, I'm not worried about that at all. We have the Space Force.

I've never played because I watch Michael, our 19-year-old play,  and it looks like a lot of fun.  It's all about bosses and it looks like a lot of fun.  It's so hard.  And so I've always known it's too hard for me,  but I did buy it because I really wanted to do it.  Believe it or not, the New Yorker had a whole interview with Miyazaki.  He says, death is a feature, not a bug.

If you go into the game knowing that you are going to die a thousand times  and that you're there to learn,  I guess it could be a good way of dealing with resilience,  learning to get back up.  Yes, there you go.  Fall down six times, get up seven.  That could be the learning curve that you have to go through  when you're playing Eldar Ring.  But if you look at Eldar Ring and you play it that way,  it's frustrating because you're doing the same thing very repetitively over and over again.  But there are ways to beat bosses.  I've seen people that are able,  beating bosses that are way above where their skill levels are.  And people can be amazing at it.

Transcript:  And that's the other thing.  It is fun to watch somebody who's good at this  because you have to dodge and parry and roll and jump and time.  And in a lot of it, it looks like that you have to really understand the boss's  attack sequence so that you know when your moment has come.  You also have to be very, my problem is I'm too impatient.  I just go in there and they go, and it's over.  You have to be patient.  This is from the New Yorker article about Miyazaki.  The video game director who's in his late 40s  has punished more players than perhaps anyone else in Dark Souls,  the 2011 fantasy game that made him famous.  You play as a loin clothed wretch racing through sewers and cowering in forests.  You're attacked by a giant wolf,  pugilist mushrooms,  Mephitic swamps,  and a sword wielding spider.  If you fail to parry an aggressor's lunge or tumble off a rampart,  you're greeted by a superfluous message.  You died.  After it fades, you're reincarnated beside a bonfire,  one of a series of checkpoints scattered throughout this mysterious, vaguely medieval world.  Of course, every one of your enemies has respawned as well.  I'm glad the New York, we finally got the New Yorker treatment for a video game.  I think this is very good.  Are you in the discord, Uncle Leo?  I can be.  I can.  What are they?  Oh, stop that.  Stop that.  What are they doing?  They're posting pictures of me.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's one is that it makes them feel like they can do things that other people can't,  just like people that do extreme sports.  It causes that adrenaline rush.  And then you get this huge dopamine hit.  So the harder it is to accomplish something, the bigger your brain rewards you for being  able to do it.  And so building that kind of resiliency and that delay of gratification is one.  It's actually really good for us.  Like to be able to do that is the modern day marshmallow test.  It's the marshmallow that kills you first.  Yes, it's kind of like the question about that.

Transcript:  I love that you mentioned flow state, which is like a really cool thing.  So flow state is when you lose time and space, nothing else matters and you're just vibing.  It's just you and whatever you are doing.  And like hours could go by and it feels like minutes.  Now, for me, I am definitely not in a flow state when I play Elderen's, but I have heard  from a lot of other people that they are that it doesn't even bother them that they've died.  They're just gaining information and learning how to do something better.  And so, yes, they can be in that flow state while they're playing this really horrible  game.  Now, I am not in that state.  I am feeling frustrated and angry.  So I have not reached that level of gaming capacity.  It's irritating.

Transcript:  And then and then let me let me finish what I'm saying.  Secondly, it's the same reason I don't subscribe to participation trophies is the same reason  I blocked every shot the lead tried to put up against me.  I didn't give her nothing because guess what?  She cried about it the first eight times.  And when she finally made a bucket on her own, the joy of actually succeeding was beyond  all compare.  I raised her and her friends as a genius that I am.  I raised them at four years old.  I beat them down.  I raised them at five years old.  I raised them at eight.  My legs are still bigger than theirs.  I beat them.  And to this day, they still talk about how fast I am.  No matter how rotunda I am, they remember me beating them down in the leg race.  And I am the fastest man on earth compared to those children.  So it's all about succeeding.  But you got to go through the trials and tribulations first.  Leah had a karate contest.  She didn't practice.  I told her, hey, you've been to practice.  She gets up there.  She got a little rinky dink coin and all the kids got a big trophy that won.  She started crying.  She's like, why didn't I get one of those?  I said, well, you should have been practicing.  You got to earn it.  So that's what the games were.  What is hard?  You earn it.  All the joy when you're when you play on easy, you don't even feel good about yourself.  You're like, man, look, I ain't nobody watching.  I guess I'll put it on easy.  You don't feel good about it.  When you're on medium slash hard, all the success, the small victories, the joys of  the zone, as it were, my professional opinion.

End of the season, she had regionals.  When you're in, losing your out.  She lost this girl.  This girl was jacked.  And I mean, like the girls are better, but she was stronger.  Natalie is in here eating protein shakes, lifting after school every day.  Put like she's out here riding my spin bike.  She's I got to get weights.  So that motivation of when something you have to work for and earn is what does it,  whether it's in sports or video games or shoot, even starting a business.

Transcript:  And everyone's like, who do you think anybody ever talked about flow?  He wrote a book called flow.  Here he is at his Ted talk back at 2004 that described this state.  And he said, it's what makes life worth living.  And I'll never forget it.  I mean, it was a very interesting, he's a very interesting fellow.  But me, even though I'd never heard anybody use this phrase, the zone or flow before,  I immediately got what he was talking about.  And we all have some experience of the world disappears and you're just focused.  And I remember in acting, you do these exercises to bring up your energy,  but it's not uncontained energy.  You want to bring your energy up, but be seem relaxed at the same time.  And it's flow.  It's the centered flow where you have the energy, but it's contained.  So I think if anybody can experience it, I don't know if this Elden ring is exactly  the key to flow, but I guess, you know, if you're really good at it, you probably are.  Yeah.  Yeah.

And interestingly enough, for anxiety levels, when you hit flow, your levels of anxiety go down.  It's soothing.  Like you're just in a zone and your levels of dopamine and opiates, you feel just really good  and usually more energized afterwards, as long as you're eating and drinking and doing  all the other things that you need to do as well.  You don't want to get lost in it because some people can do a full activity and then they're  just, you know, gone.  They didn't pay their taxes.

The worst thing that can happen to you in Las Vegas is winning because then you want  to get that again.  And there's also that mechanic, isn't it?  It's not just flow.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's about, he tries to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless who gained  notoriety for starving to death in a bus in the Alaskan wilderness under circumstances  that were mostly preventable.  I'm not here to litigate that whole thing right now because it's ongoing, but he has  a beautiful chapter where he describes talking about hiking the, I'm going to mess up the  pronunciation because I've only ever read the Stikeen Ice Cap, and Krakauer describes  the brutal process of inching up and placing your feet very carefully and scree falls away.  And what he talks about is how, quote unquote, a trance-like state settles over your efforts,  the accumulated clutter of day-to-day existence, the lapse of conscience, the unpaid bills,  all of it is temporarily forgotten, crowded from your thoughts by the overpowered clarity  of purpose and by the seriousness of task at hand.  And then he ends the chapter by pointing out that once you've achieved this great thing,  quote unquote, the climb is over, the only place to go is down.  And listening to you guys talk about the emotional intensity of being able to master this really  tough task and having the joy of dropping into the moment and feeling that purposefulness and  that accomplishment. And then when it's done, you're like, ah, rat, lever, press the lever again.  That's the flip side to that beautiful moment of knowing yourself in intense focus and purposefulness  is it just, it ends. And when you guys are talking about the game, it's the same thing.

Transcript:  Incredible, incredible story. And I was thinking about that Netflix has a show called 14 Peaks,  which if you haven't seen it is worth watching. It's a documentary about all of the people who  summit Everest, going back to Sir Edmund Hillary, really did it because they had  Nepalese Sherpa who did it for them or help them or led the way or set the lines.  And these Sherpa never get the credit they deserve. It's always Edmund Hillary at the  press conference, not Teng Seng Norgay, his Sherpa. So 14 Peaks is about a Sherpa,  a Nepali mountaineer who wanted to do it for the Sherpa, to get the credit for the Sherpa.  And he did something no one has ever done before. In seven months, he summited all 14  of the world's 8,000-meter peaks. And it is harrowing. But it's fascinating.  I suspect that he also does it for the zone, that moment of leaving the world's cares behind.  And boy, he must feel that letdown when he gets down because he went right back up and went right  back up. Of course, once you finish 14 Peaks in seven months, then you're really going to have  a letdown. It's a great story. And a lot of credit goes to Nimzadeh Puljja, who is the

Growing up when I was younger,  I lived a life where I had everything, we were really well off, and then we were poor,  and then I had everything again, and then I was middle ground. And so when I turned 21, I went to  Lang City, put $1,000 on Black, I hit it for the next five years. Every year on my birthday,  I went down there and I hit it. I doubled my money. I walked out. Didn't bet on anything else.  Wow. Six years, I lost. I never played again. I went out to Vegas with my buddies for a bachelor  party. We're waiting in line to check in our hotel. I put a quarter in the slot. I won $800.  I didn't gamble a dollar the rest of the week I was there. And everybody's like, yo, you're hot.  I was like, look, bro, I made my money. I didn't hit this thing. Shut it down.

And once the high goes away or something messes it  up. But like I said, once I lost, I haven't put it, I haven't got like, literally I walk in the  casino, put the thousand dollars down. I mean, I watched the boards and I picked my one and get my  feel. But as soon as I hit it, I take that money. I walk out. And then one year when I lost, I haven't  done it again. I'm up like $6,000. I'm good. That quarter, there's nothing better than I'm going to  do in Las Vegas than put a quarter in the slot and win almost $2,000. No matter what I do.

Transcript:  I'm just telling you Ant. Tharat is coming up March 31st. We're going to do one with Paul Tharat.  This is all, this is what we're trying to do is make club twit an exciting and tight enticing  place to be. The original idea was people said, well, we don't, we don't want to hear all the ads.  We don't want any ad tracking technology. So we said, well, you know what? If you give us seven  bucks a month, which is about what we would make on you from ads, you don't have to have any ads.  And so that's how club twit was born was Lisa's idea. Ad free versions of all the shows that are  just yours. But turns out the discord, which is another benefit, we just thought, well, let's give  them another benefit. Turns out to be really one of the great benefits. So much fun to hang out in  there. All sorts of conversations, not just about our shows, but with our hosts. Stacy has a book  club. We have the Untitled Linux show. And then we have all of these conversation pits on everything,  crypto, food, gaming, hacking. We have a let's play group where we have a dedicated, actually now two  dedicated Minecraft servers just for the club. And then there's the twit plus feed where you could  hear George's fireside chat. Oh, doctors, ask me anything. The upcoming Paul, Thorough, Stacy's book  club, the Untitled Linux show, the gives his all the shows that are by the way, we've been, well,  I'll tell you in a second what we've been doing in there. But if you want to join twit.tv slash club  twit, there's a little plug for it. Now that by the way, was an ad that the people who are club  twit members did not hear. So if you're hearing it, go to twit.tv slash club twit, and you'll never  have to hear this ad again. We, we're also going to start using this to launch new shows. And the  very first show we've launched in there that we're about to make public this week in space is starting  on Friday with Rod Pyle and Tarek Malek. Tarek comes from space.com. Rod Rod is from the National  Space Society is a contributor to the Tech Guy Road radio show that is ready to launch and go  public. So go to twit.tv slash twist, you can sign up, get on the feed, get links or whatever. And  the first episode, there's an episode zero, but episode one is this Friday, it has been club members  only we're now going public with that. All right, let's take a little break.

We'll be talking about emerging issues like meeting equity, which is becoming  a bigger deal as more and more workplaces go hybrid. We'll be talking about the emergence of AR and VR  in the workplace and how that's going to shape how you do your job.

Transcript:  Now they have squid game Funko Pops. You can't be trusted.  Our show today, actually, this is for all the cooks in the audience. This is the place to get  your produce, your vegetables, imperfect foods. And don't be fooled by the name. I think they're  perfect. But the idea is Imperfect Foods was founded because they found out that a huge amount  of food in our, in the U S food system was wasted. Just fell through the cracks. Produce grocers said,  well, that's, I can't carry that apple. It's too small or, or meats or vegetables or even snacks  that there's too much of it or nobody's, but whatever they can, you can now get it. So basically  it's a grocery delivery service, but it offers a line of sustainable groceries that tastes delicious,  reduce waste and embrace the natural imperfections in food. The chickens, the heritage chickens I get  from Imperfect Foods are amazing. I will eat no other now. They're, they're pasture raised,  heritage chickens, incredible snacks and the, and the produce it's always fresh seasonal produce.  Yeah. Okay. I admit they're not apples the size of your head. They're apples like they used to be  when I was a kid and you'd go to the apple orchard and you'd pick the apples. They're a little smaller,  but they're sweeter. They're, I think they're just the way apples should be the original kind  of apples. It's such a great idea. Now I should have said right up front, it doesn't, they don't  deliver everywhere. So you need to go to imperfectfoods.com and see if they deliver in your area. One of the  things they do, which is great, they deliver on the same day each week so that they can combine  the truck runs that in, in by the way, saves emissions. In fact, this delivery weekly by  neighborhood model produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions than individual trips to the grocery stores. So  you're saving that way too. And the other thing, a lot of, you know, I was worried about packaging.  They take all the packaging back. They use a minimal amount of packaging. It's card, basically  cardboard box. They don't put a lot of plastic bags in there or anything and they take it all  back and reuse it. So you'd never feel bad about packaging, no more packaging guilt. In fact,  I think it's the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return the packaging  after every order. I just, I am such a fan. Our day is Thursday and we love Imperfect Foods.  Save the environment, get great food that would otherwise go to waste. You're doing a good thing  for yourself and for the planet. Right now, you're also going to save 20% off your first four orders.  Yeah, just go to imperfectfoods.com. Use the promo code TWIT, 20% off your first four orders.  That's up to an $80 value at imperfectfoods.com. Use the promo code TWIT. We had Imperfect Foods  broccoli just last night. So good, so green, so fresh. Join the movement. Imperfectfoods.com  promo code TWIT. Forget your misconceptions. This is something you can do that gets you great  groceries at a great price and helps the planet too. I love it. Imperfectfoods.com.

I got my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.  I like it a lot. I don't think the newest ones have this problem, but apparently Samsung shipped  100 million phones with broken encryption. That's a lot of phones. That's a lot of phones.  This was something discovered by Tel Aviv University in Israel. The researchers wrote  a paper called Trust. This, by the way, it's very competitive now in the security research field.  You've just got to have a catchy thing. Trust dies in darkness. Shedding light on Samsung's  TrustZone key master design. It'll be presented at USENIX this year. They rely on something called  Trusted Execution Environment, which comes from ARM's TrustZone technology. Basically,  it's an isolated operating system, the TrustZone operating system, but it's up to vendors to  implement the crypto within the TrustZone operating system. And apparently Samsung  made a little mistake in the hardware abstraction layer.  This is actually not at all uncommon. They used an imperfect random number generator. Samsung failed  to implement keymaster TA. TA is the trust abstraction, the trust architecture, properly  in its galaxy S9, S10, S8, S20, and even the S21 last year. The researchers show how they could  obtain keys from the hardware protected blob. And again, this happens, Steve talks about this all the  time. Random number generators are not random. They're pseudo random. And Matthew Green, who is  our favorite crypto guy at Johns Hopkins, said that the unique number, which ensures that the  AES encryption produces a different result every time, the salt, they call it, needs to be unique.  But if you reuse it, it's not unique. Green tweeted, so they could have derived a different  key wrapping key for each key they protect. But instead, Samsung basically doesn't. They allow  the app layer code to pick encryption IVs, which allows trivial decryption. IV is the initialization  vector that initializes the random number. This is called an IV reuse attack. Just mentioning it,  not a problem with the latest Samsung devices. Samsung did not immediately respond to requests  to confirm the researchers estimate of affected devices and to estimate if how many devices,  if any remain unpatched. Basically, they had nothing to say. So maybe nothing to see here.  Pay no attention. Honestly, I mentioned it just to point out, it's very hard to do this right.  It's easy to make a mistake in crypto. That's why you want to get it reviewed by crypto experts.  And it's good that there's a security community that bangs on this stuff. And I presume Samsung  will fix this. It's a thing you can fix in software. But these things happen. And it's  just something to be aware of. I don't think this attack is so easy to do that it's going to be a  threat. We don't know of any in the wild exploits, just raising awareness is all I'm doing.  I'm excited about the web, the James Webb telescope. I bet you Georgia Dow is a James  Webb nerd. I don't know why I just feel like you might be. We have a little telescope,

It's finally, you know, at the  Lagrange point, which is a million kilometers out so far that it's gonna be very hard if there's a  problem to fix it. It was it had to be folded up like an origami project to fit in the nose cone,  so they could launch it. And then it had to perfectly go through hundreds of steps to unfold  it without a flaw. It did. The mirror is 18 separate mirrors. They're hexagonal in an array,  each of which can be controlled separately. So it's out there a million kilometers from Earth.  And now the mirrors have to be adjusted. They move very, very, very slowly so that the images  they're collecting can converge on a single point to basically focus it. They took you probably saw  it. We talked about it a few weeks ago. The first images came back 18 separate images. Now  they've been able to get it all to converge. They've successfully completed the image alignment.  They are moments away. I think it's very soon that we're going to see the first perfect images  from this most amazing telescope. All the images are in the same place. The goal now is to get those  tiny little nanometer adjustments. In order to get the final focus, engineers have to image the  spectra of light looking for slight shifts of the image locations at different wavelengths  and then fine tune it. Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing. So good news.  John, wasn't it February 25th? Wasn't that the day they said we'd get our first images? I guess  maybe they're a little bit behind. Maybe it's next month. Maybe it's March 25th. It's pretty soon.  It's pretty soon. It's been an amazing story. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, right. Because they  have a sun shield, but it gets pretty hot out there. We're starting to see some reviews of the  Steam Deck. We were talking about games. This was a year ago, right? I got in a pre-order. I haven't  gotten an invite.

Transcript:  Thank you. From Sean Hollister on the Verge. Steam Deck review. It's not ready.  He says, both of these things are true. First, I'm having more fun with the Steam Deck than any  gadget I've tested in years. Second, it's a mess. It's rushed. It's unfinished. It's buggy and  unstable. If people sold it at Best Buy or GameStop, they'd be returning it in droves.  But of course, the people who are getting it are all people like you and me, Georgia, who  can't wait. We're in on the beta. $400. Here's the good news, at least from my point of view.  All of these games on this are, it's a Linux box. It's running Linux. So all of these games had to  be rewritten to work with Linux. So it's been a great boon for Linux gaming. It's really good  news for Linux gaming. I don't see Elden Ring on it. Probably won't. No. The fan, apparently  quite noisy, never stops whining, says Sean. There are still many games that don't work.  Battery life, two hours at the highest fidelity. A little disappointing. Nevertheless,  I still feel like there's a lot of promise here. I'm excited about it. You'd buy it, right, Georgia?

Somebody got to figure something out. But she's like, just the concept of being able to  take the games to friends that don't have gaming PCs. She's like, I could get so many more people  to play if I could just take it to them because I can't take my computer over people's house.  I'm like, well, I should get you a laptop that if that's what you're thinking, you just want to go

They're aging out of the kind of really  immersive, imaginative play that little kids do. But it's been interesting watching how the girls,  because I have a daughter, watching the girls bond over creating worlds and setting up rules for them  and then having interactions with them and things like that. But in the course of like, I would say  two years, we went from no one in any of my kids classes having a switch to practically everybody.  And now there are play dates that are set up where everybody brings over their switch or they connect  with each other in social spaces and do that. And the portability, I think, is what makes it easy  because you're not tethered to a whole setup. You can just like pick up your little case  and go and hang out with your friends and pop on. And it's just so easy to set up. I was really

I play Animal Crossing and I thought this was going to be kind of a switch for grownups more  because it's a Windows or Linux machine, quad core Zen 2 processor and 16 gigs of RAM. I mean,  it's a pretty serious device. It's a seven inch screen. It's not huge, but I mean, it's bigger than  you think. That's the size of the switch. It looks like they wanted to make a switch for AAA titles,  kind of. Yeah. Although the gaming on the switch is pretty good, I have to say.

Yeah, well, that is true, isn't it? But there's not a lot of software that challenges modern PCs,  except games. There's some pro stuff, video editing and photo editing and stuff and rocket  launching. But for most users, the games are the hardest challenge. They need the most hardware  for games.

And Leo, I'm sure  I've said this on your show before, but I feel like we're in the dying age of desktop computing,  where the desktop is the primary metaphor for working. And you have now a cohort of people who  are heading into the workplace, who grew up on Minecraft and other really customizable environments.  And I'm sure if you're in your 20s, you're like, well, what is this desktop and file system? Why?  Why can't I create a space that works with the way my brain works?

I think  it's becoming a primary entertainment form. I also think because of eSports, it's only a matter of  time before it's also going to be a spectator sport. Yeah, the gaming is going to be like,

Start time: 5795.86

You think about even the way people watch TV these days, it's a two screen, it's a multi-screen  experience because they're tweeting their reactions, or they're on like online fan communities,  looking at references and parsing things out. And gaming is just, it's, you're not just passively  watching a narrative, you're changing the narrative. Yeah, you're participating in it directly.  And that seems to be something that really resonates with a lot of people.

And people are, the creators are making many of the millions of dollars. I think it's,  I think it's the future of entertainment. So, and I think it's interesting that you're seeing  new form factors. That's the other thing. You know, this, this Steam Deck is a new form factor in  the way you really don't see new PC form factors or new console form factors. So it's kind of  interesting.

Start time: 6121.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And hearing it in VR and going through her journey in VR and hearing it all over around you  was such an empathic experience for me as a therapist, but just for me to kind of  understand someone else's journey, it was really kind of eerie and cool. I think that for some  people it might be too intense because you really do feel like you are there. And I've had people  describe how they would actually talk, eventually they're talking to the voices back and it just  feels like it's a part of them. And I think that it helps some people go understand what someone  that's dealing with psychosis is going through. And also to understand how you believe your world  that you're in, because we only view the world through our own experience of that. And so what  might seem like off to other people is just real and understandable to others. And so I think that  that was a really, it was a really neat experience. So I have a close family member who's been through

Start time: 6181.10

I've been on the outside watching  and it's horrific, but you can't understand what was going on. And this person says it was very  traumatic. They still live the trauma, PTSD from it. So would you think this would be a good game  to play just to kind of, I mean, how close is it? You've not been through psychosis, so you probably-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some people have and actually found that it was really a wonderful experience and they loved the  way that they showed it. And the makers of Hellblade, they really, like Ninja Theory,  hired a psychiatrist who dealt with psychosis. They actually hired people that are going through  psychosis to make sure that it was real and honest. And they had to do that balance of how  far do they go so that they're not doing a disservice, but it's still an honest portrayal of  what is it like to have to go through that.

Transcript:  It's a very cool game because one is it's a puzzle game. So you're in her world and she  sees symbols, which is also something that some people with psychosis can go through.  And you have to actually figure out like whatever you're looking for the letter that looks like a  letter M and you have to kind of move the world so that you find an M. And so the tree plus this  wall makes together a letter M. So there's part puzzle and then there's a part fighting game.  And you go through her story and through it, these voices are mostly kind of saying mean things to  you and putting doubt in your mind. And she's having to fight her internal battle that she's  then expressing outwardly.

But it was like this and it is a creepy thing because he was  going through like mental issues and even spirits, whatever his mind was talking to him,  playing tricks on him. And you'd hear it. If he has a round sound, it would really freak you out  because someone would be in your left ear telling you to do stuff. And you're like, wait, what?  As you're playing the game at night, it would like it would make me jump sometimes. I'm like,  whoa, what is like? Who is having something in the back of your mind?  Yeah.  And this seems great. I mean, I almost I once made me want to put on some daggles.

Transcript:  I have to say the only thing is that if you get motion sickness, I did feel and I don't usually  get motion sickness in VR. I did feel it a little bit because I'm using the controller.  So I'm not walking around the same way I'm looking around, but it was really cool. If not,  you would wear it with a headset at the same time so that you can hear it in 3D.  Really, really neat experience. And I think that experiential things like that you can experience  in a way that seems more real than you could. Like if you want to really experience what it's  like to go into an Egyptian tomb, like doing that in VR, like you get the scale, you can feel  things, you can see them. And so it's a really neat experience. And I think that for this game,  it was it was really cool. I'm happy that I did it in VR instead of just playing it on the computer.

Transcript:  The newest sacrifice and I think Ninja Theory did an amazing job of really caring about being able  to show what people are dealing with with psychosis and not falling into those old tropes of there's  something wrong with her and she's crazy and she's scary and that means that she's dangerous. And I  have to say I applaud them for being able to do that in a really respectful way.

Transcript:  It also raises some really interesting ideas about how a game can be an experience and can  introduce you to the experiences of others by living there, you know, walking a mile in their  shoes to use the cliche. Very interesting. I'll have to have to have to try this.

Start time: 6476.44
End time: 6505.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and definitely play it play it with a headset on if you're going to do it because it's a  really eerie but a neat experience for most people and for some people it might be a little  bit too intense. Yeah. So you're saying do do it in VR.  Yes, I would definitely try it in VR. But you know, grab some fresh ginger afterwards because  you might feel motion sickness. You have to do it in like 45 minutes. Yeah, I will get nauseated

Start time: 6506.18
End time: 6517.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if I spend too much time. Depending on the type of game especially. Yeah, yeah, the movement. I  mean, I got nauseated playing Halo because there was a lot of head bob or something. There was

Start time: 6517.16
End time: 6558.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  just something about it. Yeah, you're moving especially when you're going across the axis.  And if when you zone so I don't get it if I'm using teleport. But if I'm walking, I get much  more motion sickness because what happens is that your brain is getting two different signals,  right? So like you're because I slow the tracking movement, you're kind of getting a different  signal than actually walking. And so because of that, your brain and the horizon are different  and your brain thinks that you're sick, like you've drank eaten some poison or there's something wrong.  And so once you throw up the poison, it's like adaptive mechanism, but it's not really helpful  if you're on a boat or if you're playing VR, our brains are not adapted to VR. And so because of

Start time: 6558.80
End time: 6585.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that, you might feel some motion sickness. I have to stand up and play like if I sit down  and play get nauseous, like if I'm standing up, exactly, exactly. I feel like I can I can,  I play just fine. But like if you sit down, try to come from me, it just throws me all off. And I'm  like, what am I doing in here? It's such a weird, like I said, we're not we're not at peak, you know,  plugging my brain technology, but we'll get there one day. You know, I might try this on my this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that you'll still feel you mean headphones, headphones. Yeah, I think that it's  quite immersive. It's not as much in the world. Because like there's a scene where she she comes  up and she's looking at you. And it's kind of like this out of world feeling in VR. And she goes to  like touch your cheek. And it was really this this strong emotional moment and the voices and  then she kind of like touches you. And I like it did kind of bring me back like that was like a really  interesting experience for it and that you wouldn't get. But you would get it for what it would be  like to hear voices that are around you and in your head and you can't get out of it.

And I want to try some other things that are as engaging  as fun. You know, that's hard to do. Fun. That's why I want to kill monsters in in the Elden Ring.  Yeah, yeah. No, it's not.

Transcript:  I'm holding out hope that I'll find a gaming experience that clicks because you know, I'd say  for example, I used to joke in the early 2000s that I just didn't get the point to radio.  And then I was in a job situation where I was commuting. I was like, broadcast radio,  you don't get the point of broadcast. Well, no, I was gonna say, Leo, this is my conversion.  You're gonna break my heart. No, this is my conversion story because I was like,  what is the point? We can read it on the web or we can read it period or there's video.  And then I was in a job situation where I had to commute for like 90 minutes each way every day.  And I got like, and so I was listening to KQED. And like, all of a sudden, after like a month,  you begin to recognize the conventions of narrative reporting through NPR or California  report or marketplace. And I began to really like started admiring the music selections and  how they move your mood and how efficiently information is imparted. I'm like, I get radio  now. I get the allure. I get it. And I'm sure that's going to happen with a game for me at  some point. It hasn't yet, but I'm open to the possibility and I hope I get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you to use my VPN. I can tell. I can tell. I could see that.  My VPN. My VPN. His VPN. My VPN. ExpressVPN. Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like  leaving your keys in the car while you're running the gas station for a snack. You know, most of the  time you come back, your car's there. Sometimes you come back and there's a guy driving off in  your car. You got to protect yourself every time you connect to an open network, an unencrypted  network, cafes, hotels, airports, anybody on that network can access your personal data,  your financial details, your passwords. Worse, they could do things like impersonate your home  Wi-Fi access point so that your laptop goes, oh, we're home and joins it. And then you're on  their network, baby. Doesn't take a lot of technical knowledge, just some cheap hardware.  A smart 12 year old could do it. And of course, you know, when you think about what they would  do with that, they can make thousands of dollars selling your personal info. They can make your  life miserable. You need a VPN. There's so many good reasons to protect your privacy,  to protect your security, to surf the internet in various places around the world so that you  eliminate geographic restrictions on content. ExpressVPN is an encrypted tunnel. It creates  a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that hackers can't steal your  sensitive data. They can't see your sensitive data. They can't even see that it's you. They just see  gobbledygook flying through the air. It would take, because it's using strong encryption,  it would take a hacker with a supercomputer more than a billion years to get past ExpressVPN's  encryption. Until there's a hacker at the Starbucks using a quantum computer, I think we're okay.  Fire up the app, click a button and you're protected. That's the other thing I love about  ExpressVPN. 94 countries, 160 locations. They devote money to bandwidth so it's very fast,  fast enough to watch HD video. You'll never complain. In fact, you can put ExpressVPN on  everything. Phones, laptops, smart TVs. You can even put it on your router. When you put it on  your router, it's amazing because your whole family, your whole house is protected. But I  can guarantee you this, no one's going to say, what happened to the internet? It's so slow.  It's the same. They don't even know, but they're safe. They're secure. I love that.  Secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com  Twitter. When you go there, there's a list of the routers it works with, a list of the devices,  Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, ExpressVPN.com slash Twitter, EXPRESSVPN.com slash Twitter.  When you buy a one-year package, you get three months free. That's your best deal. Brings down  to below seven bucks a month. You want to pay for a VPN, you got to trust me. You do not want them  to make money off of you. You want to be the customer, not the product. You want them to  invest in their networks. You want them to rotate your IP addresses. All of these make a VPN work  better. ExpressVPN does all of that. They are independently audited on a regular basis to  make sure that they do exactly what they say to verify their privacy policy, to verify this amazing  trusted server technology. There was a great write-up the other day on Bleeping Computer about  ExpressVPN. Actually, I've been using ExpressVPN for years. I didn't even know how they work with  this trusted server technology. The article was because ExpressVPN has a bug bounty of $100,000  to the first person who can hack its servers. In the article itself, they talked about how  hard this is going to be. ExpressVPN's trusted server custom-built operating system based on  Debian Linux, featuring proprietary security enhancements designed for VPN infrastructure.  It's RAM only. They periodically wipe the entire system every reboot. The whole thing starts over.  So no logging, no record of your visit. The system has built-in verification that prevents  insider code tampering events. It's patched every week with clean installations on every server.  How about that? So good luck. The bug bounty has been going for six years, $100,000. No one's  collected it yet. This is the one to use. ExpressVPN.com slash Twitter. We thank them so much for their

Well, so actually let's do a  whole Apple thing because there's a whole bunch of Apple news, but it's all somewhat speculative.  I think 15.4 will come out March 8th, a week from Tuesday. The rumor is that's when Apple  have an event. They'll announce their new iPhone SE with 5G. They'll announce a new iPad Air.  iOS 15.4 will come out. I'm hoping a Mac Mini will come out,  but there will be a new voice on 15.4. I think this is great. I've often wondered why  it's a female voice on these voice assistants. I don't like that.  Apple has given us some choices. They are introducing a new voice that is in fact not  gendered at all. Brilliant. About time. Apple says they hired somebody from the LBGTQ Plus community  to record this. Let me see if I can. I'm trying to find an example of it.  If you have 15.4, you've heard it and I have not heard it yet. I wanted to see you find it,  but I don't think anybody has the sample of it. Gender neutral voice option. Let me see if CNET has  it. Nobody. Darn it. I was hoping. Yeah, it's Pat. Somebody said, is it Pat? Yeah, it's Pat.  Could be a guy. Could be a gal. We don't know. We don't care. Do you think that's a good thing,  Lisa? Why should it be a female voice or even a male voice?

I think that launching Siri as female along with and I believe Google  Assistant's inaugural voice defaulted to female. I think it said a lot about some of the baked in  cultural assumptions that the people developing these assistants had and chose not to examine.  The fact that they defaulted to, we're going to make this assistant, we're going to have it present  as female and we think it's perfectly natural to have a female presenting technology subordinate to  your desires and wishes and making your life easier. I think that says a whole lot more about  the culture inside tech companies and the culture inside development teams

I mean,  a human recorded it, but it's a robot. You're talking to a robot. It helps you remember that  it's a piece of assistive technology that augments the human sphere. Do you encourage your daughter  to treat Siri like a human or like a robot? So what I've tried to do is model how you should  talk to Siri and Google Assistant with things like Siri, could you please set a timer for 10 minutes?  Or if Siri answers a query for us in the car, I'll say thank you, Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing. That's you in the text and that's a little bubble inside your head.  There's no other interaction involved, but if you're modeling a conversation,  and not all conversations have to be like the one we're having now where we're striving to  exchange ideas and come to a common understanding, sometimes it's just an information exchange.  And if you have those and you do have those information exchanges with people,  so why wouldn't you model the kind of behavior that you hope somebody applies to a person to  person information exchange? Develop good habits.  From person to technology. Develop good habits.  Exactly. Because it's a habit.  It's the same. Why?  It's the same way you always drink a glass of water or you make sure you always have  things like that. It's just another good habit.

Transcript:  No, I don't think there's ever a bad time to model courtesy, not to animals,  not in any sort of exchange.  Be nice to the robots. They deserve it.  Yeah. Well, yeah, exactly. There's a really good short story.  I can't remember if I found the link off Boing Boing, but the premise was that in the short  story, there was a guy who actually really enjoyed being verbally abusive to his AI assistant,  setting it up to present as female and being abusive with it.  And then the AI was like, oh, is this how we're playing? I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think it's just a good habit. They're not human and that's fine. But I think that if you're  want to model behavior, it's so close. Our brain does not know the difference between conversation  with a human and not with a human because that's not the way that our brains have not changed  almost at all in 150,000 years. So if you want your children to practice being polite,  and since they're interacting so much with technology, they should be a polite across  every single scale of conversation so that when they feel frustrated and upset, which  since I'm interacting with Siri is a lot of the time, they can do that and deal with that  frustration and still be polite instead of wanting to say that you're a dip head.  Please. In my head, I say horrible things to Siri outwardly.  It's great. I think that it's wonderful to have different choices of voices. I think that being  represented is really important. I think that that matters a lot. That Siri still doesn't  understand intonation that if I'm whispering, don't shout back at me. That might be a really

What I think is really interesting is my daughter will  pit Google Assistant and Siri against each other where she'll ask them both the same question.  She'll ask them both the question and she'll see how they answer it. I find it really interesting  that she's always testing to see which assistant is more useful and legitimate to her needs.  There's just some sort of techno skepticism that she seems, I don't know where she got it from,

First of all, in my mindset, I was thinking the reason  it's a female voice is because women should be running the planet because men screw up everything  and nobody wants to hear somebody man explaining to me how they didn't turn off the mic.

Parenthetically, the Air Force for years has used female voices in the heads up displays. Pull up,  pull up, pull up, because they thought men listen to their mothers. If they're blacking out,  they're redding out, if they hear their mom saying, pull up, pull up. All the things,

So, yeah, it's like, I told you, they know, they know there is  nothing like a human voice for some things like for instance, audible.com. I want a human voice to  read to me, right? But I don't, but I don't want a human voice on my Amazon Echo or my Siri. I like  the idea of it sounding like a robot because I, and I think it's why I think it's important to teach  kids. Yes, you want to get them in the habit of please and thank you. That's important. I had a  guy call me the other day, call me sir on the radio show, sir, sir, sir. I said, are you in the  military? He said, no, I'm just polite. But he, but he was, I, you know, in fact, Aunt Pruitt,  we'll call people Mr. and Miss and all that. I like that. I think it's a Southern thing, but,  yeah, it's the South, but you gotta know, but you gotta know the difference between a human  and a robot. And I think the other thing kids need to learn is these are not humans. It might  feel like it. You might emotion. I don't, I worry about a kid getting, I know intellectually they  know, but I worry about them getting some sort of emotional sense that I'm interacting. It's  easy to get in that, I think. And I think it's important that they know the distinction. Have  you ever watched the movie Her? Yes. He fell in love with her. He fell in love with her. Yes.

But I find it so interesting that we're going to have basically the suite of  technical tools that's going to try to meet people where they are emotionally and then  move them to a different place emotionally in the service of a customer transaction.  That's so manipulative.  It's so, it's so wild that this is what people want to do with the technology.

They're getting better and better,  but there is nothing like a real reader. And that's what Audible is all about. Audiobooks  performed, not read, performed by some of the best performers in the world. In fact,  when you get a celebrity audio book, a biography or autobiography, often they'll read it. Steve  Martin reading, Bourne standing up. It's like he's in the room. It's fantastic. Get experts talking  to you like they're in the room. Audible has more than just audio books, more than just  celebrity memoirs. They've got mysteries and thrillers. They've got self-help, motivation,  wellness. They've got business. They've got podcasts, thousands of them from popular favorites  plus exclusive news series.

Audible gives members a chance to listen  to and discover new favorites and explore different formats. And that's part of what makes your  membership so much more valuable.

And so he's completely nerding out explaining to us,  oh, and this has happened when the dinosaurs were walking the earth. And this happened when people  were just... The thing is, he's dropping all of these technical terms. And I was like, how lucky  we are. And I won't remember any of this because it's just... Nope. There's not enough room in the

Oh, that's the volcano that blew up in Oregon and made Crater Lake. And maybe  the old man of the lake was in that volcano. We don't know. I think that's hysterical. Does the  ranger understand the irony of the fact that you're going in a boat in this lake, and he says,  and there's the old man of the lake, a log that's been floating here for 100 years. Does he  understand the irony of that? Or does he just do it straight? He does it straight. They have their

Transcript:  It depends on what you really enjoy. Gaming, it should be towards something that you already  enjoy doing. For me, it's just stress relief. I want something kind of mindless. I can come in,  I can come out. I don't have to worry. I get a little bit of dopamine from whatever,  a Candy Crush game or doing a puzzle solver like The Room where you're in an area and you have to  find the clues and put them away. It's just a really fun, beautiful, easy to start and end game  or all play people against boggle. I like quick and easy games, those really long, expansive games.  I don't have the time to be able to go through it. Lisa, it seems like you're doing a million  different things. I don't think that you'd have a lot of time to be able to do a game that you're  going to have to spend a lot of effort in doing. I would say something that's more like a casual,  something that's good for your brain and you're doing like whatever, words with friends or other  things where you can have a little cute little competition going, but it isn't something that's  really serious or that's going to take up a lot of time. Good idea. Casual gaming, iPad, iPhone

I'm sure that a little bit of competition will get the  blood going. And when you shoot a turtle at a kid and they scream and cry when they're about to make  first place, there's no greater joy. I know you said you don't want violence. It's not violent.  It's just a turtle. Oh no, it's not violent until the kids get upset. And that's the kind of violence  I enjoy. Making children sad when you hit them with a little turtle or you drop a banana peel

WandaVision from  Black and White Wanda. Oh, Monochrome Wanda. Yes. That's how the show starts out. My  twit wife, Georgia Dow does an excellent job recapping that show. If you want to feel like  you know something about mindsets and psychology, you should go watch those episodes first. They're  fan tabulous on WandaVision. But today is a special day. First of all, I never promote myself in the  show. If you watch the show, you know me. I don't care if you go check out what I do, whatever.  But Doctails is back. I did interview Jeff Jarz. I just interviewed Jason Howe. I got Lisa Laporte  on deck. Leo's done a show back in the day. Jordan's on there. A lot of new people coming on. I also  do a sports show every week. It is fantastic. It's called Gritty Nights. Get a drink, come hang out.  IQMZ Tech is now back where I rant and rave and I do a poor man's Uncle Leo once a week talking  about the tech news on my own show. So IQMZ.com. All the links are live. Go there and check it out.  Now after that, let me tell you something. We are coming out of a pandemic and Leo and I have been  alone for two years. Let me tell you something. When you come out of this world, there are a lot  of people that you need to not contact again. Okay. So as much as you missed family members  and friends and I told you to reach out to those people, love those people, you've also lost a lot  of losers. Don't you pick them losers back up when this world starts opening up. Some people need to  be left behind. Do good for yourself. Leave the baggage behind. Look for better things,  better opportunities, better people. Know one thing. You cannot waste your time. You've already  suffered two years of loss of time. Don't waste it out here with people that don't deserve or value  you and your time. Be choosy. Be picky. Take care of yourself. Treat yourself out here in these  streets. Now the world's opening up. Okay. Focus on you and better people around you. I'm your boy  with JJ Stone aka O Doctor and as they say, another twit is in a can. Amen, brother.
