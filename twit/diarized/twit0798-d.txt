Start time: 294.80
End time: 310.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 380.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so  They've they've also said that the police are not gonna really enforce this as much as they're gonna be sort of like requesting and advising  So nobody's gonna get fined for doing it. But you know, we're kind of in this weird situation where  We're having to to do things to try to mitigate the spread of kovat 19, but also trying to  Make people feel like they can continue their daily life  And it's it's a real struggle because you can't go back from telling people that they can now  You know go go out to restaurants  It's really difficult to go back from that because people are they're tired of it they're tired of the situation  They want to be able to go to the bars and go out to restaurants and they don't like being told that they can't even  Though they would have in March or April now that they were allowed to and now having that taken back from them. That's just  It's just it's kind of just part of our emotional state people just don't want to do it anymore  It the same exact thing happened during the Spanish flu  They you know  it's they had mask mandates and then they took away the mask mandates and then they put the mandates back in and  Everybody went wild because they didn't want to have to wear masks anymore. We're just going through the same thing again

Start time: 865.92
End time: 878.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the question I have about all of these hearings is how useful are they if you are talking to a bunch of legislators?  Who still aren't quite up to date on the scope and the breadth of what these social networks do?

Start time: 879.40
End time: 889.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these were blatantly political the last time  Is was it again this time pretty much? I mean and why even bother the elections over? What do they hope to gain at this point?

Start time: 889.72
End time: 917.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is still an issue  Yeah, I mean it's it's i'm glad that we're talking about it  The timing is probably not very useful because it's because of the lame duck session. Yeah  But it's an important conversation and I actually I think that  Legislatures are starting to learn more about it. We've seen some really smart  Questions and takedowns and some really stupid ones too  But it kind of depends on this legislator and if they've learned anything in this election cycle, it's that the internet matters

Start time: 918.66
End time: 929.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, uh the other point somebody made is where's susan mojinsky on this doesn't isn't youtube  At least as culpable as facebook and twitter at spreading election disinformation

Start time: 930.64
End time: 943.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's hard to measure culpability, but it's so important. I mean  this the the  Algorithmic rabbit holes that people go down and never come out of are so damaging

Start time: 944.36
End time: 1022.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so I was at an event I  May have been rsa or it was another one where um  A senior leadership team from youtube was speaking and they were supposed to be addressing the topic of here's how diversity helped us  Deal with concerns that were coming up with our youtube for kids product and I thought oh this ought to be good since um  how youtube  aims its uh  Offerings at children and and again pulls those kids into rabbit holes where yes  They're just clicking and what was interesting is when the youtube executives began speaking  They said well, we were identifying a real problem with our youtube kids product. I thought oh, this is great  We're going to start talking about oh there were videos that were inserting upsetting content or they weren't factual or they were marketing pitches  And like and they said the problem is the kids weren't spending enough time on the app  And it wasn't sticky enough  So  At how they were using it so we could boost engagement  And we're just not we're just not addictive enough. That's the problem. You know about youtube's priorities. They're wow  And the argument i'm sure they'll make is we're not a publisher. We don't have to be responsible for the content on our platform  but yet I think you do have an executive team at youtube where  Engagement is is their top concern over anything else?

Start time: 1023.08
End time: 1039.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think you can say the same thing on facebook. I don't know about twitter  Twitter's priorities are more free speech than engagement. I think but but but literally youtube and facebook's entire  algorithmic  System is designed to make increase engagement stickiness to get you to spend more time there, right?

Start time: 1040.10
End time: 1079.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were just in the house talking about this this morning that one of the interesting side effects of that is that so we know  That fear and anger create engaging content and people do engage which is why so many young men get radicalized on youtube  Yeah  And it's and it's upsetting but one of the things that it leaves is really bad marketing  So as we kind of go through time  I think when you start to think about facebook as a product your emotional reaction to that product is generally negative now because when you log  In you see negative stuff and I think over time it's going to kill these brands. Maybe not youtube, but facebook  It's really bad for them  Yeah  Well, if you believe because it's unpleasant

Start time: 1080.16
End time: 1128.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't think anybody at either facebook or twitter  Or youtube is saying oh, yes  Look for the most the stuff that makes you angriest or look for the stuff that makes you more upset  They're simply saying it's easy. It's a simple thing  What content generates the most engagement? What do people stay watching the longest? What gets them to click more?  What keeps them on the site longer?  That's all you have to do and and and it's the nature of humanity lindsey that  That means you're going to get the angry  Crazy all this stuff. Yeah, and this is what happened to local news, right?  You know, it was local television news. You know film at 11. It was all about  Engagement and it ended up going the lowest common denominator. It's what happened don hamley song dirty laundry dirty laundry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That  Now I was recently rereading neil steffensen's book fall or dodge in hell love that book  But there's the entire section in the middle where one of the characters sophia as a college student is going through part of the country  She's not used to being in and negotiating with subculture. She's not used to yes  And what I thought was really interesting in that book was a stevenson  Uses facebooked as an adjective to describe a type of online or or even face-to-face discourse  That is all about getting that engagement rush as opposed to a substantive exchange of ideas  and um  One of the geniuses of good sci-fi writers  Is there really good at kind of anticipating where you're going to be five ten fifteen years down the road and the fact that he  was already pegging social media as this  As this what is the opposite of a value add whatever the opposite of a value value subtract  Yeah, a value subtract. I guess yeah, but yeah  He was talking about like that and I couldn't help but think about that with you know, a lot of uh  What we're looking at now in terms of how what role did social media play?

Start time: 1196.34
End time: 1241.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um fall also has I love I love the book. It's a little hard. It's not maybe not a great novel, but  As usual with neil the the ideas are really provocative  One of the other things people in fall do is they wear a mask  Which is initially intended to defeat face recognition because it's so ubiquitous  But ultimately what ends up happening is you can project you have you own different persona  All signed with the crypto key and all that and you can project the persona the person you want to be at the moment you're  Being it whether it's hanging out with your friends or at a store  that you completely control  the  Person that is in public and I thought that was a really interesting idea that's going to happen

Yeah  Youthening  Just in time for fleets  Which is not an enema  Well, actually it is an enema but it's also  Twitter's disappearing tweets which look exactly like snapchat's disappearing tweets, which look exactly like instagram's  Disappearing movies. It's pretty much they didn't even bother to make it look different. It's still it's a circle at the top of the twitter  thing  Um, but what do you think of the name? Is that a good name?

Transcript:  I have a completely opposite opinion on this one. You love you love fleets. I haven't made a single one yet, but  My experience I think with rolling out new features social media is in general twitter  Especially has tested the daylights out of anything that they roll out and they're pretty certain  It's going to be successful and that people want it  And then also people like people who are really engaged in twitter love to complain about changes  But it'll catch on and I promise like you mark my words in a year if somebody takes away fleets  People will be really really upset and I also think that if you're not into instagram  And you're into twitter for different reasons. It gives you a chance to do some things that you wouldn't do on instagram because instagram isn't a news platform  So it gives you a chance to use a different format for that kind of commentary  And let's say you don't want them to stay in your timeline forever  There are people, you know who delete their timelines every week because they just don't want a record of it. Oh, yeah  I wish there are a lot of people who just every week go back and delete all their tweets because they just don't want it on the record  That's actually now there's another way to do it and I can't take credit for this insight

But sometimes you just like you just want to say something to the world  You just want to yell it into the void but twitter is not that void but you do it anyway, and then later you go  Oh, yeah, I forgot. I did that i'm gonna take that down now and even like we've heard of some people  Who have like their entire careers were destroyed because of some sort of flippant thing that they weren't thinking  They didn't think about before they tweeted it and you know 24 hours later  It's it's still there. It's still horrible or maybe they took it down and put an apology there, but it's like  if you if you  You know have the option for it to just disappear after 24 hours  Maybe people will forget that you said that really stupid thing that you didn't mean to say, you know, like there's  Or never noticed in the first place or maybe never noticed in the first place.

Yeah, they've gotten better  They're they're starting to realize  That they actually have to ask important questions and it's not just a place to say  You know will you promise to do x y and z because that's my platform. They don't they don't do that as much they really are  Coming to the table now with like, okay. Here's what our constituents are actually worried about  Here's what what are what we've been researching and there are people who are kind of behind the scenes telling them things  Like this is what's going on. This is what the issue is  This is what we need to work on and they're starting to bring that to the table now  And I think that we will see some real discussions being had about this sort of thing in the near future  Maybe within the next year

Transcript:  so  I guess the question is and maybe it was ted cruise who?  crystallized this he asked uh  Doris jack dorsey about twitter's decision to add labels  To the president's tweets about voter fraud  Cruz said you're a publisher when you're doing that  He barked you're entitled to take a policy position, but you don't get to pretend  You're not a publisher and therefore get special benefit under section 230. That doesn't  seem  Unfair just for those who are not following this it's something we've been talking about for months  section 230 of the communications decency act says in effect  that uh, just because you're publishing on the internet  A comment section a chat room twitter facebook doesn't mean you're a publisher and in fact you're protected  In if you decide to delete content or not delete content  You can't be sued for what a third party posts on your site now clearly facebook  YouTube twitter are publishers too of content that they create  But that most of the content on those sites are not created by them  So they're not liable for that that many people consider is the as a foundational law that made the internet possible  I know I wouldn't be able to have an irc chat room if I could be sued for what people say in there  I wouldn't have comments on a forum or on a youtube post if I if I were be liable for what they say  So that protects me  And it has been a very important thing for the development of the internet  But it is true that if you start acting like a publisher you shouldn't have a safe harbor, right?

Start time: 2020.30
End time: 2047.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and leo there's also  something to consider which is that  Just like you're saying you wouldn't you wouldn't have a a forum if if you weren't protected  but there are lots of people who are harassed and  You know like have all kinds of horrible things said to them said about them  And and these non publishers like twitter and facebook and stuff. They just shrug and say  We didn't do it. So we're not going to really make a big deal about it

Transcript:  I think they get really nervous about policing it and this is a problem with 230 and I don't know what the solution is  But they get really nervous about policing it because I think that they are concerned  That once they start to police in a detailed way  They are then liable to police everything which they can't figure out how to 230 specifically says though

Start time: 2068.36
End time: 2111.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do that and it doesn't make you a publisher you can  So  And even if you act as a publisher in some aspects  That doesn't mean you're suddenly liable for content that third parties put on your site. I have a blog  I'm liable for the blog content, but i'm not liable under section 230 for the comments on that blog  That and that's one thing ted cruz is a little confused about  But and there's very specifically a safe harbor so that you this is the other thing that these guys I think don't understand  If you eliminate 230  That eliminates moderation  Because it's 230 that's protecting you when you moderate  Yes  You don't you lindsay you think that it it

Start time: 2112.02
End time: 2202.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Any moderation i'm trying to go back to my very very early days on the internet and i'm talking about like the year 2000  And how much time we spent kind of worrying about the degree to which?  We and meaning publishers  Got involved at all because the concern was if you start to get involved then you are acting as a publisher  And deleting is one thing and I think that we have evolved the internet has evolved  And all of the understanding of laws and this one in particular has evolved to allow us to do more  Deleting to protect people  But there is still but it could be argued the opposite could be argued  Which is that once you start to make decisions and really detailed decisions about what is fair game?  You're then responsible for all decisions and you're acting as a publisher because you are editing  And so I think that the social media sites have had to try to navigate this and they do it wrong a lot  But I think that 230 itself probably needs to evolve to give more flexibility  To allow that safe harbor without publishers having to worry  About going a step too far and then becoming responsible  For what people are saying on that platform  It's it's just a tough tough question because it's true. I think it's fair to say that  Um, you know twitter is in many ways playing a communications role. That's more similar to  The phone company that a common carrier instead of a publisher  But it is not the same as a phone company because the the record is permanent and it's not one-to-one  So it is a difficult one

Start time: 2203.26
End time: 2303.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, um to get into more of the internet old school thing. I actually remember  Um  in  1995 people were debating whether or not isps were considered publishers because  They would allow people to put up bonkers websites. Um, I actually in 1995  I did some I did a news story on storm front because they had rolled out their website and they had forums and were beginning to recruit  And the question was the isp that lets storm front run its operation. Are they responsible as a publisher and  Ultimately, they concluded no the whole point to a common carrier is it provides a service to anyone who can pay the fee  And there are terms and conditions for the service, but you can't  Just go in willy-nilly. It has to be something that's provably  detrimental to the service  um  Well, that's what I wonder is if social media is going to get to the point where they're going to argue that they're more like  an isp  in that they're equal they they offer equal access  and um as such  It's just whoever can pay to play gets to  Yeah  You know, it's because it seems these are all companies that are, you know fundamentally selling data  What they generate on the end the harassment campaigns or the incorrect tweets or the facebook groups that are used to organize  Like that's the user experience  But from a business model every single one of these companies is in the business  Of harvesting data and then selling slice and dice data products to somebody else  so  They're going to do whatever there are two things here. There's the law which is very clear

Start time: 2303.24
End time: 2443.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact that one of the things i'm i'm so hesitant to modify  230 because it is it is so almost perfect in its very simplistic  Clear description. It's almost like a constitutional amendment. It's very  Simple there's also though public pressure if you are publishing storm front you may not be violating the law  But you may also be subject to intense public pressure and this is this is not to obviate that the the the need  For a society to you know, in other ways say hey, we don't like that  You shouldn't do it. But but what they're saying is government should not get involved in this  It's important to remember that the reason 230 exists  Was a lawsuit against prodigy  That's how long ago this was  Prodigy in an effort to provide and i'm reading from mike maznik's excellent  Post on tech dirt.com in order to provide a family-friendly environment prodigy did some moderation of its message boards  In and in the in the lawsuit stratin oakmont versus prodigy  The judge ruled that since prodigy did moderate the boards. It would be liable  For anything it left up at the time the state of the law was such that that was the case so section 230 was written  to explicitly overrule that judicial  decision  So that sites like prodigy would not have liability if they moderated it would give them  The right to moderate without suddenly becoming a publisher  It's really really important without that. I don't know if you have the internet  You know, there are there are a lot of lawsuits that were just preemptorily  Stopped because section 230. Nope, you cannot sue  twitter for something  Lisa's husband posts on there  Right mark zuckerberg can't come up come come after twitter for that  And that's right. That's the way it should be. He does look like data. There's nothing mark zuckerberg  Can do about it  So I I think we gotta be careful about modifying it  I really makes me nervous because it is pretty close to I feel pretty close to perfect  But that's i'm just arguing against you a little bit lindsey on that oh that's totally fair

And I think it's really important to understand how important a company like tibco is  in the modern world if you're a and I can I can actually I think I can do this by giving you some examples  If you're a company  Nowadays everything's instrumented, you know, you've got lots of information flooding in from your factories from your stores  From your customers tons of information all the time  that  I think if you're an executive you look at you say I know if I could just somehow  Um, I think if I could just somehow  Massage that information connect that information I could gain insights from it that would change how we do business  That's what tibco does  They there are three pillars to tibco. They let you capture  data  Connect to that data  Unify it and then predict  Based on that data take an example panera, you know panera everybody knows panera so panera's  Problem, it's called covet 19 all of a sudden these stores that were vibrant thriving people coming and going  Nobody's coming in anymore. Nobody can come anymore. So panera needed to know what do we do?  to change  Our business they had the data they used tibco to unify the data to analyze it  And they were able to figure out. Oh, I know we do we create panera bread grocery  And they knew exactly what menu items what what what products to cook  And what they could sell they were able to diversify their business during quarantine because they had a solid flexible master data management foundation  from  Tibco it supported quick updates new product additions, you know the name tibco i'm betting  You've probably seen it on their mercedes amg patronus f1 team, right?  Seven world championships, that's another good example of a huge amount of data an f1 formula 1 race car  Is instrumented to the to the ninth level?  I mean every single thing on that car is setting out megabytes of information every second  tons of information  How do you use that information to tell you how to drive the car how to tune the car how to handle the next race?  With tibco's deep technical expertise and connecting  disparate systems unifying the data and then predicting outcomes with advanced analytics  They won seven world championships for the university of iowa's their hospital and clinics  They were able to use the data gathered from surgeries from patients  And they were they were able to reduce their surgical site infections by 74 percent. That's what analytics can do for you  That's what tibco can do for you. They solve tomorrow's impossible business problems by connecting seamlessly connecting any application device  Or data source. That's the first pillar  Intelligently unifying that data so you have better access trust and control of it  That's the second pillar and then confidently predicting business outcomes with real-time data driven intelligence  This is business intelligence to the nth degree. This is the next  Level tibco gives businesses the things they need the information they need to succeed  Data is there's no question about it the transformative energy of the modern enterprise  And tibco is there to help its customers unlock the value of their real-time data to create a competitive asset  I think there's nothing more real time than the data coming into an f1 race car  constant flow of data real time  Tibco can set it up so that they you can analyze that and use it and get those insights  Fuel the modern enterprise through tibco's connected intelligence  You want to know more about tibco and how they unlock the value of your company's real-time data?  tibco tibco.com  podcast  That's tibco.com  podcast  Really interesting company.

Transcript:  The  Yeah, the premise of that in the apple video last week a pulp fiction still it is isn't it?  It's just wild was the instant on on mac laptops. The funny thing is  Mac laptops have always been instant on I have never had a delay to opening up the mac laptop  I don't know why they decided to pick that there's so many other things you could talk  But I did want to point out there have been a couple of really useful articles  In the aftermath of this what happens with any apple event at least it does for me  Even without steve jobs, there is a reality distortion field  They're so good at marketing that you watch this and you're and you start drooling you say god  I don't know. I gotta have that I want to have that so it's really important to step back after that and say, okay  But really what is it? Is it gonna what's the difference gonna be?  and also of course for  everybody independent press to get  And users to get their hands on these devices and see what they really are like in the real world  So a couple of things have been happening over the last two weeks. First of all people are getting  Their new macbook airs or macbook pros or new mac minis with the m1 chip  And there has been in general huge  Excitement people are saying this thing is these are fast. These are  These are this is battery life that to die for these are really nice machines  With none of the flaws people were worried about with the first generation product  And then the next thing that's happening is I think some very good journalists have stepped up ours  technica had a great piece with craig federighi johnny suruji and  Who else there was a third person in there talking about the process of design and om malik who  I always I miss giga ohm  And ohm is you know now he's a vc, but he's still got that journalist hat on he spent some time talking about  The m1 chip and some really interesting conversations  About what it means  And he said and I think this is  Kind of true that this is this is really what's from day one  Steve jobs was aiming for this was  He calls it steve jobs last gambit  We're learning that apple's been planning this for years at least three years  It takes three years for them to conceive of a chip to from then to shipping it  And so they're aiming some degree into the future  I also think and this is again taking off from ohm  the m1 is a is is a I think a  A phase change in desktop computing  that  Something has happened that will that will change intel that will change amd  That will change windows forever one of the things he says chips have become so complex that you need integration and specialization  To create better performance and control power consumption  That's one of the advantages apple has they do the software they do the hardware and they do all the hardware now  He also says and I thought this was interesting when I saw the chip a huge amount of it is devoted to machine learning  He said machine learning will define the capabilities of software in the future  The unified memory architecture, which means ram is much faster perhaps more efficient  You may not need as much ram  Am it talk me off the ledge now?  I'm not going to ask lori to do this because we've been talking because i'm going to push you right. I know you're going to push me  off  But but lindsay and lisa talk me off the ledge here. Am I nuts to think that this is  I'll start with you lindsay because you're you look at this is you look at the industry as a whole  And then i'll and then i'll go to lisa because she's a windows person do you think  Do you think this is that kind of a phase change?

Transcript:  The other thing that's important is that  As much as microsoft would love to do this  They can't  Uh, they can't design their own chips because they've got oems  They've got lenovo and dell and hp and everybody's making these they can't do suddenly do what apple's done and said no go  We're going to use microsoft chips. No  They can't they have windows historically's biggest, uh boat anchor has been legacy  They're not going to abandon legacy apple does for some reason they don't seem I guess because they have a tiny market share  They don't seem to mind cutting people off at the knees and saying sorry the future is now  Microsoft never does that  And yet I have to think if you're a windows laptop user  You're looking over the fence at 22 hour battery life at better performance and and and saying  Uh, so what do you so so tell me from on the other side of the fence lisa?  How's it look over there? That was a good setup

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think  um  Unless you're on a computer for 22 hours straight, um, you know  Battery life is is going to be a lot more personal. Um, I think the  The thing that made me sit up and pay attention was actually in tech crunch  Where the reviewers said oh this thing works like an ipad matthew panser. Yeah  Yeah, and then said the click is responsive every interaction is immediate  It feels like an ios device in the best way  And the reason I thought that was really important is because it points to a trend that we're actually seeing on the windows side  too, which is the notion that computing is um  not going to be  Based on the model that we're used to where the keyboard and the mouse are your primary sources of input  And data manipulation and data access we're moving to  a model where it's going to be tactile and immediate and  You and your data are going to flow between  You know your mobile device and your laptop device and back and forth  and I thought it was interesting that apple is  Massaging and amplifying user expectations for a shift that's already in progress  And a shift that's already been happening with people who are hardcore surface surface users for quite a while

Transcript:  Yeah, no desktop as a service is a huge and growing market for enterprise folks and it's gotten a real boost from  well 2020 because  When any enterprise is faced with having to support people virtually  Instead of being able to just like walk over and see why somebody is hitting the restart button repeatedly and not getting to ring it up  You know, uh daas. It's just you can pop in see what they're doing  Reconfigure things reboot it for them. Um get it going  and you know microsoft was  I guess the best way to put it is you know, microsoft's like yes, this is going to be a thing  Yes, we've already they've already got a really strong cloud-based position and they've seen phenomenal growth in their cloud-based  services for the enterprise like not just azure we're talking like office 365 has been great for them, too  And this is another logical outgrowth of that where if if I get a customer to pay for a service rather than a license

Start time: 3534.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But are they really aiming at the same audience?  For all that we're sitting here talking about this, you know a lot of microsoft's bread and butter is and really  um  almost boring or  You know, we run the world type places like hospital offices or school administrations things like that  And apple's done a really good job of colonizing a much different set of offices and industry verticals  So I don't know if you can necessarily  Compare them one to one anymore. They're very different companies in a lot of way microsoft makes an increasing percentage of its revenue quarter over quarter based on  Cloud-based services and data manipulation whereas apple is beginning to move into consumer-based services and  Emphasis on wearables and phones and things like that. Um  So maybe they're not they're not  You can't really do business parity in my opinion. They're both part of like a personal computing ecosystem, but they have very  different  Functions. I mean it's the same thing you can have  um  to use another metaphor you can have like your kitchen aid mixer and you can have your coffee maker and  Both of them can be beautifully designed and do what they're going to do  But you can't interchange them. You can't make coffee in a in a five-quart mixer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um  Now matter of mind, this is just a personal opinion  And this is also based on you know watching trends in the enterprise and things like that  If you are an end user  You're probably going to conceive of computing as this is the collection of data and experiences and apps that are in my personal cloud  And I access them through any one of a wide variety of hardware devices  For the companies it's going to be a slightly different relationship where they're like  these are going to be the services we offer and these the devices and appliances we offer and these are the configurations we offer  And um, you're not going to have people locked into different platforms. You're going to have them maybe locked into different  Services based on how easy it is to move their stuff around and access it but  If if somebody is an apple partisan, it's it's not oh, I I only store things in iCloud  I never use google drive or gmail like that's just not how it works.

Well, what about boot camp? Will I be able to run windows on this in fact?  Uh in the ars technica article, uh, I think craig faragi said that's up to microsoft. They gotta figure that out  We're not gonna it's not our job to get windows running on our new macintoshes  Maybe the answer is I don't run windows on my macintosh. I run windows virtual desktop  In a browser  And now I have everything I want I have a cloud I have I have windows I have a personal device  That is aesthetic and beautiful and powerful. I get everything I want is that

Transcript:  I mean I I would in theory you could run it in a bra. Here's what I find really interesting  uh  while a number of manufacturers  Including microsoft have been you know said well we're going to embrace the m1 chip  But we're not going to do it right away or you know offices currently in beta google within days said oh, here's chrome  And I thought about it. I realized that's actually  Because I think google sees chrome as the window into windows virtual desktop. I know they see chrome as the window into stadia  People complain. Oh my m1. It's not going to play video games doesn't have a discrete gpu. Who cares? You're going to be running  uh, so I I just  When that hit me, I thought I don't have to worry about native games on my mac on my new mac  Because i'm going to run chrome native and it's going to use web asem or whatever  Technologies pwa technologies it uses to and I can play fortnight. I could play I ordered pre-ordered cyberpunk 2077  I could play all of that because it's it's not running on the machine. It's running in the cloud. I'm streaming it  to a browser  I think that's to me  That's why I think this is a sea change and I don't know what it's going to how it's going to shake out  but I think you  I think you actually you nailed it lisa by saying  Yours is a personal thing like my wristwatch is a you know, or a piece of jewelry is a personal object a commodity  That's mine my phone  But it's a window into a larger  Toolset that is actually probably in the cloud much of it, right and this this is microsoft's perfectly positioned for that  All right, nothing to say i'm going to take a break

Transcript:  No, no, no, no rcs is rich communication services. Basically, we're talking about google's response to apple's messages  So apple has never of course put messages anywhere but on apple devices  But people want the features  That apple's messages offer  Uh google was hoping that they could get the mobile carriers to do this  Mobile carriers like sms. Nobody else does  Uh, and and the carriers really dragged their feet. So last year google finally threw up their hands  And said fine  We'll do it  Uh, they actually bought a company that did rcs  Uh, and as of this week google completed a rollout of rcs for all android phones using android messenger  Or I guess they call it google messages. I don't know you never know with google what the hell their messaging platform is  But I guess it's now google messages  It has rcs and they are  Starting to put in end-to-end encryption as well  And the problem is  On apple you're still a green bubble doesn't matter what you do  If you're on android, you're a damn green bubble and you're and you're discriminated against  And apple's not going to ever put apple's messages on android  and I just it's a shame because  It feels like  It's siloed in both cases mostly because it is and it has become you're right is 100 become a social thing

You know, what's good about they're on discord servers and they moms not on discord  actually  I am on discord and the reason i'm on discord is because I couldn't get my kids to text me back  I joined discord and I my username is your mom and I  Friended one of my children  And he came back to me. It was like lol. Ha ha ha and i'm like no really i'm your mom  Oh my god, I thought you were just somebody like a friend of mine trolling me  And then both of my kids have been like this is great.

Transcript:  That's too bad because yeah  That means i'm kind of stuck still on an iphone using  messages  Until somebody does a gateway or something  Maybe there's a messages to discord gateway  Isn't this a little bit of the risk apple faces by not?  Opening up messages that somebody's going to come along be cross-platform  And just take the market away from them is that so I think the the problem is

Start time: 4583.04
End time: 4649.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for from my perspective and maybe this isn't the way everybody uses their devices, but  the the  The messages app on iphone is the default messages app and that's why I use it  It has nothing to do with where my friends are what platforms they use. It's the text messaging  Thing for the phones, you know, i'm i'm old enough that there was just text messaging back then and so that's my that's default where I go  so  I have you know a number of different ways that I chat with people slack and discord and all these other things  But if I want to talk to a person  I just go to the thing where I text message people which on the phone is  Is the messages app?  I don't think it's a it's a competition type thing if I was on an android phone  That is the thing that I would use to text message people. It's just how I think of it  I I and I really do like again i'm going back to the it's it's really a status thing when you can say  I've got the blue bubble. I don't think it's that the messages app is so great and doesn't everybody wish they had something similar  No, everybody just wants a blue bubble. That's all it is, you know

Transcript:  Is uh, there any chance apple will adopt?  Rcs no, they don't need rcs. They have all the features of rcs  in their siloed app  It's market pressure is the only so what can convince say this is a mess. That's the problem  That's two it's too fragmented a market for any one thing even in google's rcs  To threaten apple's messages so they could just sit back and say yeah fine. Have fun

Start time: 4679.26
End time: 4733.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know what they should do and they might do because they  user experience is important to apple and what they should do and hopefully would do is make  The kind of features that interact with android devices, for example a lot easier. So  renaming a group message or tap backs that  you know make sense to an android user or  um, you know being able to pin  Um the the group message that has an android user in it  Like if apple could on the iphone's end make the interaction with android users a better experience for the iphone user  Yeah, they don't they don't need to worry about what the android user thinks  But they need to worry about what I think and if it's frustrating to me  That I can't have the same kind of experience with my friends who use android i'm mad at apple  I'm not mad at android so I think good question from the chat room to make some changes

Start time: 4734.24

Start time: 4751.54
End time: 4814.78

Transcript:  I don't I don't think this that is in this case and it's because you can use any other messaging app that you want  So they don't lock you into messages  It you can at any point in time open up the discord app and use that you can  You can hide the the messages app and put discord right there on your main page and be that make that be the thing  That you always open  um  It you can make it your default  Messaging app by just not using the other service. So I don't think it's really a lock-in sort of  anti-competitive  Situation for this particular thing, I think it's really just an issue of  it's been such a a nice pleasurable experience for iphone users for so long that  It's kind of a joke now and people you know, people want to make fun of android's lack of of that kind of feature and  um  And then again, you know  Like I was saying there's the user experience from the perspective of an iphone user  But that that's it's really not that big of a of a deal

It does have that  impact because the  I don't I you know, I fell in love with telegram. I wanted everybody to use telegram. I've gone through all these stages  Aol instant messenger anybody remember that?  But eventually I just gave in  I just sank into the warm bath that is the apple ecosystem  Right, but didn't we all do that? Yeah, it's like, uh, just use messages

Start time: 5013.22
End time: 5056.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do think that there is the reason that apple needs to make it a better experience is because  Back to the earlier conversation people are just going to leave  texting altogether  Right, it's going to become and and I sort of notice this happening already  Like that's just not where a lot a lot of the back and forth that I used to have with some people now happens  in other apps  Because it's more cumbersome to do it via text for whatever reason and when you're talking about these like microscopic choices of like  That really is deciding between something that's going to take you five milliseconds and something's going to take you seven milliseconds  Um, it seems kind of like a silly decision, but these things happen over time and you move toward the system that is more  frictionless

So they create discord servers, but you can do group chats  You can have one-on-one conversations and a lot of and then you can switch seamlessly to voice  Which is why a lot of them use it.

We should federate and everybody should be able to email everybody we solved it and went away  Then but then there was then the message wars began  and for a little while we had  I mean aol's instant messenger was I no icq was the first then there was aim  And and for a while there were programs  That would let you do all of them like pigeon and stuff  Yeah, and then they changed the protocols because they didn't want that  And as a result that was a mistake. They faded away whatever happened icq and aim  They shut the servers down there over but we're still in that same tower of babel that we were in 20 years ago  Where all these we have all these messenger platforms the names have changed  But the same it's the same experience from the point of view of the user you have to figure out  Well, what platform is dad on?  And how can I message joey?  I wish we true memory trillion. I wish we had what do we  How do we solve this? It's not a good solution

It is really well moderated is my perception  that um  people take their discord server moderation very seriously  And it's in discord's best interest to prevent  Nefarious stuff from happening because so many kids are on it the second some legislature finds out that bad crap is happening on discord  It'll be bad. So they I I get the impression that it's actually  Pretty well regulated internally

Transcript:  All right, take a little break I want to take you back in time when we come back  Yeah, as flash there's actually two big deals going on flash is gone by the wayside  This is it for flash one more month. Thank god  And it is the 35th anniversary of a technology that changed the world  We'll talk about that in just a little bit our show today brought to you quite literally  By our content delivery network cashfly cashfly has been around since 1999  We've been using them since we practically the very beginning in the earliest days of the podcast  I was you know letting people download it from a website that didn't work out so well then I tried bit torrent  I had I remembered the days when I come, you know, the show would be over said, okay, please seed us so everybody can download it  It was a pain. Finally. Matt levine of cashfly one of the founders came along and said leo  Try cashfly and it has been  Such a burden off my shoulders  Cashfly  Brings our content closer to the users. So when you download the show, it's faster  It's it's instantaneous  Because there's so many servers all over the world  You never have to worry about  The server's down people can't get the show. There's a hundred percent sla guarantee from cashfly. That's awesome  uh  I never get the 3m call, you know  Oh the server's down. I have to log in and make sure I haven't exceeded my capacity that kind of thing  I just love it  But there's one little thing that any cdn has to deal with it's a caching server  So when you put up a new show, the first thing that has to happen is  The the various servers all over the world when somebody hits it and says I want the latest edition of twit  That server says I don't have it and has to go back to the source and get it and that could be a real problem  For you downloading  From the origin. That's what we call a cache miss  When there's a cache miss they have to go to amazon's s3 or wherever you store your content downloaded  That slows it down for your users. It could cause buffering if you're streaming  It can be a real problem. You can also cost you a lot of money because  Sometimes the real expense is the the the cache miss  Where you've got data transfer outfields fees from s3 or whatever to get to your caching server  That's why cat we've been actually using this since almost since day one, but now cash fly is offering this to everybody  storage optimization system or sos  It's a dedicated storage space on cash fly  So when we upload our podcast, we don't upload it to s3. We upload it to cash fly  Which means your data and content is closer to your  Customers or your consumers you save thousands a month by shielding your origin cash fly guarantees. No cash misses  What does that mean? No buffering no slowdowns your download speeds will be drastically improved  And your data transfer out fees will be significantly reduced and you'll get 100% cash hit ratio. It is so  Awesome. You're gonna love sos. It's just one more reason to use cash fly  They've also by the way increased their pops. They just got six new points of presence in south america  Which means they're now serving 10 times the amount of traffic in latin america since last year  But  But not only is it not getting slower. They've actually drastically improved their performance in the region  While they're taking on a much higher traffic load. We love it  We have listeners all over the world and cash fly serves them with servers near them  Whether your end users are in north america latin america the caribbean europe the middle east asia pacific  Your content is delivered quickly and reliably you can expect consistency and performance  Everywhere in the world and because of cash flies reliable throughput and scalability  They're as fast as 500 faster than other cdns  So get sos get that 100 uptime sla guaranteed industry leading global performance stream  podcast videos  Digital downloads to global audiences of any size. It's the best thing that ever happened to us  It should happen to you too and because of sos cash missus delivered five times faster  Because you're getting it from the cash fly network instead of some third party across the public internet  Cash fly, I want to congratulate them too. They're partnering with world central kitchen to help people in need  They've donated over 50 000 dollars  Serving over 300 000 warm meals to people who are struggling in these difficult times great company great people doing  Just what you need  Look at all the people who use cash fly including us  Right now if you want to know if cash fly can save you just for twit listeners  Cash fly is giving away a complementary detailed analysis of your current cdn bill and usage trends  Just bring your bill and your usage to twit.cashfly.com chances are you're you're spending more than  20 more than you have to  Just find out go to twit.cashfly.com.

Thank you cash fly for your support  Nobody's gonna mourn flash  Right  And and thank you steve jobs because it really was steve who wrote the letter  Public letter on the front page of apple.com saying we're not going to put flash on our iphone and then later the ipad  It's over  Get over it. It took it more than 10 years to die  But at the end of the year even adobe finally says  It's over for flash  Well, the internet archive is making sure it's not over for flash  Uh the internet good for you know what I love the internet archive good for them  They have decided that that now you don't the beauty of this is you don't need flash  To see flash on the internet archive  They're using webisem and and a flash emulator called ruffle  uh so that you can  see  flash items  and ladies and gentlemen  prepare yourself  because  It's peanut butter jelly time.

That changed the world forever  It was the release of windows 1.0  Uh, which was by the way barely windows it was really a shell on top of dos for many many years  version 1  november 20th  Wow, yeah  and uh  That gave rise to a few articles  Here's one. Uh, happy birthday to windows showing up. That was it  No, maybe that's not it a few articles showing the old user interface boy. It was ugly  It was really bad  Did you celebrate at windows it pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I I think one of the reasons we didn't also is um for the last few years one of the stories that we've been  Following is microsoft's persistent downplaying of windows as as a flagship sort of product. That's absolutely true. Yeah  Uh, because they've really been shifting a lot. I mean so inadel has been so consistent about the messaging where  Microsoft is a data-led company. It's all about data analysis and empowering users to be more productive  And it's been really notable that in most of the keynote speeches  He's given at marque events even during the virtual events. We've had this year  Windows doesn't really come up as one of the elements that microsoft sees  I mean, it's a product they have they're clearly not going to abandon it  But it's not the product that they're sticking their future on so I don't think they're going to do a whole lot of  And then we rolled this out. Yeah, maybe they don't want to talk about it. Yeah. Yeah

Yeah running. Yeah microsoft  And then underneath nadella it was we want to be he said many times  We want to be wherever our customers are but the best experience will be on windows  And then they dropped that second part in 2015 at ignite.

Transcript:  We a mobile first cloud first computing experience. That was the positioning they used  and they reiterated the message a mobile first cloud first computing experience, which  I thought was  kind of a big deal because what it effectively says is that  Your choice of device or your choice of operating system matters a lot less than the portability of computing period  and for the last few years  They've talked about how microsoft's  Mission statement now is to empower every user on the planet through technology  So they're really like going big and vague at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not being entirely fair to it because I can't recite all of it because I believe it's you're empowering every user  It has something to do with the quality of access at some point and there's something in there about  Using data as part of the empowering but I agree with you. It's a very pie in the sky  In theory like the skies will be clean and the temperatures will drop and we'll have a quality of opportunity  If we can all just get that to azure and you're like, yeah really clearly such an adela is one of the best ceos ever

Yeah, that was a video intended for internal use only probably the sales meeting  Where they were laughing and laughing but uh, it lives on on youtube.

I was just I was thinking like just from the perspective of a person who follows the apple ecosystem  There are there are times in fact up until you know three weeks ago  That um a lot of people who were uh following apple were saying that you know  They're they're kind of forgetting about the mac and they're forgetting about  Their you know, they've moved on and the mac is no longer important to them and then now suddenly  Oh, absolutely. That's not the case  Do you think microsoft is is going to just sort of forget about windows?  Do you think that we're going to see a future where there's  Not really much about windows at all anymore and they're really just going to be taking care of legacy windows  But it's not we're not going to see the next windows iteration or something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, that's a great question and you can tell it's a great question because i'm saying the stalling thing  That's a great question to try to organize my thoughts as I answer it  So  To begin to answer it i'm going to backpack backpack backtrack just a little to two  Beginning premises or or two beginning facts that i'm going to build the rest of my answer on  And the first is that windows still makes microsoft?  A serious amount of money every quarter like they have three different business divisions windows is in one azure is in one  and  Productivity which is where they have office 365 is in the third and their windows and hardware division still  It's only been very recently  That azure has overtaken that division in terms of reliably producing revenue every quarter. So windows still makes them money. That's number one  number two is that when they rolled out windows 10  they  also rolled out the concept of  Continuous updates and  Began to promote the idea of windows as a service, which is kind of a logical predecessor to desktop as a service. So  um  I  Oh and the third thing I should add now that i'm thinking about it is over the course of the last I want to say  two years or so  We have seen them doing  Two things with end user software one. They're making it really easy to complete software functions  across  different  Applications. So if you are in teams and someone says hey, can you check out this spreadsheet?  You can launch a specific file within teams and edit it within teams. You don't have to switch over to  Excel open it edit it there and then re-upload it to teams again  the  Goal that they're moving towards is they want to break down the siloed functions of apps and just rather have people think in  terms of task flow and number two  They want people to think of teams as the primary space from which they work  So if you take a look at all three of those things  I think windows is going to be a product that they keep up as long  As they do have a legacy base that can't afford to pull in new computers and push everybody to a cloud first  Do the thing but  I think at this point it's a product they maintain because it makes them money and because they have a user base and as people move  Off of it  They're not going to go out of their way to continually reinvent a desktop experience anymore  I think they're going to move you more towards the idea of a collaborative workspace  where you can  Move things in and out of teams and or one drive or sharepoint and you can open stuff up like in windows  And not windows, excuse me  You can open things up like in in word or you can answer emails even from from teams  But they're shifting the definition of how they see you working on a computer as long as computing has been around

I remember apple  Well, microsoft was going to create what was that longhorn which was a a document based?  Way of thinking of things apple's been was doing the same thing with ibm. It was called pink  This is as long as computing has been around people have said no. No, no, no  No, we went on completely the wrong way all users care about is there is their data and and manipulating it  that's all that really any computing interaction is and and  We just we focused on the operating system. Okay, that's infrastructure who cares about that? That's like, you know saying  You know, I want to go to the bathroom, but first I got to install plumbing. It's just not  It's not what users want to do and that's why I think in the long run the future clearly for microsoft  And maybe for all computing is cloud-based  And and I think if you're a small business or a big business  It's very attractive to say well just by thin clients. You don't even buy these big computers  You no longer have to worry about updates  You no longer have to worry about plumbing. You no longer have to worry about security  You just have a productivity tool and by the way  It's the same whether you're sitting at your desk at home or your desk at work or in your car on your phone  It's the same data and that's where the cloud is slowly moving us to and I think clearly this is what satya  Nadella is thinking is that's the future of office. That's the future of windows and oh by the way  I get a monthly subscription. So i'm happy i've got an annuity the stock market loves that  My stock price is going to go up.

Transcript:  one of the use cases that I I see and hear about whenever  Back in the before time when I could talk to people at conferences is you'd have somebody who worked in an industry like say  They were in a printing shop  And I would find out that they had a computer that they still hadn't upgraded from windows 95 because there was a piece of proprietary  software they had paid somebody to write way back when and they were like I don't have the money to  Migrate it to write another version of the software and migrate it again  So we've jury rigged this entire workflow around obsolete tech and we just try to keep it running  I think that happens a lot more  than um  Well, it's not just companies are willing to talk about no, it's not look at android look at android  There are lots of people who are still running max that are not even os 10 max because they're like I got this piece of software  I wrote back in 1998. It does what I needed to do. I can't upgrade it

Start time: 6608.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But almost all the security problems happen to that layer of people  Yes, they're not getting updated. They're not doing any I mean  You know that the microsoft apple and google would love to get rid of the 50 android phones that haven't been updated since cupcake  They would love to get rid of you know windows windows 95  What stop

I guess yeah

Yeah, he did the first couple and you can feel it. Yes  it feels like  I'm done with this and then somebody else said well, let's see where we can go.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah  Back we go  A couple of things real quick before we wrap it up because it is getting late  But I but I just so it was a lot actually given that we're in the end times  There was a lot to talk about google is becoming a bank  Google pay, uh is gonna now have which is funny because google did this once before with a credit card. Remember  Now they're gonna start by next year. They will have  Banks all over the world. They'll have  They have a bunch of partners the launch partners city and stanford federal credit union  Uh, you're gonna be able to get a credit card. You're gonna be able to  Do payments this has been the holy grail. I thought I always thought this was what apple and facebook were gonna do  And they seem to have lost their nerve  but  In some parts of the developing world like in africa m pesa  Is the dominant financial?  instrument  Because they don't have computers. They don't really have banks, but they seem to have smartphones and so they're used that for everything in china  Wechat is the complete like is everything and I feel like google would love to be the everything  Company, right?

Start time: 7220.04
End time: 7253.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think that they always try to pave google's interesting. I can remember google loon  Making sure that you know in order for google to succeed everybody has to have an internet connection  And also for google to succeed everybody needs to be able to make payments. So it kind of makes sense  Like let's make it easy  For people to get access to things they might not have access for and and given how google often behaves  It would make sense for them to go off  Go for sort of the um small transactions  People early in their  Economic life, right? I I bet that's what they're gonna do and though if you're threatened by it

Start time: 7253.24

In fact, this is not just google at this point microsoft with their streaming gaming service xcloud  Nvidia with their streaming gaming service g-force all have solved the apple store problem the same way with a web app  A progressive web app running in safari. You can play fortnight  You'll be able to play cyberpunk 27 7 when it comes out december 10th  Uh g-force now works on chromebooks, but it's going to be  Coming soon and I think this is the proof of concept for streaming windows  Because if you can stream  triple a game titles

Start time: 7347.38
End time: 7399.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can definitely stream windows. Yeah, I think um this what's really interesting about this is when um  you know when when uh  The hearings the anti-trust hearings and things like that were coming up and they were saying well what you know  Developers have to use your app platform if they want to have apps and how is that fair and and  Apple over and over and over again said make a web app, right?  They just like you know shrug their shoulders like that's not a problem make a web app and finally  You know that through they took them up on it  Yeah  and I like  I would rather be able to have that direct user experience with the app and really kind of get the most out of it  And hopefully someday there's a compromise will come so that apple can get what they want and you know  Google stadia can get what they want. But for now a web app  Thank you. Thank you for doing that so that I can play these games from my devices

Start time: 7399.46
End time: 7453.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm excited and this is the argument for these anti-trust at least hearings if not  Actual lawsuits because it it it it sends a signal to apple because apple could say no  No, you're not going to do a web app either  They could pull the plug on web asem or the services that pwas require but they can't now because  The government's looking at them. Yeah, and they're okay. Yeah, make a web app. I guess we better stand by that  We'll see if web asem and and these tools are fast enough  My suspicion is they are and actually apple may secretly hope that it works  Well, because on their m1 chip people have said well, you're not going to get gaming. You don't have gpus  There's no discrete gpus  Well, you don't need them because the gpus are in the cloud running on google or microsoft's or nvidia servers  And all you need is a is a m1 enabled browser. Oh look chrome is available for m1
