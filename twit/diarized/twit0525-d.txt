She's absolutely a  phenomenal therapist.  This is for people that may  be dealing with things that  are too shy to go in to see  a therapist. You can download  the video and deal with your  anxiety at home. Also, it's a  good adjunct. If you're  dealing with therapy and you  want to remember something  or you want to deal with  sleep or some certain set,  you can get one of the  videos and help yourself  that way as well. That's my  specialty. This is all we do  every day is just really  mainly deal with anxiety and  depression. It's something  that we're pretty good at.  We're hoping to be able to  help more people.

Next  week, many of you will be  flying to San Francisco.  Apple sent out the  invitation. Oh, you know  what I need? Could you  get me my iPad? The  invitation reads, hey, and  I won't say the S. I'll  say Schlomo, but you know  what I'm talking about.  S-I-R-I. Hey, Schlomo, give  me a hint. And they  announced that it's going  to be September 9th. We  kind of thought it would  be September 9th. That's  kind of when they always  do it, first week of  September. In this case,  not a Tuesday because  Monday's Labor Day, so  they're going to do it on  Wednesday. The big  surprise was Bill Graham's  Civic Center, which is a  7,000-seat venue. But, of  course, as soon as I saw  the invitation, I had to  go to the venue. And I  had to go to the  venue. And as soon as I  saw the invitation, I had  to try this. I mean, let  me ask Siri, I'm sorry,  Schlomo something. Give

Start time: 487.74
End time: 496.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They actually built into  Siri that there's a big  announcement September 9th.  Did that go live that day,  the day the invitation  must have?

Start time: 497.24
End time: 500.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 503.94
End time: 514.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Siri's calling the web,  right? So, I mean, I guess  they could in real time,  they could update Siri at  any moment, you know, with  an update. It's not like  they have to wait for a  software update. So, yeah.

Start time: 515.96
End time: 519.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's probable that after  September 9th, she'll say  something else if you ask  her for a hint, right?

Start time: 520.54
End time: 522.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably. I think it's  brilliant, though.

Start time: 522.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good marketing, I  got to say.

Start time: 524.16
End time: 537.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because people love  to be involved in  something. And so this  pulls people in. So it's  not something that, you  know, you're getting to  watch, you're getting to  interact with it being a  little bit of part of the  event. And it's something  cute on their part.

Start time: 537.44
End time: 550.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's speculate. We  got three good speculators  here and then me. I never  get anything about Apple,  right? But let's speculate.  Couple of question marks.  Why such a big venue?  And why is Shlomo  so prominent in the invite?

Start time: 552.24
End time: 554.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because Apple TV.  Yeah, there we go.

Start time: 555.90
End time: 564.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all about Apple TV.  You know, I think that's  going to be one of the  headliner bits for the  event is Apple TV in,  you know, Siri in Apple  TV.

Start time: 566.52
End time: 567.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve, you agree.

Start time: 568.22
End time: 597.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think  that's going to be the  focal point. The iPhone  6S, you know, pretty much  everything is like that  already. It's just going  to be iterative of over  last year's model, which  was, you know, a big  change. So I think a lot  of the focus is going to  be on the TV and  specifically, maybe their  Siri controls. Maybe they  taught it something really  cool. Like, you know, it's  kind of weird thinking  about talking to your TV.  It's been kind of done  before. Roku has it and  stuff, but still a little  awkward. Maybe they  fire TV has a Roku has

Start time: 597.52
End time: 599.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it and Microsoft Xbox  one have it.

Start time: 600.88
End time: 603.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they all have.  Oh, yeah. Xbox too.  But it's terrible on

Start time: 603.96
End time: 620.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Xbox. Oh, I use it all  the time. But I use it  for commands. I don't use  it for like a place. I  don't tell it, you know,  let's watch Dukes of  Hazard. But I say things  like pause, play, rewind,  that kind of stuff. Yeah,

Start time: 620.28
End time: 657.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's true. That kind of  stuff works. I mean, fire  TV, though, the search on  fire. That's pretty  amazing, isn't it? It  works pretty remarkably.  They, you know, you just  speak into that remote.  You hold down the mic, you  speak into the remote and  it's remarkably accurate.  They've done some good  work. I don't know if  they're licensing. This is  one of the questions I  sort of have that I've  been trying to figure out  is like, are they  licensing their their voice  recognition software or  do they have their own  voice recognition division  doing a bunch of research?  I assume they're licensing  it. The prize by a  combination of the two  that are like nuance.  It was nuanced and nuanced.  It is nuanced. OK, well,  it was. I don't.

Start time: 658.22
End time: 678.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's a good question.  Remember, Siri was an  acquisition. Siri was a  very cool application.  Yeah, even more than  today's Syria.  You could make dinner  reservations with the app.  And I believe that that  was nuanced based.  But I do feel like Apple  has slowly moved to it.  This is Apple's way, right?  Slowly moved to its inhouse  stuff.

Start time: 680.08
End time: 783.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the thing  that Amazon not only is  Amazon Fire TV good, but,  you know, with with the  echo, you know, that's  remarkably pretty good as  well. And some of that may  have to do with all the  mics. There's there's all  those extra mics in that.  So it could be that it's  it's part, you know,  somehow it's getting the  audio data in better and  more clearly and then,  you know, interpreting it  better. But Amazon is doing  good work is the bottom  line. And so there's  pressure on Apple to  respond because the Fire  TV is a good device and  Apple TV is, you know,  I've actually always liked  Apple TV. I think there are  people who put it that I  I found it super useful  and the interface a little  easier in in general than  like Roku.  But with Amazon Fire TV  and sort of the newer layers  of Netflix, for example,  which is a lot of what  people are accessing on  these devices anyway,  you know, Netflix itself,  their their native their  native UI is a lot better.  And the the Fire TV  UI seems to to have used  a lot of those same kind of  you know, models from  from the Netflix, what  Netflix has done.  And it works really well  and it works seamlessly.  So Apple, certainly the  pressure is on for them in  that in the TV game to  to get it right.  And what they seem to have  put most of their eggs  in the basket right now is  in making better deals  with content providers.  And they've done a good job  with that. They've added a  lot of channels.  There are a lot of channels  on Roku. There are a lot of  channels on,  you know, on Fire TV as  well. But but but Apple  has a lot of the really big,  you know, the big hitters.

Start time: 785.99
End time: 814.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if I'm the only  one I'm really hoping that  the Siri hint is that Siri  is going to be a better  digital assistant.  I, you know, using it for  my TV. That sounds nice,  but I don't mind looking  for the remote in the  couch somewhere.  I really want Siri to be  able to help me manage my  life, not miss my  appointments, know when  traffic is going to be too  late or, you know, remind  me to call, you know, this  person because this meeting  has been moved out because  I noticed in your calendar.  That's what I'm hoping that  Siri is going to give me.

Start time: 815.30
End time: 858.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like we're really on  the cusp of breakthroughs  in voice recognition.  And it's interesting,  actually, cord cutting,  voice recognition, home  automation.  They're all converging on  a point, aren't they?  And certainly the Apple TV  would be well positioned,  although in my opinion,  one of the reasons I don't  like the Apple TV is it's  so tied to the Apple  ecosystem.  I mean, it is really an  eye. It's the only way you  can watch iTunes TV and  movies connected to your  TV.  It doesn't support Amazon  streaming, which is, I  think, critical.  They do have HBO and Showtime.  I feel like it's been left  a little bit behind, a  little neglected.  This is an opportunity.

Start time: 859.16
End time: 895.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally agree.  Yeah, I totally agree.  It's it's I mean, when I  test the Roku versus the  Apple TV, Roku just blows  it out of the water.  It's between the search  so much better.  You can just search  something like a director  and actor and you get all  the sources from where you  can find that director or  actor or movie or whatever  it is you're looking for,  whether it's Netflix or  Voodoo or Amazon.  And again, like you said,  Apple is just tied into  iTunes.  And whenever someone asked  me, like, which one of  these little boxes should I  buy?  I say unless like you have  all your stuff already in  iTunes and you just want  to be able to watch your  TV, go with Roku because  it you just have more  options.

Start time: 899.76
End time: 947.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that Apple TV does better  than anybody else is  Netflix.  Every first of all,  everybody does Netflix.  Yeah, but Apple TV.  And I was told this  actually by a streaming  video guy.  Apple is the only company  that actually has in-house  caches of Netflix content  so that when you're  watching Netflix on an  Apple TV, you're getting  it from Akamai.  You're getting it from  the Apple CDNs.  And that I had no idea  about that.  I didn't either until he  told me.  He said, you want now  that may be changing  because remember Netflix  has its own kind of  competing technology where  they put servers in the  ISPs knock and so forth.  But but Apple did this  first. And this guy told  me if you want the best  Netflix, I remember his  name, I can't.  But if you want the best  Netflix streaming Apple  TV. And I have to say I  agree. Apple TV seems to  be the most consistent.

Start time: 948.24
End time: 1112.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also does.  I still feel like it has  better content.  It doesn't have as good  as search. You know, like  Steve Sane, I think the  search is better on Roku  and now the voice search  on Amazon is much better.  But I do still find that  there's there's more and  better and higher quality  content on on Apple TV  both because iTunes has  more than you know, it's  a one to one like I it's  iTunes versus Amazon  store, you know, when  you're going and they  both do have things that  the other doesn't.  But and it could be me  and I'm sort of old from  the stuff that I like,  which is a lot of like  documentaries and things  like that, right, are  more on Apple TV than on  than on Amazon.  But I find that but I  find that a lot of that  stuff is better content  and also channels, the  channels they have, you  know, for to to connect  with places like NBC.  You still have to have a  cable subscription to do  it to connect like with  NBC and PBS and other  other places like that.  I feel like those the  interfaces and the  experience in some cases  is even the content isn't  on isn't on, you know,  Roku or Amazon.  Like I said, I use all  three.  I typically do the same  thing.  Steve, I recommend Roku  to most people just  because I think it's super  simple and it tends to be  cheaper.  So but I just I do think  Apple has an opportunity  here and they see it that  if they can they have to  catch up, I think, to  Amazon with the voice  recognition and with some  of those other things.  But they have an  opportunity to to sort of  go over the top and skip  cable providers.  Apparently we're not  going to hear that and  get that yet at this that  all those deals aren't  done that they were  supposed to be done by  WWDC.  And some of them are  still on the on the  bubble and we're  probably not going to see  that till 2016.  And so with that, that  leaves us with the  Siri becoming the main  event.  But not only I think  Siri, but that also has  to do with exactly what  you said, Leo, is home  automation.  I mean, we've heard some  indications that, you  know, a lot of the, you  know, Apple home stuff  is tied with the new  version of Apple TV.  It is reportedly more  expensive.  It's a little bit larger  box.  It's more expensive.  And that's probably to  do with the other piece,  which is that you're  going to actually finally  be able to run apps on  this thing, which mostly  means probably the games.  Right.  And so it's probably a  faster, you know, more  expensive box with more  hardware and more RAM so  that it can run games,  that it can run apps and  as well as maybe, you  know, some of the Siri  processing, even though a  lot of that's done, you  know, in the cloud.  But that makes it all  pretty interesting, a  pretty interesting thing  to see which direction  they're going to go.

That, for instance, home  kit will not obviously  interoperate with anything  but home kit stuff.  Right.  It's going to be an Apple  product with design for  Apple people.  Apple is with, from  everything I see and Mark  German has a recently  pushed article at 9 to 5  Mac about the new features.  This is playing catch up,  as we've said, with  everything that already  does all this.  But Apple, people who  live in the Apple  ecosystem will say,  yay, we can now talk to  our TV, yay, we can do  voice search because they  live in the Apple  ecosystem.  It's almost as if they're  on an island and they  don't know what else is  out there and they're  very, very happy to get  these new features even  though most of us will  say, well, there's  nothing new there.  The can't was, maybe Steve,  you can answer this, the  can't, the common  response to that is, well,  yes, but Apple waits and  then does it better.  Is that still true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  example. Amazon is a very  crappy experience on  Xbox One because  Microsoft says if you buy  an Amazon title on the  Amazon app, you give us  30 percent.  That's exactly what Apple  will say.  Whereas if you use the  Amazon app on Roku,  which doesn't take a cut,  it's a much better  experience because you  have the full you have  the store.  There's no store and there  won't be a store.  I guarantee you on the  Apple version because  Amazon is not going to  give Apple 30 percent of  everything it sells.

Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be like the  iOS version with this.  It's only the stuff I've  either bought through  Amazon or that's available  on Prime.  It's not a good experience.  If I want something new to  pop up on here, I have to  like go to Amazon.com,  buy it or rent it or  whatever, and then it  pops up.  So that's, yeah, that's a  terrible experience.  But it's because Apple  wants that cut just like  Microsoft does.

And it's a very confusing  experience because,  not for me, I know why  this is happening, but  Lisa will try to buy  something on, she'll be  watching Amazon on the  Xbox.  Why don't you say,  well, why can't I buy?  I can't, I don't see the  store.  Where's, I only see Prime.  And I have to explain,  well, that's because on  this platform and on that  platform, that's a bad  way of doing things.

Transcript:  It is bad.  And home automation is  the same game too.  So, you know, this  thing's very bifurcated,  right?  And the content  experience between, for  this on-demand kind of  content, that's why I  think everybody uses  Netflix because, you  know, it's pretty simple,  right?  And it's straightforward,  even if it doesn't have  as much content and some  stuff.  But, you know, it's very  bifurcated.  Smart home is even worse.  It's like four different  ecosystems, right?  And, you know, the Apple  Home, HomeKit, and then  also, you know, now  Google.

So Google will presumably  be a little bit more open.  SmartThings, that's the  Samsung solution, is  designed to talk to  Z-Wave, Zigbee, and many  other things.

Transcript:  It's more open and, you  know, you have to trade  off, right?  So you're trading off  security for a pain in  the butt.  And that may appeal to  people.  That may appeal to people.  Yeah, it depends.  Like, you know, we just  installed Skybell, which  is an amazing service.  But then I was reading  through their privacy  policy and all of the  videos, like every time,  if Skybell is a home  automated, you know,  doorbell, and, you know,  you ring the doorbell,  you get to see it on  your, you can talk to  the person on you and  see the video on your  watch.  Well, the watch only  sends you a message and  then on your phone you  can see the video of  who's there and you can  talk to them.  So if you're lying down  in bed and, you know,  telemarketers come by  your door, you can just  say, no, thank you.  Leave and you don't have  to get out of bed, which  is fabulous.  But they store everything  on their own server.  And I'm like, well, what  happens to this?  What happens to all of  these videos when people  come into my home?  And, you know, you have  I'm more security  conscious.  I think that it's something  that we need to discuss.  So, you know, if Apple's  everything's secure, I  don't mind waiting for  that.  I think that we often  give up our own privacy  for the short term gain.  And I don't know if that's  always the most intelligent  way to go through it.

Transcript:  Well, and absolutely  appropriate to start with  memories of Oliver Sacks.  I'm so sad.  Neuro well, neuroscientist.  He he actually wrote his own  obituary, which is kind of  interesting. In February in  The New York Times, because  he discovered that his  cancer had metastasized  and he knew that he was  that there was no cure and  that he would die sometime  this year.  What a brilliant guy.  I interviewed him once.  He came in bright red  suspenders on his big  motorcycle.  He was quite the character.  And if you've not read any of  his stuff, including the man  who mistook his wife for a  hat, all his PBS stuff  and just a really great  guy who lived fully  right up to his last days.  Really remarkable fellow.  He did exactly what you'd  expect him to do.  And what a just a sweet guy.  Quite a character.  Let's take a break. We come  back more from those  fabulous panelists.  But first a word from Fresh  Books. If you're a small  business or a freelancer,  this is really for  freelancers. This is when I  discovered Fresh Books.  When I had to send at the end  of the month, I had to send  out invoices. The worst part  of the whole.  I loved having many  jobs, doing lots of different  things. I hated having  to open up Microsoft Word  and Excel and create the  spreadsheet and send it  out. You know, get like the  stamps, put it on the  envelope, hope you get  paid. When I discovered  Fresh Books, and it's been  a while now, it was just  a revelation.  Fresh Books lets you do  invoicing easy, simple.  You create these great  professional looking invoices  you send by email. Every  invoice has a pay me now  button that makes it very  easy for your clients to  pay. Turns out clients  want to pay you.  They don't... paying the  bills is as awful as  making the bills.  So if you make it easy for  them, you're going to get  paid faster. In fact,  Fresh Books users get  paid on average five days  faster.  If you're keeping hours,  you know, you're tracking  time in hours, the Fresh  Book app will do that  for you and automatically  insert it into the invoice.  Great for expenses too.  You can take pictures of  the receipts, keep track  of expenses, get them into  the invoice as well.  It is a super simple cloud  accounting program that's  giving thousands...  program's not the right  term. Site, I don't know  what you call it.  Software as a service  that's giving thousands of  freelancers like you the  tools to save time billing  and get paid faster.  Create and send invoices  in minutes, organize your  expenses easily, track your  time instantly.  I'm telling you, you're  going to wonder why you  didn't start sooner.

End time: 1836.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I really like the six  and I was for the for a  while saying don't get the  six plus because it's just  a it's just bigger  because Apple's because  the apps don't really take  much advantage of the  bigger screen.  But I think that's changed  over time and more and more  apps that take advantage of  the extra pixels.  So I like a big phone.  I'm using a note five.  I like big phones.  I cannot lie.  Those other brothers can  deny.  But  they're broken.  Yes.  How did you know?

And if you put the pen  in backwards you can break  it right. And I thought  well I'll just show how  easy it is to get it in  backwards.  I won't I won't put it in  because at some point I  fight me.  No it just falls right in.  And then don't laugh.

And so then I see my I'm  like my weekly I'm like oh  OK so I look through and I  got to see you.  I'm watching him like now he  didn't.  And then I'm waiting and I'm  waiting minutes.

End time: 1930.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you can tell I  wasn't making this up.  I didn't expect it to  happen.  I wasn't intentionally  breaking my phone.  But what you don't realize  is there is no resistance.  It resistance is futile.  It as you it just you let  it fall in and then as  you're pulling it out  suddenly you can't get it  out.  So I did not yank it.  I did not pull it.  I went to the AT&T store  where I bought it and said  please sir.  I seem to have something  stuck in my phone.  And they said well what do  you want us to do about it.  I said well fix it.  We don't do repairs here  you could send to Samsung  see it three months later.  Just go to the Samsung

Transcript:  Then I said well OK but  don't you have like if you  don't like a phone you'll  take it back.  take it back like that.  But if you were to remove  the pen and put it back  in we'd take it back.  But then I would.  But then I couldn't have the  phone and I like the Note 5.  So I walked away hanging  my head and I slowly gently  kind of totally.  And it didn't fight me.  It just kind of came out.  But in fact there's a little  teeny weeny plastic  hook that gets caught  and I broke it.  And so but you know it  doesn't really make that

Start time: 1964.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw someone take it  out really nicely if anyone  else is doing it by cutting  a sliver of a piece of  paper.  I should have done that.  Slid it onto and then they  fed it in and then they  pulled pulled it out.

Start time: 1976.28
End time: 2007.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah you can do that because  you can push that lever back  before you remove the pen  and protect it.  I didn't do that.  But it's not the end of the  world. The only thing you  lose is this the the  sensing that the pen has  been removed which has  some slight benefits but the  pen still works.  You know you can still press  the pen button and all the  pen applications pop up and  all that stuff.  So it's not the end of the  world. And by the way I  gained a little battery life  because I then turned off  pen detection and settings  and my battery life went up  by like an hour.  It's a feature.

They should know that people  are going to put the pen in  backwards upside the try to  put it in sideways.  They should not allow that.  All they had to do was just  make it a little bit wider in  the base.  That's that's it.  It wouldn't take that much  or change the manner in which  they had the little tiny  sensor.  OK.

We discovered that we're more  productive with a bigger screen.  It's easier to read.  It's easier to use.

And then you know we obviously  all of us get lots of testers  in and the more time I spent  testing you know some of these  fablets I'm like boy it really  is nice having that you know  that big screen.  You know I find myself reading  more on it.  I find myself you know answering  emails on it a little more  or longer ones because with that  little bit bigger screen you can  manage the keyboard a little  better.  And so yeah for the first time  I'm sort of thinking for my  everyday you get the six plus.  I may actually get a  fablet. I also I do think it's an  interesting time if we're talking  about phones and then I'll shut  up and let the other guests hear  what their perspective is on  these two.  I think it's an interesting time  because with contract you know  Verizon go in no contract  you know T-Mobile essentially  same direction.  Others are going to follow  clearly you know all of a sudden  the price of these phones is going  to be a lot more.  People are going to be more  sensitive to price than they are  currently.  And I think that that actually  hurts Apple and Samsung or will

Very well received.  I think if or I think I  expected it's going to be well  received.  And I think that if you're a  consumer and you're wanting to  upgrade your device and you're  looking at four hundred versus  eight hundred and fifty and this  device even if it's 90 percent  as good or I  think the perception of it is  going to be that it's you know  really close.  You know I think there's no doubt  people will choose something like  the Moto X Pure Edition or maybe  a Huawei phone or whatever over  you know an eight hundred and  fifty dollar iPhone  six or you know Samsung  you know no five.

And I was you know I was pretty  much a skeptic going into it.  Although I've worn fitness bands  and I said I want to fit this  since I started coming out.  But the problem with the Apple  watch is mostly expectations  and Apple and some of this is  Apple is to blame for.  People expect it to be an iPhone  on your wrist when it's actually  just a smarter version of a fit  bit.  You know if you're expecting  an iPhone on your wrist you're  going to be disappointed.  And even Apple I think with some  of the things they tried to do  in apps you know overreached  a little was a little too  ambitious and this device is not  does not have enough power and  the UI is not well thought  through enough to work  you know with some of the ways  they'd like to do apps that could  get better in the version of  software that's about to be  released to point out to point

I can say oh I can curate.  Do I want to answer the phone  right now.  Is this important is it not.  And then I can decide if I want  to search through my purse  because it's important enough and  I need to deal with this call or  not.  So it saves me time.

This is just a little bit more  sophisticated version.  And same thing with the fitness  tracker.  It's just a little bit more  sophisticated version of the  fitness tracker and the back end  you know Apple's health kit is  better right.  It takes it pulls all that health  data from your tracker into  health kit and then health kit  can feed it back to apps like  lose it and other things.  So then you know you can you can  get a larger picture of your  your health.

Transcript:  There are a few specific use  cases that make a lot of sense.  Fitness is one of them although  I don't think it does anything  more than in fact it's not even  the best selling fitness band.  This is what gets me.  And Apple's going to say hey  we're number two.  Fitbit outsells them according to  IDC now IDC is making these  numbers up understand nobody's  knows what the actual numbers  are.  So I don't know how accurate  these are but according to IDC  in 20 in the second quarter 2015  4.4 million fit bits  3.6 million Apple watches  a Xiaomi fitness band 3.1  million Garmin point seven  Samsung point six and others  wins all 5.7 million.  So Apple only has according to  this 3.6  out of the 18.1 million  wearable sold.  It's a small fraction.

Start time: 2963.44
End time: 2991.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  small market.  They have a small fraction  of the small market.  This is not some breakaway  hit.  And now I don't by the way  it's not my job to decide  whether a watch or a product of  any kind is a success based on  sales.  I don't do that.  This is not a business show.  We're not judging Apple's  business acumen.  I judge it on whether it's a  success in terms of being a  product that I and others might  want to use and I think it's of  limited utility.  I don't.  It's not.  It's a little bit of a  disappointment.

You have to know what it is and I  think you know kind of like we  were saying earlier it's it's  best use is just that a watch.  I use it to check the time and  that's sad and that is it.

Transcript:  I'm not really as negative on  the watch as I sound.  I know I sound like I'm very  negative on it but I want to  kind of I mostly want to give  an opposing point of view that  it isn't all that.  And I think a lot of people are  like this is you know the second  this Jesus watch and it isn't  it's still wearables I think are  very very difficult.  Something that small it's  difficult to come up with a user  interface that's actually useful.  And so I think wearables in  general the Fitbit does very  well for a lot less money at the  kinds of things that people want  fitness watches.  A Timex would do very well at  telling time.  The notifications is the one  thing and I just I feel like I  don't really want those  notifications coming in all the  time.  I find that a little bit  annoying but there are some use  cases walking around London was  great to have a smart watch say  turn left now turn right now  without having to stare at the  map the whole time.  But I just feel like these are  limited use cases.  Mostly I'm saying they haven't  yet figured out how to make  wearables really useful.

Start time: 3108.94
End time: 3199.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't think that they will  either.  I don't I don't think that  there's a whole lot more that  this thing is going to do.  I think ultimately expectations  are were a little too high and  Apple didn't necessarily help  with that.  But it is good at those two  things and I think it will only  get better which are the  notifications.  I don't like taking my phone out  of my pocket all the time.  So to me that's a super useful  to me.  Like I said I like notifications  on Fitbit as well before you  know this came out and did a  little better.  I used to fit fit for a long  time for fitness and like I said  Fitbit does it well and still  most of the other people in my  family and friends still use  Fitbit.  You know I've you know passed on  my Fitbit to other people.  And so I think that it does  those things a little bit  better.  It is not you know it's not a  breakthrough product.  It is still 1.0 but it does do  some things better.  And on the on that score it does  well.  It's not going to sell.  I mean I think we talked earlier  in the year.  People were talking about it's  going to sell 20 million 20 to  30 million units a year.  And I said that's insane.  It will not sell more than five  to 10.  And that's about what the  trajectory I think that that  they're on.  So you know it does those two  things well if you want those  you know great also you know  look for it does need to do  like like George was saying it  needs to stay on all the time so  you can look at your watch.  You know I think the next  version will probably have an  OLED display which is low power  enough or has a low power mode  that you know this is this is an  OLED display.

I don't think it's I think it's  only mildly useful.  And I guess I guess what I'm  saying is the same thing as you  say Steve when you see people in  the subway which is unless you  know you have a use for this and  you know you want it you  probably shouldn't.

Start time: 3637.16
End time: 3690.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I think the ecosystem is  moving toward round.  It's harder to do it you know  from a from a developer  perspective right.  Round is harder to a degree  than square because so many of  these apps and the existing  ecosystem of of of all the  things that are there are built  for are built for square.  Right.  So so round is a little harder  but but round does look nicer.  I mean I wouldn't when I was  testing Apple watch I was  testing the motor 360 at the  same time and I like the look  of the 360.  I just wish it was about a  third smaller.  It was just kind of huge.  Yeah.  And you know but I also got  was got the smaller Apple  watch to test as well the 38  millimeter and I find that it's  fine.  But these these round ones  look really really sharp.

It's going to be something that  seamless and becomes part of  similar to what you were saying  with you know the hearing aids.  It's something that makes it  really easy because it's already  a part of you.  So you don't have to find it  there to give you information  as you need and to help you be  like that digital assistant  throughout your day.

Transcript:  until everyday life.  Each piece has to work with the  other piece and UI is the  problem and this is the problem  I see with watches.  They're so small.  Look at what Apple's done with  the stem and the button and the  force touch.  There's too much UI there.  It's very hard to navigate.  Those icons are tiny.  I feel like if you're going to  do that then what you do is you  take the computer and you break  it out but it all has to come  back into a central hub which is  what the computer was for a long  time in the home.  And I feel like a smartphone is  actually perfect.  It's the perfect form factor.  We've solved the problems on  this and it's not so far away.  It's in it's on your body it's  on your person and this can have  a acceptable UI whereas a watch  or hearing aid or something  stitched into your fabric can't.

But it feels like you're talking  to your house.  And I think that what's cool  about that is it.  You know I mean probably Siri  and Google now can do more than  Amazon.  But it feels like it's  kind of always there and you  don't have to take anything out.  I'm lying in bed and I can say  what time is it.  I can say read me my book.  Put me to bed.  Get me a hot cocoa.  No I can't do that last stuff.  But that's not too far  off. Maybe voice is the way.

We talked about this before  content blocking ad blocking is  going through the roof.  Ad Age said billions of dollars  lost.  I don't know if that's a  hyperbole or if it's accurate  but I think it's really going to  start snowballing and September  9th might be D-Day for online  not just online advertising but  online analytics of all kinds  because iOS 9 will ship we  presume and Apple is going to  allow they've announced content  blockers in Safari.  Yeah.  That means that many of the  people who visit your site will  not only not see your ads they  you won't even see them you  won't be able to count them.  Is that something that worries  CBS interactive or Business  Insider it worries me and I  don't even have I don't even  make money that way.

Yes they can slow down some  sites by the way business  insiders very fast.  There's a study done comparing  us to other sites and we load  much faster than a lot of the  competition.  But anyway you know it's it's  almost like stealing.  You know I need to eat to I'm  providing you a service I'm  giving you great content.  And if a little ad next to the  content you're viewing bothers  you then go sort of then pay us.

Start time: 4409.64
End time: 4504.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that there's a little bit  of a difference in between this  is that so you know our mind  works that things that are  stagnant and stay in one place  eventually we start to block out  we don't actually see them we  don't even like it doesn't even  register in our mind because it's  static and most static things  were not anything dangerous so  nothing that we actually need to  pay attention to most static  things didn't kill us.  That's right.  And so then after a while that  they figured out that people  aren't actually reading the  advertising in the side we  actually block them out from our  mind as if they don't exist.  And so then they started changing  them by making them really vivid  colors so you can think about  like animals that have vivid  colors they're a little more  dangerous so you should pay  attention to them.  But after a while in time people  noticed you know what we're not  looking they're not looking at  those ads either or increasing  their clicking.  So then they started making the  movement.  Our eyes are naturally made to  take a look at movement because  movement was dangerous to us.  And then the ads became more and  more obnoxious.  And so I think that it was that  they took advantage of the  goodwill of wanting to go to  sites and now they've made these  ads that are incensed they chase  you around this the screen  sometimes they blink they turn  on audio without your choice.  And I think that they kind of  broke the social contact and  that contract and that's why  this is happening.  And I also my site also needs  people to come in and you know  it's there's there's advertising  on that.  And so I understand the other  side of it as people saying you  know what it's gotten to be too  much and that increases our  levels of stress right.  These ads are actually  emotionally damaging to us.  They cause us stress because  things that chase us things that  we don't want to do with

And so sites that run those  type of ads I won't go back to  a site and I will even email  and let them know because often  you know some other ad company  has placed these ads there so a  lot of websites you don't know  which advertising is happening  on your site isn't that though

Start time: 4538.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  isn't that the right way to deal  with it the ethical way to deal  with it is just not go there  again.  Like my god you've invaded you  you've torn a little of my soul  out I'm never coming back.  But you know on the other hand  if you're in a quest for news  or information it's hard to  remember which sites you're not  allowed to visit anymore.

Start time: 4559.90
End time: 4582.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that that's why  though this has happened is that  people are so annoyed with so  many ads that are you know  everywhere causing load times to  be so slow that now people have  taken to the other side and  said well then no more I'm done  now.  And the problem is is that that's  going to make it we're going to  be changing the entire way that  we monetize web based  performances because people  aren't going to be making money  that way anymore.  Well that's what I think that's

Transcript:  If you're enjoying the content  you're reading if you if you  want that to go away one day  then block all the ads because  that will immediately vaporize  so much great content out there.  The I'm more is the business  insiders the CNET's the  all those sites the Verges  the Gizmodos.  I hear both sides.

Start time: 4610.40
End time: 4649.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hear both sides though.  I also understand why people  load times are tripled in some  cases not on business insider  but in some sites.  Malware is injected via  flash and other  means on some sites.  We've seen this happen and over  and over again.  The ads tear a little bit of your  soul away each time.  So I understand why people block.  I really do.  And I also think it's important  for people to understand that  that's how sites like business  insider and I'm more  and tech Republic.  That's how they're these are free  to you.  They pay for the staff.  They pay for the servers.  They pay for the bandwidth with  these ads.

Start time: 4650.20
End time: 4825.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I mean but it's so  this is a game that is  is changing and is changing  drastically.  You know for us you  know we see the writing on the wall  that you know advertising  is a race to the bottom.  Right. Like there's infinite  there's infinite demand.  Or sorry not infinite demand but  infinite supply now.  Right. There's so many sites  writing about tech.  There's so many sites you know  writing about business  that you know  that they will do it and give  people ads cheaper than what  we do because we are  game is to play a quality  game. And so  you know more and more  you know we were looking to other  ways to monetize  and we see that absolutely that's  going to you know that's  the future.  And when  you know from there's there's lots  of conversations that we have all  the time about you know how to  make our pages load faster how to  not annoy people with ads.  You know there's lots of talk  when when sort of new kinds  of ad units get put on  and on the pages.  And then it's like OK then takes  them off. Right. Because then  that will enable  the page to load faster that will  not infringe on the user's time  and their attention as much.  And those are the conversations  you should be having when you're  you know in the business that  we're all in.  But you know  and that's where if you because  if you don't and you overstep  that's when more people  would use ad blockers because  they'll feel like you know you  sort of broke that that  unwritten rule of why come here  and I agree that I'm  getting free content.  And so I have to  I you know I have to see some ads  or I have to do whatever.  But if you if you  abuse that that's kind of what  George is getting at if you abuse  that then the users take it upon  themselves and say you know what  you know I still want to come here  but I'm not going to keep doing  this. This is out of out of hand.  So that's where as a as  brands like we have to we have to  find ways to balance that it's  like you know you Leo you limit  the number of ads that run on your  show to it to a certain number  and you won't take more than that  even if there's greater demand  even if you could make more money  by running six ads or seven ads  on your show you know you limit it  to like three or four.  And so that's sort of the tenuous  balance of this thing.  But but I do think that all of us  are are faced with  a future where we're going to have  to think of other ways to monetize  our sites because in a world  of infinite supply  where more and more people are  doing tech now mainstream media is  trying to do it tech often very  badly but they will catch up and  they'll hire you know more people  then you know that  that takes the value  of all these ads down.  And so we start putting more on the  pages and that's when adblocking  help. You know that's where the  vicious cycle comes  and that's what we're in.

What is why is Apple doing this?  Is this just because hey we care  about users?  No they're just trying to push people to apps.  It's not I bet you anything it's not  going to block iAds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to push everybody  to apps right.  They want all of us to  not you know encourage  people to just use our mobile  websites.  Because in our apps  then we can serve ads right.  So they want us to create  apps and get them more engaged in  the app ecosystem and make really  good apps on iOS and use  those and not just use the  mobile web because when it comes to  the mobile web who wins  Google wins.  When it comes to apps who wins  Apple wins because they take a cut of  any revenue you have because  they you know you're  you're making you're trying to make  really good apps for one platform  or the other sometimes both.  But if you know most people are  developing for Apple first  they win when it's apps they  lose when it's the web.  And so they're pushing this.  That's what this whole thing is about.  And I don't think they should be doing  it and it pisses me off that they are  doing it.  But but that's what their game is.

Start time: 4900.88
End time: 4984.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I worry the other  side effect of this is that it  when the less people  look at ads the more outrageous  obnoxious ads have to be and then  ads go underground with native  content ads  that opposes editorial but are in  fact paid advertisement.  You're seeing a lot of sites do that  product placement  watch American Idol.  They have big Coke cups in front of  them. That's because people are  skipping ads in between.  And some of these.  Well I don't think that's so bad.  In fact we keep trying to do  product placement deals but nobody  will give me free pizza.  So I don't  know why.  Actually we're talking about selling  naming rights for the studio which I  think would be a nice unobtrusive way  to do an ad.  But you know we have to be very  careful because we have a  sophisticated audience.  It's very privacy concerned.  It's very savvy.  I would assume that most of our  users use ad blockers.  So it  doesn't cost us much because we only  have two banner ads only one of which  we charge for on our website.  It does hurt us because we don't get  analytics on the website but that's  not the end of the world.  That's not your distribution.  Most of our money 99.9  percent comes from ads in the  podcasts and those have always been  skippable.  I mean a podcast just fast forward.  We Tivo it for you.

Start time: 4984.90
End time: 5012.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the nice thing is that they have you  you know saying saying something and  people are already attached to you.  And so it's something that's not  improtrusive.  It's something that's not exceptionally  long and you're not there's not like  lights blinking out.  And so it's something that's  comforting from someone that they've  chosen to watch.  And so I think that that's people feel  comfortable to deal with that as their  contract is okay well this is the  advertising.  And I think that it increases the  sellability of a product.  It's not just some square on you know a  page.

Start time: 5012.42

Wait a minute you're gonna you don't  want my money.  No nobody's ever heard of turning down  an ad.  That never happens.  And then people are hurt like are you  saying that I my product sucks.  I'm saying no I just don't think our  audience is interested or we can't.  A lot of times it's because we can't  help you.  I don't think we're going to sell it  that product will sell very well to our  audience so I don't want to take your  money.  I try to be ethical maybe that's but  but this is

Start time: 5064.06

Transcript:  it's also innovative though right Leo  because that creates that's what  creates the trust with your audience is  you are filtering  essentially people who want to make a  pitch to them.  Yes and they trust you to do that  because you know the stuff that has  pitched many of them has  you know have um have turned out well  right.

I don't want to promote ad blockers  because I want I want your sites to  persist. I want  I don't want I don't want content to  good free content to disappear. I don't  want  pay walls everywhere I go. I really hate  it when I'm trying to read a financial  times  article and it says sorry you can't  because you don't pay for financial  times.
