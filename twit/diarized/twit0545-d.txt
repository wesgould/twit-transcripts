Transcript:  Yeah  So there's a lot of digital culture. That's what the Instagram doctor guy is  Yeah, I'm in charge of just the nuts-and-bolts gadget and app coverage  but uh, you know, we're pretty diversified and you know, the whole idea here is to  cover things the broad theme of the site is innovation and and  What technology enables us to do and so that hot doctor wouldn't exist without it  That's true. So it's a kind of a different approach to

Transcript:  Technology journalism, I think I was looking at iJustine's  Feed the other day and we love iJustine. She kind of got her started on this network  She you know and we I've watched with great pride and interest in her success, but man, I mean  It's interesting to watch your Instagram feed the most recent one is her jumping in the air and there are a lot of them like that  I think  20,000 likes and it's immediately to immediately  did you see the video of  the  What was that of the guy? It's notifications. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jiminy Christmas  So you did have a story that is more probably more important than how many Instagram likes by the way  It's a it's a demeaning story  By the way, it's a it's a Demi Dizou who runs a soccer focused Instagram account at four three three  I've never heard of but if I guess if you're a soccer or football fan you would know  SpaceX had a launch and an attempted landing today that failed we should mention  They were trying to do what they had already done once before which is land  the second stage or the first stage  No, the second anyway one of the stages  Successfully so it could be reused and unfortunately in this case  The apparently one of the struts snapped we weren't able to watch the video the video feed from the barge failed  One of the stuff they're gonna put it up later. Yeah  Musk said the residual pieces of the crash Elon Musk  We're talking about the founder of SpaceX or bigger this time compared to the first two similar landing attempts last year  But from the you know from the looks of it at least some of us survived  And of course this is important to SpaceX and the space in general because one of the big  Costs of launches is that these rockets are one-time use and they've landed in the sea and they're gone and they're very expensive  to build

Start time: 476.62
End time: 502.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the last failed landing that they had blew up rather spectacularly looks like this one just kind of doubled over so yeah  You know, that's that's an improvement, but you know, the one success that they did have was on solid ground  Was on solid ground they're still trying to do the the drone ship landing thing successfully  They haven't managed to pull that off just yet if they can do that then they can do that in in California  Which is what they want to do  So I'm not to wait and see but I guess it was somewhat rough seas today, which probably didn't help matters at all

Start time: 503.38
End time: 565.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, and also  there is a little bit of  vying between Jeff Bezos and  Elon Musk cuz Jeff Bezos is was a blue or blue sky blue origin blue origin  Did successfully land one of its stages and so there's you know, this is kind of they're measuring it's okay  Little competition is good in civilian space  actually, we talked yesterday on the new screensaver Jason Calacanis was my co-host about Elon's plan to provide global internet with  some huge number of low-earth orbit satellites and  He had to  Jason play that well one of the reasons he can even contemplate this is he happens to own a rocket company  So maybe there is some sense in launching this. What was it? How many was it was a 400 500  Low-earth orbit. All right, let's get let's get back to the topic at hand. You didn't go to see yeah, Tim was at CES  Ben you didn't go to CES. I was there. Where are you very happy?

Start time: 566.74

Start time: 578.70
End time: 585.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Keynote thing Faraday is one of the electric cars kind of a new one in the in the business. They showed off a concept car  How I feel

Start time: 588.78
End time: 590.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Back home depending on how you look at it. Yeah

Start time: 591.62
End time: 597.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're Faraday has yet to actually show any real product right? But are they what do you think Tim? Are they credible?

Start time: 599.12
End time: 666.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've definitely got a lot of funding  That was one of the big things that they talked about at the event at CES was there the backing from LED TV  Which is a major Chinese media conglomerate worth billions of dollars  They've invested somewhere around a billion dollars to get this company Faraday future off the ground  So they definitely got some strong backing and they have started  They're about to start construction on a battery factory just outside of Las Vegas  So that was another part of the big announcement they're making at CES  But you know the big thing that we wanted to see was some kind of a production-based car or something that would be you know  That we can actually see and sit in and get driven around and then actually, you know  Track the the course of this company towards some kind of a product that you and I can actually think about buying  But instead they rolled out this crazy concept car thing and autonomous thousand horsepower  Four-wheel-drive electric hyper car thing which was you know, just a hollow shell certainly nothing that would ever go into production and that was pretty  disappointing because you know  Everyone can draw cool sketches and have lots of fun  But to actually make a production ready car that can pass all the crash regulations and everything else that you need to get on the road  That's a much more complicated thing. And so that's still a big question mark in my mind and in a lot of other people's minds as

End time: 692.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know when you go to these websites and Faraday future is a really classic one and it's very  Airy fairy blue sky. What if we could redefine our relationship with the automobile?  I always makes me a little little suspect of the whole thing, but they got money. They got venture capital  You you wrote it recently actually been your most recent post on Strutecary was about  Autonomous vehicles

Start time: 709.02
End time: 723.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about the Detroit Auto Show because that's one of the things that you see at CES  is of course the consumer electronics aspect of automobiles the  You know the the high-tech inside. Is it the same at the Detroit Auto Show these days or is it more traditional?

Start time: 725.09
End time: 786.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's definitely more traditional  We're seeing CES become the platform for these major manufacturers to make big announcements about their their consumer electronics integrations  Carplay announcements GM announced their 500 million dollar investment in Lyft  For example, those are stories that really wouldn't play as well in Detroit  You know Detroit is a traditional automotive show with a lot of traditional automotive journalists there. They want to see new cars  They want to see a new sheet metal talk about new engines that kind of thing  So, you know partnerships with Silicon Valley and infotainment integrations and things like that  Just really would kind of get buried amongst all the noise of the new models being unveiled in Detroit  So, you know, we're seeing GM and Ford and other manufacturers have kind of a smart came so they'll go to CES  They'll talk about the technology stories  They'll talk that up and it'll get a good buzz going into Detroit where they'll show off the actual car  So Mercedes did that very well this year as well. They showed off the e-type in at CES. They did some  Some demonstrations of the autonomous functionality that are the self-driving functionality of that car and then you get to Detroit  You actually see the car itself. So that was a nice way to transition from one show to the next

Transcript:  I love it Corning was there with Gorilla Glass  For car windshields. They showed it on the Ford GT

Start time: 793.94
End time: 806.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right in Ryan Seacrest was there for the demonstrations of well  he was there talking at the the Ford event and then he went to the Ford booth and  People got to shoot hails at hell stones at him

Start time: 815.52
End time: 827.24

Transcript:  Can't imagine anything better we can survive this

Start time: 833.54
End time: 851.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is you know what there is a moral to be told here  Which is the more you have consumer electronics in a car the more you risk  crashes and I don't mean physical crashes but  Software crashes and it's one of the reasons I think car manufacturers are a little bit rightly so skeptical of turning these things into computers

Start time: 853.32
End time: 906.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's definitely you know, there has to be a line drawn and you know firewalls built and all that good stuff to make sure that  They haven't done a good job of that according to that kind of thing  Because  And that's definitely one of the things that we talked a bit about in fact General Motors just launched a cyber security  Division within the company about I think eight or nine months ago  So they actually have a team of somewhere between 80 to 100 individuals working in GM focused exclusively on security and some of them are  You know half the teams trying to break stuff the other half trying to fix stuff  Yeah, but it's good to see that the corporations are making that level of interest and you know  They are still not exactly clear on exactly how the software structure to provide the internal security that you need for these sources  Systems they're trying to you know, not being totally transparent or as open as you might expect  Someone like Google to be for example, but they are being a little bit more transparent and they're learning  I think that that security through obscurity is not the way forward which which for me was quite quite encouraging to learn

Start time: 907.26
End time: 915.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You talk a little bit about Audi is doing a hydrogen fueled. It's a concept car, but this is a different kind of electric car

Start time: 916.50
End time: 974.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, so, you know your typical EV your Tesla that kind of thing has electric motors powering the wheels and then the electricity comes  from a battery a  Hydrogen powered car is actually pretty much the same thing except the battery pack is a lot smaller and there is an additional  Hydrogen tank on board plus a fuel cell stack  So instead of the electric electricity coming exclusively from the battery the electricity can come through this fuel cell stack  Which is powered by hydrogen the only emissions from the car would be basically water  Which is you know, not the battery the environment and you get a much quicker refueling  You can refuel a fuel cell powered car in about four minutes  So, you know roughly the same time as you can refill a gasoline powered car  And again, you can have all the range of a gas powered car and all the power and everything else too  The problem of course is you can't go to your local  Corner gas station and get a tank full of hydrogen at least not yet  But get both well Audi had the htron car there, which is pretty cool  It also has some kind of fancy high-tech stuff like pop-out chrome mirrors and offenders instead of having actual mirrors

Start time: 974.82
End time: 984.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're just digital cameras at point backwards, which is nice. I think that's really interesting. We've seen other cars doing that too with it  Who is it that the rearview mirror that was just a camera view? What a great idea

Start time: 986.06
End time: 1022.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chevy's actually replaced or has augmented the bolts of the old bolt  Yeah, a rearview mirror with a camera  So that gives you 120 degree wide angle view at the rear rather than just using a mirror  But in the US you cannot actually get rid of at least the driver side mirror has to be a proper mirror  So a digital rearview mirrors which are much more aerodynamic than things hanging off your door are not legal in the US yet  That's something that manufacturers are trying to change  But she'll be kind of got around that by building the mirror into an LCD panel that sits behind the actual mirror  So if the LCD to go out for any reason it works just like an old-school mirror  But when you flip on the system you get the digital camera view at the back

Start time: 1022.44
End time: 1032.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is a pretty smart way to get around the legislation as it were is that the concern of legislators is safety that a  Video tap might not be as reliable as a physical mirror

Start time: 1033.91
End time: 1045.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's part of what's why that law still exists  But ultimately it exists because back in the day there simply was no alternative and they wanted to  Legislate that there had to be a mirrors so the simply stated that a life is gone here had to be on the car

Start time: 1045.96
End time: 1051.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't cameras. It was because there weren't any there wasn't anything like that

Start time: 1051.68
End time: 1114.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's one of these things that's getting really unfortunately confusing as manufacturers are trying to go forward with autonomous functionality  BMW for example in Europe you could park your new 7 series by getting out of the car and hitting a button on the remote  Control the car would then pull itself in your garage  You wouldn't have to do anything  but in the US  BMW did disable that functionality because the law in certain states in the US says that you must  To put the car into park you must physically depress the brake pedal before putting it into park and BMW said well  You can't do that for not the car so therefore we can't disable that functionality  But of course Tesla added that functionality just a couple weeks ago and the new e-class from Mercedes will do the same thing  They took the interpretation that the brake pedal simply had to be pressed it didn't matter how it was pressed  And that's one of those annoying kind of things where stuff for interpretation and different manufacturers are interpreting it in different ways  And that's one of the reasons that we saw that the US Department of Transportation making a big statement just last week that  They're going to try to work to standardize a lot of these laws and everything to make the US a more friendly place for  Autonomous research like that which is which is very encouraging

Start time: 1114.84
End time: 1128.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Tesla also announced a fetch mode where you can actually say to your car park in the garage  The car parks itself, and then you go out your front door and say come your car, and it comes and gets you when you're the next day

Start time: 1129.14
End time: 1138.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, which is great if your garage has just enough room to fit a car and nothing else that certainly you know  Means you want to spend much time cleaning your garage, but certainly you know it'll make cars easier to park

Start time: 1138.50
End time: 1143.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really interesting is it reliable have you tried it we haven't had a chance to try it yet

Start time: 1143.24
End time: 1180.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but BMW and Mercedes-Benz both have similar functionalities the Mercedes app  Is it part of this also is that you always must maintain control of the car to be you know?  Basically well to show that you are in control of the car to be driving the car and that was another part of the legislation  That BMW was concerned about the way that Mercedes is getting around that is you run an app on your smartphone  And so as you're backing up your car you have to run your finger in a circle on the app to basically  Continue to make control. I'm in control. Take your finger off. Yeah, the car stops immediately that way you're demonstrating control of the car without actually physically  Being in the car that's some form of driving silly games and things like that control

Start time: 1184.29
End time: 1256.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow  Yeah, actually I the the only time I've used any autonomous functions. I was at the Ford test track  This is some years ago. We actually unfortunately have this on camera  And they were demonstrating their self-park feature and they said okay, you're driving through town  Thank goodness. This is on the test track  I and I was in a big old flex and they said okay, you're looking for a parking space  So press that button the car continues you continue to drive and then it beeps at you. Oh, here's a spot  I could fit it's a big car. So that's good. And then you said okay, they said go park it and  So I press the other button and they say take your hands off the wheels or feet off the pedals  It's gonna park itself in the it's cool. The thing spins around and stuff  What they don't tell you and I think they did on purpose is and maybe now that there's a whole now  I'm thinking there's a whole there was a whole plan here is  once it parks  Put your feet back on the brake and turn off the ignition because I didn't and it continued to idle  backwards into the car behind me went BAM  And now I'm thinking oh they were trying to they do this because they were engineers in this car laughing at me  I think this is their way of lobbying  State legislatures to take that rule off that you have to have somebody with a to put a foot on the brake because it should just  Say I'm parked

Start time: 1256.97
End time: 1317.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely  Especially now that you don't have to have any physical linkage between yourself and the transmission that the transmissions can shift themselves cars can steer themselves  Now there's no more mechanical driving by wire. Anyway, yeah, absolutely  So there's a lot of old laws hanging around that ultimately are making making these engineering decisions more difficult than they need to be  As part of what that program from the DOT is is going to try to go through to iron out all these like you can  Test autonomous cars in four states in the US right now, and I think Virginia's coming on will be number five  But that's it  you know there are certainly a lot of places and a lot of  opportunities to be testing these cars in other states in the US and if you have to pick and choose like that it's going to  Make it more difficult to be a leader in that area and autonomy is you know  It's going to be a huge industry for these auto manufacturers  And if they can't test these things efficiently in every state in the US that's going to be a major issue for them going forward  so you know  I hope that this really helps to to have a stable platform across the US for laws that are progressive enough to enable this kind of  Technology and to enable us to continue to be leaders in the automotive space and Thompson you wrote about this in strata cory

Start time: 1325.64
End time: 1365.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry I got disconnected so yeah, we got you back  recover any points but um  Well, I think I mean that was that was a nice a nice hook I think the the  I'm personally a little skeptical about the bolt  specifically I think the you know the challenge when it comes to a  low-cost electric is  the  what you're buying as a  someone buying a  $30,000 car is very different than what you're looking for in a purchase in a  You know you mentioned that you were you were acquiring a Tesla in a hundred thousand dollar car and a thousand dollar car. Yeah

Start time: 1367.26
End time: 1371.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Particularly today is it because it's more expensive to do it right well first off the up

Start time: 1371.86
End time: 1450.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean the upfront cost is is is going to be more  And there's plenty of evidence that customers anchor on the upfront crust more more than the total cost of ownership  to the total cost ownership of an internal combustion engine powered car right now is is  As low as it's been in a long time  It's going to be for it looks like it's be that way for a while because of the low oil prices  and then three I think an  underappreciated part is of  people who are buying a a  Tesla  If they want to go to grandma's house they can say oh, we'll just take the BMW instead, right?  Whereas someone buying someone buying a $30,000 car with subsidies you got the one  They probably don't have an alternative car to they're definitely not going to fly right they can't drop  You know $2,500 on the whole family plane tickets  and so the the  the  pure driving performance issue aka range of electrics is much more of a of a  Limiting factor I think for the lower you go on the income scale  On the flip side the bolts not gonna really unless it gets like some sort of Prius aura  Confer some sort of like status on you that no question having a Tesla does you only need to you know?

Transcript:  So I grant you that  Yeah, I think  This is a very narrow point, but I'm I guess I'm I'm no no auto expert like like Tim or anyone else in the space  But I think just looking at kind of the market the characteristics of the market for a car like the bolt  We'll see we'll see I think big picture  I think that what I was trying to do with my piece this week was was really  We talked about cars are changing those cars in news constantly, but there's really very distinct  Axis that it's changing on and I think  Your kind of interpretation of what's happening varies based on what you look at the three being you know the electrification  Number two being self-driving number three being the changing nature of transportation  Which is from individually owned and operated vehicles to right to transportation as a service and that may throw everything up in the air

Transcript:  Because you know these cars these companies are built around the notion of private personal car ownership  I thought it was very interesting as you point out that  as well as announcing the bolt GM announced a half billion dollar investment in Lyft and  You don't invest in Lyft as a  Ride service you're not buying a taxi company you're buying. It's not really about ride-sharing  It's in my opinion both uber and Lyft are really about the future of car ownership, and they're hedging their bets in effect

Transcript:  Right well. I mean I mean  frankly  if if  Transportation as a service becomes the dominant form of transportation. I mean all the existing car  Manufacturers are in trouble not because we won't need cars we will  But because the nature of what we need a car for will change

Transcript:  it's hard to know how the number of of of  Miles driven will change  But I mean presumably if we are all using ubers and lists in the future  The cars that are used for a burn lift are going to need to be replaced far more frequently  I mean just the wear and tear is so it's still a business for them right, but the difference is you're not buying a  $90,000 car because it makes you feel good about yourself. It's all fleek environment. Yeah, right actually  I spoke with them spoken with Mark Fields

Transcript:  It was the CEO of Ford in Detroit this past week, and you know everyone's asking that question  It's Ford basically is Ford screwed if everyone just goes into car sharing and stops buying cars and his response was pretty interesting which I'd  Never heard before he says that the personal transportation industry I need the car industry is about a two point something trillion dollar industry  They said the mass transportation industry  Is if something like a five point something trillion dollar industry and right now the auto industry has no share of that whatsoever  And he said worst case if they need to transition to being something more of a mass transit  You know something more of a not quite an authority, but in that area  That's actually a huge new market for them to tap into  Obviously it's going to take a lot of change for them to be able to capitalize on that  But with that investment from GM in the lift and with Ford's smart mobility program  They're definitely looking in that direction and they see you know  They see the writing as much as anybody and and Mark Fields at least is confident  They can pivot in that direction of course he would be but but that was an interesting angle  I thought of that attack on that problem well, and you know I also

We've seen technology  The havoc technology is wreaked on a lot of industries, but this is a giant  Industry and a huge economic driver in the United States, so I think there's a lot  You know there's some concern about what this might portend

Transcript:  Well, that's something that's interesting what Faraday future has told had told our reporter a couple weeks ago  They don't see it like though in the long term view you know in the short term in four or five years  They'll have a car that you can buy it'll be like another Tesla type thing  But 10 15 20 years they're going for that services thing, too  They see it as like a subscription service you pay a fee and they deliver you whatever car when you need it  So if you need a truck to you know pick up furniture from IKEA you get that  Excuse me, and if you need you know just a one-man vehicle just to get you to work for the day you get that and that's  What comes to you, so it's kind of like?  Almost like Spotify, but for cars you know you get the thing that you need when you need it  And then you don't own the car

I mean that's how uber X and Lyft started was this notion.

Transcript:  No, I'm sorry being facetious. This is exactly why I think it's useful though to tease these things apart because  It's it's trivial to sit here and imagine what the future will look like the real trick and analysis  Particularly when it comes to the technology related is figuring out the timing  So yeah, maybe one day I can order whatever car I want to my door and come up but  As much as Faraday wants to brag about their funding  I like to see the funding that guarantees they'll get to that date and they'll be in place to do it  Color me pretty skeptical  Well the the and this is where it gets into I mean  You know something that has has gotten criticism over the last couple years as and in part for me  But is the idea of disruption, but I think it's actually a very useful thing to think about it in this case in that  When it comes to electrification for example or these fetch my car or park in my garage the things you talked about earlier  I mean these are very much  Sustaining sort of innovations in which in which case we should expect the existing manufacturers to take advantage of them  And if you want to enter the market you're likely you're gonna have to take a tactic like Tesla  Where Tesla is coming at the high end they're offering something they're going over the top on features  they're going over the top on status and brand and  Really, that's you know there's a reason why there have been very few new entrances at the car market over the last hundred years  It's it's a hard thing to break into  on on the flip side  Disruption is not about people use the word disruption for everything right but it  Disruption is about business models first and foremost and  What happens with something like like an uber where you no longer buy a car you just use one when you need it?  That is a new business model and what is scary about disruption is it doesn't matter that  Mark fields can see it coming it doesn't matter that GM can see it coming  What will happen to them will be almost completely out of their control and maybe they will survive in some fashion or maybe they won't  Or maybe it won't happen at all, but the entire point of disruption and what's kind of makes it ironic  Is that the brilliant insight of disruption is that incumbents can't really do anything about it right and then now there's a whole consulting practice  On helping incumbent companies deal with disruption right which should and we have such a template for this

Transcript:  I mean what happens is once you get to a world where people don't buy their own cars. They're all fleet sales like I'm sorry  but for did  Innovate all you want but your business has fundamentally changed and almost certainly in a less favorable direction because you're giving up all  The angles on which you sell differentiated cars was gonna buy undercoating if it's fleet purchases  Yeah, I mean there's lots of stuff like that. I mean now now again. There's a timing issue here  I mean it's very easy to say that you know the u.s.  Sold a record number of cars last year's have people five billion cars that's 17.5 billion new reasons to not take an uber  So by no means the timing is clear, but what makes uber  particularly interesting from my perspective is  that uber uses today's cars with today's driving systems aka humans and  Like everything about uber uses today's existing technologies  But with tomorrow's business model and so that's interesting because as these technologies come online  Like uber is actually very well placed to acquire them or build themselves all these sorts of things people want to have a Google  And all this sort of thing Google is going for this this  home-run  Multi-bank shot approach where magically their system will work  You know be regulatory approved and people will accept it all at the same time and that's not usually how technology change happens  and  And so we'll see I mean I'm you see the younger generation. I mean  The analogy I made was to TV what happened people have been predicting cord cutting for ages  And it hasn't happened because people like their cable bundle, and there's lots of reasons for that. There's very good reasons for that  However the numbers are going down finally, but the reason they're going down is not to be morbid  but people are dying and  Young people are not getting it for the first time  they're just they've grown up with tablets and the internet and all these sorts of things and  I suspect the same thing will happen with cars us old people are attached to our cars  we're gonna stick with them till we die probably in a car and  Young people are gonna come up who the idea of wasting a couple hours a day on anything other than their smartphone  Will make no sense to them, and that's when the shift will happen.

I mean the thing about electrification is it's interesting. It's a new technology  It theoretically allows some new companies to come in because you're moving the complexity of the drivetrain  But it's not changing the fundamental nature of what it means to have a car company and what it means to own a car

Transcript:  I mean, I think I've been saying this will be the case for TV for a long time as well  I think people it's so people get so hung up on the technology and you can see why a  Future makes more sense than the present and you can see that  Future makes more sense than the present and you can see that in TV where over-the-top video makes more sense  You can see it in in cars where having these you know  Autonomous cars that just drive around ferrying people around on demand makes more sense for all kinds of reasons  But I think a mistake that technologists in particular make regularly is  dramatically underestimating how difficult it is to  For that sort of change to happen  I mean you see this in technological products people are hesitant to change how they use a computer  much less how they use a car or the fact they they have fifty thousand dollars sitting in their garage or  you know how all these sorts of things and and I think that  And so that's why I mentioned before it's gonna be a generational sort of sort of thing  And so in them in the medium term short to medium term I suspect actually most car companies are going to  Continue to you know to do better than we expect  And so that's why I mean that's why I don't that's why I don't do do stock picking for for example  One if I did I would do it for my own profit  but to  this is what makes it tricky is getting into the the timing the timing aspect of  Winnessess going along and the other thing too. This is why the Apple car  I think  You know  Like the Apple car it makes no sense because we're all gonna be in an uber one day well  That's like saying in 2001 that building an iPod makes no sense because we're all gonna be using our phones one day like that  Doesn't mean Apple shouldn't have made the iPod for example  You know if we actually still have 20 to 25 years of this paradigm. I have no idea  I just threw that number out there then you know  making something at the high end  Maybe it's not the worst idea then again if the paradigm is gonna change in five years  It's a terrible idea  And this is where and this is why you get paid the big bucks to be you know Tim Cook or whoever to?

They've been delayed many many times  That's not that's a company. That's got some interesting history there  I'll leave it that but yeah, definitely once once cars can avoid accidents better than we can yeah  We can strip out a lot of the extraneous stuff in there, and we can get rid of things like speed limits  And you know driving licenses even at some point  We won't even need we won't even need those right  But you know as we try to chart the future of the the the car sharing economy somebody's still got to build those cars  And you know no one's better position than then the big auto manufacturers at this point  So if anything we could we could make transportation something that's accessible to more and more people  That doesn't necessarily mean that these companies are going to go away that their business is going to shift drastic drastically  I think they all appreciate that  But doesn't mean they're going to go away by any means

Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit about Bitcoin Mike Hearn who is an early  Mover in Bitcoin, I think I think you think he left his job at  Google to go to work for about five years ago as a Bitcoin  Developer wrote an article that caused the price of Bitcoin to tumble three days ago on medium the resolution of the Bitcoin  experiment in which he says I've sold all my bitcoins, and I think I have come to the inescapable conclusion that it has failed  Bitcoin is over. He says the network is on the brink of brink of technical collapse  You should know that but he he's he sets these six points  He says think about it if you'd never heard about Bitcoin before  Would you care about a payments network that one couldn't move your existing money to had wildly unpredictable fees that were high and  Rising fast three allowed buyers to take back payments  They'd made after walking out of the store just by pressing a button  He says if you aren't aware of this feature, that's because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it  And I think that was in response to large backlogs of  Bitcoin transactions sometimes taking a full day and  Much of the Bitcoin mining now occurring in China Jason Calacanis told me he believed that was because a lot of the Bitcoin miners were  Kind of in power plants and coal plants and nuclear plants in China where they could get tap into the electricity for free and avoid  The real cost of Bitcoin mining which is the cost of the electricity and finally in which the companies and people building it were an open  civil war  Fred Wilson AVC comm wrote a response in which he said well, it's just an opportunity for Bitcoin to  You know transform itself and survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think that's that's well that's that's actually kind of the rub here is I  Can't speak for most people in certain value can speak for I know where a few of them stand including myself and I think  That the value of Bitcoin actually is more interesting the less you think of it as currency  What a very fundamental level what Bitcoin and and the blockchain type technology allows is digital scarcity  Right the entire thing with with digital is that it's infinitely copyable and that's interesting in some ways  But it's problematic in other in other ways  Because you know the value of something digital immediately goes to zero because there's there's an effectively infinite amount  Well in the case of of the blockchain like you can actually have something be digital and all the advantages that comes with that being instantly  transferable  You know transparent movable over the place well also being scarce like there's there can only be one of something and  That's like that was thought to be impossible and what makes Bitcoin so interesting is that that made that made that possible  now that has all kinds of potential interesting applications the most obvious one of which is  to be used as a currency and the way Bitcoin specifically works is a series of of  checks and balance not checks and balances, but it but  interlocking incentives in which there has to be a monetary aspect to  Motivate miners to verify transactions which enables the scarcity and so there there has to be a component that to it  but a real open question is  with Bitcoin  specifically is the future as this sort of  Restricted amount of digital currency like gold which is why there tends to be an overlap in people who support  say a gold standard and  That sort of approach to monetary policy and Bitcoin  Supporters or as opposed to fiat currency, which is government-backed is based is you know not backed by gold  and  You know there's a Federal Reserve and all those sorts of things like there's a reasons why there's all these political angles that you've  Heard in react in relation to Bitcoin it comes down to this question  And so the real civil war here is between the one side that that believes in that aspect of it  You know is against the Federal Reserve as it gets this sort of thing wants it to be its own currency and  the other side that what that sees the technology and what it could potentially enable and  there needs to be changes made to the protocol to make that possible and  There's just a fundamental division here  and so actually I think the division if anything is probably more between Silicon Valley and  kind of  speculators well, I would say  Bitcoin true believers, and I don't mean that pejoratively. I mean that where they see likes the initial the original Satoshi  You know  Document and writings were more in line with that sort of view  I mean he was very skeptical things like the Federal Reserve he wanted to create an actual currency  and and that it's a fundamental philosophical divide and  And so I think this is division is real and and I'm not sure how it will be resolved  I'm not that deep enough the community to know but I'm deep enough to know that this  Like when you get to a core question of what's the point?

I mean, I think there's um, you know, I think that  If this is such a this is a kind of complex subject I was hearing the blockchain ID is fascinating  There's a debate you can you have Bitcoin independent of the blockchain?  you know a lot of it gets down to this question of sort of  one thing that  Again, I need a less pejorative term than like true believers or whatever  But like the true believers really hone in on is that there's no trust required a Bitcoin  It's a trustless system and I think what people forget and it's easy to lose sight of is  all systems all  institutions that involve humans have some sort of  Structure to them the question is whether it's explicit or implicit and you're seeing that play out in Bitcoin right now  Like there is governance in Bitcoin  there are people who are in control and it turns out as as as my current is finding out that  Just because it seems like  Theoretically, there's no one in control

Transcript:  You look at any sort of human institution there there are there are structures that will emerge  The question is do you want them to be planned like they are in most corporations or you want them to be?  Be implicit and it's easy to say oh implicit and natural is all sort of good until you realize that's how things like  You look at tech and you see how we have a diversity problem  And why is it that we manage to start companies end up being all?  male white and Asians well because we just we just hired our friends and we got recommendations well if I mean  Unless you are explicit and planful  Like that's what's gonna happen and again. There's there's good things to you. Oh, we have a consistent culture  We all believe the same sort of thing well, and you we all pull on the same or like okay, but like  There will always be structure in the question is it implicit is it explicit and  Again, I think you're seeing that happen in Bitcoin you see it happen everywhere

You're planning for disaster  You wouldn't run a business without fire insurance get some data insurance from carbonite dot-com  One of the things that makes carbonite work is that you're not just backing up locally  You're backing up to the cloud  so if there is a  If there's a fire or flood or somebody comes in and wipes your business out just takes everything  You're not relying on those backups that Joey from the mailroom stuck in the closet last week  You got stuff on the carbonite cloud automatic  continuous  Backup no more downtime with carbonite cloud backup protect the files that keep your business running or your home running  smoothly one of them under no matter more than a one and a half million homes in small businesses  Trust carbonite to back up their computers and servers now  I know a lot of you are geeks and say well I could easily do an r-sync to an Amazon web service s3  Instance and and yes, you probably could  Would you rely on it? I think it's probably safer better to trust carbonite and certainly there are a lot of people  Who aren't gonna roll their own who really need good backup?

Transcript:  I mean it is it is I'm actually super interested in this I mean I  Nothing to write per se but I mean just kind of speculating  I mean if they do really if you if you step back far enough  It wouldn't be a shock if Google scales at least from my perspective if Google scales back their sort of  Developer platform support sort of thing I mean for for them from a strategic perspective  Particular on Android I mean apps are a necessary thing that they need to be competitive, but it's not it's not core business  Right, but that said I mean it's it's  Like it's pretty it's pretty important. So this is really interesting  I'm very curious to see what happens with the rest of the program and schedule and and  You know what obviously what it means

Start time: 3553.06
End time: 3596.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you could also make the case that those sessions could happen outside or purely online  you know as long as you have the developers or excuse me the Google personnel talking about the new APIs and streaming that online and  Yeah, why do you have to go to Google?  Yeah, I think there's obviously a lot of value and people getting together Google I Oh and actually seeing physical demonstrations of things  But presumably you know  I think by and large a lot of that's just there for the media to be able to write about what cool new things  Up to and maybe that's what this is turning more into they have a big splashy keynote like they've had in the past the media  Gets to go there and write about all the cool new things Google's up to and then developers go back to their computers and learn  All the valuable things they need to do to build the next generation of apps  You know again the question do they physically need to be there to make that happen?

Start time: 3658.78
End time: 3685.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it gets to the that that timing issue I talked about before I mean  First off I  Pushed back against the way people kind of instinctually lump VR and AR together  Again, maybe there's certainly technological connections  but I think you know a computer and a phone are the same thing as a console and a and  Or a better example a console and a and a phone are basically the same thing as well if you want to get technical

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  About it well, but but I do have to point out that I know you're I know where you're going with this and I'll let  You go on but I do have to point out there have been now some hybrid approaches  Where you're in your oculus rift, but you don't run into a table  Because in it's in your real space and it shows up in your VR as a real obstacle

Start time: 3704.18
End time: 3809.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, and that gets to the point that they are they are  Technically similar or technically in any your there's some sort of thing image in your eyes eyes are involved in right  But the the big difference is how you use them and and  something like a VR thing like an oculus you it's it's a  What I term a destination device like you make a decision like I am going to use the the riff now  and you go and you put it on and then you use the rift and then you finish and you take it off and then you  Move on and there's a there's a big vein in technology of this  That's where consoles fit right you go and you sit down and you play up a constantly a gaming device you're saying well  I mean or well, not just gaming. There's also movies right you sit down and you watch a movie  Okay, and then you stop watching the movie and and that's a very large and profitable space to be  But the there's another  Space of technology which I call accompanying technologies  Things that are with you as you go about your day  The reason why the smartphone is so dominant in such an important platform is not because  We make an appointment to go use our smartphone and the reason why Facebook is such a big deal is not because we say  Oh, I'm gonna go use Facebook now. It's four o'clock. It's because they're they're omnipresent  They're always with us and they're there when we need them  We can pull it up and I have three minutes in line and look at Facebook and play Candy Crush or whatever  That's what makes Candy Crush a very different sort of game than Call of Duty, right?  One you sit down to play Call of Duty. You don't like sit down  I'm gonna block off a few hours tonight to play Candy Crush  You might end up spending a few hours  But the way the way in which you go about doing it your posture as you do it is very different

Transcript:  I think you might be making the same mistake though that somebody who was  In the in the world of computing where it was a desktop computer and you said, you know someday you'll have that in your pocket  They might say oh, that's crazy talk. Nobody wants to do that a desktop computer is a destination

Start time: 3824.16
End time: 3883.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, what I'm saying is I think you're looking at current technology maybe not what might be happening no, I would know you're  You're you're you're you're mishearing me. I'm actually what I'm saying is AR is very different than VR  Well, I'll agree with you on that AR is more interesting in the long run to me because AR is an accompanied technology  Like so I actually think Google Glass is very interesting  I think the timing was wrong and probably the tech wasn't ready in the way they approached them and I've been right  But the idea of having  an  augmented vision and  In the computer with you as you go through your day-to-day activities that by definition  The market is much bigger from an attention perspective from a time perspective because it's all the time in your day  And so my distinction is between AR and VR which VR will be fine and interesting  I think I just I think that AR in the long run will be bigger than  VR simply because it's it's we have

I mean there you know  Reality to us is what we perceive at any moment in time  So it can be like to you you could say that all people want to actually live real life with with people like well they  At the end of the day, it's just neurons firing. I mean if whatever triggers that triggers that that's a really interesting point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Both if you imagine  You know, there's a lot of sorts of talk about contact lenses that can project images on the you can imagine a situation where you can  Have an augmented reality experience and then ultimately if you want to go full VR that your vision could be completely occluded by some sort  Of a virtual representation of you know your current landscape or a fictional landscape  So, you know, I would like to think that down the road these two things will kind of blend together  And you'll simply be stepping from one to the other somewhat seamlessly  The yeah ultimately in the short term at least in the midterm AR is definitely the sort of thing that you can apply to your  current day-to-day life whereas VR is going to be much more of a  gaming entertainment sort of thing as much as Facebook wants to turn into a social experience down the road and maybe they'll figure out a  Way to make you know second life cool for a new generation with their own

Transcript:  What Tim said is really interesting too because  Based on what we've heard so far what limited things you've heard so far about magically that's exactly what they're going for  That's that's Google's that's Google's right and that's Google too. And you or they have a heavy investment in them rather  But what they're doing is, you know their technology kind of this is not the terminology  They'd probably want us to use but they kind of blasts the images right into your eyeball and they can dial it up  You know from AR they dial it straight up to VR and back again  As needed and you know, that's the kind of one gadget to rule them all the ultimate goal is to not only you know  Have something cool entertainment experience, but also just eliminate most of the screens in your life, too  That's really what they're going for and that's like a really bold mission for that company. But I mean, yeah  Yeah, this is magically

Transcript:  We really thinks they're onto something very similar to that and why the resolution is so how would you do that with contact lenses?  What would you it's some kind of thing where again they haven't shown any of what they have but these people  John Dewar spoke at our conference  I think it was two years ago our BI mission conference and he was just like this things this blew my socks off

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's totally different. So HoloLens  I was actually a little disappointed with how narrow the field of view is  You know, if you look in your peripheral vision the images that you're looking at kind of disappear it's cool  You can walk around the room and like walk around these fake objects in real life  But it's nothing like those HoloLens videos show we know a little more a HoloLens

Transcript:  Evangelist Bruce Harris spoke at an event in Israel  And Brad Sam's is reporting that he shared some more information about this  five and a half hour use  Battery life unless you're on heavy load and it'll be two and a half hours  Anything can connect to the device as long as it supports Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and here he addresses that tricky field of view image  Whether you know whether you're looking through a slot a mail slot or what?  He said it's basically like a 15 inch monitor about two feet away from your face and the reason  finally giving a reason for this and confirming it is  Because of cost and battery life but Harris said as manufacturing improves the company intends to expand the field of view  It's just a price issue  He says is being made by Microsoft not by a third party, but not in the US  And of course, we know that Microsoft has announced there'll be a developer edition for three thousand dollars  Coming out at some point this year. So, you know, we're in early days of all of this stuff  I mean, it's interesting VR must be easier to do. I think it is technically technically a lot easier to do  You don't have to calculate in real time real world surfaces and respond to them  But that so that's a little bit ahead right now  But I think both will be very important and I'm kind of with you Ben  I'm I will I would probably wear an AR device of some kind whether it's glass or HoloLens or something else a lot  I mean, I would love the idea of being in the real world  But getting augmented information about that real world. Yeah, I mean generally speaking the dedicated device

Start time: 4216.44
End time: 4330.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is going to be ahead in what I mean dedicated not just dedicated in that  that's all the device does but the device is dedicated to doing one sort of job and like they like the the  The gaming or console world and movie world has traditionally been ahead and then things come along  You know things like your phone come along come along behind  But then but eventually they become good enough and  and this is I think the one I've been actually relatively skeptical and critical of of of  Facebook thinking that IQUS will be a platform of the future  I think they certainly they want and expect it to be more than just the next console  and one reason to  And so I think that's why like Google and Microsoft have been more focused on the AR sort of things  Which is I think is more about the platform of the future and we've got a Google doesn't own magically  They've just invested in it via Google Ventures  But you know if you want to have a defense of Facebook going the sort of IQUS route  It's that well it is gonna be the market first  I mean you can buy one now or pre-order one now and and because yeah, it's it's a it's an easier  Problem to solve and then can you branch out from that to more of an AR view? Maybe?  We'll see we'll see how it'll be certainly interesting to see how it plays out  There's a go-to-market challenge with any dedicated device  Which Microsoft learned with you know they wanted the Xbox to be the computer for the home the problem is like by starting with gaming  Yes, there was an established market, but they ended up making it too expensive to be a computer for everyone  You know I think  There will be there's always it's always the challenge of building a platform from a dedicated device is you end up  Having a real tension between your hardcore customers and just casual people  For example I didn't order innocuous.

We should get those first right. I think you will yeah  But it's not just gonna be oculus you got a lot of people are very excited about HTC's vive  Which is in a relationship with steam those are two good players Sony's got their own helmet and now Google has really doubled down on  AR or VR they have a taken  Clay baver who was VP for product management. He was in charge of Gmail Google Drive Google Docs  He also was in charge of cardboard  he's now dropping all the apps and he is going to be a  Senior vice president in charge of VR  They've got a guy doing VR full-time at Google and a fairly I think fairly high level guy  So that seems like his title is VP virtual reality or VP VR

I thought oh this will take a while  So I said wait a minute. I have a app  I just put on my iPhone that attaches to the watch that has a complication on the watch allows me to record and  I press the record button  It's what is it called press record?  Press record now. I can't remember. Let me look it up here  It was it just press record it was it was awesome  The audio I could play you the audio the audio  From my watch and sitting here with Addy  Sounds pretty good. I am sitting here with Addy who is going to now ask me some questions for Addie's doesn't that sound pretty much?  Like I search paper in sixth grade  Question one

I mean holy gonna come downloading it right now  It's amazing and then and you need not all the watch faces support the complication. I'm using  What is the name of this chronograph but the complication on chronograph you have a little microphone complication you tap that  It records and then the cool thing is it immediately transfers it over to the phone  So as I was able to email this back to Addie  As soon as we were done  What's the app called?  Just press record  Where did I find out? I think I found out about this on Mac break weekly one of our  Hosts probably Renee Richie or might have been yeah. They was Renee told me about this. Isn't that cool?  So that is this is the first app on the watch  Then I really thought okay that takes advantage of the watch's form factor in a unique way  I mean, I've got a stopwatch application on here big deal, you know, I mean I could do that with a time X

Transcript:  Oh, the basic for me is notifications  I mean, I just love not having to pull my phone on my pocket that said  It I will note that I like the watch. I still wear it every day  It has reduced its utility in for two reasons one cold weather because I have long sleeves on now  and so  There's more effort involved in looking at it  Which has been complicated by it  No, no pun intended has been complicated by the fact that I broke my arm which made it much  I didn't have another Oh dear. I didn't have another hand to pull my sleeve up  So it actually for for a few weeks  Anyway, it ended up being that pulling the phone in my pocket was more convenient than looking at my cast.

It is the concern that  In general tech won't be the driver that it has been for a long time  and also that Taiwan needs to move beyond a sort of manufacturing sort of mindset and approach and  It's gonna it's a generational thing again. I mean, I think  the big thing that drove this election was  Discontent about things like wages relative to real estate for example  And there's definitely a youth  Much more of a component to this and a lot of disillusionment with the current with the current government. I mean  I'm not gonna wait in on the other side because you know, my job is about technology not politics  But it was it was definitely a sea change the last two actions have been a real sea change  Just the party in power basically almost wiped out  And so it'd be very interesting to see what happens over over the next couple of years  So it'd be very interesting to see what happens over over the next couple of years

Um, but in general that's that's  For better or worse, that's still the tech angle that matters is is component  Is components and the supply chain and you know the hopes for taiwanese branded tech companies like  Acer and asus and htc obviously did not turn out and  There isn't a great  software

Um also and there's different parts  But then like for example like the camera like the sensors made in japan  Uh the actual lens modules made in taiwan  watts  taiwan, I think by volume might have the highest number of suppliers of the iphone, uh, or it's somewhere up there and so  They're made in china like there's lots of parts that go into making a phone  It's assembled in china would actually be a more appropriate term.

Transcript:  Hey, if you have a nest thermostat, you might have been left in the cold literally  This week, that's what nick bilton said in his new york times article  Uh the nest thermostat, which is of course owned by google as the entire nest company is  at a mysterious software bug  Apparently there was a firmware update pushed a couple of weeks ago that drained its battery and sent nick's home  Into a chill in the middle of the night, but nick wasn't alone many many nest owners were now nick has a newborn  He says he was woken  By the baby crying at 4 a.m. The nest was off his room was 64 degrees and dropping  Uh, apparently this was a quite a quite a bug  And not so much if you live in los angeles as nick does but very much  So if you used a nest in your vacation home in the rockies for instance, and your pipes are frozen  uh  There is a fix but you have to take your nest off the wall plug it into a computer via usb  Push a bunch of buttons. It's a nine step process to reset it  Uh, it takes at least an hour  And meanwhile, you're freezing cold. It's not a good thing  Nick says a number of his friends did the easy thing which is go out to the hardware store and buy a  $25 not so smart thermostat that actually worked  Uh not kind of a black mark for next nest, but even maybe more importantly a black mark for the internet of things

Start time: 6216.11

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And smart home in general  I mean that's definitely one of those things that you you want to always work  Especially if you're away on vacation and that kind of thing happened  You know if you were away for two weeks and it was to blow freezing  Absolutely, your pipes would be burst and you could be and you can be in a lot of trouble  These are things that absolutely have to work all the time. Um, just like the nest protects

He said the opinion of nest is struggling a little bit  He thinks that there are some defections from nest people don't like working for tony fidel  And that some of the nest technology is not doing so well  And maybe maybe this and by separating made this point which I thought was interesting by separating nest out from google  Making it a separate division under alphabet  It it yes, there's more autonomy. Yes, the company can be run, you know more independently  But it also means you can't hide failure  And it actually could if a company's struggling like this  Could uh, heisen its demise

Transcript:  Yeah, this is a pretty brutal  Failure, I think by by nest i'm actually I think they've it seems like they've skated by relatively  unscathed, I mean fortunately all you I thought there'd be a couple, you know, like  Pipes bursting stories to tim's point. I mean that they're getting the tens of thousands of dollars potential worth worth of damage  uh, but I mean the big challenge with with selling something that's way more expensive than the standard is  it's all about the delta between what you already have and what and what you're going to go out to get and

Transcript:  nick points out by the way that in deep buried within the nest  agreement is uh a  requirement that you use arbitration  And so that if you did suffer some damage, uh, there are limits to the damages you can specify and  You'd have to go to san francisco for the arbitration  advantages of software  And you have to keep it confidential  Uh blah blah blah.

Transcript:  This is not the only internet of things uh failure in the news this week one of our sponsors ring that makes the ring video doorbells  Uh had a problem as well. There was a post from a security a blogger  Uh who had figured out that if you take the ring video doorbell  Which is a doorbell that has is tied to your wi-fi as a camera microphone and speaker  If you take it off plug it into your computer you can fairly easily  Extract the user's  wi-fi login and password  And uh, I I I tweeted gee i'd much much more worried about losing my 200 doorbell than that  But the point is you could put it then back on you do this in the dead of night put it back on  Uh, hope that nobody noticed when they when you remove the ring and then you'd have the password and you could continue on with it ring  however had a better uh  Ending to this story because it turns out that the ring video doorbells are why are updatable automatically  They are on the wi-fi and ring was alerted of the security flaw  Developed a solution and pushed it out to all active ring devices  Uh two weeks ago so that at this point no ring video doorbell is vulnerable  But it's points out the we're gonna this is just the beginning of a lot of stories  Because all of these internet things that dices whether it's your samsung refrigerator with a camera in it or your doorbell  Or your car or your car. They're all tied to your wi-fi and if they security practices on these  Products aren't good. It could lower the total security of your network. I saw a great tweet today

Transcript:  Well, you know one thing that ring did right which is it they put in a mechanism for automatically updating the firmware instantly  And uh that got them off the hook for this one  So they did do that right and I think that that points the way for  For future a lot of these devices are not updatable or don't have a mechanism to do that  Um, and that's a problem. That's gonna be a problem  I wonder if the nest can be updated over the year in fact was updated over the year  I think that was the problem is that they had pushed a firmware update which then two weeks later caused this nest problem  And once it's dead, you can't update it  It's too late  Um, let's see  Um  Facebook mentions for android big deal. I did though have to do a live stream immediately just to see if it worked  Uh facebook messenger apparently an app for mac on its way according to photo evidence tech crunch  Got from somebody a u.s.

Transcript:  Well, I think in general it's the exact opposite direction twitter needs to be going. Yeah  Um, there are there are absolutely and I acknowledge strong arguments for allowing  anonymity on the flip side there are very real problems with anonymity and  I think that  twitter should in generally be moving towards  towards  more verified accounts, um  and and less  And having less room for to sort of drive by sort of abuse that is  That is unfortunately, uh much more suited to twitter than almost any other network  I mean the the beauty of twitter is I can reach out to and have a conversation with anyone on the planet that may or may not reply  one of the problems is that anyone on the planet can reach out and have a conversation with me and  Sometimes that's not particularly pleasant now for me. I don't really have a problem because i'm fortunate to  Uh one have great twitter followers. Thanks guys. I love you and also to be a  I mean to be frank a white male who just doesn't have to deal with that  um, there are others that aren't as fortunate and  uh  I mean not as fortunate twitter mentions. They're  Perfectly fortunate as human beings that have to deal with a significant level of abuse and  and the problem for twitter is  At what point is that worth it? What point is it worth it to have drive-by?  callouts that you didn't ask for  um, and that's a that's a  What's the word it starts with an e uh, that's an existential problem for twitter like people just not wanting to be there  Not wanting to be on the platform and I think

Yeah  Why the one thing that people  Like tv manufacturers, I think you know always pushing for 3d and pushing for 4k and sort of thing  Failed to appreciate is that a big reason why people bought hd tvs was not for hd  It's because the tv set itself was physically such a better object to have this thin  Thing is that this big massive box  uh, and I think that with with vr the the immersive aspect, uh is  Is such a like that's just as important as the content itself like that. It is a physically different sort of experience  Um and and as opposed to  The 3d or or even 4k sort of thing. I love this. This is a video from

You can look at what's going on  behind me  And this was a cheap 350 dollar, uh camera  I I take it with me everywhere now because I feel like this is a really interesting way if you're if you're you know  I mean if you're just talking on like we are I don't know if there's much value to it  But if you're in somewhere interesting  the ability to look around  It's kind of neat

Transcript:  But it's always been that way and gopro has always been able to elevate them above the herd by having this brand image  You know these kind of silly looking silver cameras stuck on the helmets of all the pro  Boto cross racers and everything else that you want to be  But definitely, you know, those things are becoming more and more commoditized it's it's going to become more difficult for them  They've got to stay progressive. They've got to stay ahead of the curve and right now  They don't have a an affordable 360 vr option  They do have that high in google thing that we saw in iota last year  But that's you know, ten thousand dollars or something like that  They need a 360 camera and they need a drone in the market really soon  And certainly there's a lot of talk that those things are coming, but they're not here yet when you love to have just two things

Start time: 7369.92
End time: 7457.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean one yeah, those points are both well made  But two a brand ultimately has to be based on something  like and and and gopro not being different is a problem for the brand in the long run and then three the  Reality is the brand that matters as far as community and content  When it comes to the sort of sports that gopro's focus on is red bull. I mean red bull has  Has occupied the position that I think gopro was striving for  and  So they're a nice secondary brand  Um, but that's a secondary brand based on an increasingly  Disappearing brand value  And brands that's why brands fade the reason why the apple brand for example apple doesn't succeed because  Apple absolutely does succeed because the apple brand but that brand in the long run if apple stopped innovating if apple stopped having  interesting new features and new products the value of that brand would fade as all as  brands do  And how does apple stay differentiated by having software differentiation like that's that's how they differentiate their products is the key is ios and that sort  of thing  And gopro by lacking that again, this is just what happens  This is this is all  Unexpected again the the challenge as far as you know picking stocks off goes is timing  Although this is probably one that would have been easier to get right than others.
