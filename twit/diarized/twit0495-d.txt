Start time: 187.43
End time: 194.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  Yeah, that news came out this week.  And I'm writing the book about the Silk Road and the Dread Pirate Roberts and what a crazy, crazy, crazy story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The trial going on right now.

Start time: 197.10
End time: 223.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was in New York the last couple of weeks covering the trial.  And I have finally I finally understand why they call it courtroom drama.  Why?  Because there's so much drama.  It's just so intense.  And everyone is the prosecution and the defense.  And, you know, it's one of the few instances where I think on television they are not able to come out.  They are not able to capture the real drama that's taking place in a courtroom.  It's really, really intense.  I agree.

Start time: 224.04
End time: 231.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, whenever I have free time, I like to sit in courtrooms and watch because sometimes it can be.  It really is better than the TV shows.  It's really great.

Start time: 232.14
End time: 260.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing because you're in there and, you know, I'm in the press gaggle with, you know, great reporters from Forbes and Wired and so on that have been covering the whole thing from the beginning.  And to the left of us on the in the other seats is the family.  Ross Ulbricht, who is accused of being the Dreadpire Roberts, you see his dad and his mom and his sister and all these people.  And it's incredibly difficult to kind of watch that, to see the reality of kind of what the story could end up doing to them.

Start time: 261.66
End time: 287.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what are you what are you noticing from like we especially people on this show who listen to the show are much more tech literate about things like the dark Internet.  And whatnot.  Now you're in the you're in the mainstream.  You're in a public courtroom where maybe they don't know nearly as much as these listeners.  Is that from what you've seen, even a little bit you've seen?  Is that an issue?  Are you like pulling your hair up like, no, that's not how it works.

Start time: 288.80
End time: 397.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is an excellent, excellent question, because there's a couple of things that are going on in the trial where one of that somebody from Vice wrote this really great piece that said the problem with the jury in the Silk Road trial is they don't understand the Internet.  And they literally as far as we're all concerned, they don't.  They they've never heard of Bitcoin.  They've never heard of Tor, the dark web.  They don't know what crypto currencies are.  You know, they don't even understand.  I mean, they they don't don't understand certain instances of emoji and things like that.  So there's these instances in court where there was one one moment where the prosecution was reading the chat log between the Dreadpire Roberts and one of his his people that worked for him.  And he didn't mention a smiley face emoji.  And so there was after the jury had walked out at lunchtime, there was a big discussion and debate about whether the emoji should be explained and so on.  And, you know, just that alone was was really fascinating.  The other thing that's that's been interesting is the prosecution and the judge have been pushing for a glossary that the jury can have that would explain what, you know, the Bitcoin means or what this or that the other are.  And the defense is kind of pushing against it because I think that one of the goals of the defense is like is to kind of confuse a little bit as to what these things mean and what they are.  But there's also it's really difficult for them to come up with a conclusive definition of what certain technologies are because they mean different things to everyone.  You could if you're the prosecution, you could say Tor is a network that is used for the dark web mostly to go and buy drugs.  If you're the defense, you can say Tor is a network that people who live overseas can safely talk to their family and friends with.  So it's been really fascinating seeing that.  But but you definitely get the sense that that they have no concept of what people are talking about most of the time.

Transcript:  Were you there for jury selection?

Start time: 400.41
End time: 456.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was ever jury selection.  I've been I mean, obviously both sides wanted this jury, right?  Yeah. So the both sides didn't want anyone who understood tech too much.  They didn't want people.  No, seriously, it's true.  It's true. One of the questions they would ask to decide who who they were going to put on the jury was they didn't want anyone on the jury who read the news on their mobile devices or on their computer.  They wanted people that read the news and using traditional newspapers and then media sources.  And so it really is interesting.  And it's a it's a it is definitely, you know, a wide range of our peers of all walks of life.  And it's it's funny.  There's like there's one guy in the back who, like, you seem like kind of falling asleep sometime.  He like catches himself like when they're exchanging explaining how like a Bitcoin exchange works.  They get into the minutia of every single aspect of it.  And they're showing MD five hashes and this that and the other obfuscated.

Start time: 456.61
End time: 463.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Confuse them.  So I wonder, I mean, one of these because they don't need to know that to understand.  No, no. And that's part of part of the beauty.

Start time: 464.00
End time: 495.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, justice should be justice should transcend your understanding of like networking protocols.  There's the sense of right and wrong should somehow still be available if the story is being told effectively.  And I'm just like for us, it would be like traveling 20 years into the future and being jurist on a trial about things we've never heard of.  But we can still somehow suss out when someone's being wronged or being wronged situation.  It's like an as an interesting theoretical test for me of like how much information is required to render a sound judgment.

Start time: 496.44
End time: 501.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I have to say I've watched a lot of The Good Wife, so I feel like I understand how this works now.  We obviously know.

Start time: 504.30
End time: 517.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're actually it's you're actually right.  I know a lawyer that a couple of lawyers have spoken to and they said The Good Wife is is exactly right every single time in the in the legal aspects.  So you probably do know.

Start time: 518.20
End time: 548.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like there's this ideal which Baratunde you just described of, hey, we don't need to understand the nitty gritty, the technical details to understand this case.  But then there's the reality of it, which is that both sides are really trying to obfuscate.  They they they are their interest is in not having the jury understand this case in either in either case,  because the more they don't understand, the easier it is for them to slant it in a way that favors their side.

Start time: 549.02
End time: 560.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can manipulate people who are ignorant much more than you can manipulate people who have a full understanding.  And that is the premise of our democracy.  USA, USA, USA.

Start time: 563.26
End time: 598.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I do have to say, though, it has it has been a very eye opening experience to see that because you have this assumption that the people do understand Bitcoin.  I do understand Bitcoin and so on.  And the other thing that's been really fascinating is, you know, as a reporter, the New York Times, my job is to kind of explain these things in layman's terms to people.  And you definitely see that that there are other industries where that is completely 100 percent necessary.  You should have there should be someone on the legal teams of both of both groups, you know, being able to come up with really good analogies for, you know, how bitcoins are exchanged or or that's Taurus.

Start time: 598.62
End time: 657.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a it's a challenge of storytelling not to get too much in the weeds.  But I know serials, obviously a podcast people have been talking about a lot.  And I ended up having a conversation with an assistant district attorney who said, look, every case is muddy and there is no pure truth that we have access to.  Like people think if I just had more information, I could absolutely know exactly what happened, when and where.  And that's not the case. We never have full information.  We have our best judgment. We have our best storytelling capabilities and we have a little bit of faith and trust.  And that's that's better than zero. That's better than like random slaughter and assassination executions.  So we're above that. We're not medieval anymore.  But pure justice is probably not attainable.  And someone in the chat room also added like, yeah, there's a lot of tech in this case.  But if you are looking at a case that involves like high performance automobiles and that's key to the case, like most people don't know about that either.  So there's always going to be some gap in like full education.  And we have our system shouldn't require everyone to be an expert in that technology.

Start time: 659.14
End time: 669.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really easy to understand that what was going on that Silk Road was kind of a black market using the Internet to sell illicit goods, including drugs online.

Start time: 669.62
End time: 673.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't need to know Tor. You don't need. But you don't need a special degree to know any of this.

Start time: 674.86
End time: 702.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what you have to do, what you have to do is the jury is follow the logic of Ross Ulbricht being the kid who ran it.  Well, that's tough because the evidence I don't I don't I dimly remember the FBI catching him about a year ago and how they caught him.  And I think that's what the jury is going to have to assess is, is this electronic evidence compelling that he did it?  Because there's no there's no smoking gun. It's not like.  Well, he was seeing that.

Start time: 704.62
End time: 746.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what the smoking gun was. The smoking gun was actually the defense's opening statement where the the the the judge,  Dre Tell, who's who is representing Ross, came out out in the open and in the beginning, not judge attorney, sorry, the judge, the attorney, Dre Tell,  came out in the beginning and said, my client started the Silk Road.  But then he it got a little overwhelming and he he left soon after.  And he's not the Dread Pirate Roberts. He's not the Dread Pirate Roberts and the real Dread Pirate Roberts framed him and so on.  But but that was I mean, that was a shock in the courtroom when he said my client started it because from the beginning,  the defense has always said that they had nothing to do with it.

Start time: 747.46
End time: 769.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dre Tell said, quote, he created it as a completely freewheeling free market site that could sell anything.  In other words, just a marketplace except a couple of items that were harmful.  But after several months, the work became too stressful and Mr.  Olbrich handed it off to others.  And then he's then he's the fall guy, a perfect fall guy for the real guy.

Start time: 770.02
End time: 801.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of my one of my favorite little moments in the trial was when they had one of the FBI forensics experts come out and explain what they found on Ross's laptop when they caught him in the library.  And as he was logged into the Silk Road as mastermind and all these things, he was also a bit torrenting at that very moment.  I had a video interview with Stephen Colbert and Vince Gilligan of the creator Breaking Bad, which I thought was which was quite ironic.

Start time: 802.26
End time: 816.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the one who knocks what we've learned some interesting things from this trial trial.  One of the things that was kind of a huge story was that Mount Gox was this.  Am I right on this had invested in Silk Road.  What's the story there?

Start time: 818.18
End time: 852.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was there was a point in time when the the CEO Mark Carpellas of Mount Gox was considered the possible dread pirate Roberts.  And you know, the that that was the originally going to be the defense's case that it could have been him.  But the prosecution argued, well, there was 400 people that it could have been until we found the right person.  There are always other suspects in the case.  But there was there was some stuff that went on with the servers being housed and in certain places that could have been perceived.  And there was all these different things.  But that was all kind of squashed after the fact.

Start time: 853.70
End time: 869.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Catherine Forrest, the judge, said, no, that's inadmissible.  The fact that the Department of Homeland Security thought it might be Mark Carpellas is inadmissible.  Yeah. It's fascinating to watch this.  How long how much more longer is this trial expected to go on?

Start time: 871.04
End time: 902.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The prosecution is going to arrest it was supposed to arrest actually Monday tomorrow.  But because of the snow, they're expecting to delay the trial a day.  So the prosecution will probably arrest on Tuesday.  And the defense is expected to take two more days.  They have seven day character with witnesses coming.  And then there are two big questions.  The big the first big question is, will Ross testify?  If he does, it's going to be two days.  They think of back and forth.  But it's it's it's a risky, risky, risky bet for him to testify.

Start time: 903.24
End time: 921.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as in every case, when the accused test, if he doesn't testify, there's some presumption the jury might think he's avoiding being questioned because he's guilty.  If he does, he could absolutely say something stupid and the trial's over.  It's always a challenge. I know this from watching The Good Wife, by the way.  I know that's real.

Start time: 923.14
End time: 930.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I went to the law school.  Serial is law school, isn't it?  Podcast networks. Great.  It's much more affordable than actual.

Start time: 931.90
End time: 978.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the after the after the defense rest, they're going to do their closing statements, which I think are going to be very, very intense, because that's when they're going to really kind of get into the murders that didn't necessarily happen.  But they were he was accused of offering Bitcoin to assassins.  Yeah, so that's when they're going to get into that from the from the prosecution side.  And that's when the defense is going to get into all these other people that could have been and how his laptop may have been taken over by hackers and and so on.  And then and then the jury has to decide.  And and there are a lot of charges against him, some of which there's a kingpin charge, which could which could be life in jail.  There's numerous drug charges.  And if he's found guilty, he's going to be he's going to be in quite some trouble.

Start time: 979.10
End time: 981.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thirty years old, he could be spending the rest of his life in prison.

Start time: 982.70
End time: 1007.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a there was one moment in the it's amazing to see the all the all the things that take place in the courtroom when there's not court in session.  But there was one moment when one of the days when during the lunch break, the the judge, the same judge sentenced someone else, a man to jail for 12 years for drug dealing.  And his family were there and they were screaming and crying.  And it's it's intense stuff.  Like to see it firsthand, it's really, really, really intense.

Start time: 1007.08
End time: 1064.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was on a jury for one of the trials.  Remember the horrible thing they used to do on NBC to catch a predator MSNBC where they would set up a house and they would entice people to come there and predate on young girls.  And I was on the jury of one of these guys who was being tried.  It's a similar kind of thing because the jury has to all you know, they're reading transcripts from chat rooms and all sorts of stuff and a very similar issue of how much technical information you need for this.  But it was interesting because we heard the prosecution's case and then the judge threw it out saying it's entrapment.  You don't have to hear the defense.  It's over.  And they let you go.  But it is.  But I've had a similar experience.  But what we didn't have and what you have, which is great, is the stuff with the jury's out of the room and all the all the wrangling over a smiley face.  The judge finally did rule that the smiley face is part of the information of the message and should be read.

Start time: 1065.32
End time: 1070.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the judge ruled that you can't that they didn't want the chat logs being read with any sort of special emphasis.

Transcript:  Oh, they should. This is like there's a lot.  I mean, I lay the past few months as a lot of out of work actors here.  I think we should.  No, because any dramatization slants it.  Any dramatization slants it.  And we'll do multiple versions.  That's even more work.  I guess what I'm saying, guys, is I support the arts.  I agree.

Start time: 1161.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

The more I listened to it, the more I realized it was some weird line between journalism and entertainment.  And it was unfair to the family in my eyes.  And I don't think it was handled very well towards the end.  I think it became it got so much hype that it kind of it didn't take into account that there were human beings that were being talked about and analyzed and so on.  I know we just did that.  Bartender and I just did that.  And but and I will not listen to the next one.  Good.  Because because I don't because I think that it I think it was an exploration down a line of a new form of storytelling.  I think that was what's really interesting about it.

And in a way that was pretty irresponsible.  You know, not everybody who engaged already was irresponsible, but I think it created a forum and an excuse for people who heard this story and thought because of the way that the Internet and technology makes you think about problem solving.  I just need more data and I can solve this.  Right.  I like this has been this is a bug in the system.

And so part of the unintended consequence, I'm sure it was truly unintended, but because they didn't expect it to be as popular as it was.  But when you assume things are going to be public and could become very popular, the level of like ethics and responsibility to me get even more interesting.  And when Internet communities decide to try to play detective at digital private eye and start harassing people and making phone calls and sitting outside of people's houses, that's like you've unleashed another undesirable thing in society.

Transcript:  OK, but no, here's the thing.  Two things.  First of all, OK, I know we kind of like dis all the social media stuff.  And there's times I get super frustrated with it.  And everyone's like, well, I wanted a flying car and all I got was Facebook.  OK, imagine imagine for a second that that none of this stuff existed,  that we weren't talking on this thing and that and that we were all standing in a field somewhere.  We're a bunch of idiots.  And someone comes along and they're like, you see that thing over there that that car can fly.  You can you can have that.  Or here's this thing.  It's a smartphone.  You can connect to anyone in the world instantly.  Millions and millions of people.  I'm going for this.  Yeah.

Start time: 4421.59

Transcript:  No, I agree.  The smartphone is an amazing thing.

Start time: 4424.04
End time: 4443.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get it.  And I think that we kind of underestimate the power of these things.  And one of the things that I've learned with Snapchat stories specifically,  because there are so many kids on there and they're not rude and they're not mean.  Like if I go on Twitter, it's just it's just dribble of people being like, I'm smarter than you.  And you're an idiot.  Your article is an idiot.  And Bartone is an idiot.  Just getting to their credit.

Start time: 4444.00
End time: 4445.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4445.52

Start time: 4448.00
End time: 4462.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can the thing that I can attest to the radges that I had show at a high school recently, a comedy show at a high school and the kids there, that's all they do.  You know, they're on Facebook.  My kids.  Yeah, but they're not active in a meaningful way there because Facebook equals drama.  Right. Facebook equals somebody liking or not liking that stuff sits there forever.  Teachers can eventually find it.  You know, if you don't protect the settings in the right way, when you don't when the performance piece disappears, it liberates you a little bit.  It's why people do open mics in the performing world.  It's why there's like residency programs for artists to just kind of get experimental.  So that low bar, that low burden of history, you know, a system that doesn't impose history on its users gives them a level of freedom to be something that they're not allowed to be in a more publicly performative and like historical setting.  I sound like an academic, but I think that all has hopefully made sense, especially when you're a kid and you're changing and you're messing around and your words can be twisted to mean something that don't really mean this is a relatively safe, much safer environment for that level of performance.

Transcript:  Snapchat was, you know, when I first wrote about Snapchat, Evan Spiegel, the founder, was still in school and it was it was essentially being used by kids to send pictures that they shouldn't send.  And and it just kind of exploded from there.  And then it became about, you know, ephemeral messaging and then ephemeral content.  And now that's what it's about.  It's all about content.  It's about, you know, it's about messaging, too.  But the messaging, I think, is secondary to the ability to broadcast.

Transcript:  Yeah. But here's the other challenge.  I think maybe it's the same things that are affecting their slowing growth in ad revenue.  Right. Attention is shifting.  New platforms are emerging that they have nothing or almost nothing to do with.  And as the Internet and the Web part of it get populated with all this extra media,  you know, you're looking for, you know what you're looking for.  Nick, when you put here, I say the Web is dead.

Transcript:  But but but the source of credibility don't matter anymore.  Yeah, those exact the sources of credibility that conferred that knowledge in the past  were like, oh, you're clearly because the New York Times linked to it or 10,000 people  blogged about a thing.  Not that that's where Google is exactly stuck, but it certainly doesn't take advantage of,  oh, on Tuesday, two years ago, this is the super popular thing you were looking for.

Start time: 5529.86
End time: 5551.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think you're confusing that with Sidiya.  OK, OK. So Cyanogen is I first experienced it when you would take a Samsung,  let's say Galaxy S2, and you really don't want the touch with.  So you root it. You put a new recovery system on it and then you can install your own ROMs.  And Cyanogen was always one of the best.  They were version. They took Android.

Start time: 5559.28
End time: 5619.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So you root your Android and you put a different ROM on it.  You get rid of touch with and Cyanogen did something that was quasi.  I think quasi not right, but they would make it based on AOSP, the open source.  But then nobody really wants just AOSP Android.  They want all the Google services and Google apps.  So they do a side load of all of that, which will put the Play Store  and Play Services on there.  And now it's a better Android phone.  In fact, this was kind of the end game on it was putting it on a legitimate handset.  The fact Cyanogen on a one plus one is great.  Except I don't know where Sanj is going.  Their new CEO said we're going to we're going to kill Android.  They want to be the new Android.  They say Google is not a good steward of Android.  And they've taken it. But then they take money.  Sorry, didn't mean to mention Google.  My phone woke up and then they take money from Microsoft.  Any thoughts on that? That's probably not in your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The science behind that.  Yeah. What's the science behind deflate gate?  Well, the science is is about gases and it's about like the temperature of a room  and it's about what happens in pressure.

Start time: 5731.40
End time: 5756.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was for those of you don't follow sport ball,  deflate bait is a deflate gate is a controversy following,  I think it was the AFC playoffs between the Colts and the Patriots in which  the Patriots are accused of under inflating footballs to make them easier to grasp and pass.  Now, I don't understand exactly how this would benefit one team, but not the other.  Maybe I don't know, they switched footballs.

Start time: 5759.18
End time: 5763.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the idea is that you there are regular rules about how with a PSI,

Start time: 5764.14
End time: 5768.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the ball is supposed to be to twelve and a half to thirteen and a half pounds per square inch.

Start time: 5768.54
End time: 5781.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if one team has avoided those rules and then made it much easier to grip the ball,  you know, when they're playing offense, then they could in theory have some kind of advantage.  I think that's the that's the basic like allegations.

Start time: 5781.76
End time: 5785.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  The last I just talked to a super pats fanatic yesterday.  I haven't dug into this myself.  I just I'm not that into it because because football is not super important to me.  But obviously, you're here right now.  It's like the game has probably started.  But the guess the idea is the Patriots are saying we didn't do anything wrong.  Like this just happened.  And so there's a question of deflation.  Deflation happens.  Yeah, is it possible for footballs to lose pressure?  I'm not going to play into the balls.  I can't do the balls pun thing anymore.  Is it possible for footballs to lose their pressure naturally?  Or do they have to be interfered with by a person who is basically trying to cheat  in some way?

You're not going to I think anyone that's using it is using it.  So why screws over with the cost of it, first of all?  And second of all, there are technologies out there.

JetBlue has it.  They are upgrading now. Yes, they are upgrading.  And so it's like, you know, why charges the air to ground stuff is three  megabits per second. It's it's well, because Nick,

But they you know, when what I keep finding  that's really fascinating with technology is every time some new,  amazing technology comes out, we're like, wow, this is the greatest thing ever.  Like 3D printing.  And then somebody thinks of something really bad to do with it, like make guns.  And I think that you're starting to see that with drones.  And we first saw it was like, wow, this is really amazing.  And now people are  are coming out saying, well, but they're using  that being used on the border to to to pass drugs back and forth and so on.  That's a good idea. A great idea.

You know, the hammer can be used to bash in one's head in the knife  can be used to into one's life in a second and also carve a delicious,  delicious roast, you know, on a Sunday afternoon.  So so we should be very careful.  That delicious. That was like I was just I think.  But like, you know, the white this this White House situation, like, yes,  a drunk employee flew a drone over, but also a dude just jumped over the fence  and then ran.

Transcript:  Like there's just thing is they can do something about the dudes jumping over  the fence. These drones are harder.  By the way, DJI's response, I think DJI and other  Phantom manufacturers are totally terrified that because the president said  there needs to be more regulation.  And so DJI has now got a mandatory firmware update  that will stop the drones from flying over Washington, D.C.  Over the whole city. They don't work.

Transcript:  The updated firmware will be released in coming days, says DJI.  It adds a no fly zone centered on downtown Washington, D.C.  for a 15 and a half mile radius in all directions.  Phantom pilots in this area will not be able to take off from or fly into this  airspace. What? What?  Furthermore, they're going to start programming its drones to stop flying  when they get within certain distance of airports.  See, DJI is unlike some cheaper drones have GPS built in.

Oh, unplug and replug your headset while we talk about fresh books dot com.  It is cloud accounting software designed for small businesses or freelancers.  A lot of us, I, you know, I for years was going to Canada,  doing the TV show up there, and I had to bill them every month.  And I would forget and forget.  I didn't forget. I hated it.  Who wants to launch Microsoft Word typing in the whole thing printed out?  Like a stamp. Just I would put it off,  which means I wouldn't get paid for months.  And then they'd complain when they get five invoices at the same time.  Fresh books save my life.  Fresh books makes it easy to invoice beautiful, professional looking invoices.  You can have them automatically created every month if you wish.  They they have when you email the invoice, a pay button  your clients will love because they press that button.  And you can use top credit cards, online payment systems.  You on average will get paid five days faster when you use fresh books.  That's amazing.  Fresh books integrates with your apps and services to like Google apps  and PayPal and Stripe and MailChimp and Funbox and Zen payroll and on and on and on.  You can work in multiple currencies, which is great for me.  I was billing in US and Canadian dollars for a long time.  Fresh books customers spend less time on paperwork.  You free up on average two days a month to focus on the work you love.  And if you've been using, you know, a paper system or a stopwatch  to build time and hours, don't.  They've got apps for Android and iOS that will do that automatically  and put it right in the invoice.  You can even snap photos of receipts right from your phone.  Enter the details and fresh books makes it very easy  for you to bill for expenses as well.  Never been better.  And with an open API, developers can integrate with Fresh Books platform.  And so more features are being added all the time.  The best support in the world.  PC Magazine calls Fresh Books simple and friendly.  Its invoice management is among the best.  Got editors choice for both web application and mobile apps.  And I agree. I've been using it for years.  Try Fresh Books free with no obligation.

Transcript:  Oh, I so I have a very similar story.  I bought a very inexpensive drone, a SEMA,  because Padre, Father Robert, who is one of our hosts here, is an expert on drums.  He's building them on know how we have drone school.  We do a lot of drone stuff here.  And he said, look, the first drone, you shouldn't get an expensive one.  No, get a 40 dollar drone.  So I got the 40 dollars.  SEMA. It's not quite disposable. Forty bucks.  But it also it has the advantage of being very light.  It couldn't really hurt anybody.  So first, I put batteries in, charged the battery up on the drone, got the remote.  You push the joystick forward to make it go up  and it goes up.  And then I try to go backwards. It doesn't go backwards. It goes up.  I try to left goes backwards. It goes up.  I try to goes up.  It's like a bullet, like a helium freaking balloon.  I lose sight of it.  I can't see it. I'm going, where to go, where to go.  It's gone. First time.  No, you never found it again.  I walked the property.  I walked three acres looking for it.  Wait, are you serious?  Isn't it have a look into it?  Gone in 30 seconds. This was gone in five.  How do you know someone isn't stealing your drone?

Start time: 6631.52
End time: 6677.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steal it if they could find it in a remote.  So I had the DJI sent me the Phantom,  the latest one when it first came out.  That's nice. And I was doing a I was doing a product review.  And I was in San Francisco and the big business editor was in town  from the New York Times.  And and I took him down to the water and I took this other reporter  down to the to the to the to the water, too.  And we were flying down in this big, big, big parking lot.  And I'm like, oh, and I said to my editor, I was like, take it over the water.  Let's take some photos of the boats.  And he was like, OK.  So he flew it out over the water.  And he looks at me and he goes, it's it's it's not working, Nick.  And I was like, let me try.  And as he handed it to me, the drone literally just fell out of the sky.  And we ran to the water.  And that was it was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So and they weren't too happy about it because it was like a prototype.  There was like 10 of them in the world.  But but so I wanted to know what happened.  Drone business.  There's no business like drone business.  We're trying to figure out what happened.  And one of the things we thought was in these early prototype ones,  they had the switch on.  There's a law that a drone can't go within a certain distance  of an airport.  Yeah. And we thought that maybe they had that on that it was turned on  and that it automatically shut down, knowing that it was in the water.
