Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is This Week in Tech, episode 7, recorded June 2nd, distributed June 4th, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th Upwork Class Twit of the Year show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now for something completely different.  We are all twits now.  What a great twit!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So everybody's recording?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, recording.  Okay. And here's Slamdance Industry. I'm calling him again, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it just popped up saying he signed on, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. Yeah, well, I see him. I just, he's not answering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talked to Pat a little while ago. He was playing with connectors on his mic or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's still soldering. Oh no, he has the connectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I just got that 45 inch Sharp AquaSand. What a lovely, lovely display.  Nice.  1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's 1080p?  Yeah.  45 inches? How much?  Yeah, eight grand.  Eight grand? Well, that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's state of the art for what Sharp's doing right now.  And there aren't many displays you can buy right now that are, I don't think there is one larger that is actually out on the market yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to call Robert Heron P-Tip because he's the 1080p guy, or 1080p tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, the cool new trend is with smaller flat panels, the 37 inch. Everyone's shooting at 37 inches with 1080p now.  And they're all for around two grand or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when it's 1080p, that means that the native resolution of the screen from top to bottom is at least 1080 pixels.  Right.  Are they typically more than that or?  It's usually 1920 by 1080 for fixed pixel formats.  Can plasmids, are they doing any plasmids with that resolution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. But it's up in the 70 plus inch range, which is $50,000 on up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so if you want 1080p and you're going to start seeing more and more 1080p high def, LCD is the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really hope that's going. I mean, Windows Media, give them credit for their high definition effort, at least.  But at least they include 1080p in all their published formats, or as far as what you can buy in the store, like the Terminator 2 disc.  And I'm also watching, oh, what is it called? Coral Reef Adventure.  The Coral Reef Adventure.  That's been out for a while, right?  Yeah, but it is just gorgeous.  But it's just coral reef, right?  Yeah, that's true. It's lots of underwater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Schwarzenegger in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Liam Neeson narrating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this was, remember when HD first came out and you'd go to the trade shows and all these Japanese companies would be there with aquariums.  It's like, come on, we want something. I mean, you don't buy an HDTV to watch fish.  No.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, PC graphics, too, initially pushed it on just because you already had high definition PC and if you could just come up with the right format graphic, it would look pretty sharp.  The problem I'm running into actually with that sharp 46 inch right now, or 45 inch, is that even though it's 1080p, I don't believe DVI or any digital format currently supports 1080p, as far as I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean you can't put it out of anything that you've got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can do it through component, but not digitally right now, which is something I...  Like the native PC resolutions 12 by 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would that be? I mean, digital doesn't specify what the resolution is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a bandwidth issue, to be perfectly honest with the current spec, especially with DVI. I'm less certain with HDMI and that's something I'm looking into right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if it's DVI, it's going to be HDMI because it's the same thing. It's just a different electrical connector, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It should. No, I mean, it is totally backward compatible, but I was a little bummed that I couldn't just simply turn my PC on with a DVI connection to 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. That's a real limitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm willing to bet I can do it with component. I'm about to find out anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick just sent me a note saying he blew his power supply.  Don't.  Somebody's switching to another system.  Patrick's having the same problems I'm having lately.  Hey, I have to tell you something. I feel a little guilty here. I actually bought a PC laptop and worse than that, it's a tablet PC.  Oh, no. Oh, I know. I feel like I've gone over to the other side.  Hey, man. Hey, there he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. I went on hold of everyone.  I did something really stupid and blew up a power supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Patrick, are you, is your recorder on right now?  What's that? Don't say anything unless your recorder is on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I realized that I can't find the adapter for the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick's the only one who got a microphone that actually came with a connector.  With a quarter inch connector.  And you say you can't. Oh, I see. You don't have a headphone adapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a good four or five of them. But right now I started packing up my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, I don't care. Just still plug in the recorder and record yourself on the.  Okay.  Because at least we'll get a high quality recording that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I just have. No, actually. Oh, yeah, it is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And then turn it to MP3 64 kilobit.  Already did that. Yeah. So that way you'll get enough on there.  I spent the 45 minutes working through the manual to get that set up.  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is like the part in Wizard of Oz where it goes from black and white to color.  Patrick Norton is about to go from Skype to high quality audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. That's better.  Okay. Hey. Hey, guys. Yeah.  So I got a hot tip for everybody. Seriously hot tip.  If you're going to stop the fan on your big expensive computer so that the wine from the really loud power supply you haven't replaced,  even though you have a brand new power supply sitting in the room with you that you haven't installed yet,  when you're using that little removable steel tab that, you know, the card slot cover, don't stick it in too far or there'll be a loud pop and the power will stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're using the card slot to physically stop the fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now I'm not because the power supply is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, you're shooting for a Darwin Award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you just catch up on that part of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Part of the fun of working with Patrick is the risk involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, hey, somebody gave me a revision point one motherboard that was in a brand new box and I went and installed it  and I'm having more issues than I care to describe right now.  And then I realized it is a revision point one.  So they probably got it for free before it ever came out.  I'm ready to throw it out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you guys heard about the bad caps problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, where they were having problems with capacitors blowing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of that? Is that BS or is that the real deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was real about a year or two ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't? Oh, so it's all better now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was just a significant issue.  There was the whole problem where they would leak and become an aid.  It's pretty corrosive material inside of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Badcaps.net is the website.  So you think that that's all water under the bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, as soon as it came to light, it seemed that there was an immediate reaction.  Everybody took a good look at whose brand they were using and putting a little more quality, I think, into that one part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, these are pretty old. I'm looking at it now.  They are pretty old motherboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of scary when you think about, I mean, you know, you think about the amount of little tiny parts that go together to make a motherboard, you know, or an MP3 player or a video recorder.  Somebody screws up a running capacitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a two-part.  A two-cent part.  Yeah.  Well, and that's what happened.  Apparently, there's a batch of leaky capacitors that got into a bunch of motherboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quality control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, well, and especially when, you know, your margins are razor thin and you're trying to crank this stuff out.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they don't want to recall the parts and replace them like they should.  Well, that's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they learned that from, you know, Detroit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw Fight Club.  Yeah.  I know how the automobile industry works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take the cost of a recall.  Actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lawsuits.  Patrick, you're going to be mad at me.  I bought a tablet PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not mad at you.  I'm laughing at you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the worst part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least you're away from Tiger now.  I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you use it to browse in the bathroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you take it in the bathroom with you in the mornings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there needs to be a 12-step program for me for tablet PCs.  I can't stop using.  So are you drawing on the screen all the time?  Well, you know what I bought it for is for the TV show.  Because I mean, I wish we'd had these when we were doing the screen savers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you can bring up a web page and hold it up to the camera and point and just articulate and do all the stuff they tried to make us do with that football.  With a stupid teleprompter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, yeah, basically.  And also it's flat.  So it doesn't, you know, it's not like this big clunking thing sitting in front of you.  You're just holding a tablet.  And so I think particularly for Amber's web workshop, it's going to be really great because she shows sites.  She can highlight circle.  I put Visio on it so she can use Visio to quickly do mockups and stuff.  I think it's going to be a good way to do that kind of stuff anyway.  Well, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a vertical industry, Leo, much like hospitals and insurance adjusters.  I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the ink is kind of neat.  You draw, you write your stuff.  And I'm using, you know, OneNote and the Franklin planner folks have a day planner program and it holds the ink.  And then if you want to turn it into text, it does a fairly good job.  You know, it's a lot better than the Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the battery life on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got an HP, the 4200, I think TC4200, and it's a Pentium M.  And I'm getting about three hours.  It's not huge, but it's a tiny battery.  You have to get a supplementary battery.  But it's a little, you know, it's a small one.  It's not a big one.  It's a 24 by 768, 12 inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you said it's definitely better than the Newton?  It is better than the Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of cool.  You know, but now Patrick, you have to explain to me, because you're the one who always said never, you know, you don't like, you like these little micro notebooks, sub notebooks that don't have spindles.  They don't have a CD.  How do you install stuff on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm using an external CD or do it over the network.  The truth is, it's actually, it's getting, until you get into the really sub, sub notebook, I don't even know what you call them, the ones that are running like the three quarter screens where it's 1024 by 760 or, you know, 620, stuff like that.  That's what I have.  Yeah, it's getting really hard to actually find a five pound notebook that doesn't have an optical spindle in it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it should because I would like to be able to, you know, I mean, I got this for the TV show, so it's not as critical.  But I think if I were going to buy one all the time, I want one that has a DVD player and a CD burner.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my IBM T40 has, I love that.  Yeah, that's a great notebook.  Just small enough and it's tough and the keyboard's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  T-Series is an amazing series from IBM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That and the little light they put at the top of the screen you can turn on and off because I work in a dark, you know, dark lab with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I like the tablet, but it's not a tablet, right?  It's just a regular laptop.  No.  This is a convertible.  So you get the kind of the best of both worlds as long as the hinge doesn't break, which I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you guys still handle 1024 by 768?  I can't take it anymore.  I cannot work on anything that's 1024 by 768.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can.  But I'm old.  It's small enough.  I'm old.  I have bad eyes.  Everything's too tiny.  Yeah, it depends on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a high res, but I haven't been able to find that many laptops that support up to like 16 by 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new, you might like the new, there's a new tablet PC, I think it's a Toshiba that's that 16 by 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  16 by 12 is really small.  I mean, that's a really, that's, that's a lot of resolution for.  But anything for.  You have young eyes, Kevin.  Yeah, anything like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm using, what is it?  11 by 18.  Smaller than a 17.  My 19 inch monitor at home.  And I find that's just about kind of a perfect balance.  Yeah.  Without having to, you know, boost the DPI or anything to achieve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that, you can always do that.  You can make the, you know, icon text bigger and all that stuff.  I mean, you don't have to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what?  It kind of, it screws up some of the menus that pop up and things like that.  It doesn't scale everything properly, which I guess Apple supposedly does a little bit better, which wouldn't surprise me.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I ran into a big problem with it.  I was helping a friend by a laptop for doing CAD work and he had to have a minimum of 1280 by 1024 for the program to work.  And so he ended up having to go with like Voodoo is like $5,000.  Absolute top of the line card with a Quadra FX card in it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I normally found that when I was looking for a laptop, I have a Dell, the 600D.  And it was like a custom option that you had to order.  You know, it was like the, what do they call that?  Like the SXGA plus screen.  Yeah.  Extra hundred bucks or so.  Well, that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that was like, that's a 15 inch monitor on that 16 inch?  14 actually.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that's too high resolution for 14 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a 14 inch with 10 by 7 and it works out just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're crazy.  Hey, interesting.  One of my sponsors on the radio show is a DSL provider.  Just announced that they are now offering normal DSL, you know, 1.5 megabit DSL for 15 bucks a month.  I read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For how long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, SBC's done it and so now everybody's dropping.  Can you believe?  Is that for six months or is that indefinitely?  I don't know what SBC's do.  I think SBC's a few months, but these guys are guaranteeing for a year.  15 bucks.  That's great.  I really think we're going to start to see big time price wars in the high speed internet.  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you know, the big companies are going to kill off the little ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That happened before though.  Remember there were all these little ISPs and now there aren't.  Whatever happened to Vario?  Remember Vario bought everybody?  Are they still around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they still an ISP?  You don't hear about them.  I don't think so.  They bought everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on, I used to use the same person that sponsors you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't want to mention their names because it's not an ad for them at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.  I know who it is.  That's why I say the same company.  They were my residential service when I was in Oakland.  I loved them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  They're going to give me in the new, you know, I'm moving this all next week into an outside  office out of the house and I'm going to get because it's two blocks from the central  office.  I can finally get I think 512 up.  So I'm going to get like three megabits down, 512 up, something like that, whatever their  top of the line is.  And then I'm going to have at home, I'm going to have Comcast.  So it's going to be very interesting to compare the two.  I'm not sure.  I used to always like cable better.  I don't know.  What do you have, Kevin?  Do you have DSL or cable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have cable mode at home and it's terrible.  Do you have Adelphia?  No, Comcast.  And there's too many people in your neighborhood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the afternoon.  Yeah, there's too many people.  I love my cable modem.  You like it?  Robert, you said you like it or you don't like it?  I think I just cut off on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now?  Cable.  That's the cable modem.  There's the answer right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, listen, I mean, it pretty much depends on the cable provider.  And Yoshi, you like DSL.  Yeah, I have a three megabit line here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Patrick, are you cable modem or DSL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm DSL because until I moved to this house, I couldn't get a cable modem.  And the only cable modem provider I know of in San Francisco is Comcast.  And I won't give them any of my money for reasons I won't go into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, this is cool.  Nobody here works for Comcast now.  Nope.  Yay!  So we can say anything we want because nobody can get fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin, big, big rollout.  No, I'm not going to do anything.  Don't worry.  Big, big rollout for System last week.  You want to tell the world what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was just madness.  I can't believe what happened.  How many people were in the chat room, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got up to 800 people in the IRC.  But you couldn't do anything because we were being bodied the whole time.  They finally locked it down.  This was DSL Extreme who provides the chat room.  The guy's name is Andrew.  His handle is Ecstatica.  He is one of their techs there.  And he is an EFNet op and he knows what he's doing.  And he locked it down.  He did a great job.  However, I've never seen 800 people.  You know, it's like skiing.  The techs go by so fast.  You feel like it's like blurring.  You feel like you're downhill skiing through text.  It was amazing.  And it was, people were, I know you were having a party, right, with a camera.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, so basically we had a little get together.  There was probably about, I don't know, Yosh, what was it, like 15, 20 people, something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, about that.  I mean, there was over, when we were there, there was over 800 people in the IRC.  And we were like, whoa.  All the websites were getting hammered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the system actually went down.  The web server itself went down.  But luckily we used a caching service from Prolexic.  And they were able to bring on multiple machines all over the place and kind of cache all of our content and seed our content.  So we stayed up.  I saw that on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had you made an arrangement with them ahead of time or did they come to your rescue like the fire brigade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually it happened right when we went down.  Ron, who's kind of our tech guy that handles the server side of stuff,  made a call to our CEO, Jay, who is friends with the owner of Prolexic.  And they were able to accommodate us.  They were really stoked.  It was crazy because the guys, I guess, that set it up from Prolexic were like, we're hosting system?  That's awesome.  They were really stoked about it because they had heard about it themselves.  So it was really cool.  They really helped us out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're like an Akamai kind of.  They do the caching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, their main business, I guess, from what I understand is anti-denial service.  If you're a Microsoft or a Yahoo and someone's DDoSing you,  they will basically spread the hit out and also use ways to filter out the bad packets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The key at this point with DDoS, because of raw sockets, you can't really filter by IP address.  Even if you say it's a massively distributed denial of service attack where you have thousands of machines,  even then it's only going to be thousands of IP addresses.  You can eventually lock it down by blocking those addresses.  But if they use raw sockets, every request, every SIN is a different IP address.  You can't block it.  You can't lock it down.  So the only way to solve that is to throw bandwidth at it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have somewhere around a thousand servers worldwide.  That's what you need.  Spread it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you can throttle it.  And then you can also throttle it by saying, no, if I get a SIN,  so a SIN is a request, okay, I want the page.  You can't block SINs universally or your page is down.  So what they do is they say, okay, we're going to, the SIN flood,  you only get the packet once from that IP address.  Then that guy switches to a new IP address or maybe twice.  So the key on these is to say, oh, all right, well, I'm going to wait and make sure it's a real SIN.  So I'll wait until he resends because every normal browser will wait a little while and resend.  So your site's slow, but it's up.  Because you basically filter out the bad SINs.  But yeah, so that's, but it takes a lot of bandwidth to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just got a, I am from Rob.  He said he should be able to be back and he's on a different connection now.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me invite him back into the conference.  Of course, like I said, we've been hearing him on the recorder this whole time.  He's been on the Twitcast.  I'll have to, you don't have to, there we go.  I hope you weren't talking, Robert, because now I have to edit you out of the high quality version.  I hope you swore.  It's like, I ditched the ethernet and went to wireless and it seems to be working better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you looking for information on Vario, Leo?  Yeah.  They got bought by Japan's ILC NTT.  Oh, NTT Docomo.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's NTT Docomo.  It's a telephone and telegraph.  Yeah.  NTT communications, global IP network.  You get swallowed by them.  You're swallowed.  Well, it's pretty scary.  Vario, they bought more than 54 local, regional, national, international providers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were, I think, angling to be the big guy.  And then of course, a bigger, as they, to quote episode, what is it, episode two or episode one,  there's always a bigger fish.  Except if you're NTT Docomo, then there isn't a bigger fish.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have 125,000 mile network of backbones, it says.  Wow.  It's kind of insane.  Look at the global IP network.  And I'm counting like lines across the Pacific.  Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, like 18, I think.  15, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we were talking about system bringing, being just huge.  Do you know how many downloads you got, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's hard to count.  We have the tracker through BitTorrent and according to BitTorrent, it's a little over 60,000.  That's great.  And then we have all the, obviously all the mirrors that were set up and posted.  And how big is the file?  It ranges depending on you want lower or high quality, but in between 50 to 150 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 60,000 times, let's say 100 megabytes is six terabytes.  Is that right?  Yeah, six terabytes. That's a lot of data.  Holy moly. Jiminy Christmas. Good golly.  That's crazy.  Holy megabytes, Batman.  Have you seen, anybody seen the new Batman?  Batman Begins or whatever it is?  Anybody seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It comes out the middle of the month.  Everybody's getting excited. They say it's good.  Well, that 10 minute preview they showed at the end of Smallville, the season finale was, it was awesome looking.  I cannot wait. That excites me far more than Star Wars, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we've had some bad Batmans though.  Oh, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is the origin of Batman, starting from when his parents die on up through his training to become Batman.  And it really was cool, but you know, maybe they only showed the best 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope not. I really want to see it.  I have actually seen the models for the cars that they used in the movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that stuff's pretty wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I didn't know Batman was a ninja.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had to learn that somewhere.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I didn't realize he did like ninja training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The caped crusader he is.  Hey, just remember, numchucks don't kill people. Ninjas do.  I've stolen. I should give credit to that.  That is a company. I met this guy in Rockville, Maryland.  He has a company. This is his t-shirt that he had.  He was wearing. It's called, oh, it's naked.  Oh, shoot. Now I feel bad because I owe him a plug.  I just stole his best line. Naked.  I'll put a link in the show notes. Naked.  I just lost his business card. Where is it?  So, okay. I'm sorry to keep coming back to the system, but I feel like I really want to hear the whole story.  So, were you DDoSed?  No, no. It was just the downloads and the sheer number of people that were trying to access the site at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The funny thing about it though is that the main problem that we had with the server hitting its peak load was not the sheer number of users,  but it was just the fact that people were signing up for the newsletter.  Yeah.  And it was sending out, so many people were signing up for the newsletter.  It was sending out the newsletter confirmations and it actually brought our server.  We had a pretty crappy server at the time, but now we're much better.  And KevinRose.com is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You went back to TypePad?  Right. I went back to TypePad.  And are you happy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm extremely happy. I actually chatted with one of the guys there.  I think he's the CTO or I can't remember his exact title there,  but I told him some of the problems I was having as far as the site going down because of too much traffic.  And it seems like they've really built out a great backbone and a great network at TypePad.  That's me.  And I haven't had an issue ever since I moved over there.  I mean, that's a really nice success story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just this young couple, Ben and Mina, and they were all really happy.  And they've really built a business around it, which is kind of neat.  Something I'll never be able to do because I don't have a head for that stuff.  But it looks like you're doing it, Kevin.  Yeah, we're trying to.  I mean, we've put together a really good team and we're excited about cranking on as many episodes as we possibly can.  How was your last day at G4? Was it sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a little bit.  I mean, I've become friends with a lot of the people there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guys on Attack of the Show is just a really good team.  They're really good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a little bit.  I mean, I've become friends with a lot of the people there.  The guys on Attack of the Show is just a great group of people.  Who's left now?  Prager's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarah's still there.  Joshua and Brentano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Joshua and Brentano.  Brendan Moran, but he never really worked with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ryan Vance came back.  That was wild.  He was a guy who really put X-Play on the map.  And he left, and then he came back.  What, he's like a vice president now or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's pretty high up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me tell you about this blackmail story, because I think this is kind of whack.  And I don't know how widespread it is.  Just one security company claims they've discovered this.  It takes advantage of a whole, since patched, but most people still haven't patched Windows,  that allows you to, a website, to run arbitrary code on the computer of the guy who visits the site.  So if you go there with an unpatched computer, they run, what they run is PGP.  And they encrypt your document files with their password, right?  And they leave a note in your hard drive saying, you want to get into these files, it will be 200 bucks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is really clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, that's just funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's funny is that's not one million dollars, it's 200 bucks.  One million.  But Yoshi brought up a good point.  He said, well, can't we just track the payment?  I mean, maybe you have to pay somebody in Russia or something and they can't catch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, bank records can be tracked all over the world now.  I mean, if you call the feds and say I'm being blackmailed over the internet,  if they actually do investigate it, they're going to just get the routing numbers  and go know exactly what account it went into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you move fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, basically all of these hacks require that, right?  You get even the phishing scams.  You get as much as you can for the 24 hours, you can keep the site up and then you move.  Because they block these sites as soon as people notice them.  I've been getting a lot of phishing mail from eBay lately.  Yeah.  I've got one right now.  Have you guys been getting a lot of Russian spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of Russian spam.  No, but I do get a lot of emails from young Russian women who are looking to meet a good-looking guy like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you try that out?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get email that say I need to take the hair restoration drugs and then I'll meet the young Russian women.  Then they'll send me the young Russian women spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly it.  First you got to take the Viagra and the Rogaine.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you hear about that Viagra that's blinding people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you think that's true?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You'll go blind if you do that.  Oh, it's true.  Your mom was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially for all the people that are taking it recreationally.  It's like, uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, why is it any worse if you need it or you don't need it?  You're still blind.  It takes it recreationally.  I think a lot of people take it.  Come on.  Well, Kevin, you don't need to because you're young and virile.  But I think a lot of people take it recreationally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We hope.  And if you're not, we don't want to know.  I don't want to know either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that's very common.  That's why you buy it on the internet, right?  I mean, why else?  For fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you meant like he's hanging out with some friends.  Oh, no, no.  Because I'm a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be very little strange.  Excuse me, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to move here.  I'm a little uncomfortable.  I can't stand up.  I can't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So does this qualify as the G-rated version of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is our last guess because as soon as we get on that big player,  we can't be.  We have to be.  No blue material.  You know who invested in Cialis?  You know, Cialis is one of the competitors for Viagra.  Oh, Bill Gates.  Bill Gates.  Bill Gates was a prime, I think, prime investor in that.  And then they sold it to the pharmaceutical company that sells it now.  But he started, funded the company that came up with it.  Let's talk about BitTorrent.  So BitTorrent now is a trackerless BitTorrent.  Trackerless BitTorrent.  You're going to keep using BitTorrent for a system, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it just makes the most sense right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, it's the easiest way to get Twit.  But the problem is it's not, I mean, it's easiest in the sense that you can get it  because there are a lot of seeds and it's very fast.  Not initially, but once it's got, you know,  once there's 10 or 20 seeds out there, it comes in pretty quick.  The problem is it's, you know, I think a lot of people don't know how to use BitTorrent.  It's, you know, it's not exactly easy to use.  We all use Azurias.  Does everybody use Azurias here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems awfully quick.  That's all I have to say.  Once it's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, once there's enough seeds, you're pulling it at your maximum speed, I think,  if there's enough seeds out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think about it, but using the new BitTorrent search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what they're doing.  It's called trackerless search.  And that's the problem with BitTorrent.  The reason it's possible for the Motion Picture Association of America to go after the,  you know, BitTorrent sites, the supernovas and the TV torrents and all that is because there's a tracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No slowdown in tracker sites.  If anything, they're more than ever.  And there really is some question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, these guys don't stay up because who can fight, you know, deep pockets?  You know, you can't afford to fight it.  But tracker sites aren't hosting any content.  I mean, there's nothing illegal on the tracker site.  It's just putting people together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't 2600 give into a long and extended legal battle about, you know, pointing links?  That's right.  But did they lose or win?  I think they won that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they won that case.  Did they not?  I think you're allowed to link to you.  They linked to DCSS, the decryption tool.  Well, even if they lost in court, and I don't know, we'll have to do some research,  but even if they lost in court, they certainly won morally because DCSS is, you know, is everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be interesting to see what happens because now that we're seeing trackers,  because when it was tracked, they were still kind of responsible because they were actually operating the tracking servers.  So there's somebody you can go after.  There's no central point of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, although you could still, if you could, I mean, if you look, if you're looking for Star Wars  and you start downloading Star Wars, you can see the IP address of the guy you're getting it from, right?  Right.  Everyone that's even in there, you can just use TorrentSpy and drag and drop it inside that app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll show everyone's IP address.  And I mean, that's identifying them.  But that's even been addressed now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, on a Slashdot this morning, there's a new BitTorrent replacement, quote unquote, called Rody,  which is written in Java and it actually includes full and nominatity.  So you can basically use a third party to block your IP address and there is no way to figure out who's doing what.  And it works really well with...  Well, what were they saying?  If A wants to get a file from B, I'm quoting this right off the page right now,  and they get C to agree to stand in on the exchange, B gets C's IP address, not A's.  So it's a third party.  If you could also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you...  You know, there are tools out there to anonymize you.  There's a...  I'm actually getting one to review and I'll let you know how it works.  There's a product called iFandom that is very slick, which gives you full anonymity.  This is a little box.  You would put it outside your router.  It's not doing that.  It filters all your traffic through their servers.  And their servers look for viruses, spyware.  They completely protect you.  But also because you're going through their servers, it's in effect a proxy.  It's not a proxy, but it works like an anonymizing proxy.  Nobody can see your IP address.  And this is iFandom?  It's called iFandom.  They're sending me one because I'm very...  It sounds really cool.  The guys who did it have a really good track record in this area.  And I think it might be a big business.  It's a very intriguing product.  It sounds like anonymizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you have to have the hardware box?  Why can't you just do all that in software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anonymizer is a proxy server.  You know, it's proxying.  So it hides you by filtering you through a lot of different servers.  A couple of disadvantages, of course, is slower because you go through a bunch of different servers.  But what this does in addition to that, it provides firewalling and antivirus and anti-spyware.  Because they're looking at all the traffic that's going through and they're stopping.  If you have an email with a virus attached, they remove the virus and then they pass along the email to you.  So it's much more... it's anonymizer plus.  Although really the anonymizing isn't the key to this whole thing.  It's a side effect.  But, and I ask them this specifically, do you work with BitTorrent?  Yep, pass it right through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like a hardware version of the zero knowledge stuff that they used to do.  It's kind of like that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, it's not a proxy.  It's doing something a little bit different.  Do they keep log files so they could be subpoenaed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, anonymizer, I know for a fact they don't keep any log files.  Right.  So you just toss them right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because otherwise, Interpol or a police agency could say, well, who was using this IP address at this time?  In fact, that happened, of course, with, remember, those anonymous proxies, email proxies.  The email remalers?  Yeah, and one of them, the big one.  Was it anonymous.5?  Yeah, the Interpol came to him and said, you know, give us the names.  And they did.  But yeah, so that's a good question.  I'll have to ask them.  Because their business is not anonymizing, does anonymizer work with BitTorrent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I know it encrypts and handles everything as far as HTTP requests.  Yeah, I bet it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I know you can have, I've had some difficulty.  I'd have to turn off anonymizer.  It's things like editing wikis and stuff because it messes things up.  In fact, the Google cache did the same thing.  Oh, that was a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that didn't work too well, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They pulled the plug on that very rapidly.  You know, you got to credit them.  They try stuff.  If it doesn't work, they say, well, move on.  You can't have a thousand hits.  I mean, 90% of what they do is great.  So you got to give them some credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have, Leo, I have a, and everyone else, I have a guest here I want you to talk to.  He's sitting right next to me, Mr. Dan Huard.  Yeah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Foo Foo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Dan.  Hey, how are you doing?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are you doing, Dan?  You're working on system full time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're so, yeah.  That's what the boss tells me.  You're getting a paycheck?  I think so.  It's checks in the mail, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so great to talk to you.  You know, on Mother's Day, I tried to, we were trying to get you,  we've been trying to get you on for a while.  And in fact, you have an email address, believe it or not, Dan.  It's Dan at ThisWeekInTech.com.  But on Mother's Day, I saw you come on IM, so I started typing it.  It was your mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, my mom, she came on.  That's right, she told me about that.  Very sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a lovely conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, what did you guys talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You, of course.  What else would we talk about?  I'm just kidding.  So how's things going?  Are you having fun?  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, it's the time of our lives.  When we lived up in San Francisco, for me specifically,  it was one of my best times growing up.  And we're, you know, there's a good chance that we're going up there again.  And we're just going to re-experience that and do something that we love at the same time.  Are you coming back up here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we think so.  Oh, dudes, that would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, then we can get together and do some video content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could do it live, and that means we could do video.  That's right.  I just dropped the bomb away.  I'm excited.  Yoshi, you'll be the last one down there.  You've got to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Time to come back up, Yoshi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I may have just had an offer that's not going to enable me to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, can we talk about that, or is that still up in the air?  It's still up in the air, but I mean, I can talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a special effects company that does 3D scans and stuff that has offered me a position.  I just have to sign the final paperwork, possibly tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So excited for you!  That's really exciting.  It sounds like the job for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for me, I mean, you know, growing up, playing with all these toys  and being a Star Wars junkie and all this kind of stuff, now it's like, okay, cool, I get to make them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you going to be doing?  You making models?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they do the 3D scans for all the movies, like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, all those they've done.  And sometimes for movies for visual effects, but also for the toys and the models and the mock-ats and that kind of thing.  And I will be running all of their technology, all their computers, all their scanners, all their rapid prototyping machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dude, we want Twit action figures.  I'm not kidding, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not here. That sounds awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think? Because, you know, I'm going to have to learn how to use all this stuff.  That's right.  I want an action figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ThinkGeek has said that they will sell merchandise.  I know we have this Jinx hackware also, Kevin, and I'm not stepping on Jinx,  but we've had a relationship with ThinkGeek for ages and ages too.  And they want to do some merchandising.  And Jinx just does t-shirts, right?  What's that?  Jinx hackware just does t-shirts, right?  Yeah, they just do t-shirts.  So we'll give Jinx the t-shirt concession, but I want action figures and we'll get ThinkGeek to sell those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yoshi, you can have a lightsaber on your action figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted the samurai sword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I want Kung Fu grip.  Okay, Fufu's Kung Fu grip.  Try to say that three times.  Fufu's Kung Fu grip.  We'll call it the Kung Fu Fufu grip.  I want the string that comes out of my back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nicknames!  Dan doesn't like Fufu.  You can't call him that anymore.  It's too late, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are Fufu.  You are the Foo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just accept that one.  You're the Foo-mister.  And there's so many worse nicknames you could have.  It's true.  Like the Dark Tipper or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Poor guy.  Never again will you be carded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's too bad because I was thinking for the action figure, Kevin, a big D on your chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm good, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll be the blind guy with no hair.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No way.  You have the badger-like pelt of luxurious hair.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Pat will have to have his sledgehammer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, this is exciting.  And a car.  You've got to have a car, Patrick.  You've got to have a Camaro or something.  No Camaros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about an old Boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this.  So what are we going to do with Robert?  Robert can have the, I know, Robert's like in a lab coat and his hair could be sticking straight up.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That and the string coming out of my back you can pull and I'll say something either.  I'm going to lose that thought real quick.  Yeah, lose that thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No more string out of his back.  But you can have a little cigarette dangling from your lips, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  To remind me of the habit I should stop.  But cannot.  Yes, you should.  The most well engineered legal drug in the country.  It is.  It's a perfect alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a perfect delivery mechanism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boys and girls, remember that Robert Herrod's addiction to cigarettes is not an endorsement on the half of twit for cigarette usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Send your unused cartons, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so hard to smoke in California now because you just can't, you have to not only go outside the building, you now have to walk like a hundred feet away.  So it's getting, nobody smokes around here as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You must be hanging out in really nice places unlike the rest of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say when you go to Canada, everybody smokes in Toronto.  It's the weirdest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you go to most states in America, everybody smokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was strangest for me, I think, in New York and Chicago.  Watching the, we had it, I think it affected us out here in California first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where the restaurants, you couldn't smoke in a restaurant or a bar when you couldn't smoke in a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The minute I saw that kick in New York and in particular Chicago, it was amazing.  You see the writing on the wall?  I never thought it would happen.  Vegas will be the holdout though.  That's right.  You can smoke anywhere in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can smoke or drink anywhere in that town.  So big announcement from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big Longhorn, are you ready?  The big Longhorn announcement, right?  They took out the file system.  They've taken out anything good that was, but they do have a new feature you're going to love in Longhorn.  No more my.  It's no more my music, my pictures, my folders, my network, none of that.  It's now a computer.  It's just going to be documents, music, pictures.  No more my.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazing telling point right there.  I'm up for you for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  In how many years is this going to push back development?  Well, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, they just picked up six months of development time.  2007, yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no my.  It's going to be worth it.  You want to upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it wasn't for gaming, I would just dump the Windows platform and move everything over to Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buy an Xbox, buy a PlayStation 3.  They're going to be better gaming.  PC gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PC gaming stays ahead of that curve better than you just can't.  You can't beat it.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love console gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your favorite game right now, Robert?  What are you playing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For my PC.  Actually, I've been getting back to some real time strategy stuff like roller coaster tycoon.  Come on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's hard core PC gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I also fired up a.  If it were for roller coaster tycoon, I'd be using Linux right now.  No, those are some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once you build up a sizable amusement park, that actually becomes a pretty challenging game.  You like Zootycoon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad you couldn't say that with a straight face, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what was the other one?  Empire Earth 2 was another one somebody just gave me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'll be honest.  I still am playing Rise of Nations and I like that stuff.  That's a great game too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I actually loaded up Far Cry again.  I'm going back through that.  You know, that's one of those games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a beautiful game, but it took like a few hours to finish.  Oh, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been trying to do it on realistic, which is the hardest setting.  It's it's darn hard.  That's all I have to say.  It's a challenge.  It's a challenge.  But that game, I still say that game has the best AI of all first person shooters within the last in all of history.  I haven't seen a first person shooter with a better AI system than Far Cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You play games, Hoard?  How Hoard?  Foo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That and my Counter-Strike addiction.  Oh, you still play Counter-Strike?  Counter-Strike Source is just fun.  They've been adding a lot of new maps to lately, which, which, you know, mix it up a little bit.  A lot of they've been revisiting a lot of classic maps from the original Counter-Strike and redoing them with the new engine to pretty them up.  I still it's a good team game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Co-op team games are my favorite, bar none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of an underground business, but there's a lot of them.  And they're big in San Francisco.  All the kids go in after high school after school's out and they all go to these Internet gaming parlors and they're all playing Counter-Strike against each other.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of them, at least three of them that were within a couple miles of my neighborhood have all shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe they're coming out to the suburbs now because there's a bunch.  I was driving behind a big old pickup truck that said you frag them on his latest plate.  Just follow him to the gaming center.  We didn't really get to talk about this last week.  So let's talk about this week.  Pentium D, the dual core Pentium going to the desktop.  Intel says it's going to sell a million of them by the end of the year.  It's the end of the line for single core processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, then there's almost a performance improvement if you use a couple of obscure benchmarks.  It's expensive yet difficult.  I don't know.  It's the benchmarks I've seen so far.  Robert, you probably have been following this closer than I have.  But I'm not seeing much that doesn't make me want to go for a much less expensive, you know, Athlon 64 compared to the Pentium D.  I was going to say Intel who?  Is Intel in trouble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For desktop CPUs, it's losing favor with the hardcore group.  Definitely.  With AMD's X2 coming up, that is the most powerful processor you can buy for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a dual core 64?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, dual core.  That's coming up.  Let's see.  Actually, I think you can purchase them right now.  Let me see over at Monarch.  Actually, I thought I had a couple of them.  Take a quick peek.  But anyway, all our performance numbers for every video encoding, audio encoding, gaming, everything.  Everything just puts that chip at the forefront.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that you don't have to have a 64-bit OS.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's no reason to have a 64-bit OS right now for 99.9% of everyone out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's lots of reasons not to like nothing works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there's just no benefit yet is the big thing.  No significant benefit.  I don't know if there's a real benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a bunch of guys out there who do like really huge statistical database packages who are like, yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  I need four terabytes of memory.  And there are people who actually do.  I think that's one of the ways Intel went wrong though, right?  Is just saying, well, we're going to put all our efforts into 64-bit code.  And AMD said, no, x86 has lots of legs.  And they stuck with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Intel still owns what percentage of the market?  That's because of companies like Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Dell is looking at AMD now, though.  That would be, would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Intel still has their integrated graphics, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would that be the bellwether if Dell suddenly says, yeah, we're going to do AMD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think people still, you know, the vast buying majority and certainly IT community, like the IT community in general, are all about Intel.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought of Pentium M. I mean, this type, this pad is a Pentium M. I mean, that's the best laptop chip still, yes?  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Pentium M, I mean, unless AMD's, you know, I love the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know about the Tourion yet.  We haven't seen benchmarks yet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I love the Averitech notebook I have, except for the fact that it doesn't have a Pentium M in it.  And the new ones, they actually switched them from the AMD Athlon XPs over to Celeron M's or Celeron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Averitech, a second tier company, but they're making good products for very low prices.  Well...  Some complaints about quality control.  Maybe they don't last as long as the other guys. Is that...  Well, I've already had to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had to...  This is the first notebook I've ever had to ship back inside the first six or seven months for repairs.  The power supply plug came loose inside the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've heard numerous complaints about that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The case itself, the plastic molding was bent a little bit, so it scrapes against the screen, and there's nothing I can do about that.  The keyboard's warped from the heat of the unit, so it's got a really interesting shape to it.  But it was also...  It was $800, $850 after rebate with a half a gig of RAM, a decent processor, 12-inch screen.  This is the ultra-portable version, onboard 802.11G.  And I mean, when it came back...  Except for the melting keyboard thing.  Yeah.  Well, it's funny.  It's most...  I mean, most of the keyboard manufacturers for notebooks...  I mean, because it was funny.  I've told you guys I've been gutting my house and throwing away all the old stuff.  That box of crap is going to have some amazing stuff in it if we ever decide to give it away.  But I had this notebook I've been saving for forever, which is one of the original Dell Latitudes.  And it's got a trackball in it.  And the keyboard is amazing.  But the notebook's like three inches thick.  But the action on that keyboard is still...  The closest thing to that is the keyboard to use in the IBM ThinkPad.  ThinkPads, even those are...  You know, just because they have to go so thin on the Z on these.  If they don't spend money on the keyboards, they just fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another reason I'm buying my IBMs.  I love IBM's notebook keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm nervous about the Lenovo takeover on IBM, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's the Chinese government.  Speaking of governments, look what the...  Did you see what the MPAA announced today?  The Motion Picture Association of America said they're putting up 10 surveillance cameras on the streets of LA to catch DVD pirates.  Can a private group put up surveillance cameras on the street?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are more surveillance cameras in the United States, like per square mile, than any other country in the world.  I mean, you're walking down an urban street...  Yeah, but they're usually put up by the city.  No, they're not.  They're put up by building owners.  They're put up by corporations.  But this is on the streets of LA.  What do you think happens?  Go walk around downtown San Francisco.  There's buildings that watch the exits in every corner.  What's going to be interesting is like, yeah, if they are working with the city,  they have to work with the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are. The city police are monitoring the cameras.  Oh, that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My last trip to Europe when I was in Italy, every building on every corner had at least two cameras.  They were everywhere.  So if it makes it easier for law enforcement...  Yeah, there is the whole Big Brother issue, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could monitor with your new little device that you showed on system.  You could monitor those cameras.  You could steal the signal.  Now, let me ask you this.  So that's what you built on the first episode of system, a device to monitor video cameras.  Could you reverse that, and this is very eye spy, and make it send a signal to the camera,  or intercept a signal and send a different signal...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, you'd actually have to broadcast...  At that frequency.  At that frequency and the same signal to act over...  I know what you're saying.  You're saying so that whoever's watching the security monitor, you could replace their signal?  Yeah.  You could put the Flintstones up or something.  In theory.  Wouldn't that be cool?  You talked about it on your video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all you have to do is basically boost it.  You get a camera that's transmitting the signal and put a booster on it  and just overpower the heck out of it, and anything that they have  isn't going to be able to keep up with the power of that signal you're sending out.  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a very candid camera.  That's kind of 21st century punked.  You watch the guard go crazy because all of a sudden, you know, something else is on there.  What is that FCC rule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says all electronic devices have to accept some form of interference or any form of interference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they're on unregulated...  I mean, that's what you're talking about from the shadows box three  is that this is unregulated frequency, right?  So that you can do anything you want.  Well, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, according to FCC though, you can't increase your...  It's like when we were trying to modify some antennas on air back at G4  and they wouldn't let us.  You can't increase the broadcast power beyond a certain amount.  It's actually illegal to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a maximum.  And it's illegal.  It's also illegal to use any non-certified antenna,  which is why they all had different pigtail connectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think our biggest issue though for that TV broadcasting was the fact that...  Or it was a radio or television, but we were interrupting signals,  potentially interrupting signals that were being used for commercial purposes.  So it wasn't an unlicensed chunk of bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long before someone hacks the MPAA cameras  and maybe puts Star Wars episode three on the camera?  You know what?  That would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's just going to walk up and just smash the front of them in with a hammer,  put their blanket down and start selling their pirated videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from the group that said that the VCR was to the American public  as the Boston Stranglers to the woman home alone.  And who's the real threat here?  The Motion Picture Association of America, folks.  Not the VCR.  Geez.  Well, I wonder what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, is it even possible to know how much money they actually lose worldwide to piracy?  I mean, I understand them wanting to protect it,  but it's kind of like funny because they're always doing really nickel and dime things  because maybe the only place they can do them is inside the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much money are they spending trying to enforce all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all the lawyers are already on retainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish they would just simply put that effort into creating more formats for us  at better quality and cheaper prices, and I think the problem would solve itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guys, I think we are running out of time.  Any final thoughts from anybody? Any plugs anybody wants to get in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you guys talk about Star Wars? Did you guys all see it last week?  I missed it. I was out.  You were a little busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw it. I was a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see it again.  It was a lot better than the last two.  Oh, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just would have liked to have seen the emergence of the dark Darth,  the masked Darth Vader a lot sooner in the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we all want to see him.  Forget Princess Amidala. Who cares about her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the love scenes with the princess.  Biggest disappointments.  Well, they just snuffed her character.  It was kind of like what they did to Jar Jar in episode two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was like the leader of her people to this twisted housewife, and it just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like a Henry James novel without the good writing or the plot and character development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it just me or is it kind of freaky out that Luke and Leia are twins?  I mean, is that kind of freaky?  Why?  I don't know, it just creeps me out. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because one has brown hair and one has yellow hair and they don't look alike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they were this love interest in the beginning and it's like, eww. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's where Han steps in and goes, oh, sister, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, yeah, man. You got a cute sister, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just gotta treat a Jedi sister and she'll mess you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And your mama's pretty cute too.  Even if she's a Yale graduate.  La la la la la la la la la la.  When will I become a Jedi?  Well, yeah, right? I mean...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that would happen.  Are there female Jedi masters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In series when it comes out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess there were female Jedi's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who?  Were there?  I thought there were in episode two.  Yeah, there were some. In episode three, yeah.  In that other word, Jedi's in drag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they all wear skirts. It's kind of hard to tell.  I've never done a star wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, that was playing in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks, Leo, for inviting me up. I just want to tell you for inviting me up to Canada, that was a lot of fun.  Call for Help was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, watch Call for Help because he'll be on it soon, I think.  I can't remember when those shows aired, but yeah.  Showing us how he does system and the little war spying device that you made.  That'll be fun.  And are you going to come back at some point?  What's that, Leo?  You're going to come back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely, if you'll have me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anytime. In fact, standing offer to all of you.  Anytime you're in the mood to Toronto. I can't pay your way.  I'll buy you dinner. That's all I can do.  But anytime you want to come to Toronto, you're welcome.  Hey, I apologize to all our listeners for being a little late on the Twitcast,  but Memorial Day and I was down on Bourbon Street and I didn't wake up until Tuesday.  Who's drinking?  You know, in all honesty, Bourbon Street is a little over the top.  I mean, there are people just stumbling drunk all over the place.  It's like a frat party.  Where's Bourbon Street?  In New Orleans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like that year round last time I checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A frat party. I was kind of appalled. I mean, I'm not prude, but boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that the city that's going to disappear into the ocean in 20 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it?  Well, they've been saying that since the Civil War.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, the whole, they keep building bigger and bigger dikes around the perimeter of the city to keep the water out.  But at some point it's just going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in the bayou. I had a great time.  And I met a lot of people who listen to the Twitcast, so things are going well with that, I think.  Not quite six terabytes yet, but it's a smaller file.  Six terabytes. I love that band.  Congratulations on your success, Kevin, with System. Congratulations on your new job, Yoshi.  Congratulations on your new apartment or house. What is it, Patrick?  I'm going to be renting another house.  That's exciting.  Yes.  We'll get you into the home buyer market pretty soon here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know what? As soon as I win that lottery ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert Heron, congratulations on the new action figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pull my string.
