It's time for twit this week in tech, the show we cover the week's tech news with the best tech  journalists we can find at short notice during an NFL playoff season. I'm just kidding. I'm just  teasing you. Wesley Falkner is here from IBM. He's from developer relations at IBM. Hey, Wesley.

Transcript:  Good to see you. We'll be seeing you, I think, in Austin in a couple of months at South By.  That'll be a lot of fun. Wesley is in Austin. He's developer relations at IBM, many years at  AMD before that and that may be relevant because also with us, I think for his first time on twit,  Sebastian Peake, the editor in chief at PC Perspective and our new host on this week in  computer hardware with Patrick Norton. Hey, Sebastian.

Transcript:  Homegrown. You came, we brought him up from the farm league. Yeah, yeah.  Right.  He used to be a shortstop for the Mississippi Blues. No, it's great to have you. Thank you  for joining us, Sebastian. Thank you for having me.  Thank you for being willing to take on Twitch. We went through two hosts in a very brief period  of time because Ryan Shroud, who started the show with me way back when, got a job at Intel,  so we put Alan Malvintano in his place and then Alan got a job like three weeks later in Intel.  So I think Ryan scooped up Alan.

Start time: 190.36
End time: 194.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  That's the site. That's the site. Yeah, you know, anytime you don't have other journalists to hop  on because of football, I'm happy to be here for you.  You couldn't care less.  I could not care less, but you know what? I appreciate it that some people do and I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care about anything.

Start time: 225.66
End time: 266.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing. I don't care about anything on TV, he says. No, we love having all three of you on.  It's great to have you. I don't know what's going on in football either and I'm happy about that.  Most of the people who listen to the show already know what happened. So there you go.  Oh, we were talking. Actually, I want to... There was a little inside baseball going on  between Sebastian and Wesley about the rumors that AMD, where Wesley used to work, but you  don't have any... Do you have any inside information there? No. There was a rumor that they were going  to do a 5 GHz Ryzen and Sebastian, you said maybe, huh?

Start time: 267.90
End time: 278.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. There were rumors that were reported by numerous outlets. I think the  original report came out of the adored TV YouTube video, but...

Start time: 279.10
End time: 281.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, I don't trust YouTube videos for nothing.

Start time: 283.56
End time: 337.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Essentially, he claimed that when Ryzen 3000 was going to be announced, and that was widely  rumored to be the big announcement AMD was going to have at CES, that it was going to be more cores,  all the way up to a 16-core desktop. They were talking about parts with 5 GHz boosts, clock speeds.  And then when Lisa actually came out and sort of pre-announced the next version of Ryzen,  she did not give specifics. She said, we do not have final clocks. And even on the on-stage  benchmarking with Cinebench that they did at their presentation, they were not revealing what clocks  their prototype was actually running at. So that's all under wraps. I would not be surprised at all  if they do have a part that can hit close to those numbers or those numbers on single-core  boosts. But I would be very surprised if they had something that came out at 8 cores, 16 threads.

Start time: 338.00
End time: 343.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be pretty... You could use that to heat a house. That would be so hot.

Start time: 344.70
End time: 356.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. They're not as warm as maybe the previous generation AMD stuff we're used to. But yeah,  if you're pushing 5 GHz regardless on that many cores, you're going to be generating some heat.

Start time: 357.28
End time: 378.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the past, I've rooted for AMD. For years, I rooted for AMD because they were keeping Intel  honest. Intel really didn't have any competition for a long time. Then all of a sudden, AMD,  this was maybe as much as 15, 20 years ago, came along and really stuck it to them. So I was really  rooting for them. At this point, I'm starting to feel bad for Intel. I don't know if I...  Don't feel bad for them.

Start time: 378.70
End time: 382.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't feel bad for Intel?  They seem to be doing pretty well.

Start time: 382.46
End time: 429.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. It feels like they've fumbled the future a little bit.  But they have enough in their bank. They have enough money.  It's like IBM. They got patents, they got money. It's not like...  No, nobody's going broke. But at the same time, Brian Krzanich manages to  not ever create a mobile part. They never get down to 10 nanometers. They...  Five gigahertz? What are you, crazy?  And I started to feel sorry for them, to be honest with you. And I think it's important that we have  numerous people competing hard against one another. So you think that x86 has legs. It's not going to  be an arm world going forward.

Start time: 429.82
End time: 482.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Intel's greatest strength is, or was its greatest strength, is turning into their  greatest weakness. They used to say, you're not a real chip company unless you have fabs.  And they're having problems tooling up their own fabs. The good thing with AMD, which  is good and bad, they spun off their fabs into global foundries. And that also  allowed them to flex to other manufacturers. IBM was one of them. And then,  I can't think of the other one that they went with, in order to be able to go where they were  able to get the dice rings, what they needed. But now, since Intel does their own fab, they have to  spend that money, their own research, and they don't have access to the same amount of patents  as an IBM does. And so that's probably what's slowing them down, is just being able to figure  out how to get it smaller, not in the design, but actually in the manufacturing.

Start time: 483.14
End time: 499.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also a leadership crisis. Krizantich left under a cloud. The story was because he'd  had an affair with an associate, but honestly, it really had to be because  the company was not going in the right direction.

Start time: 500.14
End time: 501.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Allegedly. And I heard it was consensual.

Start time: 502.82
End time: 541.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You could easily overlook what happened. It wasn't like he used his position of power.  But it was a convenient pretext for getting rid of Krizantich.  I will give somebody five points. I know you guys know, so don't say anything.  If you could tell me who's the CEO right now of Intel? Anybody? They're looking at each other.  It's their CFO, Bob Swan, but he's temporary, right? And now we're waiting.  He doesn't want it.  He doesn't want it. So who's going to take over at Intel? And does it matter?  By the way, Lisa Sue, you were talking about the CEO at AMD, is considered one of the candidates.

Start time: 542.70
End time: 562.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. The rumor is that they really want her. It would be  quite a coup if they were to take her away, but I feel like she's,  she has risen very, very fast to seemingly the top of,  she is one of the most celebrated CEOs certainly in Silicon Valley now.  Interesting.  If not the nation.

Start time: 563.78
End time: 601.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting? And then there are a lot of candidates from  other companies. Apple's senior vice president for hardware, Johnny, is it Shruji or Shruji?  I'm not familiar with his work, but he was at Intel for a long time, 15 years.  He's also one of Apple's, apparently, according to the street, one of Apple's highest paid  executives. And if you're thinking Apple and I pay, that's pretty good money.  Uh, somebody from within maybe Intel's own ranks or perhaps former COO of Google cloud, Diane Bryant.

Start time: 605.21
End time: 613.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny.  I just feel like it was hard for him to ever come back there, uh, Krasanich after that,  uh, ill timed, we shall say stock sale.

Start time: 613.54
End time: 615.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was another problem, right?

Start time: 615.53
End time: 618.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The optics were not good.

Start time: 618.36
End time: 631.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, uh, you say I don't need to root for them, but I am rooting for Intel because we want,  and I'm rooting for AMD. We want strong competitive companies and we know ARM is,  is doing all right. Uh, the various ARM fabs.

Start time: 631.22
End time: 633.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Keep in mind, AMD has an ARM license too.

Start time: 634.68
End time: 644.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting. Interesting. All right. I thought I'd just bring that up because we got the hardware  guys in house, but Michael, we got, we'll get something for you too. Don't worry.

Start time: 645.10
End time: 648.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it's all right. I'm here. I'm listening. I'm learning.

Start time: 649.08
End time: 683.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I mean, one of the big shoes is we're going to find out in the next couple of years,  it's going to drop is whether Apple stops buying Intel chips and starts making its own.  Intel got a windfall because Apple, we found this out by the way, finally in testimony during the  Qualcomm lawsuit that Apple couldn't buy Qualcomm chips for its next generation iPhones. They were  forced to go to Intel and say, uh, can you double your production? Uh, because we need your chips.  We can't buy Qualcomm chips for, was it the 10 or was it the 10 S for the new generation iPhones?  The new ones.  It's a 10 S.

Start time: 684.40
End time: 711.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's testimony by Qualcomm on Friday. I don't know if you saw this,  I didn't see it.  Where they, they directly disputed saying we never stopped selling. Um, and they pointed to their  dispute with Samsung and said that when we were two years in dispute for, for licensing and we  still sold to them. Um, so it's conflicting testimony to say whether or not did they actually say they  won't sell it or, or, or did they continue to try to sell it? And then Apple said, well, we won't  buy it unless these are our terms.

Start time: 711.68
End time: 793.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a Apple COO on the witness stand sworn to sworn in. So that would be perjury. Jeff Williams,  who said, no, they wouldn't, wouldn't sell it to us. Um, Bloomberg has acquired some leaked emails,  uh, in this regard. Uh, I'm not sure what to, what to make of it. Let me go to the  reveal new reason Apple and Qualcomm parted ways. This came out a couple of days ago. Um,  this is part of the FTC. It's not actually Apple's, uh, fight with Qualcomm. This is the, uh, FTC  trial against Qualcomm for not licensing their, uh, their technology at a fair and reasonable price.  Um, uh, in my wildest imagination, wrote Jeff Williams of some evil intention of Apple. I have  trouble coming up with a real scenario where anything of significant value could be leaked  based on this code. Uh, I just hope the licensing dispute doesn't cloud good judgment in the team  on a massive business opportunity. This is $2 billion of chips from a Qualcomm. I was hoping  to keep some decent quantity of business flowing with hopes the licensing stuff will get solved.  Apparently Qualcomm was concerned that Apple would leak technology information.

Start time: 794.64
End time: 808.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they've actually accused Apple of doing that and giving information to Intel to allow them  to build their, uh, the modems for the phone and avoid the $7 and 50 cent per device license fee

Start time: 808.20
End time: 831.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that Qualcomm is charging. It does say in the emails that, uh, uh, Qualcomm offered to provide  the software access Apple needed in return for a commitment from Apple to use Qualcomm chips in at  least 50% of iPhones over two years. So maybe, maybe Jeff's story did need a little bit of, uh,  additional information. Maybe it wasn't completely the Qualcomm's fault.

Start time: 832.22
End time: 834.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it mean there's a, it seems $7 and 50 seems very petty.

Start time: 835.60
End time: 852.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like just pay it Apple. So that's what they're asking. Qualcomm says we want $7 and 50 cents per  iPhone. But, and I'm not clear, but there's maybe Micah knows because I know Renee has said that's  not merely the 750, but it's that Qualcomm is demanding a percentage of revenue rather than a

Start time: 853.12
End time: 863.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  flat fee for licensing this stuff. Well, that's capped at $400 of device. So it's $400 per device  is the cap of the revenue of the phone. Still, you can understand why Apple might say,

Start time: 864.50
End time: 868.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well dudes, you know, you're just one part of the pie here. Yeah. You want a percentage of our

Start time: 869.28
End time: 884.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  total revenue? No, we want to, you know, we'll license it, but you know, somebody asked for 5%  of my revenue to play music or something. I would be, I'd say, no, no, I'll give you a flat fee,  but I'm not going to tie it to how much I make. It's kind of core to the technology of what you're

Start time: 884.60
End time: 896.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  trying to do. What if they're charging 5% fee of you being able to stream on the internet? Right.  You'd be like, okay, that sounds reasonable. Right. It's a fascinating back and forth,

Start time: 896.88
End time: 900.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  although it just feels like it was going on for decades. That's what I was going to say. I can

Start time: 900.82
End time: 912.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  remember reporting on this years and years ago and it's just ongoing and there's like,  is anyone actually getting any money out of it? What I understand sort of wanting to step away

Start time: 912.32
End time: 971.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  from Qualcomm. Yeah. Lawyers win. Apple finally gave up, you know, I think the Apple Samsung  battle was really started by Steve Jobs and I think Apple finally said, all right, that's enough.  Enough. That's enough. That's just chill. And I suppose at some point adults will prevail in  this Qualcomm battle. Maybe not. I don't know. Apple has lost a few, but the FTC inquiry has  really helped them, I think. Meanwhile, Tim Cook writes an editorial in Time Magazine,  doubling down on Apple's best marketing, I think, best marketing pitch, privacy. He says,  you deserve privacy online and here's how you could actually get it. The problem is solvable.  It's not too big, too challenging or too late. He calls on Congress to do a few things. And I  really like his three proposals here. First, the right to have personal data minimized.

Start time: 973.24
End time: 1029.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And some of this is in GDPR. The company- Yeah, and some of this is stuff that he,  that not he, but Apple and others have actually put forth. And his sort of pitch in this article  is about this really good sort of clearinghouse where the data brokers that collect our information,  buy our information from other companies and then sell it to other companies, those sort of middle  men. It's about being able to get access to them and know what they have on us and be able to change,  delete or adjust that information as we see fit. So I kind of like how he sort of piggybacked off  of the idea of the thing that's already sort of in the works that these different companies are  working on to say, and also what really we need to be doing is talking about these companies that  are buying data of ours and we don't really know that. And then people are going to them and buying  and then people are going to them and buying those packages of data to be able to understand

Start time: 1030.66
End time: 1090.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what their consumers want. Well, and after all, wasn't that what AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile were  accused of doing is selling location data to third, to brokers who then would sell it on  to other people. I mean, that's even worse. That's like, well, anybody who wants location data.  So he says he wants Congress to pass, I'm curious what all three of you think of this, but  here's his proposal. This is Tim Cook again, Congress to pass comprehensive federal privacy  legislation for principles, as I mentioned, the right to have personal data minimized.  Second, the right to knowledge to know what data is being collected and why.  This all seems completely reasonable, by the way. Third, the right to access. It should be easy for  you to access, correct and delete. That's an important word, your personal data. And finally,  the right to data security. Keep my data safe. And all you have to do, you'll look no farther  than Equifax to realize how important that is. If you've got my data, you better darn well keep it

Start time: 1090.16
End time: 1159.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  safe. I think some of this is not really helpful unless it makes it easy. A lot of the disclosure  happens and a lot of legalese and things you click off when you sign something. But if there's not an  easy way of getting to it, like Facebook says that you can control ads, you can turn off  preferences, but you have to dig through I don't know how many settings to find it. So  all of this sounds well and good, but if there's no standard in terms of this is how you present  it and this is how you find it and everybody does it, then it's almost impossible to manage.  It would be nice if it was like a credit report where you say, tell me who all has my information.  You get a big report and then you can go to them saying that's wrong, that's right, that's wrong,  that's right. There needs to be some aggregator where you can go to one place and get it from all  these different sites. But if you have to say, what did I sign up for? Who has that information?  And then you have to do the investigative work yourself to figure out who has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One-sy-two-sy, you know, with every single thing, every app on your phone.

Start time: 1168.25
End time: 1242.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why we believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data broker  clearinghouse requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the  transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place and giving users the  power to delete their data on demand freely, easily and online once and for all. So I do see  that as sort of the credit report, the ability to go and say, okay, I know that when I was on  Instagram and I clicked on these, I liked these things, then Instagram had that information and  maybe that information then got sold to this third party that then sold that information to  someone else. And it goes all over the place. To be able to pull that in and collect, I think is  great. One of the things that I see in the chat room and when I talked about this before, the  concern that, okay, if all of my data is in one place and it's a site that's built by the government,  let's talk about privacy and security there. Because if you've got one place where someone  can attack and get into, they've suddenly got all of my information from all of these different  apps and services that I use. That's a little concerning. So that part kind of worries me.  I don't know who should be in charge of holding on to all of that data for me and actually keeping

Start time: 1242.78
End time: 1296.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it safe. Well, and then there's a fight between federal and states. I think it needs to be a,  and I think Tim Cook's calling for a federal law, but California has a very aggressive  privacy law. Marco Rubio of Florida has proposed a bill poorly named the America Data Dissemination  Act, which I could say what that sounds like, but it establishes a process for creating rules  instead of issuing specific rules right away and allows 27 months for Congress or the FTC to write  the rules and it would supersede any state law. Now, I don't think that's a bad thing. I think  a patchwork of laws is probably hard for any one company to adhere to. So a federal law,  if it's the right law, would be probably the right way to do this.

Start time: 1297.96
End time: 1313.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is this like, oh boy, no, I was just going to say, is this him saying, oh dear, I see that  we're about to start working on making these rules and we need more time so we should have  27 months at least? I'm confused what this law is supposed to fix.

Start time: 1314.84
End time: 1347.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the public knowledge said the bill is based on the Privacy Act of 1974,  which applied to federal agencies, but Rubio proposes the same rules apply to the private  sector, but it's really more a transparency and data accuracy law than a privacy law.  And so there is some concern that this is a sneaky attempt to override state privacy law  and then do nothing at the federal level. Oh my Lord.

Start time: 1348.90
End time: 1390.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really like Wes's idea of a report where everything has to be registered and all accesses  are something that users can themselves access and see exactly where their information is going.  But I think another thing that we have to have, if there were to be some sort of sweeping legislation  that at a federal level laid down some rules, one of them is how the data is actually handled  because as we've seen with, I think this week, yet another data breach or at least one that was  exposed. Oh yeah, let's talk about that one. How was your data stored? Well, unfortunately,  far too many times in my life, turns out my data was stored in plain text. So it doesn't help me

Start time: 1390.34
End time: 1549.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  very much. So Troy Hunt on Wednesday published a post on Have I Been Pwned, his great site,  about collection number one, which contains 773 million in the clear,  unique email addresses, 21 million unique passwords. It was a big deal. But I love Brian  Krebs because his first thing he does is he actually hunts down the guy who posted this.  He apparently has a telegram account, his username is Sanixer, and he contacted him to find out more  about collection one, which by the way is available for the low, low price of $45.  $45, which Brian points out is just 0.00002 cents per password. And Sanixer says,  oh, you don't want collection one, that's two or three years old. I've got much, much more recent  stuff. And I hope that all of this stuff will eventually make it into Have I Been Pwned.  And if you go to haveibeenpwned.com, which everybody probably should do at this point,  not do the front page, which is enter your email address. Forget it. You know your email address  compromised. That's not the problem. Click the tab at the top that says passwords and enter in  some passwords. That's an eye opener. These are passwords that are in the clear in collection  number one. Go ahead. Let's see. This is Carsten. Oh, Carsten, that password has been seen 60,000  times before. Would you enter monkey123? Or is that your password? So I entered the password that I  use on low security sites all the time. Totally pumped. So that's the one everybody should be  going to. And it does not include Sanixer's complete collection, just collection one,  which is big enough. So honestly, those passwords are no good anymore. The bottom line, and Krebs  points this out, is turn on two factor every single place you can. Never, ever reuse passwords.  My password has not been pwned. Oh, good news. Yeah, the first, what I would do is go there and  enter your email password. Because that's the keys to the kingdom. Because if somebody can get into  your email account, first of all, turn on two factor if you're not. And if you're using an email  provider that doesn't offer two factor, get the hell out.

So I called  them and they said, Oh, you changed your path. I couldn't log in. So I called them. They said,  you changed your password yesterday. And we just got all the paperwork to sell all your stocks and  send a check. And she said, No, that wasn't me. And this is how horrible was she said the fraud  division of this online broker got involved. And they said, Yeah, we listened to the call. It was  a man pretending to be a woman. Hi, this is Mara. What in the world? And they had her address. They  had her phone number. And in order to verify the identity, as many do, the stock brokerage used her  credit report to say, Well, did you ever get a loan for this? Did you ever, you know, where did  you live of these three addresses? You know how they do that. Yeah. And the hacker knew it all.  Because obviously, Samara said, How did they get that? I said, Well, probably from Equifax.  But who knows, right? And they and at this point, they probably have your social, maybe they got it  from Marriott. They and they had enough information about her to poses her to say,  sell all my stocks and send me a check. Oh, and awful. Yes, lucky she caught it.  Lucky she caught it. So but the fact that they they fraud departments that yeah, it was a guy  pretending to be a woman. And that the customer service rep said, Yeah, yeah, fine. Okay, here's  tell us where to send your money. So that's why these breaches are important. And that's why you  got to turn on two factor, you should check your email password, especially because if they get  your email, they can you go to every other site, say, I forgot my password, send me a reset.

When you go buy fruit,  and it's organic, it's certified by some third party. I think the internet needs to come up with  a list of things you should have like with the kind of SSL secure certificate, the type of two  factor authentication that your site supports, they you know, whether it's, you know, SMS or  through an authentication app or something like that, come up with some sort of seal.

You know, if it's government, I don't know, I think it has to be at some point,  there is a democratic bill Ron Wyden has put forward, which proposes significant jail time  for somebody who allows your data to be leaked.

Because that's when it  comes to the protection, that's the one thing that I think will either a whole heck of a lot of money  that you got to pay, or jail time for folks who are, you know, legitimately negligent in whatever  aspect to result in this. Because I saw like they're working on potentially charging Facebook a whole  heck of a lot of money, or thinking about it. I can't remember what that post had said. But yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that you reveal breaches within 72 hours. That's a big, so I was doing a little research. I wonder  what Equifax, what were the big fines and penalties Equifax had to pay for that breach,  which probably cost Mara. They reached an agreement with the New York State Department  of Financial Services and seven other state banking regulators. The order does not impose  any fines or monetary penalties. They just, they agreed to implement stronger data security measures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  experience in data security? The really, yeah, I mean, as far as I can tell Equifax made money  on this by selling monitoring services to the poor people who had been hacked. That's really  what happened. They made money. I don't think there's any severe penalty that I can find anywhere.  The DOJ and SEC have charged former Equifax executives for insider trading. Remember,  there was a big stock sale right before the breach was revealed. So maybe somebody's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  why even try to do that? That was just so stupid. They are, they continue to be under investigation  by the FTC and they face a lot of civil lawsuits. I think maybe that in the long run,  that's what's going to happen maybe is that some civil lawsuits will cost them. But right now,  Equifax is sitting pretty and I don't see anything going on with Marriott. I don't see anything  going on with Target. I don't see anything going on.

Basically they want to know if anyone could  blackmail you, what can they blackmail you with? Right. And you have to like list all of that. And  then they got breached.

And they're not, because that data,  like the Yahoo data has never emerged in public, you know, on the dark web or on for sale anywhere.  And it really was probably just China trying to figure out who they can suborn where, you know,  now they have my Marriott data and they have that. Oh yeah. China's got the whole thing.

He lost everything but his  plane ticket. He can't even afford cab fare to the airport. He's walking. And apparently that's,  you see a lot of that. Little tip kids. Maybe it's better.

Transcript:  I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Our show today. Oh, I'm happy to tell you about my aura ring.  Some of you have noticed I wear this, this ring and I've been wearing this for some time.  Kevin Rose was the first to tell me about it way back when we, when he was on triangulation.  He's an advisor to this company. It's a Finnish company. And he said, I'll hook you up with  Harpreet and he'll get you one. He did. I've been wearing it ever since this beats, you know,  I have an Apple watch. I have a Fitbit. This beats any other tracker, fitness or health or sleep  tracker on the market. It is awesome. Aura is O-U-R-A, auraring.com. Let me show you what it does.  It is of course an activity tracker. You know, it shows you how much exercise you've got, you know,  and how many calories you've used. It ties in if you use an iPhone with Apple health, which is great.  So you can get more information from Apple health. So it shows you I rode for 30 minutes  yesterday, how many calories it got that from Apple health, how much walking I did, how many  calories I burned. Here's my sleep score. This is fascinating. So the ring inside it has an  accelerometer. That's how it measures footsteps and movement. But it also has an infrared optical  pulse measure that's more accurate than on your wrist because it's on your finger, 3D accelerometer,  gyroscope and a temperature sensor. It is really great. This is my sleep score from last night,  66. Not good. I can tap on it and I can learn more about how much awake time, how much REM time,  how much was light sleep, how much was deep sleep, how fast I went to sleep. It only took me 26  minutes. That's actually a long time to fall asleep, but I only had 6% deep sleep, 22 minutes,  an hour, three quarters of dreaming. It says pay attention because your restfulness was bad.  And so it gives you advice about optimizing your sleep environment, your temperature, avoid spicy  meals, get regular activity. It will give you information that's really useful. Here's my  resting heart rate. This is the other thing I really like is the temperature information  is fascinating. Did you know that right before you get sick, your temperature is going to go up?  Slightly. And here's a 30-day measurement of my temperature. So you can see if it's going up,  maybe you're about to get sick or maybe you drank too much last night. The other thing that's  fascinating is something called heart rate variability. It turns out that higher is better  when it comes to heart rate variability. That's the amount of time in between beats. It should be  less consistent, not more consistent. And it can range from below 20 to over 100. 100 is great.  And so you'll see, in fact, if I look at my monthly, look at this, my heart rate variability  plummeted in November and December. It's coming back up. That will show you readiness, the ability  to work out your fitness level. Maybe you're over-training, maybe you're under stress.  They have lots of information in the app that tells you what it means. There has never been  a better device, as far as I'm concerned, for giving you information. Now that's all the good  news. There is bad news. They're sold out through April. I hate to do this to you, but this has  proven so popular that they can't keep them in stock. By the way, the other thing I recommend,  read the privacy policy. It is a finished company. Your data is highly protected,  anonymized. It is completely secure. So this is one smart fitness tracker that you can use  without worrying. The daily feedback really is great to helping you understand your body,  improve your health, to reach your goals. It's very light. It's made of titanium  with a diamond-hard carbon coating. So it is light, it is strong, it is non-allergenic.  You don't have to worry about it. It fits on. They have a Sizer's. In fact, you can get the Sizer kit.  In fact, I might do that now so you get ready. It comes in eight different sizes and a variety of  looks. I could show you a couple here. The one I'm wearing is $299. They also have a shiny silver.  It's very pretty. Actually, I'm wearing the Stealth, which is $399. You can get heritage or  balance depending on the different shapes. Now, I'll give you a few more stats. The battery lasts  up to a week. You don't have to charge it every day. What I do is I put it when I'm taking a shower.  I knew, by the way, it's completely waterproof. I wear it in the shower, the bath, the hot tub,  everywhere. It's got a great app for iOS or Android. They're updating it all the time with  more information. It will sync to your mobile device using Bluetooth LE, so it's very easy,  very fast, transparent, simple thing to do. You don't have to pair it or anything like that.  Track your sleep. Make the most of your day. Get great insights into how you're feeling,  what your health situation is. I'm proud of myself. My resting heart rate's down to 56,  which is a very good sign. OURAring, O-U-R-A-R-A-N-G.com. If you order it now, you'll be  getting it in April. If you use the offer, go tweet at checkout. You'll get $50 off.  Order now and you'll get it in April. Do that because if you wait to April, it'll be,  order it now and get it in June or something. Although, Harpreet tells me they're ramping up.  They're getting ready. They know they're going to get a lot of sales here. I think they should. This  is the best fitness device I've used, OURAring.com. If you look back, you'll notice I've been wearing  this for at least six months. I love this thing. We thank them for their support of this week in  tech. Micah Sargent is here. He writes regularly at iMore. You've seen his stuff there. You've seen  him on our show. He does podcasts too.

This almost felt like an  admission of failure to me. It sounds like Motorola.  Yeah, or HTC. That's what they've been doing, isn't it? So they did kind of an HTC with Fossil.  Fossil still is going to make smartwatches. They still have a hundred people working there.  But Google spent $40 million to get smartwatch technology currently under development  and transfer a number of Fossil employees to Google. Number unknown. Fossil said,  we're still going to do smartwatches. We still have a big team working on it. But what is Fossil  doing that Android is not? Android Wear is not doing?

And so when I found out that Apple is going to be making a watch that had ECG,  I was like, I just upgraded to the series three, but this one, like I want to get this one and I  can use that.

So to your point earlier, Wesley, you're talking about Facebook users and, and, and generally  whether users even know that data is being collected. Pew, the research center, they do  good stuff. Recently did a survey of Facebook users. This is the most depressing. They found  three quarters of Facebook users, 74% didn't even know that Facebook maintains a list of their  interests and traits to target them with ads. They didn't, they didn't even know that three quarters.  And then researchers said, well, go look at your Facebook ad preferences page. And then 51% said,  well, well, I'm uncomfortable with that. And a quarter said, you know what, there, the ad  preferences page is wrong about me. Well, that's not a surprise. 88% of the people they polled and  they, they polled 963 Facebook users aged 18 and older. 88% had at least something on that  ad preferences page that had been generated for them.

So as long as somebody has a Facebook Messenger account, and who doesn't? By the way,  you still have a Facebook Messenger account, Micah, because you can delete your Facebook,  but it does not delete your Messenger account. Did you know that?  Okay. Yeah. Okay.

There's a big button that says talk to Leo or,  or I can call her and I'll appear on her screen. It's just easy.  Okay. That's the main reason. I tried to return it. They wouldn't let me.  They wouldn't let you. They said there's a 30 day return policy. So I thought, well, I'll buy this,  I'll review it and I'll give it back. And I sent them a note that, you know, like in two weeks  saying, I want to send it back. They said, oh, well you can return it, but first you have to tell us  why. And we need to copy the invoice. So I said, I don't want it because I don't want you spying on  me. And here's my invoice. And then I never heard from them again. Wow. So that basically that's,

And it's not, I should point out,  it's an opinion piece, not an article. Facebook's 10 year challenge is just a harmless meme, right?  She posited, well, we know, no, but what if Facebook was just trying to collect data about  how people age over 10 years? And it's more of a what if piece. It made Jeff went ballistic. He  said, this is exactly what's wrong with journalism today. This is not, you know, this, this is going  to people are going to, this is going to bring government regulation down on their heads.  This is inappropriate. I don't know. I don't think it's that far fetched. Maybe they are collecting

Start time: 3642.82
End time: 3707.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that kind of data. Of course they are. I'm of two minds of this. Okay. Um, first of all, from the  technical point of view, uh, there's a lot easier way of doing this. So I doubt that this is something  that Facebook is doing. Um, Facebook by the way, says we have nothing. This is a user generated  meme. We don't have anything to do with it. Yeah. This is not a method they would use to get this  information. Um, on the other hand, in terms of going back to the article, we just talked about  how many people know, uh, what Facebook is collecting on you. I think this is something  that gets into the public space easier than it's the, the audience is not the technical audience.  The audience is the people who don't know that this stuff is even possible, that they were like,  uh, and maybe it'll add just enough skepticism for them to, you know, say, oh, what's my whatever,  porn star name with the city you grew up on, I mean the street you grew up on. And then your  last name, that's your porn star name or whatever. I brought that one. I brought that one up to Jeff

Start time: 3712.30
End time: 3778.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  information about people. And, and so there's just maybe people like, I shouldn't submit this  information. I shouldn't do this. And I want people to pause just the layman people and just  so they can understand, like, I shouldn't volunteer this information or use it ironically,  which is great, but don't, but so from a technical standpoint, there's a lot easier way of doing this,  especially understanding how machine learning works. But the, but it's also not a dirty  data set. There's a way there's ways of cleaning it to make sure that you get good data in order  to train your model. But in terms of age progression, that's really not really useful  for a whole bunch of applications. But facial recognition and training it to say this is a  different twin time and just making sure that they know this increased the accuracy rate of predicting  the right person. That's something else. But I think this is a great article in terms of  it's getting tons of attention from people who participated who might not know that this stuff is

Start time: 3778.46
End time: 3868.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  possible. That's, that's, I like that. Yeah, I like that second, that second mind that you had there.  I think, you know, one of the things, cause I saw a bunch of different people talking about that  after this 10 year challenge happened or whatever. And at first I was sort of like this, that's silly.  And I can understand sort of the griping about that. But I think certainly in the idea that if  there was like a data scientist out there who wanted to try and figure out if they could,  you know, correctly predict how someone aged over time, then they could like search the hashtag that  exists or search for those Facebook posts that exist. But I mean, if you're on Facebook and you  have been on Facebook for a while and uploading photos of yourself from, you know, high school  into college and on, then there's the whole history of how you age in a better way than just  between two, between 10 year periods. And so it's sort of already there, I guess. Not that that,  you know what I mean? Like that doesn't make the idea that we should be concerned about privacy  any less. We absolutely should be, but I guess we could just, we could literally say this about  anything that we put on the internet. It's like, oh, Twitter was just made to collect our, how our  minds are thinking at the time so that it can better sell to us. It's all sort of doing that  always. So I don't know how this is that much different from something else.

An online experiment found that less than one in 10 people can tell sponsored content from an article.  Now, that's to me, this is really depressing because this is from a study done by Boston  University School of Communication assistant professor of advertising. Her online survey  divulged to participants they were viewing advertisements, but many of the people, 90%  thought they'd been looking at an article, even though they were told ahead of time.  They were told ahead of time.  The 738 nationally representative sample of US adults.  Doesn't surprise me, I guess, but it is depressing. Native advertising, if you don't know,  is- and you see it everywhere now- is something that somebody paid for. It looks like an article  in a newspaper or a magazine or a website. It looks like a real article, but it's not. It's  paid content that cleverly mentions the drug or the car or whatever it is they're trying to advertise.

And in high school, you have to take certain,  depending on the state that you're in, you have to take certain classes to satisfy the  requirements for the state of your education. And I really do feel like as part of a public education  at this point, media literacy should be in the scope of things. It's a very good point.

Start time: 4368.00
End time: 4489.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the RTX cards. I've just finished the review on this 2060, right when I got to CES. I was  actually publishing that. What do you think? And it's beautiful. I mean, what I'm waiting for  is what Nvidia calls DLSS because you can do hardware ray tracing. They have these tensor cores  for ray tracing. And right now they have the only hardware that can do that with these RTX series  cards. But they have this deep learning super sampling technology that uses AI to kind of  draw the frame that you're viewing and it poses a significantly less overhead to your hardware.  So the potential is to be able to do higher frame rates with the same kind of beautiful  lighting effects you get from ray tracing using deep learning, using these cards and other cards.  So we saw a demo of that at CES actually Nvidia had RTX cards running the new 3D Mark Port Royal  demo. That's going to be the standard demo, at least for a while that allows you to actually test  ray tracing, which we didn't even get until January 8th. So I was at CES watching it for the first time  because I didn't have a preview copy. And right next to it was a free release copy of the same  benchmark running DLSS. And it was running at a much higher frame rate and looked just as good.  So it actually looks slightly better because they were able to do things like they can train it to  identify the edges of objects. So the edges were really sharp. And then if you looked at just  regular ray tracing with standard temporal anti-aliasing, it kind of makes the whole screen  look a little bit soft, a little bit blurred. So the DLSS version was much sharper and was running  at a higher frame rate. So that's really exciting. I understand ray tracing. And in the past, it

Start time: 4490.14
End time: 4506.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  generates a great result, but it's so compute intensive. It literally imagines from a light  source, it traces the ray of light and imagines at each point what that's going to look like.  And you can imagine how long that takes, but they're doing it in real time.

Start time: 4506.98
End time: 4554.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That's the amazing thing. Think about just a few years ago when they would be running  rendering farms at a movie studio to do five seconds of film. And now you can do it in real  time because they have dedicated hardware for it. Will there be games that use this?  Yeah, there already are. Battlefield V is the poster child right now for ray tracing because  you can enable it. And it does look amazing. The parts of it that are shown as being very obvious  examples of it are always things like water reflections, light reflections on shiny surfaces  like chrome or the side of a car when there's an explosion. And you can see exactly how the  lighting would really fall. And it's very convincing, especially when you look at it side by side with  standard lighting techniques that have been used in games for many years.

Transcript:  They say it leverages a deep neural network to extract multi-dimensional  features of the rendered scene and intelligently combine details from multiple frames to construct  a high quality final image.

Start time: 4626.42
End time: 4647.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you read between the lines, what they're saying is it enables you to actually  in hardware render at a lower resolution and then leverage this to display it at the higher  resolution, which is why suddenly the frame count goes way up. Your actual frame rate goes way up.  I think in hardware you're probably at half resolution or something.

Transcript:  You know what the analog is of this? TVs are going to start doing this with up sampling.  So in the past when you up sampled from 24 frames to 60 frames, you had to imagine,  you interpolated what was the missing frames, and usually that was just duplicating previous  frames. But I heard about this at CES, Scott Wilkinson told us about this. They're starting  to use neural networks to actually try to, by training it with high definition material,  so it can learn what should be in between those frames when you up sample.  Sounds kind of cool.  It sounds similar to it.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I, although I do, I still can't watch a 60 frames per second film. And I remember there was this  scary, supposedly scary movie. It was like the horror movie that was really popular for a while.  It was It Follows. And I sat down and was excited to watch this film with some friends.  And I just spent pretty much the whole time griping about how it was in 60 frames per second and how  that just made me think of it as like, I don't know, a TBS television show. And the scary movie  didn't end up being that scary anyway. But I don't want to take 24 and make it 60 frames per second  because it just pulls me out of...

Transcript:  All right. Wait, Sebastian, for the DLSS, who does the training model? Is that done by Nvidia  or the game provider has to... That's a good question.

Start time: 4829.74
End time: 4863.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ...give you the training model? I don't know. I would assume that they had worked on it internally.  They didn't say anything about being developer level. However, I think that makes more sense  because certain games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, that's a coming, but it hasn't been  released yet. Nvidia was showing they've probably partnered with 3DMark to have this Port Royal demo  with the option enabled. At this point, I'm sure it is just a matter of actually having teams work  on this, implement it within games. That would probably fall on the game developer, I imagine.

Start time: 4863.92
End time: 4886.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That tells you. Yeah, but I'm guessing some game developers won't have access to the farms in order  to do the training model because the training part is the intensive part. Once it's trained,  you can deploy it on lower hardware. I'm guessing Nvidia has a farm that they then rent out to  the game developers for them to train their models so they can work better on their cards.  That sounds like another source of revenue for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and also implement DLSS in my game. You know what might be driving this is server-side gaming.  One of the points of DLSS is you render a lower quality, faster frame rate image and then clean it  up with DLSS to make it look spectacular. That's exactly what you'd want if you were doing gaming  on the server side. You'd want low latency, low quality images that you send to the playing  device. If the playing device had the ability to clean it up,  that would be the best of both worlds. You get great optics and low latency.  I don't know. I'm making this up. I don't know. It shows you how much money there is in gaming,  though. All this fancy technology is for gaming. It'll also be lock-in and harder to port.  Oh, who cares?  That's all. If video doesn't, they want everybody just using video cards.  Yeah. AMD will care.  Yeah. That's the only ... Radeon cares. Yeah. We know.  This is all lock-in for Nvidia, right? But everybody ... Every card does this. Every  company does this. How many games do you buy this? It works better with Radeon.

Transcript:  There are fewer of those, for sure. Are there?  Yeah. But there are quite a few more. I know it was  one of those things in our industry where there's been a lot of controversy about  GameWorks and how Nvidia had an advantage there and that so many games, especially in games  benchmarks, when new graphics cards come out, we run benchmarks, we release results, and then  people point to them and say, yeah, but Nvidia was helping them and they were helping develop  this game and there's an advantage on the Nvidia hardware because of GameWorks.

Talking about what these new cards do.  And they're only, oh, I don't know, a couple of thousand bucks.  How much would it cost me to get a 2080?

Start time: 5164.88
End time: 5176.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A 2080 is $699.  Some of the cards out there like on Newegg are a little bit more.  But I was actually seeing two last night that were selling for that $699 retail.  That's the MSRP if you buy it direct from NVIDIA.

Start time: 5176.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know if they're making them.  They do sell them.  They have their own founders edition is what they call it.  And so the card behind me is a founders edition.  That's their new cooler design.  And actually, interestingly, AMD is starting to sell their own cards.  This new Radeon Vega 7 that they have coming out is going to be sold on AMD.com  with their own reference design.

Start time: 5206.78
End time: 5216.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is there any reason to buy it from them instead of, I don't know, you know,  you know, somebody else?  Anyone else?

Start time: 5216.26
End time: 5274.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think, I think the reason would be just, I was thinking gigabyte, I guess.  I mean, when companies sell directly, like during last year, during the mining craze,  when you could not find a graphics card if you wanted it.  And when they would show up at retail, you were seeing crazy prices of a thousand dollars or more  a 1080 from NVIDIA.  And then you'd go to NVIDIA.com and they would, for brief windows of time, have them in stock  and you were buying them at just MSRP.  So for things like that, especially if you like just the stock reference design,  in the past, reference designs for graphics cards were pretty bad, very loud,  blower style coolers and things.  They've gotten pretty advanced, like AMD is showing a three fan, very kind of nice,  modern looking cooler.  NVIDIA has these nice dual fan colors that are very quiet.  So if you like the look of these things, then there's one reason, just aesthetics alone.

Although I saw Ry Crist on Twitter as a CNET person and he does a lot of smart home stuff.  And he had, I think he was at this conference or this meetup or whatever it was.  And I saw some of the stuff coming out of it and it did sound interesting.  Some of the things that are being worked on there and potentially like what  the Amazon Echo could do in the future, because I don't know.  There are a lot of people with these devices.  And when we give more features and more fun things that we can do with them,  I think that it helps the sort of smart speaker market overall.  And it gets people used to having these devices in their home,  which only results in more companies paying attention to them,  which means that I get to buy new fun smart home tech.  So like it's a good thing all around, even if it's just so that kids can play  I don't know, what is it?  Candyland board games with the Amazon Echo.

I think it was an iOS today about some of the games that are on the Echo.  And there actually are some interesting ones and pretty good ones that are essentially  text based adventures where you're sort of, you know, given the option to say,  Oh, I want to do this or I want to do that.  But they're not.  I think if it's built, you know, sort of from Amazon's perspective,  knowing what technologies they have available, it's going to be better.  So I wouldn't be completely against trying something like this.  I just don't want to make something less fun by adding an Echo to it.  Like you said, feeling trapped.  I think that's a really good.

Transcript:  You know, I was one of those people who jumped on Windows Phone.  When the really nice Lumia phones started coming out, and I think it was a Lumia 900,  I bought one of those.  I jumped off iOS and went to Windows Mobile.  And it was OK at first.  And there was the promise of all these apps that were going to be coming like, OK,  I'm going to be getting eBay.  I'm going to be getting this.  I'm going to be getting that.  And I'll have everything I need.  And then one of the areas that never really came was like chat app support back when  HipChat was still more widely used before Slack kind of took over.  And I was waiting for like that kind of support, which never came.  And then eBay was released, but then never updated.  And then like six or eight months later, it still wasn't updated.  And I finally just left.  Like, I love the interface.  I loved the tiles.  I could organize it exactly how it seemed to make the most sense to me for like one-handed  use, having like the size and the location of tiles wherever I wanted on the screen,  which you couldn't do with Android or iOS.  And there just there wasn't good app support.  There never was good app support.  And Microsoft was paying developers to make these Keystone apps like Instagram.  And they actually had to pay people.  They had to pay them.  And then they weren't paying them to keep them updated.  Okay, we made the app.  Here it is.  And then it would just sit there for a year without an update, without feature updates.  So it's sad, but it's it makes perfect sense to me because they just if they'd had the  app support at some point, a mobile phone is just a platform for apps.  And I can go between iOS and Android seamlessly for the most part.  I mean, there's the whole iMessage thing.  But as far as apps go, they're basically a parody at this point.  A lot of the major apps are just about the same on either platform.  But we have platforms that really did a lot with like UI, actual usability, user experience,  like Palm and Windows Phone.  And now we have like elements of Palm at least live on with the iPhone 10,  where you have like the the gesture based interface and sliding up from the bottom.  That's all stuff we saw with the Palm 3 years ago.

Start time: 6155.02
End time: 6166.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because humans don't like change and everyone says they love change and I like  it when things are dynamic and things change, but nobody really, it's not at our base instincts  to enjoy change.  It's just an icon.

Transcript:  They're going public and they're like, I guess, freshening it up.  I don't know why you wouldn't want that.  Why wouldn't you go with what people know?  It looks like Smurf sweat.

Start time: 6188.46
End time: 6224.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so it was a legitimate, the reasoning behind it was especially because of the way  that the logo was set up.  I think they said that it had like 16 different colors in it because of the overlaying bands.  And then also, there was no complete and they didn't have a place where you could go and  say, okay, this is exactly what I'm supposed to do with the logo and this is how it's set up.  Depending on who was putting the logo where and what, it all looked very different.  They were trying to bring things in and make a standard design.  That is true.  And pull it in and make it easier.  So I understand that.  With it going public, that makes sense.  That's a challenge.

Start time: 6225.24
End time: 6241.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a challenge with the Twit logo.  I had good advice, thank you, from designers who said, now you make sure it looks good  in all sizes, that you could stitch it on a hat, that you could put it on a t-shirt.  Those are things you really, and I bet you Slack data just said,  oh, this is pretty, which it was, but they weren't thinking about it.

Start time: 6241.34
End time: 6275.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was before it was public.  I mean, they made it before the app was finished, I think they said.  So the logo was sort of put together just on a whim and it sort of came second.  But yeah, so I understand the change, but anytime, I remember whenever the Twitter  changed from a star to a heart or when the typeface changes in an app or what have you.  Yeah, it's just like, we don't like that change because we're used to  what it was before.  There are some legitimate critiques of it and I understood those.  But yeah, the rage always seems to come forth and it's kind of funny.

Start time: 6276.06
End time: 6294.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're going to be like, totally hold my beer when they change the app.  Because if you're mad about their logo, they're going to be changing the interface.  And it's apparent that Microsoft Teams is really starting to get market share.  And so they are going to try to reposition their app to be simpler, easier to navigate.  Oh, interesting.

Start time: 6294.90
End time: 6309.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they feel challenged by Teams.  Now Teams does have some features missing that Slack has, but apparently the adoption  on Teams has been phenomenal because it's free.  Yeah.  And Slack has a free tier.  And you think it's simpler?

Start time: 6310.10
End time: 6348.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's easier to use.  Because it is limited in features, I guess that's why.  It feels like Slack's been built by a committee from their users, which is a good thing in terms  of adoption, but now that they're going to the masses, they're like, people are being confused  by the interface and don't know how to use it because they haven't been there from the beginning.  It's like if you picked up an iPhone today, as opposed to an iPhone from when they first came out,  and you follow them through all their iterations, you kind of get graduated from one level to next.  And so it makes sense as they add more features.  But once you're trying to be introduced to a new audience, it seems like there's a lot there.  So it's that equivalent.

We looked at Slack, and everybody really wanted to use Slack.  I mean, what Slack has going for it is people love it.

Start time: 6419.86
End time: 6427.75

But whenever the celebrities hop on that and say, oh, you know, I don't like this thing,  then there are people who follow in suit.  And the fact is Snapchat has never made any sense ever.  So I don't like them changing the way that the app was set up. It's just like, oh, well,  this is just another thing that I don't understand.

Start time: 6472.50
End time: 6492.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was an intentional feature that they figured the best way to go viral with an app  is to make it completely opaque on how to use it. But the one kid who figured out how to use it  would get all this status by showing all his friends and then they'd get status by showing  their friends and it would make it go viral. I thought it was like a brilliant marketing ploy.  But maybe not.

Transcript:  That's clever. I know that I-  whenever I- because like when I started working at iMore, the way that I got that job was actually  writing this huge guide on Snapchat. You millsplained Snapchat to Renee Richie.  I had to millsplain it to myself though, because I hadn't really used the app before.  And so I asked some of my friends who were regular Snapchat users, like, hey, am I forgetting  anything? And they're like, yeah, they're like all of these other things with these gestures.  I'm like, what the heck?

Start time: 6525.04

It looks like I  don't know what's going on. But again, it's just a logo, guys. I don't really- but I understand why  people get upset when change happens. So it'll be interesting to watch. Oh, here's their original-  this is the problem that you were talking about. It just looks different.  It's partially translucent.  Yeah. Nobody can reproduce it. That is a good point. Yeah. Yeah.

But with, with Fortnite, you know, Netflix could only say that like Fortnite was a competitor in  terms of playing the game. If they were talking about Bandersnatch, you know what I mean? Like  they haven't made games before. So I do feel like it's gotta be about streaming there more  than anything. Because my, so speaking, so we've got millennials, sure. But now we've got that  next generation called like post-millennials and all that. So my siblings, my younger brother  is a Twitch streamer of Fortnite and like does that sort of for a living.  Yeah, right. Yeah. Like he's, his rent and stuff is paid by playing that game,  which I have no idea how any of it works. But my sister, our, I guess I'll say our sister,  most of the television that she watches is actually my, our younger brother playing,  playing Fortnite.

Libratus, which is Latin for  balance was created by researchers from Carnegie Mellon to test ideas for automated decision-making  based on game theory. After he beat the poker players, the professor who led the project  founded a startup called Strategy Robot. Late in August, the company received a two-year contract  of $10 million from the army.

They  become interdependent on themselves. It builds on itself. He's trying to build the future  that he wants from, and he's adding the pieces as he goes. And so going back to TikTok, you're  saying, oh, that'll be done. No, they will find a way to support each other so they can keep going.

And it was recently released that the president of WeWork apparently owned a lot of  the properties that WeWork was renting in order to have their offices. And so that an environment  like that- Michael Talk about double dipping. I mean, he's the landlord. WeWork's CEO is also  WeWork's landlord.

Obsession number one is, as you said, real estate.  Son believes there's an opportunity to consolidate and automate the fractured world of real estate.  So $20 billion in WeWork, for instance. Although I think he lowered that recently. Obsession number  two, mobility. Transportation is moving from something individuals own to a service they rent  on demand via technology. We're clearly seeing that move. So these are some of his investments,  Uber Grab, Didi Chuxing, which is the Chinese, Didi is the Chinese Uber, GM Cruise, that's their self  driving vehicles, OLA, which is the Uber of India, Man Bang Group, which despite its name is about  truck hailing. It probably means something different wherever Man Bang is. Get around,  peer to peer car sharing, park jockey, parking reservations. You're gonna have a problem with  language, I think is going to be a problem because things mean different things in different countries.  Other obsessions. Let's see what else. I mean, that's just maybe that's it. Oh, no, here it is.  Number three, commerce. He online purchases of goods and services will flourish in AI powered  world. Maybe not.

There's like a thousand, it looks like Woodstock and we're going by and we  go, oh, there's two gyms there. They're playing Pokemon Go. That ain't nothing. Get ready. You  heard it here first. Sometime this year, Warner Brothers and Niantic, the creators of Pokemon Go,  are going to release the Harry Potter game. Yeah, that's going to get people. If you think Pokemon  Go was crazy, because what is the number of people who are Harry Potter fans compared to the number  of Pokemon fans? I'm going to look that up. I'll ask Cortana. Ask Cortana.

Transcript:  They're agile. What a surprise. So this was a big mistake. The scooter company Bird. Apparently,  I didn't know this. There are Bird scooters piling up in city impound lots because they get  abandoned and the city impounds them. And then people buy them. And it turns out with a $30  conversion kit from China, you just take the Bird board out and it depersonalizes it, turns it into  a scooter untethered from the Bird infrastructure. Cory Doctorow had the nerve to tell people that.  And Bird sent us, and I'm quoting Cory here, a legal threat of such absurdity. We are publishing  it in full along with a scorching response from the Electronic Frontier Foundation as a kind of  celebration of truly world-class legal foolishness. They attempted to use 1201 of the digital  millennium copyright. That section says, you can't disseminate circumvention tools. But of course,  Cory didn't disseminate circumvention tools. He wrote a story about people doing that.

Transcript:  You don't have to back, you don't have to figure it out. You just take out the board.  Oh, heaven for fence. So somebody at Bird's probably, or Bird's law firm is probably going,  oh crap. Because it turns out- There's a zip recruiter.  Yes, there's a zip recruiter at for that firm. As it turns out, Cory Doctorow is one of the  chief campaigners against Section 1201. He's famous for it. And he isn't going to back down.  He says, I've pledged myself to killing Section 1201 of the DMCA. He has a project called Apollo  1201, a mission to eradicate DRM in our lifetime. This is the guy you sent the 1201 season assist to.  It's like pouring gasoline on the fire. Anyway, we're hoping we can get Cory with us down in  South by, he's going to be at South by Southwest. Do you know Cory? Yeah, Wes, he is so much fun.  I have not met him. One of the smartest. I would love the honor.  It's scary. He's one of the smartest guys I've ever met. And so I really, I'm like running to  keep up with his intellect. You ran for president, right?  No, that was Larry Lessig. Oh, Larry Lessig.  Another stalwart in the fight against DRM. Larry finally decided we're never going to get rid of  copy protection. We're never going to get rid of crazy copyright and intellectual property protection  until we get rid of this massive corporate money pouring into politics. So this is back in 2016.  Larry Lessig, who's a professor of law at Harvard, he created Creative Commons, said, look,  here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to run for president on one platform only to completely  eliminate corporate donations, to complete campaign financing redesign so that it's public  financing. There's no corporate money in it at all. So when you elect me on day one, I will do that.  On day two, I'll resign. I'll have a really good vice president. He'll take over.  Needless to say, Corey didn't even stand a chance, but it was, I thought, a brilliant plan. Brilliant  plan. Here is the last story. We're going to let you all go home, but it's a beautiful story.  Cremona, Italy. This is where the Stradivarius violin was created in the 1700s  by Antonio Stradivari. These violins, which are in this museum, are dying. Not just Stradivarius,  but other classics by Amati and Guarneri del Gesù. They were, you know, age. We're going to lose them.  So somebody had a brilliant idea. Let's digitize the sound.  So the curator of Cremona's Museum of Violins, the Museo del Violino, has taken over the  auditorium, is bringing in world-class musicians to play these violins. But they found out there's  a little problem. Every time there are cobblestone streets all around this museum, every time a truck  goes by, there's a rumble that gets picked up by the microphones. Fortunately, the mayor of Cremona  is a trustee of the museum. He decreed silence in the city. They have roped off the entire area of  the museum, and they've told everybody in Cremona, you need to be quiet during the recordings so that  it'll take a long time. Four musicians playing two violins, a viola and a cello.  They work through scales, arpeggios. They pluck the strings. They bow the strings.  32 ultra-sensitive microphones set up in the museum's auditorium will capture the sounds.  They'll have to play hundreds of thousands of individual notes and transitions for eight  hours a day, six days a week, for more than a month. But when it's done, these will all be digitized,  and you will be able to buy Stradivarius samples that will capture the sound of these violins,  these violins that are losing their tone with age, and they'll be preserved forever. Isn't that

He'll just like, oh yeah,  I'll just, yeah, that's a Stradivarius voice there. It sounds pretty good.  Isn't that amazing? He won't have any idea of what actually went into sampling that.

I am trying to figure out who would be good to add to  my own work network in terms of figuring of, we have speaking opportunities, we have roundtables,  we have different things where as a company, we need experts to give their opinion on or  possibly fly you to. And so I'm trying to increase my network of developers. So if you're a developer  on machine learning, any type of R, Python, scientific research, data mining, anything  that's related to computers that you type on and make a program, send me a message on Twitter and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interesting. Yeah, well, just the website PCPer.com and there's a review. I already have a preliminary  review of the RTX 2060, their new lower cost card that still has ray tracing capabilities.  I'll be adding to that. Like my plans in the coming weeks are to add the DLSS story as that  becomes available to add more of like as the board partners like ASUS and MSI, AVGA release  their versions and what they can do. Some of them are overclocked out of the box, that kind of stuff.  Just check out the website PCPer.com. You can follow me on Twitter if you want to,  at Sebastian Peak. How much would a 2060 set me back?  $349. That's not too bad. No, and it's really not the mid-range card people were expecting.  Like, oh, like 1080p gaming. No, this actually is like 1440 gaming or like ultra-wide 1080 gaming.  So it's really kind of a step between the mid-range and the high end and $349 is pretty much  exactly where it should be. They were very fair with pricing this time. I just bought a video

Yeah, it's called Q2VKPT and I could  not type that straight. I had to go back and correct it later, but Quake 2 completely from the ground up  redone with ray traced. Oh my God, I loved Quake 2. And Carmack did an amazing job back in the day  with lighting effects with what he had, but now the hardware can do it and it looks, the videos  look amazing. I haven't installed it yet. It's all free. You can actually use the Quake 2 demo.  It only needs the, some of the basic files and then there's this whole new engine that's been  created to run it. And this has been like going on since like the mid to late 2000s, but they  finally have like a full path traced version that runs on like the new RTX card. Oh, that sounds
