Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  The steve jobs era is over apple's dead. There'll be something completely different like so, you know what?  We know you expected us to release a watch. So we're doing a headband instead

Start time: 578.84
End time: 647.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the apple um watch I think they are going to release one  I mean we've been hearing about it for a long time. I think they've I think they've had versions of this ready  Um over the past couple years and it just wasn't there and they were the only ones that were  I would say  You know maybe disciplined enough to not release something this crap because everything that's out there is just nobody would want to use it  We use them because we have to because you know, it's our job to tell people about it  But none of us I don't think would would necessarily want one  You know in our regular everyday life or have integrated into our everyday life yet  But I think apple's gonna go simpler and I think it's gonna be focused on  More focused on health than anything else and it's gonna it's gonna have less features than everybody else's it's gonna be focused actually on three things  design  health and simplicity  um, and  Probably it's gonna you know have a it's gonna have less power in it so that it can you know, the battery can last longer  It's gonna focus on health clearly and it's gonna focus on design something  You would actually want to wear want to be seen wearing and not sort of the kind of hideous looking things that we've seen so far

Start time: 647.48
End time: 651.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

End time: 669.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Years. Yeah, really it all started with a nano with a nano and the watch you stick it on there and like hey  This could actually be a watch, you know  It looks like a nano

Start time: 670.52
End time: 685.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The true advantage that apple will bring here is is that these are just  Translating that metaphor the phone onto something that is smaller and that you put on your wrist and what apple is going to do is  Bring this fresher poach and say this is not the same thing as your phone. This is something that is complementary to your phone. Yeah

Start time: 687.14
End time: 695.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If apple releases some okay, here's a couple of thoughts  Apple may not be able to do something better than this  So maybe they won't release a watch why would they be able to do something?

Start time: 695.96
End time: 725.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why would might not if they can't if they can't release something that's better  I think they won't release it if it's not ready  I think they've shown that already like I said there was limit  Photo the the photo types prototypes floating around for a couple years and people I you know  I mean from the rumors i've heard people said they look pretty slick  But they had problems with battery life. They had you know, they weren't sure exactly what to do with the thing  You know what functions to to focus on or whatever and they didn't release it because they felt like it just wasn't it wasn't there yet

Start time: 726.06
End time: 737.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it wrong of me to think of this as almost a litmus test to the post steve jobs era that if if jobs were here apple  Would release something that would set us all back and go wow. I didn't know I needed that. Yeah

Start time: 738.24
End time: 740.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I want it. Can we do that again without mr. Jobs?

Start time: 741.62
End time: 763.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's fair. I think it's fair to call it a litmus test, you know to see what they come out with if they release it  um, and how good it is and how much it uh,  You know makes people  Whether it's a hit or not, right the jobs era was based on hit products  And they had hit after hit after hit  Uh, and that's why they are where they are today, but they have released flops. We have to acknowledge. Yeah. Yep

Start time: 764.50
End time: 777.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There have been ugly the the ibook that looked like a toilet that work called a toilet seat  That was ugly, uh the cube which I thought was great and bought a flop  They have not apple has not always been 100%  Yeah, certainly especially on software

Start time: 779.16
End time: 790.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they can't they can't afford mistakes now. That's the difference, right?  The prior yeah jobs could make mistakes because he was steve and and now boy a flop now would be  Pretty bad

Start time: 790.90
End time: 834.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good point. It would I agree. It'll be tough. Whatever they do with the eye watch  I think it's fair to call it a litmus test to see you know, do they still have the discipline?  Do they have still have the design mojo?  Do they still have the ability to create hit products because while they had misses  They had they had more hits than anybody and you know, that's what sort of put them over the top  And made them the most valuable company in tech  But um, and and they could look they're gonna be able to survive for a decade on the  The things that they did last decade  But will they do it and uh, and and be creative and innovative?  That's the big question. I mean or will they turn into just a company that you know has nice looking hardware and you know keeps putting out  iterative, uh  iterative

Start time: 834.56
End time: 922.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Approaches to that to what's already out there. I don't know fans of marcus brownlee heard those two notes and immediately knew  I was playing mkbhd and there's a good reason to be playing this video marcus got a massive scoop  He got a what he says and he may be right because it'd be pretty hard to fake  Is the sapphire crystal from the next generation iphone? Yeah. Yeah  It sure looks like it and I don't know how you would I don't know. I don't know how you would make a fake of this  Uh, it's not he's not the only one who has it. There's some hong kong videos showed at first  Uh a guy uh named what was his name? Uh chet scottie. I can't remember his last name  Gave it to marcus, but the scottie had it before marcus did  I have to say if you're gonna make something that's a fake  That's gonna be pretty hard to do a lot of work and uh, sonny dixon sonny dixon. That's the name  Um, so this is sonny dixon's sample  You know  I don't credit a lot of rumors that come from within apple because apple is so good at keeping a lid on those  But when it comes to this when it comes to the supply chain, it's hard. It's hard these chinese companies. They're small  They could you know, whoever made this it may not even be foxcon. It might be a supplier to foxcon  I'm not surprising they might leak out but here's the interesting thing  Uh, he really ripped on this thing. First of all, we are not sure still if it's sapphire  It's claimed to be sapphire. We know apple bought a big sapphire  Manufacturer and is trying to make larger sapphire has been around for a long time. In fact the iphone 5  s uses a sapphire  Crystal on the camera lens and on the thumb or fingerprint reader

Transcript:  Feature limited use watches. Come on. But yeah, if you have a high-end wristwatch, uh, sapphire crystal is premium product  But watch he's gonna try to scratch this thing with a knife with his keys  He tries to bend and break it  This thing is if this really is uh, what it purports to be that alone might be a good selling point for the new  Pervious one thing that if this is the iphone, uh crystal  Uh, this is a 4.7 inch screen. So it would confirm that rumor that apple will do a larger iPhone

End time: 1002.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've got to and as marcus pointed out, uh  the thinking by some was that the  A larger five and a half inch iphone would have the sapphire crystal and the less expensive 4.7 would not but clearly this is the case  He he he he tries to break it by bending it  can't  Uh, in fact it took it finally somebody did break it a hong kong video from hong kong guy drove a 1.6 ton truck over it  and finally smashed it  I would take it back. I should point out that there's still going to be a phone behind this piece of sapphire  Some delicate electronics in there still has some fragility

Start time: 1003.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's the number one failure in iphones is is those broken screens and so if they can fix that oh my gosh  It'll be huge.

Citizens and in there were email addresses  pictures  uh  personal stuff  um, so  10 000 account holders holders  Uh, they they they cataloged and let's say many other files described as useless by the analysts, but nonetheless retained  Have starvingly this is the washington post intimate and even voyeuristic quality  They tell stories of love and heartbreak illicit sexual liaisons metal health crises. This is all in the data  political and religious conversions  financial anxieties disappointed hopes the daily lives of more than 10 000 account holders who were not targeted  Not targeted by the nsa, but never nevertheless recorded and more than that cataloged by the nsa  Uh 160 000 intercepted email instant message conversations  Some of them hundreds of pages long 7900 documents 11 000 online accounts all from president obama's first term 2009 to 2012  Uh  This clearly proves the nsa is collecting and in some cases analyzing

Start time: 1766.30
End time: 1836.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Published by the washington post and the reporter barton gellman  Who broke the story he said some readers and commentators have described the story as an overheated statement of the obvious  that surveillance of one person  Includes the content of people who talked to him others have said the washington post not the government invaded the privacy of innocence  Because we published their conversations the nsa did not  In the view of some critics we displayed ignorance of nsa systems  Or knowingly chose to distort  The way they work now he acknowledges it's a very complicated  Story, he said we drafted the story carefully. We stand by all of it  He explains in the article how?  They parsed the data  He said most of the accounts we found in the pile and he was just a dump of a pile of data were not nsa targets  Um, some commentators think that's unremarkable i'll come back to that  Nine out of ten account holders found in a large cache of intercepted conversations  Were not the intended surveillance targets, but were caught in the net the agency had cast for someone else  He says actually I underplayed that amount that number was the only one we could measure with any precision  But we think it was actually a lot more

Start time: 1838.48
End time: 1842.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, and how did he determine that individuals weren't targeted like a word?

Start time: 1842.20
End time: 1881.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he says we didn't have an official nsa list of targets. We had to find them in the pile ourselves  So they hired an independent researcher  Who you tried to figure out kind of structure all this who was the target and who was the collateral damage?  um  And he said sometimes we could probably go ahead. Oh, i'm sorry. Go ahead  He said some of our questions could not be answered with the data we had for that reason our story did not say  What some commentators have imputed to it?  Uh, we did not say there are more americans and foreign targets in the pile. We suspect that's true, but we couldn't establish it reliably  But they did say nearly half of the files contained names  Email addresses and other details that the nsa marked as belonging to u.s. Citizens or residents

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you what do you guys uh think I mean I think the general takeaway that I saw in all the press was the nsa  Is spying on u.s. Citizens that may be collateral damage, but they are collecting that information analysts are looking at that information  And this is going far beyond what they are legally entitled to do  To do um others say as I as I said, well, that's just what happens when you collect data

Start time: 1911.28
End time: 1937.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and I would say yeah, this is this just verifies  The data that we already have right we already know that american citizens are being spied upon and it's uh  I think it comes down to if you are if you're that person that's fighting against privacy invasion and you're like, you know  What I I think that this should not be happening and you can't use technology right now because by using any kind of  Technology, I think you're opening yourself up to this kind of stuff, right?

Start time: 1938.08
End time: 2001.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is true. Although it's I mean, it's an untenable suggestion for most people in this era  And and particularly look I was at the un for five years  And i'm looking at my bucket of press releases. I have over 150 000 press releases that come from all countries including iran  syria  Libya the most terrifying places in the world they i'm on their email list  It is it makes a big difference when you think of this as an abstract and then when you think of this as you  And and you can set a set of criteria and say look  And also we should put a ledge in front of all of this  But you can say these are this is the criterion by which the nsa  Made a list of the people to gather information from and then you can put spokes out from those the people who fit that criteria  And you can say whether it's okay to gather data or not gather data or whether this is what happens when you gather data  Or don't gather data. You can easily connect those dots and see  Who and what types of people have been spied on and the degree to which they've been spied on?

Transcript:  Yeah, you know, but on one hand at the top of the show we were talking about leo's watch and  More and more technology that we're embracing and getting excited about and all these things and then on the other hand  We're concerned about the privacy, but yet we want more and more  Technology to make our lives easier. You know, so where do you draw the line? Do you just say hey i'm just you know  I'm cutting the cord. I'm not going to do anything from now on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I what what I know are are people and particularly journalists and colleagues of mine are doing a few things and there's nothing that you  Can do that really prevents all of this but there are some small measures you can tape first is encrypt everything  The second is although it's not really going to make you safer  You can move to mycolab or to proton mail or something that is stored  At least outside of the the auspices of the united of the u.s  Now, I don't really believe that this is going to keep you safer  But it is a protest move and it's one that says look i'm willing to take my own privacy seriously  The other thing that you can do is which is what i'm doing right now is taking everything of importance out of google  And and using the google account to access things because you have to but not allowing an indexing of your personal data  I mean, no, you can't escape everything but you can take measures. They may be half measures, but you can send a pretty loud signal

Transcript:  Yeah, bruce schnire. We've had on the show love bruce. He's the security guru go-to guy on this  He says and he said this in a talk  Earlier this week at the new america foundation a panel discussion  Uh called national insecurity agency how the nsa surveillance programs undermine internet security  Schneier said the issue is not that the nsa is spying on whoever the bad guy is  That they want to spy on the issue is they're deliberately weakening the security of everyone else in the world  In order to make that spying easier, right?  Yes, putting backdoor access in undermining encryption protocols hacking into yahoo and google's private interconnects  Um, they're undermining security in general and I think when china says don't trust the iphone what their real message is  The usa is spying on us and any us any company that that is in the usa  Whether intentionally or not is acting as an arm of that agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I keep cutting you guys off, but but it it gives this this tacit permission  Well if the nsa can do it we can do it and that actually figures into security and threat models far more than just the nsa  I'm far more concerned about china and and egypt than I am about the the nsa  But because the nsa is capable of this and because they've been doing it  It gives these other countries permission to do it and say well, you know  It escalates. Yeah, that's right. Exactly. Exactly. And dan I would I would

Transcript:  I wonder if you you mentioned the the alternative email clients, etc that you can use to  You know sort of be more secure online and I wonder I go back to the you know  That pile of data that they were using  And and what key were they're using to flag people that they're going to look deeper at do they look deeper at people?  That are obviously trying to hide stuff or can you hide in plain sight by just they have said the nsa has said if you use

Transcript:  Encryption if you use tor tor you're screwed you we are going to flagging yourself. We can't tell  This is their excuse. We can't tell if you're  Uh a foreign national or a terrorist so we're just going to collect everything  So that's the other side of this equation. I use a pgp encryption on all on my email  It's a flag  Right. It's saying hey, I might be up to something so they collect everything you do

Transcript:  More of us that do this  Uh the other the other point the Washington Post makes is this is already data  That's been minimized according to the rules the rules are  That if it doesn't have anything to do with an investigation, you should minimize it. You should  Uh, you should redact it. You should remove personal information. They say the data we got was already minimized  So trust me, it's worse than that. They're saying  Nine out of ten people in this database where u.s. Citizens not connected  With foreign nationals in its and that's the minimized version

Transcript:  Take my word for it, right? I'm sure that we're all familiar with the panopticon and that's exactly what we are experiencing here  Well, why bother why bother encrypting? Why bother using tor? Why bother using proton mail? Because that's just the flag  So maybe I just shouldn't say anything. I should just shut up

Start time: 2283.96
End time: 2326.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I frankly I frankly think that one of the conspiracy theories that is somewhat credible is  That this whole thing is intentionally planted by the nsa to make everybody feel like that the whole point of the panopticon  which was  Uh a prison that was designed to make prisoners feel like there was no way they could do anything without being surveilled  The design of the panopticon was that the prisoners couldn't see the watchers  But the watchers could see the prisoners  So the prisoners never knew if they were being watched the presumption would be then i'm always being watched  So i'm going to behave. I think that's you could make the case. This is exactly what the nsa would like  This is this impression that we're all being watched  And so watch yourself. It's like fake

Transcript:  Bit. Yeah. Yeah, that psychological bit is far more powerful than any, you know, kind of uh, it's working they could do right?  It's working. Um, I mean i've talked about I feel like i've talked about this so many times, you know  This story specifically nothing about it surprised me, you know, no at this point we've heard it all haven't we?  Yeah, I think it was important. Nothing about it surprised me, but I still believe and you know that  I think we do need sort of a new kind of bill of rights digital era sort of bill of rights to to  At least come to some discussions some really hard discussions about what are the rights that we should expect  You know people should expect on the internet in terms of especially privacy and data and those type of things  We're gonna it's gonna take it's gonna be just like anytime you've created something  Like this is gonna be a lot of arguing there's gonna be a lot of you know, give and take  but but I feel like we haven't had those discussions and so we're slowly just sliding down the  sort of accepted practices  uh, and and I just think it's it's a bad road to go down and uh,  you know at some point there needs to be sort of a grassroots movement to  Um sort of take back the sort of rights or at least set expectations  Uh, and it needs to be I think it's gonna have to be bottom up and it's gonna have to force  Um, you know people in power to to think about it. I don't like internet legislation  I don't i'm not necessarily suggesting a body to to um  to you know  Oversee this or you know be in charge of the internet, but I do think we can come to some reasonable  Um expectations about you know, what what kind of privacy we should expect and what kind of sort of rights people have

Start time: 2426.88
End time: 2463.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And those kinds of things seems like a big obelisk like a big  NSA seems like a big box that it's impenetrable, right? There's all this data in there  You don't know what they're collecting what they're doing and  You know, by the way the key to the panopticon you don't know what the watch you have no idea  Really, but may not be collecting anything but you look at this and I say I think like, okay  Yeah, it'd be great to have some sort of legislation and oversight over what they're doing  But how I mean, how do you how do you even affect that if you have no idea what they're  What they're capturing and what they're doing with that data and they will never tell you exactly what they're doing  How do you even hope to do on the other hand?

Start time: 2464.06
End time: 2528.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that the NSA and the people who are doing this are patriots  That they're doing it because they want to protect us from another terrorist attack like 9-eleven  That they are doing everything that they know how to do to protect us, but I think there's another question is this  effective I think  Terrorists, it reminds me of copy protection  You know, the only people who are impeded by copy protection are honest people bad guys know exactly how to get around right?  Yeah, I would imagine that the means exist and that terrorists know how to use them  Osama bin Laden was not using the internet. He was hidden away  He had a courier bringing usb keys. It was really  Excellent work and great luck that we were able to figure out where he was  I would imagine that at this point if you're a terrorist you're not using the internet. You're not sending email  Hey abdullah, let's attack the pentagon. You're not going to send that over gmail, right?  So who is who is this protecting us from?

I mean we don't know  We don't know a lot about the origins of the story  We don't know a lot about like is this one study it should be one study amongst thousands of facebook  Does their public company if they're not testing this stuff? It's irresponsible, right?  We don't know that any of the kind this is such a great clickbait story that I feel I almost feel bad  Look, I want to believe facebook is evil as much as the next tech person. They're evil. Okay, great  That said this is such a great link bait story that that  We forget all the context and the questions we should be asking which is you know  How many of these studies do they do? What types of studies do they do? What's the criterion? What's the sample rate?  I mean, there's I would like to know if they do this more

Start time: 3267.90
End time: 3407.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah, well my first thought when I heard the story was like this is cold, you know, but uh  But the thing that I sort of came to because a lot of the discussions about this came down to well  People sign those sla or not the sla. Oh, yeah, if you look at the terms of service terms of service  It's very clear that they could do this. Oh, yeah, absolutely  But it sort of reminded me of again  This is kind of what I was getting to at the story and I say earlier right is like the digital world is sort of  Fundamentally changing a lot of the ways people interact and their expectations and in the you know  existing world there are  Regulations and guidelines in place to sort of protect people from entities that can do these kinds of things to them in  Manipulated and manipulative and sort of not very cool ways  unethical ways for for example, it made me think of like informed consent when  you know a  When someone is asking you to do something in a medical community and they're getting your consent for a surgery or to use some  Of your cells for something and that kind of thing. Um, like we learned with that the sort of the great book on the healer cells  um, uh the  About reetta lax. I love that by the way, that's exactly  Um, you know what happened was it was a failure of informed consent because informed consent hadn't really fully formed yet  um, and so they had to you know, they had to  Within a reasonable, you know  Within a reasonable doubt they had to give you  Communicate it to you what was happening in a way that an average normal person could understand  You know, that's the thing here with some of these that that's what that sort of make me think of there are things that people  are doing and agreeing to and  You know that are being covered in these terms of services that you know, we're just now seeing some of the use cases where companies  Getting a little bit  You know stretching the bounds of those things to see what really they can do and that's what happened in this case  You know facebook was stretching the bounds of of what it can do with its users in ways that I think not all  Of us are real comfortable with in in terms of them trying to manipulate  People in ways that is essentially an  science experience for them  But in ways that could potentially you know have negative effects on on average people of their service and senator senator mark warner said an

Not at all. Not at all. Let me ask this question Frederick  You said it's like a novel or Gina said that but you repeated it. It's like a novel  We certainly when we read a novel we expect that that's what we read a novel for it's about expectation  I expect to be lifted upward depressed or you know, and and that's not a shock  But when I read a Facebook feed don't I just isn't my expectation merely that I will see what my friends are up to

Transcript:  Less and less so I think less and less because well, that's why I'm mad  Yeah, cuz we don't know what's in our feed there  They're curating our feed for us highly for one and now we know that they're you know on purpose guiding the feed, right?  So, you know you can't anything you see on Facebook unless it's from your close friends and family  Which you know, you're gonna get their posts. You can't really trust it anyway.

You are not a cable or you are a cable  You're like a cable company. They the judges were very confused. You're excited kind of like a cable company. And  So what you're doing is illegal  So ario said, okay  We were a cable company and we want retransmission rights and we'll pay those fees  the  Broadcasters who would sue them said no  Can't be a cable company you weren't so the broadcasters basically said you're a cable company until ario said yes  We're a cable company now. They're saying no, you're not a cable company  Whatever ario may say about its rationale for raising it now. It is astonishing  Says the cable industry  Astonishing for ario to contend the Supreme Court's decision automatically transformed ario into a cable system  So it seems to me  That this is exactly what this was all about like the the Supreme Court sent him back to the lower court and  Said figure this out ario said, okay. I thought this would happen actually  We want retransmission agreements. We'll pay the retransmission fees  And now the the network say no  They basically it's pretty clear now the networks just want area to go away. It's not about the money  They don't it's about ario.

It's peace of mind  carbonite.com  I I know I  judges don't like  Distribute memos about what they they don't get they don't collude. Here's why I say this a federal judge  sued  by uber vita uber vita, which is a  Nutritional supplement company  Makes them and and there were bad reviews on amazon and uber vita says no  This is not this is a campaign of dirty tricks against uber vita  In an effort to put us at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace and they and they went to court  The judge  Has said no  if  You amazon have got to reveal to uber vita who posted those negative reviews and craigslist same thing  The maker they make testosterone boosters multivitamins and weight loss supplements. What could be wrong with that?  Unknown cometers had placed fraudulent orders to disrupt their inventory  Posted a craigslist ad to offer cash for favorable reviews of uber vita products. That wasn't us  And posted as dissatisfied users  Um  us district judge marsha peckman  Said that uber vita can serve subpoenas on amazon and craigslist  What they call john doe subpoena saying we need the identities of these people and amazon must comply  So that's the first  I'm not crazy about that  But it feels like but so it's probably good to know that when you post a negative review on a site you could be  Liable for libel, right?

I'm sure you know this but within gaming a ton of the the the gamers  uh  The youtube gamers their commenters had this trust relationship precisely because they could be anonymous or at least pseudo anonymous  But then when we flip to a consumer type of relationship, uh, just like you're saying frederick that  It's a different type of trust relationship and I need to be less opaque about my my identity  But I think that there are certain types of behavior and the gamers are really the easiest ones to point to  Where trust comes from anonymity?

They use that because they feel I can be free  I just want to say stupid stuff at night and uh, whatever nobody cares and it doesn't reflect on my  My work persona or my public persona  It's not chilled behavior and I think that that's really important too

This is makes no sense at all  They launched 100 channels madonna espn as I mentioned shack  um  Over 115 of the channels launched as part of that initiative are now in the top 2 most subscribed channels  I don't understand if that's how that's right  Since they only launched 100 but anyway, they're going to do it again  But this time they're going to be cagier  um  They are actually going to do it a little bit more quietly  They apparently according to reuters have embarked on a new round of discussions with hollywood and independent producers  to fund premium content  In other words pump a little cash  Into the better youtube channels, so it's not all groin shot videos  And talking oranges. Oh wait a minute talking oranges is the premier content.

Yes  Um, I bought lightroom years ago 200 bucks or whatever it was and I have the what they call it the perpetual version or something like that  But now they have a ten dollar a month you get photoshop and lightroom and since you have to subscribe to photoshop  I figure well i'm gonna buy that  There was some concern that if you've got this creative cloud subscription, and then you don't continue to pay  Adobe's ten bucks each and every month that you will no longer have access like is my lightroom gonna go away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm, that's a good question. Well, I could tell you the answer because tom hogarty explained. I know tom very well  I'm sure you do I do too  So the issue and a lot of people were worried about this in a little leery of the subscription  Um, although I think 10 bucks for both photoshop and lightroom is a good deal if you haven't bought lightroom  If you bought lightroom ever  Like the full version you don't have to ever worry that's always going to continue to work  You'll have to pay for upgrades of course, but that's forever going to work with full functionality  If you only got through subscription  Some stuff will stop working the develop and map module if you stop paying the subscription  You will no longer be able to use the develop module in the map module  So you have your photos. They're not gone you have you can see what you've done with your photos.

They're just you know, they're sitting there in the original photo  Yeah  So the things that you're losing access to are your changes if you've made any  Development changes and not exported a new tiff or something, right?  Then those are going to be locked in because you can't access the develop module  But everything else is there you could run some other app and point it at that directory and boom all your photos are right
