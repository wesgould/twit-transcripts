You also were an analyst at the National Secrecy  administration  But now is really kind of the guru of the hard drive and we've I've been friends with Alan for  Gotta be almost ten years now. I remember calling on you constantly as the SSD  Revolution for all you can yeah the ultimate gaming machine and yeah and a lot of stuff you you had the craziest setup  How many how many SSDs did you have ganged up when?  Still you still have that changes all the time you had this amazing like I you had hundreds of them all ganged together

Start time: 325.94
End time: 347.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ten years ago there weren't good SSDs out yet  And I had like I was pitching it to you for a gun build potentially because you were talking about velociraptors  Yeah at the time yeah, there's a 10,000 rpm spinning disc  Yeah, and I'd found this I forgot who made it  But it was a red SSD enclosure and you put six SD cards in it and it raided them inside of a two and a half  Inches SD enclosure and you gave you 40 gigs something like that

Start time: 349.48
End time: 413.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We've come a long way, baby in fact you were telling me about a  SSD that is 60 terabytes now is that what it is Seagate showed that at flash memory summit  That's what you're here for the flash memory summit FSM. Yep. Yes FMS FMS. Yeah  Great, are you gonna go to IDF or you just came out for us Ryan's cover an IDF? Okay?  I'm going back from PC perspective. Yep. We'll talk more about that 60 gig hard drive and some other things that you learned  at FMS cool  Wow, what a great panel nice to have you all thank you all for being here you are here on you know next  To it the next what we do will be from for better or for worse  We may not have lights we may not even have electricity  But we will be at the new studio the side studio  So the way this is gonna work a week from today is I'll do the last show from our studio the radio show on  Sunday afternoon and we're all gonna board we've rented a cable car, San Francisco cable car  we're all gonna get on that including a  Camera with a live you attached and we'll make the transition over to the new studio and you can all  Join us if you're here next week, you'll be asked to carry a box

Transcript:  In growing up I knew I was an adult when I actually said no, I'm not gonna help you move  Then you know how old how old were you 40? Yeah in my 40s. I  Am an adult now. I will not help you move. So do not ask I once moved house in a shopping cart

Start time: 451.12
End time: 464.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a shopping trolley literally moved put everything I did  Actually, it was a squat but that's another  one squat to the other but you know  You want to tell us more about your early days, maybe this isn't the forum

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe if there was cocktails, you know, where should we begin? There's a lot to talk about  I'm kind of interested in this is a really abstruse subject  But this week Google let it leak that they have a new operating system. They're working on its fuchsia is  The code name and they actually posted it. It's open source. They posted the code on github of all things  Is it is it a IOT operating system?  Maybe but maybe not because it looks like it has desktop capabilities as well. It is not a Linux kernel  fuchsia is based on a  Something called the magenta kernel that's based on something you might know if you pay attention to this kind of stuff called the little  kernel  Which is I don't know if it's considered a real-time operating system. It's definitely an embedded kernel

Start time: 517.80
End time: 519.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's to really lightweight OS

Start time: 520.02
End time: 533.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Small is the idea right but it is SMP aware so you could use it with you know desktop processors  It's not it's not small in power. It's my small but mighty  Why would Google want a new operating system and what might they be using it for Greg?

Start time: 534.00
End time: 554.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think what you're seeing is this there's a broad trend across all of technology around convergence that which was separated is now converged  So this is the trend that Apple's led with iPhone you get your operating system in your hardware together  Google's doing the same thing with Chrome you get your device in the operating system is pre-installed and the years of having these  Separated is kind of passing us by you know Apple Watches

Start time: 555.96
End time: 562.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  IOT the operating systems have sort of built together, but but this sounds like the opposite it sounds like fragmentation doesn't it?

Start time: 562.06
End time: 565.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is it's it's stripping out all the stuff. You don't need so there's in a

Start time: 566.72
End time: 569.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Eventually the operating system yes, I believe it's going to be Wow

Start time: 570.02
End time: 581.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this similar in theme to kind of the windows everywhere strategy?  Microsoft is currently working on because this feels like a pan OS across all devices and form factor screen sizes  IOT up to big screens because Android is terrible on anything. It's not about this size

Start time: 581.96
End time: 606.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not OS for everywhere. So the way operating systems are kind of structured today  Is that there's a lot of functionality in the operating system?  It's not just you know running the CPU booting the hard drive getting the operating system running what we're seeing is  You know thousands of functions built into the kernel of Linux for example  And if you look at other operating systems like  Qnx these are micro kernels that have the bare minimum functionality to boot and then everything else is an application

Start time: 606.34
End time: 609.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple uses a micro kernel called mock. Yeah same idea. That's right

Start time: 610.32
End time: 614.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is not using that same structure so you said Linux is not although. It's funny

Start time: 614.96
End time: 627.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Linux started more as a modular kernel that you would plug in at what was needed, but as it's shipped today. It's got everything  Most unless you build your own kernel. It's likely that you'll have support for every possible kind of

Start time: 627.42
End time: 651.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see this the the person who's behind this has invented you know developed many kernels before the key  Developer behind it interesting. I see this is a reversion towards micro kernels  Back to real-time operating systems with all the functionality stripped out so that you're maximizing your battery power  There's no unnecessary apps and you have to build a modular packaging system on top of that  So if you want, you know printer driver support you add printer driver support

Start time: 651.16
End time: 676.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It doesn't come as a standard feature if an unsophisticated user would look at this and say oh they don't want to do Android anymore  That this would be for the phone  Because it has the feature is fact  It's got the material design interface or using something called flutter which will give them material design. It's really designed around  Using little battery as possible. It's kind of almost a real-time operating system  It feels like a phone operating system more than say a desktop computer

Start time: 676.56
End time: 690.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think everybody points the finger at Google and says this is Chrome  Why is the Chrome operating system different from the Android operating system? Right? Why don't you converge these two together?  So this would be that I?  Would speculate that what's interesting is they're putting Android on

Start time: 691.58
End time: 698.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Chrome OS. Yeah, there you can get the Android store on Chrome OS  And they're running Android in a subsystem on Chrome OS. I wonder if they're running away from Oracle

Start time: 698.68
End time: 717.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know the Oracle V java Java lawsuit versus Google and maybe they feel no more Java  Yeah, well, you know Android operating system is all built in Java and then compiled so this might be a Dalvik  It might be a  You know might be a backdoor away of saying I've got an emergency if this court case comes more than that

Start time: 717.30
End time: 753.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that they're running into for instance. I think the EU and the Russia just find them six point eight  That's like I've got to find you a penny  But the EU's been down on them because of the way they manage  Android and it's funny because in a way they're getting in trouble because Android has an open source  Arm as well as a proprietary arm app. They're not beaten up on Apple for doing you know for requiring that all iPhones have  Apple iOS on it  Yeah, they're mad at Google though because they're making some restrictions on what people who want to use Android

Start time: 754.86
End time: 766.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With Google services have to do well Android's global market share is far higher than Apple's right makes more of a difference  Right. We're very accustomed to in America to see a lot of iPhones and Andrew come on parody, but outside of this country  That's not the norm  So

Start time: 774.16
End time: 781.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But but but this would be Google's attempt to say well, okay fine  We're not gonna do an open source or we are good. I don't know maybe a read

Start time: 784.18
End time: 794.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about security I mean how many  Vulnerabilities are there in androids that we talk about every week  There's a deeply a you know massive insecurity in Android something like 40% of all Andrew finds are compromised today

Start time: 795.50
End time: 801.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that due to the slow pit cycle for most consumer handsets or is that that's more that's more the problem  Well, it's it's a fixing it

Start time: 802.16
End time: 804.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google's fixing it but they're fixing it in the you know in

Start time: 806.30
End time: 815.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Current iteration. Yeah, it's very difficult to update the Android operating system with its current architecture  You have to replace the entire operating system. If you had a microkernel you could start to modularize the

Start time: 816.36
End time: 835.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Deployment of patches interesting and say you're not I confess. Yeah, I don't know what microkernel means  It's it's a kernel but it's really small I understand that but why do I particularly care as they put in that I'm a normal consumer  Tell me why I care about anything. I got it's kind of like risk versus sysc. Yes  Well, that makes perfect sense great

Start time: 836.82
End time: 870.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when you go to what you're doing is reducing the surface of the kernel the kernel is the core of every operating system  Your Linux kernel is a fairly substantial piece of work and it's been evolved over 20 years  It has hundreds and if not thousands of functions built into it and every one of those functions has to work perfectly for it  To be stable and reliable and when you upgrade it you replace all of that code  with a microkernel what you do is pull out all the stuff into  Surrounding into pieces into modules if you will and you decouple them from the kernel  So the kernel now has the bare minimum of attack surface the least amount of code a minimal amount of functionality

Start time: 870.62
End time: 873.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to turn that answer which is beautiful into an EDM dance remix

Start time: 877.24
End time: 908.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Charm will have one before the show's over  It's interesting to read I'm reading an Android police article that because they made it open source people have access kind of poured through  The code and there's interesting things to see there for instance a permissions based or capabilities based security model  They're obviously paying attention to that. I find it interesting that they have a  Renderer in there. They're calling Escher which supports open GL or Vulkan and many of the features of  Open GL or Vulkan that's that's almost for I guess some of it could be UI  But it could be for gaming to write and be further one

Start time: 908.46
End time: 923.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're doing it more for UI I would imagine because those are more efficient like Vulkan especially as a more efficient API  Uses less battery juice also very less CPU resources in general  That's how it's able to get higher frame rates and games and whatnot  But you can flip that the other would also benefit you on the UI exactly. All right

Start time: 923.54
End time: 935.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what Apple's metal does same similar sort of thing right and because they bind the metal very closely  What reason it's called metal is because it runs directly on the silicon on the GPU direct X was kind of that idea as well

Start time: 935.20
End time: 942.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Was it not yeah kind of that there was more overhead, okay?  So it's like X 12 reduces that over also we built in support for 32 bits 64 bit arm and 64 bit

Start time: 945.70
End time: 978.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I86 mm-hmm so Intel's got a number of really good  Power efficient atoms that they're trying to drive into the market so  Intel IDF last year or the year before they were announcing us a smartphone like a prototype  That was smaller than that thinner than an Apple iPhone  So the Apple iPhone was six point one millimeters and Intel had a five point nine millimeter prototype  It hasn't really taken off because the arm processors have still advanced ahead of what Intel's doing  So I think what Google's doing here is giving Intel a chance to come back into the game and get their chips into smartphones

Start time: 978.52
End time: 1000.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  somebody has  In the chat room mentioned this maybe is somewhat what like Samsung's trying to do with their own operating system Towson  Be less dependent on Google less dependent on Android  also, by the way according to  Tavis Geiselbrecht from Google it will be available for this will be available for the Raspberry Pi 3 as well. Yep, so

Start time: 1001.72
End time: 1023.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interestingly that kind of makes sense more for the lower the lower powered computers  I wonder what this means for IOT devices and maybe you know other things along those lines like if  Android is too heavy to run on even some phones these days like  As we get smaller smaller devices maybe with IG networks and that aren't using much data speeds like we need something to run on this

Start time: 1023.48
End time: 1026.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we need we need IOT devices that run for ten years

Start time: 1026.46
End time: 1038.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, as discussed earlier, but then notably Microsoft and Google than are working on this problem  But Apple probably isn't or as I haven't heard any Romans. They're building out a similar microkernel. Do you your definition? They already run a  I'm just so wrong. It's even funny

Start time: 1039.22
End time: 1040.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Always 10 was a microkernel from  I

Start time: 1045.74
End time: 1054.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mean it's a pretty old microkernel it is but at all Apple keeps to continues to iterate and because they sell the phone and  The operating system together they've iterated the kernel substantially

Start time: 1054.56
End time: 1060.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact iOS and watch OS probably run on mock as well, right? I don't know about watch OS

Start time: 1060.36
End time: 1080.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not too sure but their their ability to design the CPU to take advantage of the kernel and the apps and to squeeze out  Power and you know all those types of features show you the power of a microkernel and also the ability of an Apple phone to download its  patches reliably  Whereas you know download updating your Android isn't necessarily a foolproof game

Start time: 1080.88
End time: 1104.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah  but that also  Has as much doesn't it have as much to do with the economics of it the fact that Apple is the only manufacturer of the iPhone and  They've strong-armed at least in the US. They've strong-armed the carriers to say you're gonna push our updates the minute  Available I mean Google Apple used to push big updates that were much of the operating system  They're now down to these data updates. Yeah, it took them a while to get there. It's only very reliable

Start time: 1105.18
End time: 1110.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They still hear people complaining that they'd updated their Android and it crashed and burned Oh never hear that on the Apple

Start time: 1113.36
End time: 1122.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it it's a little more convenient now to you like you can say download the update and tonight in the middle of the night  Install this one and it's nice  It was a really big problem

Start time: 1122.22
End time: 1126.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'd hear that the websites complaining that Apple's blowing it and Steve Jobs would never have stood for it

Start time: 1127.62
End time: 1132.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait, we hear that all the time. Maybe you don't hear that in the UK. We hear that all the time

Start time: 1132.82
End time: 1151.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also wonder like is this trying to fix some of the original problems in Android, right? You were talking about you know  Being so reliant on Java  But also the idea that I don't know maybe they didn't expect Android to get as big as it did and now it's everywhere  It's like oh my god, this this is the wrong engine for what we're trying to do right now. They didn't plan this obviously

Start time: 1151.14
End time: 1185.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's pretty clear that this they had no idea what was gonna happen, right?  You know, I it's funny because one of the reason I'm fascinated by this is because we had this conversation some months ago  Where is the next operating system coming from and I think my conclusion?  I think our conclusion in general was who cares?  It's not about it's no longer about the operating system isn't as the cloud meant at this point  We're operating system agnostic all our data all our even some of many of our programs  Oh, that's my phone talking just ignore that  My daughter calls right in the middle of twit every every week

Start time: 1186.74
End time: 1197.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. If you're a kid and don't your parents actually answer the phone, but save calls. Yeah  Sorry to blow up her spot, but that come on we've all tried that one

Start time: 1207.28
End time: 1221.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that you're right. Although most people in the cloud  I think there was some a statistical survey showing that 70% of people running Ubuntu in the cloud 70%  Yeah, so if you're on AWS or Rackspace, you're probably running Ubuntu and then Ubuntu Linux

Start time: 1221.80
End time: 1247.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, but I'm like I'll give you this one long time ago link and the right is Linux  The Chromebook is Linux. Look at well the Chromebooks are selling all of a sudden. They're huge  In fact a great article in Wired magazine this week from a writer who said to students your next  Laptop for going to college should not be Windows or Mac. It should be a Chromebook and I kind of agree with him  He says especially in light of the fact that the Android Play Store is coming to Chromebooks

Start time: 1322.36
End time: 1343.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's easy to see why Chromebooks have taken off in schools just like that because I  Used to work in IT for a very long time and the sort of idea of having a cheap disposable  Laptop that you can set up real easily if it breaks no big deal  That's great for institutional purposes for a student for something that they're gonna bring and rely on for their entire school life  You want something a little more expandable?

Okay, what you change your password?  Oh, yeah change it all the time. I encourage her to change to two-factor. She wasn't using two-factor  I said make sure you disconnect all your connected apps. I thought maybe some app is posting on her behalf  She said I did. Yep. I said you've checked all your browser  plugins make sure no  Are you what browser she's on a Mac using Chrome?  Yeah, she checked almost every box. She did she checked every box. Yep. You were listening  I was and it took me a while. In fact, we did this off the air  Finally found out she had a man in the middle attack going but not from a bad guy but from her  Antivirus she was running a vast antivirus and it installed an advanced certificate and I asked her to look at those Facebook  Certificate and it was going through a vast. Yeah now my theory and I we never I can't confirm it  I can't see the computer is that it wasn't a vast doing this obviously but the device had somehow been hacked and somebody

It's a 24 billion dollar market so by buying the endpoint  They can now take that ad tech data and unify the users as it comes across the network and get better targeting. That's why  Verizon's out there buying up all these content properties not because they're in here because they've got better ad tech  Yeah, and they can drive higher users. It's not about the content. It's not about the companies  It's just about displaying it

So Comcast bought NBC Universal  They became a content company smart pipes smart pipes. Yes  And in fact you see this horrible conflict of interest in the Olympics  Where you don't get you know, you're not experiencing this in the UK  But here in the United States because NBC owns the rights of the Olympics and Comcast owns NBC  it is a terrible nexus I think of  Dist of content plus distribution we broke up the movie theaters used to own all the movie companies and we broke that up years ago

Transcript:  Because it was so that has to change like for example  So I'm here from the UK and in the UK. My cell phone has an unlimited plan  so that means 24 hours a day seven days a week I can draw data all the way down and  What I'm now doing I can now take that phone over here and I get unlimited data when I'm here  So I don't pay roaming charges. It's just part of the plan. The company just gave and sorcery is this

Transcript:  So the company in the UK three and basically has a deal with three for Google five  Do you know how much it costs to collect the accounting data to do that?  It's a huge sums hundreds of millions of dollars in accounting systems and interconnect because they don't they don't probably there's an impedance mismatch  Yeah, you you have to get the data records from so when I was working for a large mobile phone carrier  Inside information  Yeah  we used to have to set these massive pipes for the accounting data to change and we used to interchange and what used to happen was  we'd count all of the calls that Verizon phones were on our network and then  They would count all the minutes that were on ours and when there was a discrepancy we had to reconcile them and then somebody paid  Each other do you know how much it cost like tens of millions of dollars and I think that's what data roaming is so expensive  Yes, the actual cost of it is nothing because the internet traffic doesn't get back all back to the UK and then go out of the  It just routes out internet Verizon has all those internet exchange points. It's the account zero  It's just straight-out arbitrage if I charge you $10 to join twit and then you charge me $10 paid me $10 to appear here  Who's winning? Right?  Right, right, and that's exactly what they're doing, right?  It's a straight-out arbitrage deal and what threes basically what I suspect this is speculation  Is they're just saying why am I spending all this money on accounting?  Why don't I just call it squids and just say whenever you're in these countries?  It's just whatever you'll play Google Fi

That's probably not the best  Yeah, but it's I mean they're not doing it right either right right so it's hard to do  It's if you're gonna point the finger at Apple you got to point the figure  Google Amazon's got a sinking  Volume Drive sinking engine and nobody uses that for the same reasons it works pretty bad

It's not just like the scale and the resource and everything  It's like oh like let's just get into Maps and that was a disaster  And then we heard this week what that the Maps fiasco led to the public testing for Iowa  Eddie Q said that in a and that makes a lot of single a devoid of any information except for that

Transcript:  I mean I've built infrastructures like what Apple's doing with iCloud and it's not easy and Apple made some mistakes in the early days  They bought off the shelf from existing vendors  They bought teramark for storage. We're using Azure as far as I know and they're still using they use all different cloud services  a lot of the iCloud photos is done off Google at the moment and  Some stuff comes off Azure and a lot of stuff comes off Amazon in addition to what they're using and the challenge is that they can't  Scale up fast enough. They can't build data centers fast enough

Start time: 3301.26

Start time: 3305.46

Start time: 3319.82
End time: 3347.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then what they did was to keep moving at speed because Apple was moving quite quickly a few years ago  They were outsourcing the tech they were going and buying it from other people and letting those suppliers  you know like integrators come and provide those services and  Those companies didn't do a very good job because they couldn't do it at scale  Apple's now turned it around and started developing all of that infrastructure themselves in the same way that  Google Amazon and Facebook do and they're starting to get  Reap the rewards of that who does it best in your opinion is it Amazon?

Transcript:  I don't know how much jet had in terms of mobile experience  But you know Walmart for if we're places that have Walmart's you know  Anybody who needs to go the store they say I'm gonna go to Walmart because that's the place you go to get stuff  Now you're buying stuff online you go to Amazon because that's the only place most people go unless you want like specialized hardware or something  So if Amazon wants to compete on that level, yeah  They need better infrastructure. This is a classic challenge

Transcript:  A chance so that's my question. What is the chance that Walmart actually pulls off a reasonable Amazon competitor?  Not number one, but actually a viable long-term brand that people use after the jet acquisition

Start time: 3462.36
End time: 3475.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think it's that likely not to be negative, but how loyal are people to Amazon if you suddenly found a good experience  That offered a good price  Wouldn't you be willing to shift? I don't I don't think I'd have a problem buying from another store, right?

Start time: 3475.22
End time: 3482.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think they'll pull off that level of service. They have to do that  I don't think they'll be the threshold required. I don't really like Amazon that much I use it's it works, right?

Start time: 3482.94
End time: 3493.86

Transcript:  There's no other Amazon. Well, also we're bought into it. We gave him a hundred bucks. So we'd have Amazon Prime, right?  We've kind of committed to it  And I think there's the perception still that Amazon has the lowest prices, which I think is fat

Start time: 3494.00
End time: 3507.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact not true something like sometimes I do it's more about guarantee of service to like if I mean  I know I need this cable or something tomorrow or even today right Amazon has no options  I know I can trust Amazon to get me that that's actually the big selling point

Start time: 3507.74
End time: 3514.78

Transcript:  Well, so is well that one dark but so is Walmart in a lot of ways  I mean they piloted using satellites to track trucks. Oh, yeah  They have RFID and in all their products and I mean, they're very smart about Walmart squeezes money out of their supply chain very efficiently  Which is how they have profit margins, right? It's a more power tone  Yeah, I am holding a lot less stock now

Start time: 3533.22
End time: 3576.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they've moved away from holding stock and they're much more about just selling the goods  so  Amazon doesn't want to keep building its stores  What it wants to do is be a platform so that when you go to shop you pay your hundred dollars a year  And that's what they make the money  They don't actually want to make a profit on selling the goods as much as they want that hundred dollars a year out of your pocket  That's why they give away movies give away Kindle books basically as part of the package  Because if you could get a billion people paying you a hundred dollars a year to use my platform  What have I just done?  Created a hundred billion dollar recurring revenue stream  Now if I don't have to run the warehouses and don't have to pay for the stock in the warehouses the people who manufacture the gods  Put the stock in my warehouses or maybe ship it directly  But using my distribution system then all of a sudden my mechanics are I'm making a hundred billion dollars for what?

Yeah  All right, let's take a break I do want to talk about a lot of other things you guys I think you're doing such a good  Job, you should pick the stories you want to come back with so that's your assignment while I  While I the rest of us will talk about audible calm and if you want to talk about audible you can too  But it is very distracting whenever I talk about audible. We all end up talking about our favorite audiobooks. I spend so much time  Listening to books on audible calm. I've been an audible subscriber long before they became an advertiser  Although they have been the longest advertiser. I think one of the longest advertisers on  Twitter for almost ten years. I think eight years something like that. I've been an audible subscriber for sixteen years  hundreds of books I  Love audible and I think you will too. It is the world's largest audio bookstore a quarter of a million  titles and not just novels, but but  fiction nonfiction  college courses  everything you would want to listen to  audible calm if you go to audible calm slash twit to we're gonna set you up with a  Platinum plan. This is free for the first month  It'll give you two books or two credits some books are some of the really long books a few you know  One-tenth of one percent are long enough so that they're two credits, but you'll get to use those two credits towards any book or books you want  You'll also get the Daily Digest or the Wall Street Journal  Or the New York Times yours to pick every single day  And then after a month you have to make the decision do I keep going or not?  But if you decide to cancel you'll have paid nothing those two books will be yours to keep forever  It's a great way to try something. I know maybe some of you are going  Do I want to listen to audiobooks? What will it be like trust me? I love them  I'm as you can tell an audible fanatic listen all the time  I'm getting my son to listen to every time about Henry earlier my college kid son  He I say you he says I want to learn I say you got to read  So I got to get sleepy I read and he said listen to audible and he really loves audiobooks now  He's listened to a lot of audiobooks go to audible.com slash  twit to and  Pick a book or two  You'll get them for free for the first 30 days  Enjoy it and let me know what you think. I think you're gonna become an audible fanatic audible.com  slash twit to if you are  If you're a New York Times subscriber, you probably got the Underground Railroad last week  It came in the Sunday Times a fairly long excerpt. It was kind of a neat deal  It's maybe because it's the return of the Oprah book club. It's your first book pick in some time  Brand-new book by Colson Whitehead. That's also an audible  So if you read the New York Times excerpt and you want to read more you could buy the book, but you'll get every word  brought to life  That's the best thing about audiobooks at audible.com and this could be yours for you the Underground Railroad  audible.com slash twit to try it today  We're talking about the week's tech news Alan Malvantano is here you were here for the what is it FMS flash memory summit

Start time: 3818.34
End time: 3845.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what is that?  So it used to be  Two three years ago and before that anything had to do with solid-state drives  Developments was typically announced at the Consumer Electronic Show  right in January right in Vegas and  Over the past few years that that whole storage subsection like flash memory related or anything solid-state storage related  Has kind of shifted to what's called the flash memory summit, which is actually down here

Start time: 3847.02
End time: 3873.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  At the Convention Center, so because this was because IBM's  Facility in the South Bay wasn't that where they were doing their SSD they're very  Famous developing the way early stuff. Yeah, and then Intel of course was it was the leader in SSDs for also makes sense  Silicon Valley would be kind of where you would want to that's where a lot of the development is a lot of the always is  Samsung now kind of the leader in SSDs at this and they fly right over here

Start time: 3873.30
End time: 3889.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They just come on they do keynotes. Yeah, and Samsung frequently has their own what they just call an SSD summit  And they do that in Seoul right and they like I've probably been out there four or five times by now to cover  You know announcements from them, but they also do announcements at the flash memory summit here

Start time: 3889.92
End time: 3912.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's funny because in the early days of flash you had the whole chart  There were all sorts of questions as the decoder the SSD decoder was very complicated  I gave up what firmware well gave up there were too many SSDs  But also I think what's happened is they've become commoditized now and and now the main brands are all pretty good  I would guess no no  There are really there are significant differences there are

Start time: 3913.88
End time: 3980.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I ended up having to develop new testing just to show those differences. What are the difference speed reliability?  What are the you'll end up running into it most of it boils down to the flash itself is typically fine  It's just how the manufacturers implement their firmware right so it's still that  It's all about managing how the flash is written to because it's kind of like a musical chair problem  You know you things like wear leveling and yeah, you have to do wear leveling you can't write very small random  To it continuously because it likes being written in large or erased in large chunks relative of large chunks like flash for me  Like the analogy I usually use is like a bunch of little CD  RWs right remember a CD RW if you wanted to if you filled it and you wanted to erase a file  Or overwrite a file you had to basically copy the whole thing off right the whole disk right start over right flash has to do  That in like six megabyte chunks. Oh, so you can't just do very small random writes to it continuously  There's you know so there's a lot of behind-the-scenes  Jogging and juggling around of data that happens that you are completely unaware of it just all happens like there's an SSD in that system

Start time: 3980.48
End time: 3984.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's doing that right now. That's why we have SSDs with eight gigabytes of DRAM on board sure

Start time: 3984.86
End time: 3988.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just so they can swap this eight megs eight gigs out so they have cash

Start time: 3989.12
End time: 4000.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they actually here the DRAM actually acts as a multi-tier cache inside the SSD  It also gives them read write space so that you can actually  Juggle it and hold it before you write it down and that DRAM is actually battery-backed

Start time: 4000.56
End time: 4009.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So if the drive depowers all the memories is also part of the problem the fact that operating systems  Don't know about they still think in terms of cylinders and sectors and and all of this stuff

Start time: 4009.42
End time: 4020.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's it's it's all obfuscated now  It's all it's just a sector number that you're writing to and that's that's the OS is no longer are the problem  That's not really the problem especially with NVMe and newer technologies. They're just designed for

Start time: 4021.20
End time: 4028.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NvMe is very exciting so it does away with the whole SATA  SCSI you know blocks and sectors it starts to say I want to pull a block of data

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's an address

Start time: 4030.02
End time: 4058.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you remember the old SCSI protocol which is basically fetch this block right and you see really fetch block after block  NvMe says I need this data blob and the drive and just give it to me  So they remove all of the SCSI. You worry about where it is. Yeah in some way the intelligence has moved now into the drive  Right, it's in both. It's in both  Yeah, so NVMe simplifies the protocol between the operating system and the drive fetch and then the drive itself designs  It wants to do its own housekeeping, but what you know Alex we should probably talk about 3d NAND and what's gonna

Start time: 4058.40
End time: 4063.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually the real innovation. They make some announcements at FMS about that Samsung did okay?

Start time: 4064.12
End time: 4077.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they've Samsung's been iterating on their 3d NAND 3d vNAND since it came out a few years ago  And there was actually 24 layer vNAND which was version 1 but nobody saw it in any consumer parts  It was just kind of a try. Okay, you're gonna have to explain to me is this like

Start time: 4078.54
End time: 4086.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  ram ram or  Stacked ram and 24 layers of it. What does that mean? Okay? So there's different ways of stacking things

Start time: 4086.90
End time: 4107.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was actually somebody tweeted at me earlier today, and they were kind of confused on like okay  What does this mean does this mean I'm putting 64 dies stacked on top of each other within the package? Yeah  No, this is actually within a single die within a single die 64 now  Announced at the show 64 layers worth of cells that are each storing charge to store data

Start time: 4107.94
End time: 4111.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, okay does that mean it's denser yes, okay?

Start time: 4111.62
End time: 4118.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you're able to go vertical that reduces some of the limitations of what used to be the issue actually if you scroll down

Start time: 4118.88
End time: 4121.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A little bit and how do you address this is it addressed in XYZ?

Start time: 4123.14
End time: 4178.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's it's still the similar kind of addressing. It's it's sort of like an X&Y like a row and a column kind of a thing  But now you've got depth. So what do you it's just it's obvious. It's just a big. It's big row  You don't you don't yeah, you don't you don't address like a specific height  But there's actually a cutaway if you scroll down a little more on the page of what that stuff looks like I think  Or no they already passed it was further up anyway  So you can actually see into the die yeah, there's a cross-section  So that's a cross-section of I think 48 layer  When that came out the guys at tech insights always like cut dies in half and do electron microscope stuff and look at it, right?  so what you're looking at is just rows worth of  Array man cells, okay  And so in this case that Samsung frequently runs that in TLC mode  So each one of those little squares right is holding three bits of data

Start time: 4178.50
End time: 4184.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, all right, and then you multiply that out and you end up with so what this means is we're gonna get more capacity in the same

Start time: 4184.66
End time: 4200.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Space yes and along those that same exact vein last year at flash memory summit. We saw  A  16 gigabyte two and a half inch form factor SSD for enterprise from Samsung and then this year they showed that same exact product

Start time: 4201.70
End time: 4208.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry, I just ignore that  I don't know why my phone is talking to me, so we saw that same exact product

Start time: 4209.86
End time: 4220.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It almost looked like nothing had changed at all  However, they had now the double capacity per die of this new 64 layer flash inside that drive  So they were able to double the capacity of that SSD

Start time: 4220.30
End time: 4222.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ssd two and a half two and a half two and a half. How much is that?  It's old in Samsung's case 32 terabytes now 32 terabytes. Sorry  I if I said to get your bites before but it was 30 to the terabyte was 16 terabytes last year  That's a big number this year. Yeah, big number for a two and a half in the same size as my 950 Evo now  No, no, no. No. Oh, it's a little well 850 Evo, but it's a little thicker little thicker. Yeah

End time: 4282.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Quantax yet at the show and keep it about this memory is that it's permanent  Yeah, so unlike flash which is you write it and then you have permanent. Well, it is but  Speed is a hundred times faster than SSDs  Yeah, so now it actually replaces DRAM and you can start to read and write directly from your hard drive

Start time: 4282.72
End time: 4288.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is the stuff called crosspoint crosspoint 3d crosspoint 3d crosspoint. Well, aren't I reading right directly from a hard drive right now?

Transcript:  Today you have an iPhone has a CPU your smartphone has a CPU it has DRAM and it has SSD  Yeah, I understand DRAM and then store  Memory and storage. What if I could replace my DRAM with a permanent storage?  So it's as fast as DRAM. It's about ten times slower than DRAM a hundred times slower than DRAM  But thousand times faster than an SSD. So so that's where that's where it's gonna be treated as as as DRAM or just really fast storage

Start time: 4318.98
End time: 4321.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's what we don't know. This is where my kernels come in

Start time: 4322.50
End time: 4329.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're on the ground for this as far as it's a new type of memory if this stuff came out 15 or 20 years ago  That laptop would be architected completely differently than it was right now

Start time: 4329.98
End time: 4334.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I could tell but I mean one thing one way you could sell it is you're gonna have ten times faster hard drives

Start time: 4335.06
End time: 4344.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually that's what we saw at the show  Micron showed a prototype and they actually showed some results some actual test results of but don't we but the problem is we're connecting our

Start time: 4344.60
End time: 4356.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hard drives via buses that are saturated as it is think about it with yes think about it with IOT  You're talking 50 billion devices in IOT by 2020 and they don't have to be as fast as DRAM

Start time: 4356.84
End time: 4376.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so you could have so why would you have DRAM and  Why not just have something that's permanent storage but closer to the speed of DRAM and then it clocks out now think about the savings  in battery power if you've got a  500 gigabyte  NVDM 3d crosspoint cross point stuff  Then you don't have a hard drive. You don't have DRAM. You've just got a CPU

Start time: 4377.34
End time: 4389.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it sounds like the PC architecture is about to change dramatic. Yes to take advantage of this it would have to yeah  So it's out now or its Intel plan basically everything you just bought is obsolete well, it's gonna hit enterprise

Transcript:  It's gonna sit between NAND flash, which is what's in your SSD and DRAM  It's gonna sit between those two and it performs between those two. No, it's interesting

Start time: 4407.78
End time: 4420.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We always think of Moore's law as applying to computation. Yeah, but there is also a very it's not exponential probably  But there's a very fast growth rate in storage capabilities and capacity and speed. It's not just it's not just the storage capacity

Start time: 4421.04
End time: 4456.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. There's also if you start to take away DRAM like temporary RAM at high speed and low speed  Permanent storage SSDs and replace it with a single module merge it then you've actually simplified the operating system  So your power consumption drops off in order to save files anymore and then we start to use NVMe  Which is a way more efficient access protocol  So instead of fetching the data from the SSDs as blocks, which means we have to emulate the blocks in software on the drive  So now there's a CPU and 8 gigabytes of RAM on this if I can do a computer all of a sudden  I've got so I was wanting to talk to you a little bit about 5g and the upcoming changes to the network

Start time: 4456.98
End time: 4463.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 4475.86
End time: 4489.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of makes sense. Yeah, there's a convergence play going on operating systems are getting smaller the technology inside of our computers  The storage is changing which means we need new operating systems that don't rely on reading and writing to DRAM and then flushing to disk

Start time: 4489.48
End time: 4513.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What does that world look like now where we have I mean it really does facilitate the idea of the distribution of computing power  To small devices all over  Yeah, intelligent devices everywhere. So we've got machine learning now and capabilities to make these devices more autonomous more intelligent  Able to kind of operate. In fact, this really facilitates the autonomous device in some ways

Transcript:  I think the way I look at it. I'm a networking professional  So my main job is, you know, how does the network connect things together and I see what today we have most of our computers  Are personal things. Yeah, your computer talks to my computer. My talk to my server in the cloud. I talk to Facebook  That's person to person or person to machine  IOT is much more focused on business to machine or machine to machine  So today you have no sensors in this building monitoring temperature except for cooling, right?

And then also motion sensors and you had a software platform that could bring all that together and say there's been no motion in this  Room I'll turn the cooling down and turn the lights off and I'll also lock the doors because there's nobody in the building  Right you'll open the pot bay doors, too. Yeah, it's a true. And all of a sudden today we don't do  or not  And today we don't do that because linking the networks up between the cooling system and the lighting actually

So they're using a there's a one gig  They're finally replacing can bus with something. Yeah, there's a new version of Ethernet called car Ethernet  designed to run in electrically noisy environments, etc, etc  It's all been ratified and tested out and the new bus is now just Ethernet

Transcript:  That works well, they're now moving to a standard  They're moving away from 10 meg ethernet to 1 gig ethernet so you can now and then putting sensors in the tail light  So if your tail light goes out, there's actually a sensor  That not in the bowl but a separate light sensor to say your tail light is no longer lighting up soon  It'll be the ball and soon it'll be well, maybe it'll be the bulb  I'm not sure but you know, however you do it. We've got this whole sensor revolution  But what if I can start putting sensors out there that are just connecting to the 5g network and there's new 5g standards like NB  IOT that are designed to be this very low power  Literally use a CRT 0 to 3 like, you know  There's little tablet sized batteries little flat things and run for a decade run a sensor for a decade  And that's that machine to machine they're talking 50 billion devices  Maybe 10 billion of those are battery operated or 20 or 30 billion or pushing data off into the cloud  And so this is where these new memory architectures combine with the new arm CPUs these new low power  CPUs to you know Raspberry Pi is the thin edge of that wedge. What if you could  Turn those into something even smaller like like a dime or a coin sized computer that has a battery in it and then you know  Connect has a sensor built into that  So we're looking at things like silicon photonics where you can build a laser straight into the CPU die and now all of a  Sudden you've got a laser sensor built into something the size of a coin that you can just stick to the door last week

Transcript:  Yeah, I would like to talk more about 5g what it means the future of 5g how soon we're gonna have 5g  That's something a lot of people the whole show honestly  I know I think it is. Yeah the race to 5g and what do you even what do you know what even 5g means?  it was the University of Michigan and we talked to David Blau and it was a  It was this is the computer you see on a quarter  It's the size of it's smaller than the word Liberty on a quarter  It's pretty pretty remarkable

It's running it not the right time, right?  A completely different time look at the app the time was changed. So like something is just not even working there  Well, yeah, it is an interesting question

Where in the things that do work, maybe my doorbell works my hue lights work  But they don't interoperate well at all the glue that holds them together is wonky stuff. Like if this than that  We are in clearly a very primitive stage of all of this for sure how to end and as usual hardware is outpacing software  The capabilities of the hardware are rapidly what I think is you're seeing a convergence of multiple

Transcript:  Advances and you can start to plot a pathway forward and then you can then you know  People like Alex can then start to turn that into revenue predictions  How do we see that right and where does the disruption occur? So if you look at a smartphone today, it's screen  CPU DRAM SSDs. What does it look like if suddenly you take the DRAM in the SSD out and replace it with a  That's fascinating, you know with a 3d crosspoint permanent memory storage. Does that make it more efficient, right?  It might get a bit slower, but you know the power consumption what it also continues the trend really to move away from discrete CPU

Thank you our show today brought to you by square space  Square space it makes it easy to create a beautiful beautiful website that runs perfectly because  They are the hosting service and they run the software. That means they always keep it up to date  They always keep it responsive whether you need a simple cover page and they have a great cover page facility  That's how I got started with square space or your photographer who needs a portfolio or you're a blogger or even a pub  publication or an online store, it's all built in the square space  You start with their amazing templates designed not only by the best designers, but also by the best engineers  So the template is bringing to your site state-of-the-art engineering like web responsive design and e-commerce all done beautifully  Within this aesthetic that you can completely control and make your own  Every site looks great and it even if you have no skills at all  You can do it just drag and drop point and click them  But the nice thing about square space is it goes deep  So if you if you really want to get and get deep into the CSS you can they even have blank templates you can design  On there's actually a fair a very large group of developers who work with square space  That's what we used for the artisanal agency site  Lisa wanted to have a gorgeous site  We we went to square space and we and they have a directory of all the people who can do this stuff and for a  Very affordable price we were able to get a gorgeous site designed that works exactly as she wants and  So do it yourself or get somebody to do it for you. You're gonna get the website you deserve  They have new magazine styles templates would be great for starting a publication  Include all the things publications, you know make a big deal about grid style landing pages  infinite scroll  Related posts at the bottom you get to author profile pages  There's even an integrated search field in the header so your readers can get right to the content  They want right away  And of course as with all the websites all the designs on square space  Mobile comes with it. So you're so you don't have a separate mobile site. Your site looks great on any size  Screen you'll get a free custom domain if you subscribe for a year and they now have domain registrar capability over 200 TLDs  Not just dot-com and net but all of the fun TLDs so you can buy a  Domain at square space domains register it and they'll give you unlike anybody else a free  Spam free parking page. So you get a very clean  site  Ready for you until you're ready to start building and you got to try the cover page  That's how I got started then I said well, I should do a blog now  I should do portfolio by that time. I really had a great site. I'm just thrilled  Squarespace commerce every template has commerce built in they recently introduced advanced analytics for commerce allowing to you to see the traffic of visitors  In real time that's so cool to watch as people come and go you can see who abandons the checkout  Carts and where they do so you can kind of make it work better for your customers device filtering and a lot more  Anybody who's built or contributed to three or more active Squarespace websites now has access to something brand new the Squarespace circle  membership gives you advanced guys optimize support six month trial periods for new products and  Projects I should say and a lot more  Squarespace is amazing join the million Squarespace customers who are using it today  Start your free trial  Squarespace comm and the one little thing we'd ask if you decide to buy use the offer code twit you'll get 10% off  Squarespace  Dot-com make a beautiful website today with Squarespace  We're talking about the week's tech news 5g you rate you said the 5g word and I'm very intrigued  I think we all are right. We've heard this although we've been through this before remember  How disappointing why max was 4g?  What was that? What did it do did it improve things? I don't know LTE stands for long-term evolution  Is that a technology or a marketing term? So I always worry when I hear 5g  That they're trying to sell us something. It's it's pretty crazy

Start time: 5359.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean I was at a mobile world Congress this year and this is I think the first year where we started to see the  5g market kind of start to take shape Intel was talking about it  Qualcomm was there everybody had like big plans and the fascinating thing too is I brought up ymax to the Intel people, right?  That's their big mistake. What a fly. Yeah, just like how they must almost put sprint out of business, frankly, totally  So and all the Intel people are like, yeah, we're not gonna do  We're working with the standards body. I remember I mean, I remember we I think was on the screens

Start time: 5388.88
End time: 5399.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They were talking about the whole why max is gonna change everything. It's gonna bring fast internet to the rural areas  It's really gonna make a difference. I don't know what went wrong with as a technical issue a marketing issue

Start time: 5400.34
End time: 5405.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5405.26
End time: 5411.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so wasn't anything wrong with the technology person. So that's why  Intel doesn't really get to say we're not gonna do that again

Start time: 5412.28
End time: 5426.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean they I think what they're saying is we learn from our mistakes  We're not gonna be stupid and we're gonna work with partners and other companies and we're not gonna try to force our proprietary  Solution when the market is moving one way, we're gonna try to move with it. So there isn't an Intel 5g

Start time: 5427.16
End time: 5437.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, and they also learn from Qualcomm. Do you remember Qualcomm 2.5g?  Was only in America when you left America your phones didn't work. Do you remember that? I don't I mean

Start time: 5438.18
End time: 5441.06

Start time: 5441.10
End time: 5467.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember an AT&T had phones that were using 3g and if you had an AT&T  Fine, you could walk off to Europe and it would work  Yeah  but if you had a Verizon phone  What happened was Verizon was using Qualcomm technology and the challenge was that Qualcomm took a fairly high percentage in profit margins in terms  Of licensing fees associated with the technology and 3g was open and no one had to pay patent fees  And of course if you're making technology equipment guess which one you went for it. You didn't go for Qualcomm's equipment

Start time: 5468.02
End time: 5471.42

Transcript:  So what's driving 5g besides the desire not to screw it up?

Start time: 5472.42
End time: 5480.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's basically there's several different trends. So 5g isn't one thing  It's not just speed although there are some 5g standards that are focused on delivering 1gig

Start time: 5482.04
End time: 5490.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Performance are this so there is a standards body as this will have a standard. Yep  Even even the definition of LTE was fuzzy. Yes

Start time: 5491.46
End time: 5511.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The original idea behind long-term evolution was that it was going to give us a foundation for where the standards could iterate  Yeah, and again though it turns out that voice doesn't matter data does right and you can everything's dated now. Everything's dated  There's no point in having voice. Yes, that's right  So running voice over IP doesn't makes more sense than trying to run voice in a dedicated frequency

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so if you want to talk to me, I'll have a conference call with you, but  You're gonna get a fairly a fairly solid mouthful of  invective  So coming coming back to 5g so there is part of 5g which is about standard  There's parts of it which is about getting one gig to your handset kind of pointless. I suspect but you know, whatever but there are

Start time: 5639.22
End time: 5643.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Emerging standards, you know who wants one gig to your handset is all the ad tech

Start time: 5645.08
End time: 5684.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That want one gig web pages. Well, what you want with a one gig you want the clock speed to be very high  Here's why there's a secret here  If I can send data on a frequency at one gig then that frequency is then  Available for the next message. It's a it's a thing called duty cycle the faster  I can get the message across the frequency and get it off the channel then the frequency is now available  So in some sense, I want the clock speed or the bandwidth the speed part of the bandwidth to be very high  Just to keep the channel just to keep the channel open so I can multiplex more data across it  But what we're also seeing is some people are thinking about can we use 5g for mobile broadband?  So instead of using wired access for the last five G's not mobile broadband  There are

Start time: 5685.36
End time: 5693.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5694.30
End time: 5698.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So 5g is not a replacement for LTE. It's not the next generation. It's everything

Start time: 5698.94
End time: 5738.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what I'm saying. There's there's part of 5g standards, which is just balls to the wall speed  Yeah, there's a part of 5g standards, which is to be mobile broadband and widely shared amongst, you know a small thing  There's another part of 5g which includes small cells  So in in the fire in the current 3g what they wanted to be able to do is to take these little  Boxes and put them in your house  So if you had poor 3g reception in your house  you could deploy this small cell technology which would allow you to boost your signal inside of a  50 square meter 100 square meter area and  But that didn't work very well for 3g  So in 5g they're building that into the standards and now they're putting in and then there's another part of 5g  Which is to do with low power, you know, we talked about NBI OT

Start time: 5739.68
End time: 5741.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really really low bandwidth rate like kilobytes

Start time: 5741.96
End time: 5754.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and this is where the low power comes from is because it's literally on very low low data volume  It's a low speed load, but they're using 800  The old analog TV channels so the 800 megahertz 700 megahertz

Start time: 5756.44
End time: 5768.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Honestly like as much as we want the fast speeds and even mobile broadband  That's the most fascinating thing to me  Like the idea that you have this really really low power  Even if it's slow amount of data attack that's gonna be useful for all sorts of devices going forward

Start time: 5768.92
End time: 5780.64

Transcript:  She's a Harvard law professor says there is no she says it's hype. There is no 5g standard  Yeah, I to ITU has not set a standard for not to like 2018  It's like these other standards it's a marketing term at this point

Start time: 5794.56
End time: 5807.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's there's a vast amounts of money. It's a bit more than that. They are actually arguing over the standards  So there is a conversation going on right now. It's in the ITU. There is 5g  There's tens of millions of dollars being in put into it

Start time: 5808.34
End time: 5818.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Great. So our broadband today are our data rates today are gonna go to crap right there. Cop ex is down  Yes, great because they have no money way and they don't want to invest on anything  Because well, it's all gonna change in three to seven years. Yeah, so there's there's a whole bunch of competing things in here

Transcript:  That's so that's why I said 5g isn't one thing like 3g was fundamentally high speed data rates. That's it  Hsdpa was the early versions of high speed data packet access in 5g  There's a part of it which is high speed data access then there's low speed low power data access  Then there's  You know, how do we do mobile broadband high density low volume and spread it out over small areas handling small cells  Handling, you know 800 megathe the television frequency  So as the analog channels the television channels are reclaimed which can start allocating those frequencies

Then yes, potentially because that's amazing. No last mile. That's so huge  So America's got a in terms of regulatory control and infrastructure that's in place  America's heavily burdened with its coaxial cables, right?  So they the government said if you run these cables will give you a monopoly over the extracting profits from the cables  That's in the ground right so Comcast and that works so well and that's yes  Now if though if we can bypass those cables in the ground and start to deliver data volumes over  At a fiber like rate at a DSL like DSL like let's let's start there. Let's be modest  I'll take a megabit baby. Yeah a megabit per second  Then all of a sudden you're starting to you know, your universal service obligation starts to go out the door  You don't need to run copper into houses because everybody's got mobile cable  You know having coax copper in the ground means I can start to bypass government men

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  potentially we could start to  Use 5g in a inside of it's a five-year time horizon five to ten year horizon  But when you're building burying fiber into the ground, you're looking at a 20 year ROI cycle, right? Right? It doesn't come back  It doesn't like $500 a meter. Yeah, it doesn't  When you take into account trenching safety

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

So if you want to start population density still only along the coast  Yes, but there's also a government not believe the cut one of the biggest employers in the country is the National Calgary area  They don't want to subtract jobs in the US  It's the bargaining power of the telcos with you know in Washington to influence things to go their way and in Europe  It's a free-for-all. It's very much a community driven thing  So you're probably going to see the innovation come out of Europe and it will spread

They go for miles  You can you know make them really powerful or really weak and they'll go very far  But if you're transmitting if you're trying to get a gigahertz, you know like a gigabit per second  You need to be transmitting at 24 gigabits, you know  Right up at the top of the speak the spectrum 24 gigahertz. That's the bag of water right there boy  You know, yeah, so then you but that might be suitable for backhaul. So from mobile tower to mobile tower or sell to sell

Transcript:  Maybe no, I think the iPhone 6 plus the that brought it mainstream  Those are among the worst designed iPhones. I'm  There they're top-heavy in a way that isn't great and because of the way Apple's design works, right?  So I have a broken success with me right now. You broke your first phone  Now not my first one, but yeah  There's a lot of bezel right? Yeah way too much on the top and the bottom of iPhone screens  Yeah, and because you have that on the plus  There's much more space like it's a much bigger device  It needs to be right you can hold an s7 or even a note and feels a little it's smaller  Yeah, it feels smaller. So I think Apple hasn't really they didn't have a way to master that feels smaller. Yeah  I  Am not a big fan of the plus. I know a lot of people like it  I remember just trying to walk down the street and use it during my review  Just couldn't do it like and that's something I have to do a lot like check on email or type in something right apps  You have to play Pokemon go whatever Pokemon gloves important  But even if I'm at home just like reading in bed or something  That's a phone that would often just like plop right on me.

I really don't want that  That's because we'll only work with an Apple device. They won't even work with an Apple laptop, right?  Yeah, that's the irony of it. Apple's still putting and I imagine will continue put headphone jacks in their laptop

I know that's not a normal thing  This year it's like success is a great phone. I'm not gonna buy I don't think I'm gonna buy any phone that has no headphones

Start time: 6770.34
End time: 6784.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think why would you do that? Well you wouldn't but lead us point about being a flop  I think we need to keep flopping in the correct context it'll sell very well  But I don't think it'll it'll help Apple drive iPhone unit growth  So it'll be a flopping that I won't actually accelerate. Well, it's so really well. I think it'll sell as well

Yeah, nobody ever thinks about connectors as mechanicals  There's a certain pulling pressure which is supposed to pop out and if you apply torsion to it it should snap off  I think that you don't damage the phone and that's part of what's MFI

I think that the trick here is that Apple I  Think the real question here is value for money  I think Apple my perception of Apple and I'm a long time like I have an Apple watch  I have a MacBook I have a an Apple iPhone 6 and I use my classic iPod  So I do not listen to Apple music  I listen to it on a classic iPod because that's still the best medium for me. I  If Apple releases an iPhone this year, I will very seriously question whether I'll buy one not because I don't need a new one  I do because there's a hierarchical plan in my family where they get passed down  But I don't think that Apple products are good value for money anymore  Right if I'm being asked to spend 700 US dollars or 700 British pounds on an iPhone  I'm looking at that and I'm going like that's not I'm not getting that  You know back in 2007 when the first iPhone came out that was value for my that was value for money  new cameras in  You know 12  2013 they are there's real value for money in those products. This is my question

Transcript:  They're not acceptable  Specifically ad block plus makes its money by taking right  Fees right and proof that they are a suitable advertiser or a trusted advertiser  So the ad block plus does lets their ads through so if you install ad block plus you still see Google ads and  Various ad networks because they guarantee that they're putting clear that

Transcript:  Can buy your way past the end can turn off the acceptable ads policy on ad block plus, okay users  So you don't have to see those ads secondly those ads still have to adhere to the standards  Yes, that the acceptable ad standards which are set by and a larger group than just ad block plus and are used by other

Transcript:  America today say ad block plus looks for HTML tags and JavaScript tags inside of the code and  As fast as ad block plus works out the pattern matching that they need to do Facebook then iterates their web page and does a content

Start time: 8281.26
End time: 8292.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Instant deployment. I'm curious because the simplest way to defeat this was is by being a first-party ad  the reason that these ad blockers work is because they're third-party ads coming from a  source other than Facebook.com

Start time: 8294.14
End time: 8299.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  We had a guy on  yesterday on the new screensavers  Proposing a new form of ad blocking the site is our data  US  Friend of mine David Glickman who is a multi multiples serial entrepreneur  He said well, what if we did it this way?  we have an ad blocker runs under iOS with the official ad blocker checkmark and all that stuff and  instead of blocking ads  a we go to  content companies  And at and and we get let me see if I can get this right we get them to pay us and  Then we pass along the money to you. In other words you get paid for your attention  Otherwise, you don't see the ad  Because the real problem here is and I'm sure this is a problem for you. It's a problem for PC perspective  It's a problem for engadget. I doubt it's a problem for matter mark because they're made of money, but  The problem is it's so much of what we consume the content we consume is ad supported and I don't want to kill that  I think that's a great thing. You don't want paywalls all over the internet

Start time: 8389.80
End time: 8395.60

Transcript:  Yes, think about that. I think about what happens to in a country like this  Downloaded and run. Yeah, you there may be a you know, there's gotta be a way to people are working away  That's maybe yeah, but that would be a real fear think about how much but for me, it's just a speed thing  I go to websites and you know the popovers the pop-unders the blockers, you know  And I don't have time to wait for them to load  Right, it's it's it's seconds like 15 20 seconds for a page for a major media property to load

Start time: 8503.08
End time: 8509.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8510.08
End time: 8525.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So two seconds for the page load and 15 seconds for the ads killer. Yeah  I'll be a lot of that's to do because that's a live transactional market  So your data is actually extracted and then it goes into a live market  Your the impression is actually bought and sold traded on multiple auction sites before the ads actually delivered to you

End time: 8675.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Key that Microsoft now that is a little bit of a biased way to put it. Yeah, I think more  Microsoft's intent was not to keep you from running Linux  But just to make sure that you didn't have a rootkit  You didn't have a modified operating system that you were in fact running a good version of Windows  I think yeah, you could say it was anti-competitive and I think some Linux users did but I think

Start time: 8675.14
End time: 8681.34

They called it the mod scene  Yeah, people were certain things  However, if you scroll down you'll find an interesting hex block  It is apparently wonder what that is the secure key. Oh, so what is what is this being Greg Farrow?

Start time: 8745.56
End time: 8749.54

Start time: 8768.92
End time: 8776.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 8777.02
End time: 8806.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So fair enough, but what it also I think the more deeper ramification is is this shows?  That cryptography algorithms where a magic key like the golden key you mandate it always fails  Yeah, and it's not because the actual implement in this case  You would have expected Microsoft to stuff up the implementation with really crappy programming  Because that's what they've done for the last 20 years. So provably you'd expect them to repeat a bad pattern  But what they actually did was posted the code onto github or something like there was a public code repository

Start time: 8806.94
End time: 8812.80

Start time: 8820.22
End time: 8838.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was just one but once the keys got that's the problem with these keys is that they eventually they have to live  Somewhere in the clear to be usable. So even if it wasn't published on github, there would be some way to extract that  So if somebody could just what happened with make sure that Theresa May and the UK knows about this and the Republican nutjob

Then this is a perfect real-world example of why your idea of back during crypto systems with a quote secure golden key is very bad  Smarter people than me have been telling this to you for so long  It seems you have your fingers in your ears. You seriously don't understand still  Microsoft implemented a secure golden key system and the golden keys got released from Microsoft's own stupidity now  What happens if you tell everyone to make a secure golden key? I love how mean that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not even a news story. It's kind of news. What's the story?  So it's me being a storage editor and reviewing SSDs and stuff all the time  So probably the bottom link. Um, I  Made my own test a test for what to test SSDs and hard drives and stuff  So I've been using this for a few months kind of rolled it out. It's a latency percentile test  Yeah, it's called latency percentile. So how is that?  What you do is you so SSDs do a lot of things and most tests will give you the average performance  Throughout a given test, right? They'll run a test for a few minutes, right and you get a specific number, right?  What I noticed is there's a lot of SSDs out there that due to that poor firmware and from the implementation  We were talking about earlier where they kind of get hung up on themselves shuffle and stuff around  They might hang for like a second or two every so often  But the problem is if you run a test over the course of a couple of minutes and you have one or two of these  Little hangs and gets averaged out. It's averaged out. You don't notice would I notice the hang as a user?  Absolutely. So that's the cause as I'm using the computer. Yeah, you're trying to do something  You're trying to open up an app something and it just kind of sits there for a second or two because it's busy  Waiting for some some of the IOs to complete right?  So the key is that a few of these requests will just take a little bit longer than all the rest of them, right?  The only way to track that and find that is you have to look at every IO  Every single one you have to log all of them  So I test SSDs that do like upwards of like the fastest one to do almost a million IOs per second  so a second a second and I run this log that I  Do how would you log that? That's that's my secret sauce  Basically, but so what I do is

Start time: 9170.26
End time: 9173.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Where's that? So is that what that spike is for instance? Is that a pause?

Start time: 9173.50
End time: 9209.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what you're looking at there is the source data for I generate the percentile results  Okay, and those are a bunch of different items and if you scroll down a little bit  All right, so I've kind of turned that into what's called a percentile and it's showing  Okay, where is the point where all of the IOs fall on an SSD?  How long do all of them take and the things on the left there are NVMe SSDs and then look at that a little bit  A little bit closer to them on to the little bit to the right is SATA SSDs  And then there's a really old SATA SSD that's that spike down the center that gray one  Yeah, right and then the three things on the right. These are spinning drives three different RPM hard drives

Start time: 9209.56
End time: 9216.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, right. And so since that's funny, so we were buying these 10,000 RPM hard drives to get this  micro improvement

Start time: 9216.88
End time: 9225.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well if we just bought SSDs even crappy SSDs and and that's a log scale so every time you know  Yeah, your times 10 every time you go a major increment over

Start time: 9226.96
End time: 9230.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they were those 10,000 RPM drives were 10 100 times faster

Start time: 9231.40
End time: 9267.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  However, we're talking way and way faster and then when the cross point stuff comes out  It's gonna be even closer to the left edge of that access, right?  So where it comes into play is testing SSDs and finding the ones that do that kind of hang for periods of time  Not all of them do that not all of them do that. That's a that's just the example  I showed to explain the technology, but if you go to the next page  Yeah, if you go to the next page in the article like the top I gotta go down to the end yeah  And you go to the second to the bottom picture. Where are you going? Well, there's a lot of comments here

Start time: 9267.98

Transcript:  And so that's where I'm comparing the drives  And then if you scroll down to like second to the last picture  Those are reads reads tend to be pretty much equivalent across different models  But if you scroll down a little you start getting into the rights, okay  So now you see that there's an SSD there that's doing something that the other ones doing that little stair step thing that has  Significant number of IOs that are taking a very long time interesting and they're actually getting far enough over in that chart to where the  Hard drives were operating before yeah, so don't buy the Plex door  The Plex door m6e was the one that didn't do very well

End time: 9383.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 9398.18
End time: 9403.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's where it really started because people were looking for you know  Really some form factor notebooks that couldn't even fit a two and a half inch form factor drive  They wanted something more compact that was the first iteration. It was supposed to just be called next generation form factor  That's what the ngff thing which turned into m.2, right?  So initially it was just make things smaller and then they included because they were smart and forward-thinking they included PCIe into the spec for  a possibility to connect it and then Intel pushed NVMe as a  Just basically it you want all three you want m.2 and m.CIE and NVMe  Yeah, all three of those things together. Yeah are all like really small compact SSD
