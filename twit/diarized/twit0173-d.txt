Dvorak dot org slash blog hi John hello you were gonna  come but the storm has kept you from showing up here yeah I was gonna go up there I like doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's a nice little town you know it is but this is raining it's miserable out we serve you wine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we serve you cheese we entertain you with dancing and singing that we had peasants last time I  thought that was really fun coming out with torches to lead you to your car but no no the  rain stopped him didn't stop Sarah Lane though from driving all the way up here you get a new  car yet maybe get a Tesla this guy knows about that mr. Jason Calacanis hello everybody number

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  16 and has it run out of batteries yet yeah well I have a big pack of the triple A's that you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at Costco so I just change them out actually that's one of our stories is about batteries  Energizer says at CES they're gonna show a new zinc air battery that they say is gonna really  transform laptops we've seen this is nothing new I mean zinc air batteries have been around  for a while I'm not sure why they think this is worthy newsworthy but maybe it's maybe they've  made some huge breakthrough in battery technology John you know I think about that curiously I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  an article for Forbes some years back on zinc air batteries aren't they here aren't those hearing  aid batteries I know not you mentioned I don't I think you might be right I've used them I mean  I had a Timex watch yeah well you have to once you break the seal the next thing you know they  start working but they're also you can get these little packages of zinc air batteries and keep in  your car and then they hook to your cell phone and you just you want you break the seal and the air  gets in there right the battery starts to work which makes them kind of cool that's what's  interesting about them is that they you know and they also can be recycled you can you can put the  zinc through a process and then they can be reused well that's that's actually I didn't know that  that's a pretty compelling reason and it says it's actually not really as much a battery as it is a  fuel cell right by that the difference being of course is that you can take and you can reclaim  the zinc and put new zinc in and the next thing you know you have is you're up and running again  you can't really do that with a battery's work differently energy energizer says it's much thinner

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  than current batteries will allow OEMs to design smaller devices that still provide longer runtime  you know I bet they're aiming these at netbooks and things like that maybe so you know I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  skeptical it was actually a big story about Andy Grove from Intel or formerly of Intel  ex-CEO saying that Intel's big push should be in battery technology was in the way I agree I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with him that's the thing that's really likely for cars well but cars cell phones it's what's  really holding us back you know the G1 the Google phone I had to abandon it got you know I couldn't  get it through a full day the iPhone for a long time you couldn't get it through a full day that  somehow they fixed that with a firmware upgrade I'm not sure how they did that yeah my iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doesn't make it through the day that's why I use it as a backup it's no good if it doesn't make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean what's the point if it doesn't make it through the day yeah of course the one phone that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  has the worst battery performance has a CEO who doesn't believe in you know removable batteries

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's that's that's thoughtful they say no mention of how much the technology will cost since they  don't mention it Shane McGlahn writing in ours Technica says he has to assume the battery is  gonna cost more I think a safe assumption zinc is selling for 50 cents a pound actually zinc

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  air technology is pretty cheap I would think it would be cheap it's certainly cheaper than lithium

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but are these disposable or do you just keep you refuel them as like a fuel seller well I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know I mean that's the question we don't know how this thing works I mean can you swap the  ink out it just it's mystifying I think this is you know every year these guys is one company or  another announced some new battery thing at CES and you go there and there's nothing to it it never

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  goes anywhere it's like the TV sets that they announce although this year Canon will in fact  bring an SED set that lawsuit is over applied nanotech which claimed they owned the SED patent  dropped that lost the lawsuit in July dropped appeals just a couple of weeks ago Toshiba which  was their partners dropped out of it so now Canon owns and he's been really skeptical about SED I  know John yep owns the outright SED technology so they in theory could make SED sets and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say they're gonna show much CES I'm sure they will big deal you know the thing about the battery  power is we we don't really appreciate how much batteries have gotten better because the laptops  and the phones have you know they draw more power and just to keep up with the with the laptop you  know video chips and etc and the new peripherals you know you basically are just treading water  but I I can't figure out I've been trying to find what is the Moore's law of batteries it ain't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ain't the same as Moore's law yes I think it goes the other way yes but it seems like seven to ten

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years we can double battery wow efficiency that's a big difference yeah and so well I mean Moore's  law is 18 months I'm getting over 200 miles to charge right now so yeah but you've got probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hundreds of pounds of lithium-ion batteries in there yeah there's a lot there I mean that's a  that's a real problem because the weight reduces the range and so you can't just willy-nilly throw

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a lot of batteries in there well actually what they should do is they should have a dual battery  pack in there where I could take out half the battery pack because almost every day I drive  less than a hundred miles short trips yeah I do 30 miles a day so I either I charge the thing every  fifth or sixth day or I you know just you know whatever that's I would say I think Andy Grove's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  absolutely right battery technology and maybe increasing efficiency of solar cells would also  be another good direction to take this if you get solar power to be more efficient and efficiency is  really the issue the amount of energy converted into power I think it's like five percent if you  double it or triple it which is still not a whole lot that would make a big difference and you could  put solar panels on the roof of the car and it could charge as it goes things like that yeah the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  solar panels on the roof of the car is kind of a myth it's not enough it's nowhere near enough like  what people actually are using it for is to maybe run the air conditioner you know and secondary  services like that it just would never charge the car right right way too slow didn't they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ARPA challenge had a solar car didn't it but they but it goes like two miles an hour I mean yeah it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like one of those things like set it in the desert and you know like a week later it's gonna go like  it gets you there what's your hurry actually there's a I got some inside information there  a couple of the owners of Tesla were I have a mailing list of all the owners and we're talking  about putting charging stations between San Francisco and LA and mammoth and you know whatever  Vegas and so we started talking and it seems like the company's actually going to put these high  speed chargers out they have chargers now that can charge the entire battery pack in an under an  hour so you stop for lunch plug it in and they're gonna make them free to start and then you pay  like whatever two dollars to plug it in down the road but it's costing two dollars to charge my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's pretty cool for 200 miles that's pretty cool like yeah I haven't been to a gas station  six weeks that's right this was not a big news week I'm sorry to say so I think a lot of what  we're gonna do since it is our last show of the year is talk about the year gone by but you had  you brought a couple of stories to the table Jason relevant in fact a little bit to to your  own business Google this is a shocker now consider the source it comes from the registered you think  this is a Andrew Laurelowski is not the most reliable no he's very reliable is he he just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  he snide I think is what the I mean he's nasty but he's not he's not he doesn't make mistakes well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he makes a very good point if this is accurate he says Google this week admitted that its staff  will pick and choose what appears in its search results he says it's an historic statement he  says it's a historic statement but I know his British roots would like him to say it's an  historic statement and no one has yet grasped its significance I thought the whole idea Google was  that humans didn't get involved how is this what Google's been doing all along which is human  tuning of the results or is this actually Google picking results Jason do you know more about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know about a Google program called search quality where they have people look at results  and say if this web page that came up in a result is clearly spam good content or somewhere in  between like it's like a triple flag you know so it just sort of takes out some bad stuff but they  don't have a large-scale effort at least not a public one but Marissa has been warming up to  obviously the concept of humans being involved in search since they've launched the search wiki thing  which was really that's not Google staff that's us that's us and then I think what they're saying  is you know this is during a Mike Arrington interview at the web but at the web she says

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that editorial judges will play a key role in Google searches that's just historic I mean  Arrington says Meyer also talked about Google's use of user data created by actions on wiki search  to improve search results on Google in general for now that data is not being used to change overall  search results she said but in the future it's likely Google will use the data to at least make  obvious changes an example is if thousands of people were to knock a search result off a search

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  page they'd be likely to make a change yeah basically Google's moved to the center now they  were saying absolutely no to humans now they're saying humans plus algorithms I've been saying  from the beginning humans plus algorithms but well Mahalo is all human yeah but it's not it's not  exactly a search but we default back to Google but we've got some things we're gonna show in  the next couple of months that have a little more algorithm to them I guess part of the issue is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's easy to say machines are gonna do it all but then people game the machines and you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  problem voting is the worst proxy voting is the worst proxy yeah well you know there's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thing here it's overlooked is that Google has not been delivering really I mean talking about the  batteries improving I don't see any evidence that Google's improving getting worse worse the  search results are getting worse and one of the problems that they always irks me the most is why  am I going to Google in fact this was pointed on a pointed out on the last cranky geeks by Cade Metz  you go to Google and you you put in some search term and then you get back a bunch of Parker sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know these that used to be a big problem it's not so much a problem anymore I'm still getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  them all the time and then Cade Metz brings up the point that Google makes money on those Parker  sites and so why would they discourage it because it hurts their larger business interest here no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but it's their larger interest is in them he says his assertions they make money because of ads sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on ads on there but really they're large something through that Leo a lot of the a lot of their  revenue comes from when he's called landing sites right some people estimate 20% yeah but it hurts  their overall business it's not worth it how so I mean if you go because if their search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  aren't as good I don't see people flocking away from Google exactly exactly and if you know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's only three out of the ten results are bad yeah you're gonna find what you want eventually  but if you had a perfectly efficient search engine the problem is the ads would never get clicked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well all right I'm gonna search for turpentine that's a good point I'm gonna search for turpentine  on Google first result is Wikipedia second result is OSHA gov third result is answers.com I'm going  down dictionary wildlife refuge I haven't found a single a single link farm yet give me another

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  word click on each one of those things you know I've seen a lot of them come it looks like a real  good site you click on a boom apparently type in Paris hotels Paris hotels all right that would be  a better one because not that's all link sites you're not even find anything decent there yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here's the first link is to Paris hotels.com which seems like a sensible no it's a it's just a link  farm it's a Paris Las Vegas which is real Paris Las Vegas which is real hotels in Paris at booking  comm which is real GTA hotels that's a real booking site Paris Las Vegas Expedia hotels.com  trip advisor maybe I'm using some different version of Google well I have like France-hotel-guide

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is a spam site hotel-paris.com even the Paris hotels.com the insiders guide to Paris since  1996 looks like a real site it's that's not I mean what you have to realize is what's missing  from here where where is like the New York Times travel section would they have a lot of well if  you want that you write Paris hotels reviews yes but there the question is are there better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm gonna write that in and see what I get I am not seeing one farming site on here. Where is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fodors, Frommers, Lonely Planet, Concierge, New York Times and the official tourism site they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not listed there no because I think but I think Google made the right choice which is it shows  bookings in Paris hotels if I write Paris hotels reviews what did you get John? not well this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  trip advisor which is right here's one check this out I don't know what you think but if you go down  if you look Paris reviews you get some ads and you get you get the trip advisor which is very  legit. It's sort of travellibrary.com that looks legit but when you click on it it's a Parker site  only it happens to be one of the more new the newer styles it looks like a real site but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not. I don't see travellibrary.com. Yeah I'm looking at it now in Paris. Are you signed in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm signed in. You were never gonna get the same results if you're signed in. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anyway so sign in folks create a Google account and sign in and you'll get good results. No no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you'll get bad results that way too but you won't get the exact same bad results that I'm not signed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in an I'm seen travel library. All right I'm signing out right now. Although but you know if  you want to review about a Paris hotel from New York Times I mean the first thing I would do is  type in Paris hotels MIT and that's the first thing that comes up. Exactly or Fodors or yeah  exactly. You know just that's you know your search terms are actually. I hate to be the one that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in total agreement with Jason on this deal. Well it is the holiday season. The question is you know  it's sort of like pollution like 20% pollution you may not notice you know and you may be able  to find stuff so you've hacked around it but you know if you see a page that has absolutely no spam  on it it looks a lot better trust me we make them every day. All right there I'm seeing travel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  library now it's what why would you why would logging in or logging out make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Makes a huge difference and it makes the biggest difference it makes is when you're you and like  you and me and we're both trying to find something together and one person's logged in or one person  isn't and you know you say well the third one down is this no it's not the third one down is  this it's really confusing and in my experience I get worse results actually being logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say though travel library.com is the only bad result I got here's the New York Times  result not not not at the top of the page but at the bottom of the page looking for Paris hotel  reviews I get the New York Times reviews I don't I here's here's an idea it used to be terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  three or four years ago I'll grant you go to go to mahalo.com slash Paris underscore hotels.  Well that's a human of course and yeah then look at what it could be and then when you see what it  could be then you start saying oh okay this could be better if you had content on the page and humans  and that's you know if the top one third was selected by humans you'd get rid of all the spam  problem so but but but then you'd have judgment involved yeah but you can hire people with a  neutral point of view so like our top set yeah that's worked real well for American journalism  photos fromers lonely planet concierge those are really good content sites if you're looking for  Paris hotels that's the best place to go and those three don't even come up in Google's results if  you type Paris hotels you should get photos fromers and lonely planet you're getting mostly booking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it what you mostly get when you type in Paris hotels even though maybe there's not as many  parker sites as there could be well let's try all right as you get a lot of these booking sites  which are kind of parker sites in a new they're a little more advanced I remember talking to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sergey Brin and one of the things he said and this was years ago is I mean look even years ago  this is when you still could talk to Sergey he said what I do is I every day I go down  somewhere I look at the end of the internet I look at the last of the results and he uses he  would look at what the last results were and he was able to tune the algorithm every day he'd be  tuning the algorithm based on that that's a form of humor intervention that that makes sense  it's but it's but it's not human editorial input I get very nervous when human I guess I guess  I could trust somebody to go through and say these are parker sites but otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it gets tricky you know you you trust humans to help you with picking a movie  or picking a restaurant right yeah I'm not saying that but you like Pandora I mean yeah  humans you know so humans are good for some things but but what if there's a Yelp page for Paris

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hotels that would be actually good too but do you trust Yelp isn't there aren't there people in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there gaming Yelp yeah no but you know you but you can kind of deconstruct Yelp in such a way  that is it's that is very valuable as a site I love Yelp I read Yelp reviews for fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yelp people are like because it started in San Francisco where people are a little bit crazy  they you know like at least in terms of like I'm the customer crazy like this sense of entitlement  like people are going into restaurants and like when they don't get their water filled I was  at a restaurant recently the woman was like I'm going to put this in Yelp she was like I'm putting  this on Yelp and this is ridiculous and she's like her friend goes out with a Yelp t-shirt on  when they go out to eat I just show that the person knows but you know who's serving them like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know but hotels.com has a whole television campaign based on that which is actually a very  funny campaign you've seen it where they where the guy goes to the hotel and then they like spray paint  the tan on him or they're giving him extra special service they gave him you know they spray they hit  the tan on and they give him a six pack so that he'll give them a good review on hotels.com which  if you ask me is probably promoting the wrong side of the business but I agree with that by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's the problem I have with Yelp if there is a problem is that is the enormity there the huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number of vegans or vegans they're not vegans that's from a that's from a constellation far  away. The number of vegans that are on that site is at least 70 percent. Sarah's almost a vegan. I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not even a vegetarian I'm a pescatarian like a lot of other people in the world. What's a  pescatarian? It means I eat fish. She's a Pisces. I'm having some mahi mahi tonight. Yum I think I'm  gonna have sushi when I get back to the city. Are you gonna sear that mahi mahi? Probably it's the best way to cook it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coat it in a sesame seed crust perhaps a little teriyaki ginger. You're not basting your meat tonight.  I usually baste my meat later in the evening. Well I'll give you a chance to baste it right now  what do you say we're gonna come back hey uh hello hello I like to baste my meat in the morning  we're gonna take a break come back and talk more about the news and then look back at the big stories  of the year and and kind of I think it's always fun to do that and see in retrospect for instance  in January of this year at CES Comcast announced in 2008 we will offer 100 megabit service  well yeah thank you Comcast I can't wait for that but we'll talk about that in just a little bit  right now I do want to mention our good friends at GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting.com  slash twit if you've ever used GoToMeeting you know what I'm talking about if you haven't you  might want to give it a try GoToMeeting is the service that lets you hold a meeting online  eliminating all that painful travel all that going about from here to there hither and thither  no more flying no more driving you and and by the way it's not a conference call either because you  know how it is with conference calls people get bored GoToMeeting makes them engaging makes them  visual here's what happens you set up a meeting ahead of time or you can do it on the fly you  can say while you're on a conference call you say hey look I gotta show you this I gotta show you  like we were just doing with these search results you see I didn't believe John if he'd say if he  did GoToMeeting he'd say no no look see that's the kind of thing so he says go to GoToMeeting.com  that's the kind of thing so he says go to GoToMeeting.com here's the meeting ID I go there  I don't have the software installed or anything I just enter the meeting ID and all of a sudden I'm  seeing John's screen on my computer he could show me the website show me the powerpoint we could  collaborate together we could do training GoToMeeting.com slash twit try it right now  you get a 30-day free trial a month of service a month of unlimited online meetings absolutely free  GoToMeeting.com slash twit I'm a big fan I've been using GoToMeeting for years and I want you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to try it now I'll tell you the way I use it how do you use it well you know every time I have to  do a press tour like if I'm doing briefings you know I like to show people what we're doing but  I don't want to give them a login to the site necessarily I want to drive and walk them through  the product whatever we're launching so exactly for startup companies you just get GoToMeeting you  set them up on GoToMeeting and then put a headset on and I say hey let me just show you the five  things we're doing and then you know it saves me from having to go meet with them they like it  because they don't have to leave their office very efficient for press tours if you're doing  a press tour very cool did you go you do go to the web you know I was supposed to give a keynote  and I cancelled like a couple weeks ago because I got a new product launching tomorrow and so I  just couldn't do it and have a board meeting this week it's just are you glad now having read all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the comments that you didn't go yeah I feel I look I love Loic Lamour this guy he's a really nice  guy founder of Seismic he puts this of how many years has Loeb been going on this is the fourth  and fifth he puts his heart and soul into it and the idea is it's in Paris it's uh of course he's  French but he lives in Silicon Valley so I think the idea is to get kind of the best minds of  Silicon Valley and Europe together is that it is that kind of and all of Europe and now he's got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Asia coming it's like 1700 people go I I spoke at the first and the third and I was supposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my wife's at the top of the world top of the Eiffel Tower Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes did that too  he did it at the fourth floor restaurant I did it proper I see he knows the details he's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you don't stop at the fourth the only reason people eat at that restaurant is to jump the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  line at the Eiffel Tower that's isn't that uh isn't that restaurant on the second floor and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's called the second floor the second stage somebody's gonna go on Wikipedia now and tell us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there but isn't there like a really good restaurant in the Eiffel Tower is supposed to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that is a good restaurant it is it got one star maybe two oh wow I have any event I felt sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for luik because uh boy the complaints and this is something that happens at conferences nowadays  because you've got this twitter back channel you've got all these people blogging and and and the  malcontents just come now I don't know I wasn't there but it sounded first of all they said it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  freezing they stay was day one the heating broke day two it had heat the internet from swiss com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  never worked poor luik they didn't even have internet for the people demonstrating their  products oh god that's gotta hurt that's terrible um there uh the food apparently was which was has  been traditionally very good he said I spent even more on the food this year it was everybody was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  complaining the food was a split decision from what I understand some people liked it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well some people like you know ham sandwiches just depends what you like I guess yeah I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there last year I mean they had foie gras I mean it was ridiculous the food off the chain I felt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bad for luik I mean he pulled it off it sounds like there was some everybody was there I mean  Arrington in fact Arrington was one of the people who was not too happy uh Scoble tried to defend it  uh I mean it was just everybody was there and and there was a lot of bitching moaning is this a bad  trend this kind of back uh channel uh bitching and moaning thing is or is this just inevitable the  way it is in everything we've got a back we've got two back channels on this show and half the  time somebody in the back channel saying change the subject this is boring it's just the way it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but you know I've been over at your place sitting there watching that back channel and  and to people who are writing we don't really read it that carefully I think Sarah's in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  typing right now I'm watching it uh Ben O'Reil says I hate all of you listener 935 says this is boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah but yeah well these are the people complaining is there anybody that likes what we're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about no okay does anybody like themselves you actually like yourself yes everybody's saying no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah i don't i think it says a lot of wheel spinning in this country i think this is my personal  feeling about that kind of generalization is is there's there are good companies in every country  there's innovation in every country i don't know if one country has an advantage over another

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i still think the innovation level in america i mean i was just in japan and korea i think you  guys were too actually john you were in korea i mean they are really catching up to us and they're  producing a lot of you know serious talent over there and that talent is not coming over here the  way it used to because the bush administration you know which uh seems i think they're leaving  soon um i've heard that but i don't yeah going but i mean what they're in shoes did you see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reporters are not known for their foot hygiene but that's actually part of the reason they threw  shoes at him you remember when they took down the saddam hussein statue they were banging with their  shoes in the middle east in their culture shoes are very dirty you don't wear them in the house  etc and that is like one of the biggest insults it's like hitting someone with the bottom of a  shoe because it's considered filthy in those in those countries that's i remember going to into

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mosques you wear booties yet they take off your shoes and you wear booties in india too left hand  don't think that sums up presidency that's the bow right there it's a really weird way to end it  but i but again uh of course we were talking about this with john hodgeman earlier and he said you  know look no nobody wants violence against the president whether you agree with his politics or  not it's reprehensible um i was just impressed by his ability to dodge i thought it was pretty good  and i have to say you know if the secret service is supposed to be there to dot to take a bullet  i think a shoe is considerably slower moving i may be wrong but i kind of you know i had to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  made me giggle a little bit you know he saw the first shoe he ducked then he came up like  what are you doing dude he he he think i better stay down something terrible is going on he  he was like he was he was waiting for the next show can i say can i say this and i everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  knows the other shoe to come fly i i politics wise i do not i'm not a bush fan but the last  few months he's been kind of likable in a weird way come on now maybe it's because he's leaving  but i just he's been kind of cute and i thought it was really likable the way he dodged it  and then dodging a likable trait he dodged it he almost grinned when he dodged it to begin with  he popped up again they threw another chew he dodged the other thing that you've ever said in  your life the secret service came running out and tried to they tried to wrestle him to the ground  or drag him out he waved them off said no no i want to watch as they wrestled the assailant to  the ground i mean i think he's kind of a likable fellow there get some so actually you know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this does is it's sort of like remember when they hit bill gates in the face with a pie i felt bad  for it was terrible i mean what that did the problem with doing this kind of stuff is it just  makes it open season like right now there's a lot of crazy people watching going oh i can get to the  president oh i can get to that's true that's a terrible thing that's a terrible fire is the  loons to go out and do stuff like this right that's a very good point bill gates was never  the same after that i don't know if you guys remember but he used to come to conferences  like in a rent-a-car he would be hanging out i mean it's not the same anymore you know yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  take that that story one more dimension which is paramount which was a big promoter of blu ray  just before that happened they switched dropped blu ray and went to hd dvd we believe probably  because of a bribe right well that was a mistake maybe they knew that it was over and they were  going to take the money and run well that doesn't help to see this kind of you know mix up because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if the public doesn't go for it well i think now a year almost a year later what we're seeing really  is blu ray did not catch on although now that they have sub 200 drives maybe it will i think  the double whammy of the economic slowdown and widely available downloadable high quality movies  actually it's a triple whammy and the and and frankly the fact that most consumers think dvd  is just good enough is is enough i think downloads are i think hd dvd and blu ray killed themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like that google google wins all memo that microsoft did i will say one thing i'm very uh i  think google did very well in the spectrum auction remember they put up 4.6 billion so that they could  participate in the fcc 700 megahertz spectrum auction uh they made as a precondition that the  that whoever successfully won the auction would open it up uh they kind of went back and forth  fcc granted some of it but not all of it but they but they made some i think they made some serious  concessions uh the fcc did to google google won their case ended up not winning the auction i  think breathing a sigh of relief no doubt uh verizon and at&t the expected winners actually  did get most of that that c block but they got what they wanted they were a happy loser because  they got the openness they pushed for and i thought that was really a nicely played frankly they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not they're not an evil company what i will say is i think that they lack a little bit of empathy  sometimes because they're really intelligent and they sort of talk themselves into like our position  is good because we're good people and then some other people on the other side of it are like  yeah but it doesn't feel good to the rest of us you know like the book thing you know scanning in  all the books they're like yeah we're just going to do this because this is the way it should be  done and then people who own the books are like but we own the books shouldn't you ask us and like  should but we're not going to uh too much work to ask them yeah exactly so i mean it's that kind of  behavior that gets interpreted as when you're that big arrogance when they're small it's like  naivete when you get big like that it looks like you're a bully or you're arrogant that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  happened to microsoft microsoft uh that's what people are saying yeah didn't look like until  one night microsoft was a monopoly nothing they did was was that damaging but as soon as their  monopoly it's a different matter that's the whole that's our trust anti-trust system that's how it  works that's why you have to slow your alright anti-trust system sucks who should we bring bringing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  power so since we're on that that particular topic since jason brought up the scanning the books thing  you know microsoft was doing a parallel project scanning books too even though they didn't get as  much uh flak for it and microsoft had scanned a lot of public domain books more so than google did  and they were all all 100 searchable it was very for about a year anyone going to trying to get a  phd or having to write a big thesis was in it was it was a gold mine but for some unknown reason  during this year microsoft pulled the plug on it left all the scanning equipment at the various  universities including the university of california where they were scanning books left and right  and then released all the books saying you know they we we don't have any more claim to them you  can have them do whatever you want with them all these pdfs and then of course they shut down their  server and their search engine and so now there's all the stuff in limbo yeah i i thought i was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  involved in with a university that did that they talked to both google and microsoft felt that  microsoft was the more reasonable that they they let them have more control over what they scanned  in you know uh and it is a shame that that microsoft project went away i tell you book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  100 million dollar settlement yeah they're still doing it but you know microsoft i i agree was  doing a better job and they were more magnanimous with the way the information could be used  and they didn't have all this weird stuff that was cut out and they did a lot of public domain  stuff which you need you know you could scan all those public domain books that were printed before  1927 or 24 wherever the year is now and you could make libraries and give them to other libraries so  they could have electronic versions and google wasn't doing as much of that they were doing mostly  newer books that they could they could push up against search engines and you know i wasn't as  impressed with what they have and i'm still not as impressed i've i've run into too many times i  search for something i find it on google books and then it's like the part i want to read is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  blocked off right google has scanned seven million books plans to do millions more and now because  they've settled and by the way that settlement happened at the uh in october although it hasn't  been approved by the court so it won't go into effect probably till next year they will be able  to go ahead right and continue to make these scans yeah which is great news i think i don't think we  stopped have they no they haven't uh the publishers tried to stop them and and and google gave them  some money and said okay we're gonna keep doing it which is great news right you and i and larry  lessig did a show on that which was quite a good show actually i wonder if uh the writers ever get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that means line by line rebuttal uh that came out of blogging in the uk uh because there was a guy  something fisc who uh you can look it up on i'd love i just love that idea so you fisc'd his  article basically pasting line by line in an end the thing that it's a concept car and i'm like okay  a concept car is something they show it at auto show that may or may not become available they've  delivered over 100 of these that's libel you know saying that anything that's not liable  is it slander and he said that technology is like something uh woefully inadequate or something like  that it's like i'm driving this car it's not a concept car and it goes over 200 miles and it  goes zero to 60 in 3.9 seconds what's woefully here's here's a question i have for you jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because i you know i'm thinking about this coupe 60 000 they say maybe for the coupe right right  four-door i really i like the idea of an electric car not not look you're not going to make the  money back in fuel savings on a 60 000 car certainly not a thousand a year yeah i mean  you're talking about the sedan leo not the coupe sedan yeah um but i want to support it like you i  think it's a good thing to kind of seed it if you can afford it and it is a great thing to do is to  drive an electric car and boy if you ever saw the documentary who killed the electric car do you  ever see that sarah who killed the electric car really dramatic must see it's on netflix uh  uh no oh it just really breaks your heart because sat who was it uh gm had an electric car they  killed it the ev1 ev1 and and really it's suspect the whole thing is suspect they could have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  making these things well the question is why they grind them all up yeah exactly they didn't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people to see it and you know what there's a um there's a rumor going around not that i have  any inside information that um tesla is working with mercedes in the smart car uh and i just  i'd love an electric smart car i just posted in the chat room a picture taken from uh outside the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  tesla store that shows a smart car with no tailpipe i would love you know i've ordered a smart car for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my daughter they for 99 bucks you can pre-order i think if you take a hard day if you hit a curb  the tailpipe falls off anyway yeah you might be right come on leo you do not want to be driving

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  around a smart car all right there's a whole debate and boy they're really you know as soon  as i said i did this and it only cost me 99 bucks to you know like get on the list  but uh i'm i'm listening that looks so there's no tailpipe on that but that could be photoshopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  out it's not it's that this is a whole bunch of reports now but anyway the point is there's  i would buy that so fast of this sooner rather than later so many he's got the mini for 850 a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  month or something so here's the question jason we know i'm not going to make my money back  as savings on gas but will it last 10 years at least i mean that's the thing i don't mind spending

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  60 grand a car more um because there's no engine and these other parts so and they just keep  upgrading the software and you take the batteries out so okay these things could last a long time  how long is it how long the batteries last actually that's something people don't really  know because there hasn't been really real world tests yet you would buy you're looking at buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a prius why wouldn't you buy an electric uh well the tesla is a little out of my price range  slightly i've done the math and it just looks like i'm not getting a tesla for christmas

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but um would you if you could yes i would i'd buy in a hot minute or you know a biodiesel type  of a thing so is the do they have a chance of getting i don't know about biodiesel there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some there's some question marks about biodiesel you're not going to be able to buy a car that  doesn't have batteries in it in another five years every single one will have batteries in  it for the first 50 they'll be hybrid at least at least and they'll be like extended range vehicles  you know like first hundred you plug it in you know and whatever so so whether you want it or  not it's coming it just depends on how soon you want to have any cars right now you can buy without

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a battery well well battery good point battery powered by the way i've been talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  technicalities you know talking about giving these guys some sort of a break i mean what part of the  tesla car is actually made in the united states the thing is assembled in england oh really well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually that's an interesting thing that goes back to my audible suggestion earlier john which  is there's a u-curve of where money is made in production of stuff and it really is like if you  look at the ipod the margin of the people who make the ipod in china is like low single digits the ipod  the selling of it here in the united states and the selling of the software and stuff like that ie  mp3s is incredibly high margin all that money is captured here so what you want to do is  move the low margin businesses offshore and keep the high margin ones here i.e owning the brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and retail yeah i understand that but when it comes to for example bailing out detroit the idea  is to save jobs in the u.s.a this is not a tarp thing not to save the investors that well that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a good point but this is a loan to keep the company going so that we can get electric cars i mean it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not a tarp so it's a loan for a fund that was set up by congress specifically for electric vehicles  this is not the bailout money it's two separate things well i know i'm not arguing the point i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  just saying if this car is mostly sourced in england built in england finished in england  mostly design anything why are we using american taxpayer money it's 300 these guys out i'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  getting it it's 300 there's 300 well if that was the case then we should be doing triodica some of  the priuses and stuff are built here like 80 the car is assembled here and it's 300 that's not what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it that's not my understanding my understanding is the lotus plant no the the sled like the basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the you know like the chassis is there the batteries come out of india or something and  then the carbon fiber parts come from another place so they do the final assembly here but  you it's a source from all over the world like any other car well you know according to wikipedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's not that's this is not true well you think wikipedia is wrong you should go fix it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wikipedia is often not i think jason probably knows what the facts on this one well i mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where is this factory that puts them together yeah yeah they have 300 people up there i'm they  literally put them together and you can if you type in like tesla being built or something some  of the owners have taken pictures of their cars being assembled there i'll have to find it i'll  put it in the uh i'll put it in the chat room moving along this was also the year that houston

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was overrun by raspberry crazy ants and of course our friend dwight silverman broke the story and  uh you know the weather changed and they went away uh i just like the story i just like saying  raspberry crazy ants this was a very good year for apple apple it looks like almost got to double  digits in market share almost up to 10 in market share they made a lot of money the ipod the iphone  2g uh 3g rather uh outsold the first generation iphone significantly uh giving it significant  market share making it the number two smartphone in the business on its way to being the number one  smartphone a very good year for apple not such a good year for many of the other pc manufacturers  however also a good year for information loss the bank of new york for instance announced it had lost  data from 4.5 million clients personal information gone it was a good weren't they losing information

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on the entire public of great britain oh great britain that's right weeks yeah there's another

Transcript:  we came really close to internet radio being put off the air which is really a shame because  internet radio is a remarkable thing the the uh copyright board wanted to raise royalty rates so  prohibitively that many stations would have had to gone out of go out of business this is at the  behest of the record industry which for some reason decided that internet radio was a threat  to its business uh pandora got a lot of attention when its founder tim westergren said we're gonna  have to go out of business if this hike goes through fortunately congress acted was able to  get the copyright royalty board to change its mind and the hike did not go through a negotiation  went on and a better solution was found saving internet radio and that's a relief
