Transcript:  Okay, so  Okay, it gets worse. They all you know, they all have podcasts and all, you know, they do but see this is the one advantage  we're one of the few podcast networks that does video for reasons no one really gets because most of our people listen on the on the  Internet but this is the advantage so you could see each other like you sister first time seeing each other. Yeah a  Couple of big Supreme Court decisions this week  We were before the show Carson my producer and I were debating which is the bigger of the two  Think they're both important  mobile phone privacy rights were bolstered by a  5-4 decision  Chief Justice Roberts was the swing on this one saying that  Law enforcement's needs a warrant to get your location records  All this time all of the major telcos in the United States the wireless carriers have had special  Website portals for law enforcement that that any law enforcement local police  The you know dogcatcher can go to and for like a buck fifty  It wasn't expensive could say where was Devendra on the night of May 22nd 2012 and they'll have it  the case was  kind of an interesting one  Fella named Timothy Ivory carpenter was accused of robbing a series of radio shacks  That in itself is interesting, but it was on  He probably could have just waited till they went bankrupt  But anyway, he he was armed robbery was accused of and the only evidence they had was  law enforcement got  127 days of his cell phone records and was able to match up his location with the time of the robberies  He was near those locations each and every time and that got him a conviction his conviction has not been overturned  But it's been sent back to the lower court and Justice Roberts  Was kind of at pains to call the ruling a narrow one  Saying quote it focused on the unique nature of cell phone location information and in particular they were bugged at the length of time  Mapping a cell phone's location. He wrote  Oh, this is in the in his decision over the course of 127 days provides an all-encompassing record of the holders whereabouts  So I think that's the key that it's not it's it's not like well was he there during that event was he there during  That event but it's everywhere. He was  Roberts wrote as with GPS information the time stamp data provides an intimate window into a person's life  Revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his familial political professional religious and sexual associations Wow  Kennedy Thomas Alito and Gorsuch dissented  But so it was a narrow victory of five for victory on kind of you know, the chief justice was the swing in this one  Good news I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it's a great news mixed news. That's I think it's mixed news. Yeah, I do this this Vox piece  There's some some stuff to agree with there  So it's I mean we've all seen or maybe have seen those law shows where you know  It suddenly cuts to this dramatic scene and the person's like, oh, yeah judge blah blah blah owes me a favor  so I can go get that warrant right quick and  I think that you know  It's noted that it doesn't have to just be federal judges who can get these who can issue these warrants  it goes all the way down the line and

Start time: 469.36
End time: 490.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the way down as he's hook writing in Vox says all the way down the line to a clerk  Who can write this warrant?  It's called judicial shopping and it's looking for somebody anybody a municipal court clerk with no law training  Can actually write a warrant?  So he says he says it's an issue because of the weakening of the Fourth Amendment basically

Start time: 490.96
End time: 520.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like it or rather, you know, we may assume that this is a huge huge protection  But it doesn't necessarily mean that that it's going to be impossible now except in the very specific cases where this is needed  So it might make it a little bit harder. Sure, but  We still shouldn't go. Okay now we're protected in this way  And we don't have to worry about police getting this in maybe cases where it's not necessary because as we see like there are opportunities

Start time: 520.90
End time: 548.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For them to still get these these warrants, but then youth was it been who thought it was great news. I  Mean I thought it was better. Yeah, you divindra thought it was great. Yeah  I mean where I'd be really interested to see if this extends farther into the realm of cell phones because the same  Doctrine that you're getting too much information  Applies to any time you search a cell phone. You're getting somebody's entire life is stored in this little device

Start time: 550.14
End time: 571.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's really the key right that it's an awareness that the cell phone. Oh, they're not just tracking location  It's everything tied to that location data and what it means and what I found fascinating about this is just like that greater awareness  So yeah, it's not a complete fix  But hopefully it'll lead to you know other decisions that yeah, I don't have a wider understanding of what technology

Start time: 571.94
End time: 619.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually can do today Roberts also said by the way that it it really only affects long-term gathering of data  At least a week or more and he said now that's  Wasn't in the decision, but he said that it wasn't ruling on efforts to collect information for shorter spans  So it's possible I suppose to interpret it that well if you only want where was Devendra last night. That's okay  You don't need a warrant for that, but if you want to want to where was Devendra all last  I don't know why I'm picking on you Devendra  I was gone  Technology companies including Apple Facebook Microsoft for rise for rise in for rise in Twitter and Google all  It's filed amicus briefs urging the court to protect the data. I

Start time: 620.72
End time: 669.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think it's good. I think this is good news Leo in that  Like Micah said this is this is it's you know, it's a small hurdle, right?  But it is incremental and it also  Establishes a record in a way that it might not have established a record before  or without this kind of  Needing to get a warrant, right?  and I don't think it solves any of the big issues of data privacy and user understanding of  Like what information they're putting out into the world and on their devices, but I do think that it's helpful to at least  Make law enforcement force law enforcement to at least you know  Go through some of the basic steps of getting permission to collect this data  I think in that in that regard, it's it's a good thing any step we take towards better cell phone privacy

Start time: 669.94
End time: 697.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's gonna be important  It's interesting that Verizon was filed an amicus brief on this because Verizon famously was the one that used the super cookie  But if you were for rising customer, they would sell  The  You know information of that super cookie to add the highest bidder  So if somebody wanted to track you basically they could use that to track you  Verizon did stop that practice after the FCC went after them, but  They're not known for privacy privacy  advocacy

Start time: 699.96
End time: 712.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Visible thing right you show that you care about privacy in a certain way  And I should say technically I work for Verizon too. So it's all very it's all very confusing  I would like it as a company to be better about these things for sure

Start time: 712.72
End time: 742.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the other thing is that  We're starting to be a little more sophisticated in our understanding of companies that they don't they're not exactly a monolithic, right?  There are people at Verizon who support data privacy and then there are other people selling your information to the highest bidder  And one company can have both. Yeah, whole departments. Yeah, whole departments. Yeah, Verizon was one of the cell companies  I'm sure who had this portal for law enforcement to find out where anybody was speaking of that portal Leo

Start time: 742.16
End time: 787.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I mean I have to be honest with you  I think one of the good things about these rulings is that it puts this stuff out  Into the public a little bit more so that people can learn  Learn about this kind of thing because the thing that I'm being honest about is I didn't know that there was a portal that you  Could pay a little bit of money and then get someone's cell location data  That's horrifying and if we know that that was a possibility in the past like at least people know that and know that what this  warrant does is changes that and  You know, maybe we aren't in complete control  But it starts with having this knowledge in the first place  And so when the Supreme Court gets involved  Usually it's gonna work its way out a little bit more to the the public and they will be more aware of these things

Start time: 787.32
End time: 882.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's good. Yeah back in May you might remember with the story about secure us  which was a company that  Major business was prison phones. They made a lot of money charging prisoners for phone calls  But they were collecting privacy data from AT&T Verizon T-mobile and sprint particularly location data and selling it  so so the the cell carriers were selling it to secure us and  Then secure us was passing along anybody who wanted it and the New York Times broke that story in May  So this is this is I think a good step and I don't know if this affects secure us business  But I hope it does. I hope I would love to see it put him out of business frankly  Mm-hmm decision number two might be a little more controversial  This has gone on for a long time this debate over whether  e-commerce  providers should be required to collect state sales tax and  The Supreme Court ruled that indeed  They should  The states now could force online retailers to collect tax for them for a long time  You I think one of the things that really made Amazon a success was and I know I took advantage of this  Mm-hmm, you wouldn't be charged that you know in California. It's eight and a quarter percent something like that for sales tax  That is that's a big savings  So you'd buy from Amazon a couple of problems with that first of all the state of California  I don't know what other states do but I bet other states do this too on the  Yearly tax form says did you buy anything and not paid sales tax because you still owe it

Start time: 887.00
End time: 983.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which means you'd have to lie on your state tax return if you know if you didn't want to pay that tax  So that was that was problem number one. I'm not saying what I did. I don't know  More off for you more he does my taxes. I'm sure he did the right thing. I have no idea  And then secondly it was a big disadvantage for our local bookstore for instance  That did have to charge sales tax  The original idea was if you don't have business presence in a state  You don't have to collect sales tax now you do Amazon by the way had changed that policy  They went back and forth with California at one point. They stopped paying associates  Fees in California as a way to strong arm the state legislature not to force them to collect the sales tax that  Then they negotiated they said alright. We're gonna give you a few years window now  Amazon does but what I didn't know is it only collects sales tax on the stuff  It sells directly which is about 50% of Amazon sales all the marketplace sales the third-party sales  Amazon says well, that's up to the marketplace vendor. We don't like I was wondering how that worked  Yeah, so Amazon only collects about half of the state sales taxes, but it's people like what is it over by what is it?  Overstock over by would be a good name for anybody  Overstock and  Etsy work very concerned about this because they because they don't I  Okay, this may be controversial  For a long time that the standard belief of internet fans was no they shouldn't have to I think they should have to pay sales  Taxes, it's only fair  Collect them not pay him. I'm with you with you

Start time: 983.86
End time: 1009.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think as a person who drives on the highways in the state that I live in and once  You know family members to get good education in the state that I live in and good health care and wherever all the sales tax money  Goes obviously I want it for that as a person who does most of their shopping on Amazon  Kind of stinks, but moreover. I think that this makes like I'm already paying it elsewhere when I go to a store very rarely

Start time: 1011.32

Start time: 1035.88
End time: 1057.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean I get your point here where these smaller stores don't get as much frequent don't get frequented as much  But one thing to understand about the Midwest  And especially the town that I live in there are quite a few people who are in  Older age groups who would do a lot less shopping than I do online  And so those places still get frequented quite a bit interesting. Yeah, cuz

Transcript:  Petaluma I can tell you we've we're lucky we have a  Believe it or not an independent bookstore one of the few towns in the country that still has a private bookstore in its town. Thank God  But mostly it's antique stores downtown. I mean all the regular retailers are gone. There was a department store. It's gone  There's a lot of reasons people buy online but but certainly giving them an eight and a quarter percent advantage

Start time: 1082.70
End time: 1111.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seems somewhat unfair. Yeah, it seems like it's about time  You know, we had a really good run of the internet  Internet commerce kind of getting up there and after a certain point didn't make sense to charge tax and at this point  I do want those small businesses to survive  You know, I'd like to walk down the street here in Brooklyn and get like my you know  Go to independent bookstores as well  So it stinks I think for a lot of people who rely on that to stout but it it's only fair at this point  Come on

Transcript:  No, I mean I hate to admit it, but I'm for it too  I do think that this sort of the e-commerce is mature enough now that that it can sort of bear the weight of this  So to speak I I do think that I  Do think that it's a good thing overall. I mean I live in Massachusetts. We love we love taxes here  and  I think and I think the state benefits from that and so I think you know, I  Like I think this change is good. I think the ruling is is gonna be a positive thing  I don't think it's gonna wreck anything or I do think that it's gonna be harder for  For some smaller retailers in some ways, but but I think overall it's gonna be a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't small retailers that challenged the South Dakota law that ended up in the Supreme Court was wayfair  Overstock and new egg. Those are the three  And and there was a precedent in 1992 the Supreme Court had barred states from requiring businesses with no physical  Presence to collect sales taxes. So that was the precedent and I guess you probably could look back and say well  1992 there wasn't a lot of e-commerce and all along comes all of these online  Stores who'd that really benefit? I think it's reasonable now to say okay Amazon's big enough  They come collect sales tax. Yeah, almost too big

Transcript:  Yes, one more thing to break so it's it's a cool idea  I wouldn't want to rely on it for my day to day  But yeah, I was just in a Computex in Taipei a couple weeks ago and man everyone just wants to copy Apple  And it's kind of sad you know  How was that? Did you enjoy Computex? I did I'm a you know, it's a show that I think a lot of people say  It's probably a little too old-fashioned, but I really enjoy it  Because I like PCs and I like PC hardware. I wrote a big PC and gadget about  Honestly right now PCs are so interesting and so exciting and so interesting and we're gonna talk about the Mac hardware, you know  What Apple is doing I think is so boring and dull in comparison  You look at gaming laptops now, they're getting thin and light, you know decent hardware in there under five pounds

Start time: 1765.62
End time: 1788.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's wild and it's it's far more useful than the touch bar because you can't do much with the touch bar  But this thing it's basically a second monitor so you could drag a YouTube video down there  You could use as a second screen for whatever while you're working. It still works as a touchpad too. So it's a wild idea  You know, it's an Asus product. So  Mileage varies on like how well it'll work, but I love the conception. I love the execution there

Yeah, we saw this  Their dual screen PCs these concepts popping up everywhere Asus had one  Lenovo had one wasn't there one where there's no keyboard. It's just a screen and then a screen. Yep two screens like that's it  That's what we're seeing now. So Lenovo announced the next I forget what's called the  Yoga tab or one of those and then Asus has a concept product  We saw this thing from Intel one side is a is an e-ink display and the other side is a normal display  Just lots of lots of cool ideas like that

They finally  Admitted that they there's a problem with the keyboards on the new MacBooks  I kind of enjoyed Josh Topolski's  outline  Headline on this on the outline. What do they write? They were like Apple capitulates Apple surrenders  It was like I remember it really isn't that bad, but they finally did admit  That there is something wrong and that if you bought a MacBook or you bought one of the new  MacBook Pros with these new butterfly keys at yeah, there it is Apple admits its computers are broken  That's a little strong. I'm not sure I'm not sure Apple admitted its computers are broken  But they but they did admit there's a problem with the keyboards and they're offering free repairs even more than that if you got it  Repaired earlier and paid for it. They're gonna refund  Mm-hmm why that is from Apple that's unheard of that's great

In fact, they still say it's a small today  We launched a keyboard service program for a small percentage of keyboards  You know they're still and I by the way not just Apple or Microsoft and this is getting to be a controversy  She still says there's nothing wrong  With 1803 the new Windows update. There's nothing wrong. Everybody loves it when in fact a  Lot of people are reporting massive problems with the update. So every company kind of wants to mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's ironic about this whole situation?  I remember when the butterfly keyboards came out and I was complaining about them because they feel awful  They were terrible to type on and it takes a bit of learning because they're it's so shallow  There's no like key depth there and Apple's big  Reason for making this change they said is that it would it would not break as much  You wouldn't get crumbs under the keys and it's kind of hilarious that after all that  Yeah, the keys break and when they break you can't just replace the keyboard  They got to replace the whole top, you know the whole front of the laptop  So it's it's such a mess on many levels for Apple and there are a number of questions

Start time: 2141.84
End time: 2175.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still Apple says first of all, you have to have a problem  If you have to have letters or characters that repeat  Unexpectedly or don't appear when pressed or keys that feel sticky or aren't responding in a consistent manner  What's unclear is what are they gonna do to fix it? And they say it may involve replacement of one or more keys or the whole  Keyboard that's a $700 repair if you're out of warranty  That's not an insignificant repair, but I'm with you to vendor, but I think that's a matter of  Opinion whether you like the butter.

There's new models every year with a Macintosh  Yeah, there's no consistency at all. We have no idea  So  I  Guess there's nothing more to say if you have one of those keyboards  You have problems bring it to the Apple store and God bless you spill some jelly on it and take it to the end

We're gonna fix we're gonna reboot to vent  And fix it back  While we're doing that let me talk about it  You know it's interesting how many of our sponsors are based upon this kind of basic premise that the old brick-and-mortar way of doing things  Isn't working and there's a better way. This is betterment  You know, I always say this why would you go down to the guy who hung a shingle out on Main Street saying?  I'll help you with your investments if he's so good. What's he doing working downtown?  If he's that good wouldn't he just invest for himself and be rich that isn't the best way there is a better way  To invest it's the largest independent online financial advisor, but online is the key  Betterment is designed to help you build wealth or plan for retirement maybe save for college  Advance your financial goals and they do it because it's it's it's automated it uses  Technology to take complex investing strategies and making them work for you things like this wasn't really an issue till the stock market got pretty  Volatile things like tax loss harvesting which takes advantage of losses to offset your tax consequences and thereby make you more money  It's actually really amazing  You probably thought you could do this yourself  I know I did when I found out what betterment is doing. I realized there is a better way betterment is constantly adjusting  rebalancing fine-tuning your  Investment normally if you said if somebody said to you, well, I'm gonna trade regularly on your behalf  You'd say well, yeah, that's gonna cost a lot. No  No hidden costs at betterment no matter how much money you invest no matter who you are. That's the other thing  You don't have to be a millionaire  It's all for one low transaction  All-for-one low transparent management fee  You still get if you want humans you still get humans you can still get advice from people but they're fiduciaries that means  They don't get they don't invest on their they don't have their own products. They don't invest on their behalf  They're not incentivized to recommend funds  Everything they tell you is on is for your best interest not theirs. That's really important  I don't care where you get investment advice if you don't get that that's those are table stakes. That's the baseline  You've got to get somebody who's working on your behalf. You can get personal advice there  It's a wonderful app that'll give you a really good look at where you stand and what you're doing  Whether you're on track to hit your goals or get the retirement you want  You could get guidance and help  But you also take advantage of their platform. It's really great investing does involve risk. Of course, I'd be I won't lie to you on that  but  If it's done, right  You really this is the way you need to do it if you're young and you start putting money away now for your retirement  You will do great. You just need to do it now go to betterment comm slash twit. You can get up to one year managed free  betterment comm slash twit there is a better way for you know, everything including investment betterment comm slash  Twit. All right. We got to Vindra back. We rebooted his or his bottle  And  This my brains alright. Yeah, that's good. Actually. Here's a philosophical question  Mm-hmm, if you took your consciousness and poured it into some machine  And it was from the outside world. It responded just like you was just like you had had all your memories  You know, you would still talk just like you  But is it you?

Start time: 2776.18
End time: 2816.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is yeah, that's the deeper question  I say philosophy in college and like they it is something I feel like they've been talking about forever  And it's gonna get even more complicated once all these things actually start happening  I a lot of people think like there's just no way to capture consciousness, right? We don't know how that works  We don't know like how to bottle it up like you're saying  so in many ways like a  Construction of your consciousness is just like your memories and maybe some elements of your personality  That's certainly not just you  But I do wonder like will we ever have the ability just capture purely what makes this conscious?  Will we ever know what that is? I don't know there was a science fiction story

Yeah, the key fobs think so if it's tied to your phone  And if it's more secure if you could be like if you could you know give an access to a friend who's borrowing your car or  Something like that sort of thing could be really cool as long as it's more secure

Transcript:  That's this uses NFC which means you'd have to touch an NFC enabled phone too  It's so funny because Apple for years everybody else had NFC  Apple wouldn't do NFC in their phones for years  And they finally did it a couple of years ago, and they still wouldn't let anybody else use it for a couple of years  It had to be Apple pay or nothing they finally like this year announced an SDK for NFC now all of a sudden  Oh NFC is great. We should use NFC everywhere. It's like they discovered it. Yeah, I mean it existed, but nobody was using it

Transcript:  Car sharing being able to use this NFC technology for all the things  Right now Apple just at WWDC was talking about how it's working with certain universities  I believe just in the US right now  Where students can use their Apple watch or their iPhone to get into their own building to get into the gym to  They would use their badge cool. Yeah, and I've got a few friends who are in  Digital effects stuff for Hollywood and like they have to use a badge to get into the buildings that they work in  And to be able to you know tie in with HR programs and use their Apple watch or their phone to get into the building  I think that would be awesome  Yes, if we can make sure that this is more secure than the less secure fobs if I have like from point  A to point B all of these different places where I can use my phone or my Apple watch  Be it maybe like my front door even becomes NFC  My car becomes NFC when I go to Starbucks, you know  Again, either using Apple Pay or using the Starbucks card if I could NFC all the things I'm down. I think it'd be great. I

Transcript:  Like it in theory, but I guess my problem is like what is the actual problem?  It's solving and to me like I look at how my like my dad uses his phone  And then I imagine or tries to use his phone and then I imagine him trying to open a car  Going and then I think about law enforcement right like we I mean we were talking about this, right?  you know, I mean again not to get too weird about it, but like  What I don't know. I just don't like the idea of like  Technology open unlocking my doors. I don't know. Let me go the old-fashioned

Start time: 3346.00
End time: 3390.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna fight make it broader than this. I think the mistake is saying it's a car key  Really the issue there's so many issues this solves one issue, but there's a lot of other issues  Which is it purely the real problems authentication, right? How do you prove you are you whether it's to your car so you could start it?  Or to a company so you could buy something or to a website so you can log in  how do you prove you are you and if somebody came along and solved the authentication issue and  then  By doing it digitally allowed it to be like  What would happen with a car is you'd say?  Oh this person who has a solid real genuine authentication is allowed to drive this car, but right  But but so what they're really solving is authentication, right?

Start time: 3391.24
End time: 3404.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the phones have the authentication piece right? It's your fingerprint your face  It's the biometric on the authentication you use to unlock Apple pay or whatever  That is that would all be tied into this and but then Ben's yeah nightmare scenario

Start time: 3404.64
End time: 3417.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really is not real because now this phone not only it has everything you know  I've done in the last year it has my it's who I am. It's my identity is in this one. Yeah  Yeah, it is. Yeah, I mean, let's see we do it now that driver's license has my identity now

Start time: 3418.76
End time: 3457.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of my stuff's already on my phone and I trust you know  like that's the thing is we are always trading convenience for security and trying to find the balance between those and it's the world in  Which we live and we sort of have to either do it or don't do it  Yoda would know a little bit about that and I think that you know with my phone if  I'm worried that a police officer or something is gonna try to law now get into my car using NFC  I just push these three buttons while the things are in my pocket or something and now they can't access it without having my password  They can't show it up to my face. They can't do any of that stuff  Because that's a feature that you know that Apple has strong authentication solves that doesn't it?

Start time: 3457.88
End time: 3521.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so and Apple has built in and actually, you know on Friday interviewed Phil Zimmerman the creator of PGP  He was still a crypto guy. He teaches crypto at the University of Delft in Holland, but he's also a privacy advocate  It's interesting I did not know this but he got into the whole PGP thing because he was an anti nuke advocate and  He wanted people to be able to communicate privately as they fought nukes  not nuclear power plants specifically but nuclear weapons and  but he's still very much involved in all this and  I forgot where it was going. Oh, he uses an iPhone and  He says it's because of the secure enclave  The he said if and this is the fix to PGP to is  You need the problem with PGP is your private key is a vulnerability. You have to store it on a computer  It could be stolen, you know, it's past praise protected, but that may be not perfect  What he says is the bet the way to solve this is hardware based security like  He says it should be in a phone like he started silent circle. They created the black phone

Start time: 3521.98
End time: 3526.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3526.80
End time: 3561.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, black phone a is out of date  But he also said, you know our mistake was we didn't understand the phone business and without carriers without info  You know, you can't really sell a phone and just say good you have it like a computer  You have to say, you know, you have to have an infrastructure  So yeah, and I he says there are some Android solutions like Samsung knocks some hardware enclaves there  But he really liked how Apple has solved this problem. So no wonder Apple's in this consortium. I  Think it's a mistake to say it's just about car keys. Let's let's do  Now are there political issues? Is this like a national ID? Is that is there a problem there? Oh

Start time: 3563.88

Transcript:  So here's the problem with a national ID it's centralized in the US government right centralization  If you're worried about that centralization is the issue if you know if we trust the US government today  But what if you didn't trust them tomorrow a national ID system could be used  Well, we just heard news stories about the Border Patrol asking people for IDs as they drove around New England. Are you a citizen?  It turns out I looked into this because I thought that's weird  Two-thirds of the country is subject to this. The the law says that if you're within a hundred miles of a border or a coast  That  The Border Patrol can ask you for proof that you're a citizen within a hundred that means here  That means pretty much every New York City everybody  so  that's why people are afraid of a national ID right is this papers please this whole notion that a  Adversarial government would use this against you. But if it's blockchain, it's decentralized  So you can have a ledger system that is decentralized but secure and strong that includes identity information what about that I  Like it. Okay. I'm gonna do an ICO. I can count on you guys  Yes, indeed

Transcript:  Actually, they were the cover story in this  month  Months Wired magazine is all about  blockchain and  ICOs and crypto it is a wild story. It was long read but it was kind of an interesting story if you haven't read it  Now let's go on to this issue as long as we're we'll do a couple more Apple stories and move on  Supposedly a researcher found a way to unlock iPhones  by streaming pass codes to it if you do it fast enough the iPhone doesn't lock out and  Since a four-digit code is only ten thousand different  Choices you could brute force a phone then Renee Richie wrote an article your colleague and mine  Wrote an article that said not so fast Apple says this actually is a mistake. It's erroneous  However, what neither Apple nor Renee has mentioned is well in what way is it erroneous, right?  so  Even the original researcher says no hack. But again, he's not saying in which way it's erroneous  So I'd like to know more about this me too

Start time: 3730.24
End time: 3741.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I wish I had more information on this because yeah  We just got the well the testing was wrong was done wrong or was the the testing was done incorrectly  I can't remember exactly what it was that Apple said the the person

Start time: 3741.82
End time: 3780.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said it it looks like all of the pins as you stream those out are going at to the phone and being tested  But he said they they aren't always sent so they don't count  So you may miss the actual code you may go whizzing by it and the phone hasn't actually seen it  So it won't unlock so maybe he he got he lucky and the code that he was using worked  But regardless there is a very good lesson here which is don't use a four-digit exactly  And modern iPhone 6 right? Yeah. Yeah, and even this guy says well 6 is so long you can't it doesn't work. It's too long

Start time: 3781.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the thing I think you should  If not for yourself, I think that caring about this is important for those of us who  have been given this responsibility in this platform to to talk about tech and talk about the future of tech and  Sort of where we are now and where we want to go if we don't advocate for for  consumer privacy and consumer protections then  companies don't you know they start to push back on that kind of thing and they don't pay as much attention to it and  So while it may not be a big issue for us individually and I certainly  Have in the past had that mindset of like what do I care?  but you know, it's it's not too difficult to imagine a  Bad future so a future that we don't want to live in where our protection for our privacy then that's where people start sort of  categorizing people according to  Who they are and like I mean any any number of of possible  Ways to discriminate against people could could easily be used to the future in a dystopia  Based on the fact that we don't have user protection and privacy protection. So I just think it's important for us to advocate for that

They did a 1984 discussion  I think for 84 weeks for a very well now for a very long time they for like the entire  Year, and I did one of those discussions. I'm surprised that people you know, this is a small smart group of people  Who didn't hear about any of the metadata collection that Snowden revealed really?  They didn't hear about all this stuff that was happening and I was kind of shocked because these are you know, these are doctors  These are people who are paying attention to say you issues around their civil liberty  They want to talk about a book like 1984 and they're not aware of this huge thing that happened and affects all of them  So yeah, I think we get a we can't ignore these things for sure

But you look at I guess what I would say is you look at stuff like that  That's actually did that is happening right now and the information around that and I think  It's not a huge jump to imagine that you need to protect yourself and your data  Considering how things might be used against you in the future. I mean, maybe I'm Tim  I guess I'm really I'm really taking on the tinfoil hat mantle  but I do I do think that you look at some of the news that just  The non tech news that is has been happening over the last week and over the last months and I  Don't think it's a bad thing a bad thing to sort of keep pushing on personal privacy  personal security protections  in the US and elsewhere, I

Okay, he works. Yeah, John's a stickler for accuracy  Our show today brought to you by Eero  Eero's a hero as far as I'm concerned about two years ago  They decided to fix Wi-Fi and now they've done it for so many people the advantage of Eero  Being around for two years and so many people using it is is it gets better all the time  They learn and they get better and it's upgraded all the time firmware upgrades  You don't ever have to worry about things like VPN filter infesting your Eero  Because they do firmware upgrades all the time. They were never vulnerable, you know, really Wi-Fi used to be good  But then we put about a hundred different devices on our Wi-Fi network  My Eero says I have 42 devices running on my Eero and suddenly and then your neighbors have Wi-Fi and  Soon it stops working Eero solves that they solve that the second generation Eero and the Eero beacon  That's what I've got here allow a customer to build a Wi-Fi system  That's more perfectly tailored to their home than ever before they offer more speed more range still though the same look at that  The high quality elegant design people have come to expect the second generation Eero is now tri-band  They have a third five gigahertz radio  One of the radios for a backhaul  But it doesn't slow down your internet like an extender will because they have full duplex on the rest of the channels  It's twice as fast. You can do more in every room of your house. You know what I like about the beacon  It's also a nightlight. It's got a little nightlight underneath it  So I put these in the hall where they can spread Wi-Fi best and they light up the hall, which is cool  You could turn off that light if you want. I have one in the bedroom  I turn up actually have five five euros all over the house. I love it  They have now a thread radio which means you can connect to low-power devices like locks doorbells other sensors and more  They're always adding new features, you know the other day. I said, oh I could turn on IPv6. So I did  Expanding coverage in any room is easy with an euro beacon you plug it into the wall and you're covered if there's an outlet  You can have Wi-Fi. I  Love our euros. In fact, I like it so much  I got the new system and gave my mom the old one  Mom's got an euro too and you know, it's neat is I can check on mom's network  So when mom says hey my internet's down I literally can open the euro app switch over to her network and see what's going on  Oh mom, you must have kicked the one loose in the kitchen and she can fix it. Let's switch over to my network  I think there's a few more devices on my network at home  35 connected devices and there'll be more when we get home  Eero  Dot-com if you want free overnight shipping to the US or Canada go there and when you buy it  Select overnight shipping then use the offer code to it and it'll be free  Life's too short for bad Wi-Fi if I've got you know what?  I got a row when I finally got fit up with a honey. The Wi-Fi is not working again  You don't want to hear that ever get a row. You will never hear it again  Eero.com we thank them for their support of this week in  tech  Speaking of devices in your pocket devices with microphones  Amazon's putting echoes in hotel rooms now  There there are two people two kinds of people in the world now people who don't mind devices with microphones in them  around them all the time and those who do  I'm wondering what Micah and Ben and Devinder.

Like you you you especially if you could actually turn the television on instead of like turning on the disgusting clicker, right?  Using an disgusting clicker or or or being like hey  Can can you call down to the front like being able to just talk to a speaker and you can order a room service?

I don't like to say the word out loud for hospitality  And it's initially gonna be at Mary select Marriott's Weston hotels st. Regis aloft autographed collection hotels  The win in Vegas and I think the aria a couple of hotels in Vegas already had echoes  But they weren't special echoes. The real issue is  How do you reset so they need to reset it when you check out and set it up for somebody new according to?  Amazon the Alexa for hospice it the a word for hospitality  commands are deleted daily  Hotels do not get access to the voice recordings  So when you do room service, it doesn't send a recording down to the room service  It actually just does a readout or something saying, you know send some hot dogs up to 743  However hotels can use a word for hospitality to measure engagement through analytics  Or I know yeah, that sounds suspicious or customize the deployment by choosing default music stations  Mary it's gonna offer TED talks

I wouldn't want to put this on somebody  So yeah Alexa makes a lot of sense for a hotel room, but hopefully, you know  If you don't want it there, you could just call and they'll take it away  For me it got a lot more useful once I added smart home devices. So once I can control my living room lights with Alexa  It's great  Would be really useful for stuff like that in the hotel. I'm worried about that aggregate data  I'm really worried about Amazon as a data collection, you know company  Because more and more I am losing faith in them in terms of I don't know what they're doing to it's a really like

Transcript:  Strategy though right to get to get echoes everywhere just everywhere. You can get the Roav Viva put echo in your car  I just got the fire TV cube, which has  I actually like it  It's not so the idea is you use voice commands to turn your TV on it will control your TV  I didn't have any trouble it knew immediately what brand of the TV was and it controlled it immediately  Turn my AV receiver on and also recognize the brand. I don't know how but it's on the same network  Maybe you queried it. It doesn't control like your Apple TV or your Roku. What a surprise  It will control some set-top boxes not Tivo's but some cable companies set-top boxes  So in theory you could say, you know watch Channel 7  But it's great because if you use fire TV if you've news Netflix or HBO go or H  Showtime anywhere NBC ABC if you use one of the channels available  They don't have YouTube weirdly enough  But one of the channels available on a fire TV all of those could be controlled with a voice  So I can walk into my office and say echo  watch Westworld  It does it will pop up a screen that then shows the movie Westworld and the TV show and then you have to say play  number one  So there is some more interaction involved but I could say pause turn up the volume turn down the volume  And I love the best part is I can walk out of the room say echo turn the TV off and it turns the whole system  Off which is nice  So it works. I mean it's $120. It's not you know, it's limited in its scope. It's not the ultimate

Transcript:  I like to be able to control stuff with my voice  Yeah, although now I imagine Amazon knows everything I watch  Yeah, right  Which which ads I stay in the room for which television you're using because it they know the brand never you set up the cube  Yep, they know the brand  They know, you know, I mean it's better than Nielsen. It's it's basically Nielsen people meter  But again, it's like well so I don't know how can that be used against me I guess is the question. Mm-hmm  Here's a great do you think it's possible that with a duly  written law enforcement warrant that law enforcement could say just turn on Leo's echo. Let's hear what he's doing. I

I'm not saying it could be without a warrant  But why can't they see so I asked Phil Zimmerman PGP creator  About this going dark issue because law enforcement saying oh, we're going dark all this encryption. We can't tell what people are doing  It's terrible. He said they're not going dark  In fact, there's this thing called Zimmerman's law that says with technology the abilities to surveil people increase  algorithm, you know logarithmically  And I think he's right. He says basically law enforcement now has an incredible high-def screen  They can see you know everything going on  There's a few little black dots  Because they can't hear your Skype or read your messages a few little black dots. They don't like that  They don't want any dead pixels. They want a perfect screen, but they sure as hell he says are not going dark  They have more ability to surveil you than ever before cameras everywhere  microphones everywhere I  Have to agree with him on that

I don't know

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it was doing it was really the voice control stuff too because we had you know voice commands on our phones before  The a word came out and the echo  But Amazon I think did it a bit smarter and they have a history as a company of just making unique products and nobody else really  saw the need for right like the Kindle and  Their bet on a cloud computing. I remember too was kind of controversial at the time and now they're dominant right Amazon  Yeah services number one easily. Yeah. Yeah, so they make these big bets and they don't always work. There was the fire phone, right?  But good smart bets and I think yeah, the key is tying it all to IOT stuff IOT devices  I never wanted a hue set  Before I had an Alexa

I'm less mad about that  I like that I see so many people using their phones in that way and recording video in that way and so many  Platforms that make it easy to view video in that way. So that doesn't bother me. Like it's really just the fact that it's  exclusive to these content creators that Instagram decides their content creators and  they the way that it's like seemingly trying to take on YouTube a little bit and it is not at all going to do that and  Instagram I think did a really good job with Instagram stories and made it this  Really easily accessible and sort of more premium version of snapchat in a way  That I've seen a lot of people use Instagram stories and really like it and then it's just like why do we have to throw?

Got you, you know  You feel for people like pub G and snapchat who invent something they create something  It's awesome. And then along comes somebody copies what they're doing exactly and takes all the audience away  I guess my space has to go on that list as well. I  Guess that's the way it is. I guess the way it is. Certainly we wouldn't try to create content specifically for IG TV  On the other hand, we're very happy to be on YouTube.
