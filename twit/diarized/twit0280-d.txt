And it was right around Christmas and it was the World Financial Center is this huge  mega complex of banks.  And, you know, every day at four thirty, me and the other girls would put our sneakers  on and take the elevator down and walk outside.  And about a week before Christmas, I showed up at work and there were poinsettia plants  on every every desk.  And I thought, well, jeez, isn't that nice?  What a sweet, what a sweet, sweet gesture.  And at the end of the day, I took the poinsettia plant home with me and I did not notice that  I was the only one doing that.  And then when I when I got back to work the next day, I realized they were actually just  office decorations.  They were not gifts.  Do you do that at weddings, too?

Transcript:  In just a moment, before we do though, I want to mention our friends at hover.com.  I just moved most of the Twit domains over to hover.com.  I've got a few more to do.  Because this other registrar, which I'm not a fan of,  and I don't think I have to tell you who it is, you probably could guess,  is holding on to these things.  They make it so hard to get rid of it. Not hover.  Hover's domain registration made easy.  Use Hover's domain management to set up your email addresses,  to forward email addresses.  Do you have a server for Subbrilliant? You must.  Yeah, I do. I have a web host.  So Hover doesn't do the web hosting.  Basically, they do forwarding, they do email addresses, they do domain names.  You have complete privacy controls. You don't even have to pay for it.  They automatically have who has privacy.  If you are transferring there, they will charge you $10,  but that gives you a whole extra year on your existing domain.  You're paying for the transfer is free and the remaining year is free.  Hover.com. If you go to twit.hover.com,  you'll save 10% over and above their already low prices.  And by the way, service and support is excellent.  They have a no-hold policy during business hours.  I can go on and on. I want you to try it.  The folks from Two Cows do this.  It used to be Domains Direct.  They've rebranded it and it is great.  twit.hover.com. Give it a try.  I have a confession to make.

Transcript:  We're talking about mailroute.info.  Actually, you can go to mailroute.com,  but if you want 10% off for the life of your account,  mailroute.info, it's a special deal we've arranged.  You know, I started using it in 2004.  He's my friend, Tom Johnson, created this.  And we met at family camp,  and he said, yeah, I'm doing this thing.  You want to try it?  And I said, yeah.  And I have...  I can't live without it now.  If you run your own server, this is what you need.  I mean, you could go out and get a big hardware,  anti-spam solution, but they don't scale very well.  They're very expensive.  Mailroute is very affordable.  It starts at $2 per person,  and the prices go down, the more users you have.  Very effective.  It's not a million in a quarter million.  I haven't found any false positives.  You can...  and I haven't done that in years  because I never miss an email.  Mailroute protects you against spam,  phishing attempts, and viruses  before they reach your server,  which saves a lot of traffic.  Directory harvest and denial of service attacks  Your costs are lower.  You probably even save money using mailroute,  and you don't have to worry about scaling,  and here's a nice thing.  Mailroute has an email spooling service.  They call it mailbagging.  They will automatically save that mail  because they're up times 99.999%.  Tom knows how to run a server.  And, you know, he created FrontBridge,  which Microsoft bought as Microsoft Exchange Services,  and he's been providing these anti-spam services,  as I said, for the last six years,  to some of the biggest companies in the country,  universities, and to me.  And I love it.

Is that what you've been telling your kids?  It's called the Catholic Church transubstantiation.  From prop to wine.  If you open one of those presents, it would just be some crummy waifu.  It'd be sad.  But when you open it in the morning, it's actually a pound of Jesus flesh.

That was pretty cool.  But you're not really going to brag about the biggest of the Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur,  where it's really about atonement and fasting.  You're not going to hold it over your Christian friends by trotting that one out.  I've been to some wild Yom Kippur parties.
