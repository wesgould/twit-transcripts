Ryan Shroud, the host of this  week in computer hardware and editor in chief of PC perspective at PC per dot com. And he's on for a very special reaction. Couple of things I want to talk about.  But the PS four, the new PlayStation, but also want to talk about has well, we'll do that in a moment. Also with us, Natalie Morris, great to have you back. Thank you. I won't be standing up to  modeling my clothes. No, that's quite all right. No need. Are you wearing any team sweatshirts? However, no, nothing. Giants? No, I'm not. No, that's gotta be tough.

Transcript:  you know, I always say this when he's on. He sounds just like Max Kellerman. Yeah, every every single time. Who is Max Kellerman? Max Kellerman is a is an analyst. ESPN was on ESPN for a while, but he does mostly boxing now. And he's a boxing. Oh, you talking kid freeze. What? That's what they call him. No.  Well, now we have all the affiliations out of the way we can move on to the tech news. I got an e-mail from somebody who said, you know, I'm just not going to listen to twit until you stop talking about sports because I'm a geek and I'm not interested in sports. I will for him. I was specifically I want to thank Steven Thompson and David Helm. They go to North Dakota State all day around there. And so we're going to do a little bit more of a little bit of a little bit of a test. So they want to look at the state of the West, and they want to look at the state of the West, and they can look at the state of the West. So that's one of the major issues in terms of the state of the West. And I'm not sure if they want to, I'm not sure if they're going to do it. They're going to have to look at the state of the West. Yeah, well, I think the state of the West is going to be  one one. I think it was nice. Is this basically your how you get your wardrobe? Yes. Steven Thompson gave me this one. I got a championship one from Hell. And I'm now making I solicited on this show. That's the only reason I thought it'd be a good idea. You don't do this on no agenda just on this show. Yes. Okay. Every show. No, just this show. This show only and only once in a while. But it was certainly sufficiently that it's become your reputation. I've gotten all kinds of Appalachian state stuff and these other others. Well, hey, if we're going to talk about design.

Transcript:  Is that an award for incontinence? It's a gala event going on right now. Let's just why don't we just check in and see because I think I just seen this fancy enough dress that I don't see. It's just like a big time award show. Wow. I never heard of it. Look at that. They've got moving sets. Looks slick. They've got people in fancy dress that people unfolding chairs.  Look at that. That is fancy. We need to do some award shows. This Larry King. Thank you. And Jenna Marbles. Well, I love Jenna Marbles. I never heard of Jenna Marbles. Oh, you see, she's huge in the YouTube crowd. She's huge. They got 6000 people in their chat room. So if you'd like to tune that in, would you just run this in the background? You know, we are going to be doing live.  Run the Streamies? I didn't even. I don't. Yes, never heard of them. Yes. You know, I didn't actually stand up because I'm wearing those same pants. Jenna Marbles pants. Yeah. Pleather leggings. Nothing like it. I thought Larry King was dead years ago. I'm just shocked to see him still. Oh, not only alive, but walking. You were on the Larry King show. I've been on his show. Yeah, he looked shorter than I think. Maybe he's shrinking. That could happen. It's a body. That's a body.  Double. It's kind of like he's not animatronics. I think he's somewhere being watered. I think they probably have him on the juice on the. There was a lot of stories this week. Microsoft one week ago shipped its surface pro the Windows Pro tablet and sold out of the 128 gig version almost immediately. We were a little puzzled last week about what the heck happened. Now I went to the Microsoft store and the  radio button is live so you can still order. You can now order 128 gig surface pro but it won't be available to March 15th. Was a scam? No, it won't be available to March 15th. I figured it out. OK, it's on the carnival triumph and they've been towing it. And people have been pooping on it. They've been towing it from China. How many Ryan Shroud? I'm sure you guys talked about this. How many surface pro 128 gigs do you think they made when they say sell out was a sell out of millions?

Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're talking about six. You're talking about stores having six a piece and that kind of stuff. No, I don't think that would be 1800 approximately. They saw Florence, Kentucky, too. I mean, I went to Best Buy trying to trying to find any capacity and they didn't have any here either. They sold out on Sunday when they launched. They said that the Best Buy has got from zero to three.

Start time: 558.23
End time: 560.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, well, it's easy to sell out of zero.

Start time: 560.98
End time: 569.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can you have zero? That's what it said.  Can't have zero. We got from zero to three, you guess.  That's the absence of having zero.

Start time: 570.94
End time: 578.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then and then most of them, I guess, went to the Microsoft store, but I don't think even the Microsoft store had very many.

Start time: 580.52
End time: 595.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, like 20, I think the estimate was somewhere between 20 to 50 is what the Microsoft stores had.  So, I mean, we're talking maybe high of 50000 to 75000 total that were out there, I think, is some of the best estimates that I've seen.

Start time: 595.22
End time: 608.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not the best Windows 8 tablet out there even now, right?  I mean, I guess I understand it's kind of like a Google phone.  People want the, you know, somehow official because it came from Microsoft.  It's Google. Yeah, you have it. That's a Nexus, right?  Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah.

Start time: 609.30
End time: 631.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What I want to know is, is what are the corporate orders?  And, you know, that's not something they normally release.  But if they're really going to brag, they've been saying this is going to be a big enterprise tablet.  So, you know, you don't see CTOs and CIOs just moseying on down to the store and, you know, coming out with an armful of service for their for their workforce.  So I don't think they're going to release that.  But that's the real question.

Start time: 632.30
End time: 674.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they would typically get them direct, you know, sold, you know, a pallet of them or whatever.  They're sold direct. But of all the what?  There's certainly interest among the enterprise.  We've heard that for the past six months, but I haven't heard not one single CIO or CTO of the ones we talked to that said, I'm ordering 100 of these or, you know, 500 or a thousand.  I haven't heard any say that they're going to that they were planning to order them at launch.  A bunch of them, a lot of them were planning to trial it.  They were planning to get it in to get some in and order them and, you know, try it out and some trials, two, three, five tablets from zero to three in every company, every Fortune 500 company.

Start time: 675.04
End time: 687.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. But even if it had been hundreds, then that would be a case study that we would know about.  And you'd have to think that maybe they'll pick a few select corporations and maybe give them hundreds and get that ball rolling.  And then they would share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason, Jason, you covered this is yours.  Yeah, yours. This is what Tech Republic covers.  What is the reaction from business to Windows 8?

Start time: 697.18
End time: 802.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's been surprisingly lukewarm.  Yeah. Right. Yeah.  Surprisingly, really?  Well, because in terms of what they're buying, right, because people leading up to Windows 8, for whatever reason, they people talk to big game like, yeah, absolutely.  We're open to bringing it.  You know, we can bring these kinds of tablets in surface and they'll immediately connect to our infrastructure, you know, active directory to whatever back end Windows systems they have, Windows servers.  You know, people talk to big game like that, all leading up to RT and Pro both.  Right. But when you actually ask them, what have you bought?  There's very few that are talking about getting lots of them, right.  And there's been lots more interest around Pro than RT in all honestly.  So reasonably speaking.  Yeah. Yeah.  But so I wasn't surprised that they sold out of 50 to 70,000 of them.  But I don't think that that's a bigger an example of the fact that there's a ton of demand for this product, because there certainly isn't, as you mentioned, Leo, you know, there are other tablets that even can do this a little better.  It's really powerful tablet.  I reviewed it.  And at the end, I said, if I were recommending this to a pro, I would have a hard time saying get this instead of something like the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet, too, which is really nice.  Yeah, does a lot more.  And it's not as power doesn't have as powerful a processor, but you can get, you know, wireless broadband in it, mobile broadband.  You can it's got 10 hours of battery life.  The pen is built in.  It doesn't have as nice as a screen.  It doesn't have as big of a processor.  But in the end, you know, it's going to do a lot more for you.

Start time: 803.08
End time: 809.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will say so much of the enterprise is still lagging and upgrading to Windows 8 anyway.  So, you know, you're sorry.

Start time: 811.48
End time: 813.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead. No, you go ahead.  I didn't mean to interrupt.

Start time: 814.44
End time: 815.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was the main crux of that.

Start time: 815.56
End time: 818.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're stuck with Windows 7.  Go ahead, Ryan. You were going to say something.

Start time: 818.54
End time: 843.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just saying, I have that ThinkPad tablet, too, right here.  And I do like the device.  But in terms of it being it's a major step backwards in terms of performance.  This is an atom based processor.  And, oh, that's not good as an Ivy Bridge based processor.  It's OK for doing some stuff.  But if you're actually, you know, needing to do some some, you know, basic  computing intensive stuff, this is going to struggle with it.  Whereas the Surface Pro will will breeze right through.

Start time: 843.08
End time: 883.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this brings up something I was going to ask you anyway, Ryan.  Shouldn't people who are buying hardware today wait until Haswell?  Well, I mean, in June, in June, Intel will do the talk,  which is the big upgrade processor upgrade with Haswell.  And there are three Haswell parts.  One is all there.  Actually, two are very low power.  One is ultra low power.  It seems like those would be, you know, battery life will be better.  They'll be they'll be able to do things that Apple does right now.  This like this power nap where even when the system's sleeping,  they'll be able to get mail and update things.  It just seems like it's going to be a better platform for Windows 8.  Windows 8 is built to take advantage of power nap style. Yeah.  Yeah, it's got a

Start time: 884.22
End time: 903.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  has a little architecture that was designed for that infrastructure, right?  Connected standby and that type of stuff.  And it will have much lower power states that it can go into.  The problem with waiting is, depending on what your cycle happens to be,  when Haswell launches in the middle of the year,  it's going to launch the high powered versions initially.

Start time: 903.36
End time: 905.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When did the use when did the use come out, the low power?

Start time: 906.02
End time: 919.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think you're going to you're going to have to wait until fall  to start seeing those roll out and probably into the winter  before, you know, you're starting to see more than just a couple of skews out there  using that really, you know, low power.

Start time: 919.56
End time: 930.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also has faster GPU, right?  So, I mean, in every respect, this is improved.  And it seems to me that if a company is looking at Windows 8,  they can be very happy saying, yeah, we'll wait till the fall.

Start time: 932.26
End time: 969.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah, the the comp,  you have to make too many compromises with the Surface Pro as it is now.  I mean, it's not that it's a bad product.  The idea, you know, as Ryan's saying, you get a lot of power.  But so it comes into this conundrum, though, right?  Because you've got all this power.  The idea is you're getting all of this sort of laptop power  in a tablet form factor that's mobile.  And so the biggest thing is now you're getting, you know,  all of this power in this very mobile device, although the device still weighs  two pounds, right?  But you can't be mobile with the device because it's only got four hours  of battery life. Right. What are you going to do?  You're going to use it to what?  Jump between conference rooms from day to day where it's a laptop.

Start time: 969.56
End time: 971.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might as well just face it. You're going to keep it plugged in.

Start time: 972.32
End time: 983.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to be plugged in.  You're not going to have it for more than you're not going to be able to use it  for anything more than, you know, jump in conference rooms for some meetings  because it's not a very mobile device because of that.

Start time: 983.80
End time: 988.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Ryan, won't we see it has well, won't we see battery lives more like,  you know, 50 percent to 100 percent better?

Start time: 989.98
End time: 1024.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know for sure what the percentage like will be,  but Intel has really changed what their design goals are on a process  to process product to product release. Right.  They're not really interested in improving performance anymore.  Ivy Bridge is not that big of improvement over Sandy Bridge,  which wasn't a big improvement in general and has well.  And so if you look at the CPU side, it's not going to be a huge improvement  in performance. What they're focusing on is that low power management.  So their their goals now are, can we get the same level of performance  you get today at half the battery life or half the half the voltage,  half the, you know, the power draw required thus increasing your battery life?

Start time: 1024.70
End time: 1036.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we've been hearing this from Intel forever.  I mean, 10 years ago, they eventually they'll get there.  I'm not sure they will.  I'm actually not sure this could be this has well could be has been.  And there you have the headline.

Start time: 1038.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just wrote in my market watch column.

Start time: 1042.40
End time: 1058.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've really as of, you know, you go back to where  the original Centrino launched, right.  And that's they they had a complete reshift there.  And they've had another one since then  when they kind of wrote off AMD as being their primary competitor  and decided that Qualcomm is their new primary competitor and arm in

Start time: 1059.00
End time: 1092.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Qualcomm specifically, but arm in general.  Right, right, right.  Because does interesting analysis last fall from a non tech,  which I just got around to reading, in which he said,  basically, that's the threat is that computing is moving to tablet  and smartphone, all of which is arm based.  Intel doesn't have a you know, they tried it.  Clover trail, maybe.  But they don't really have an arm competitor.  They got to get a chip that can get into a portable small device,  get good battery life, not take up a lot of room.  And that's where they're moving.  They are moving not as you said, not they don't have to beat AMD.  They have to beat arm.

Start time: 1093.20
End time: 1119.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they need to do it without giving up the performance that we have already.  Right. If you look at Clover trail, that's what this is.  It's like an atom processor.  And it's and it's OK. It will work.  It will function.  It will do some of the stuff that you want to do.  But I think your typical laptop user, whether it's a business or consumer,  doesn't want to give up the performance that they have today to go back to,  like, an Android based tablet where they where you see that performance  degradation has hit. Right.

Start time: 1119.96
End time: 1156.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the problem is ultimately that I think people are asking the wrong question  and trying to do the wrong things with tablets.  Ultimately, if you if you want the power of a laptop,  then you don't need it in a tablet.  I mean, that's ultimately what the conclusion I came to when I was using the pro  and testing it out, heading up, going into the launch.  And I thought this is a good device. It's beautiful.  It's well made. But if I wanted to do all of this,  it still has to compete with a laptop. And I'd rather use a laptop.  It's not as good as a laptop.  And so if you're trying to make a tablet be as powerful and do as much as a laptop,  you're always going to be disappointed because you're a content producer, though.

Start time: 1158.20
End time: 1187.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think that the entire reason that Apple just released this 128 gig iPad  is because they see a lot of people who are not content producers need that power  because they're in the field and they need a lot of content being pushed to them,  not necessarily to produce content.  Do you know what I mean? Like if you're if you're I don't know,  you're pharmaceutical sales and you need you need your entire catalog  of knee or hip replacements, John, then, you know, I'm sorry.

Start time: 1188.96
End time: 1191.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Nothing.  I don't need a hip replacement.

Start time: 1192.74
End time: 1200.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or a knee replacement.  I'm still I can do things.  And by the way, I don't recommend everyone I know has got a knee replacement is  limping around.

Start time: 1202.46
End time: 1240.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you need that tablet and a tablet works for you, Natalie.  I mean, it's it's totally true.  And I think they should be doing, you know, that the kind of thing.  A big, big storage, faster processor, more video.  But it works in that form factor.  And I think the stuff that a lot of Windows 8 machines,  including the Surface Pro, are trying to do is trying to say, well,  if you're a laptop user, here's the tablet for you.  Well, if you're a laptop user, you don't need that.  The form factor doesn't work for you.  You don't need that form factor.  And most of them don't want that form factor.  They want to use a laptop for the work that they need to do.  So I just think you have the issue of connectivity then, because a laptop,

Start time: 1246.66
End time: 1255.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ultra mobile PCs.  Yeah, that was partly because Intel's chip was so low powered, was so not.  And so so anemic performance.  It was terrible.

But in Lenovo, Lenovo offers it with mobile broadband chips in them.  You can get them in laptops.  You know, it's the same chips that run in in tablets.  It's just the demand for them isn't as high.

Transcript:  But I think what people want is they want great battery life,  but they don't want to give up performance.  They want a light and simple form factor.  They want always on connectivity.  Can can has well be the solution for this, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it can.  And I think what you have to start thinking about are different form factors,  the convertible tablets into laptops as those designs mature and get better.  I really I really do believe that that's that's kind of what it's going to become.  You're going to have a laptop.  You know, this imagine if this was a lot more powerful.  There's a dock that you can plug it into that then has video outputs and HDMI  and Thunderbolt and all that kind of stuff on it.  So you you take it with you and you get 10 or 12 hours of battery battery life  with you when you go, you come back home, you plug it in and all your storage is connected.  Maybe you've got an external discrete graphics card in there  if you want to do games and that kind of stuff.  And that is what has well will enable because that is a chip that is designed to  run it in extremely low voltage and get longer battery life.  But then if you pump some power into it, you can get high performance as well.

Transcript:  Perfect. I think it's one of those things typical Intel always tries to do this.  They always find ways to turn the chip off or turn it on.  You know, speed step.  Yeah, they get it all down.  And if you ever use one of these machines,  because I have a desktop that's got one of these chips in it,  it usually you hit the key and you wait because the chip is saying,  I think I better start working now.  Fifteen, twenty seconds late that long.  You got to wait a millisecond.

Transcript:  Where are the flying cars?  I will say the one cool thing about the service pro that was was cool.  And I think where the product is pretty groundbreaking and will have an influence  is it was the first time that I used a one of these kind of hybrid devices,  because because I've used several of these as well, where the touch  and the type worked together pretty well.  And it was the first time that I thought, yeah, you know what?  This makes sense. And it has a pen computing.  I've never been a real big fan of pen computing, but the pen on that  is so accurate and precise that it, you know, it type it's it can go down  to really thin lines right where you touch on the tablet with the pen.  It it goes right there was on some of these tablets.  It's like you're touching on one part of the screen and it's like half an inch  above that is where you're actually you see it.  And it's a really jarring experience.  This one worked really well.  The touch like touches just better for some things like scrolling  to a specific part of a page or flipping through images.  You know, it's natural to sort of want to flip through them on the screen.  And it does work better versus some things, obviously, are better  for just typing and using a mouse and keyboard.  And so it's the first device I used where touch and sort of traditional input  and pen kind of all worked together pretty well.

It'll print right on envelopes with your logo, the return address.  It'll take the recipients address from your QuickBooks, your address book.  If you're selling on Amazon or eBay or any one of those websites,  it takes it right off the website.  It prints the postage. It's legal postage.  It does it all for you automatically.  And if you have the scale, you just plop any package or letter on there.  And you always know exactly how much postage to put on.  It's really fantastic.  You even get discounts. You just can't get it.  It's up to 21% off ExpressMail, 15% off Priority Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's see. Let's try to kill a product.  How about Apple's wristwatch?  Yeah, it was an interesting product.  So, Natalie, you're a fashion plate.  You and Kate Spade like this.  Well, look at you. You're just you're dressed to the nines.  You're gorgeous. You've got earrings on.

Start time: 2262.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got lovely. You've got lipstick, everything.  So I'm just figuring you probably of all people see they people.  I say, oh, I don't want I'm not going to wear a watch.  And so people say, well, you're not you're a you're a geek.  You're not a good.  So look, we brought an actual woman onto the show.

Start time: 2281.10
End time: 2282.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 2282.92
End time: 2286.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do you think?  First of all, the pebble. Would you get a pebble watch?  Would you wear that?

Start time: 2287.42
End time: 2307.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've worn a couple of these different types of iterations before there even was an iOS.  Samsung used to have one.  There used to be various ones that they vibrated on your wrist  to let you know that your purse, your phone was ringing on your purse.  That's kind of fun stuff.  But I am into this quantified self.  The whole notion of what that you the quantified self.  No, I agree with you. What is it?

Start time: 2308.04
End time: 2311.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's like the Nike Fuel Band or the Jawbone.

Start time: 2311.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Up is quantified self. Yeah.

Start time: 2314.48
End time: 2328.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Ocean that you keep information about your body, like you wear one of those sleep  trackers and you wear a Fitbit and you keep all your calories in your iPad app.  And, you know, you have all this information.  You've quantified yourself in order.

Start time: 2328.50
End time: 2330.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds more like the neurotic self.

Start time: 2330.74
End time: 2337.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it is super neurotic, but it's also super addicting.  It is addicting.  That's why this stuff is taking off, though.

Start time: 2337.88
End time: 2345.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who is it? There's somebody who's doing this like in a very serious way right now.  He's like got measurements of everything going on.  I'm trying to remember.

Start time: 2345.88
End time: 2359.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tim Ferriss does. Tim does this?  Yeah. If you read his most recent book, he talks about how he has logs of every workout  he's ever done for like 30 years.  And yeah, it seems kind of what's the I don't want to use the word self involved.

Start time: 2359.90
End time: 2363.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Narcissistic, self-centered, solid, kind of data.

Start time: 2365.14
End time: 2379.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Once you do a little bit of it, though, then you want it for everything.  It's really a slippery slope from stepping on the scale every day to then knowing your  weight and your caloric intake and your heart rate and your resting heart rate.  So I think that's that's why I'm most interested in this Apple watch.

Start time: 2379.64
End time: 2394.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were saying at CES that this was the CES of quantified self and they did have a  whole section at the Consumer Electronics Show.  But there were only one did anything besides heart rate and steps.  And there was one that did oxygen, blood oxygen level.

Start time: 2395.06
End time: 2410.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm actually reviewing that for BYB.  Are you? But that one isn't a wrist.  I don't have the wrist.  Does it have to pierce your fingers?  No, no, no.  I don't have the wrist model.  You you actually walk up to it and put your thumb on it and it can take blood oxygen level.  And you do that like once or twice a day.

Start time: 2410.74
End time: 2418.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you find it's not non-standard.  You find the number to be off standard and you do what?  Well, that's the thing.  That's breathe more.

Start time: 2418.20
End time: 2432.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Take a walk.  Eat an apple.  And once you take it one day, it seems like you kind of have that information.  You don't really need it once a day.  Well, yeah, you do.  If it if it's if it fluctuates.  I mean, I guess mine doesn't fluctuate enough for me to feel like I need it.

Start time: 2432.18
End time: 2452.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  We don't have enough information.  It's not that we don't want the information.  But what if you knew all of this stuff?  There's a new diet program, for instance, to take a cheek swab.  They look at it's like 23andMe, but they look only at the alleles for weight.  And then they prescribe a physical diet regimen.  They send you food based on the alleles you have.  That's stupid.

Start time: 2453.44
End time: 2552.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just all about getting more.  I mean, all of these things are about getting more precise, right?  About the things you do.  There's lots of things that we do and we're not sure what the impact is.  And right. So the Fitbit thing.  The thing is, is once you do a little bit of this, then you start to want more of it.  Like I'd like to take my Fitbit.  Like when I go to the gym, I wish it was an ecosystem, right?  Like my Fitbit could talk to each of the machines that you're on and sort of take the data of like, OK, I did that machine.  I did this one. My workout on that one was this.  And then it could suck all that data in. Right.  And then over time, you could compare and look at, OK, when I was working on these machines, you know, this was working versus that.  And so the thing is, we actually don't have enough data.  We have more data than than we had in the past when you track your activity.  But in the same sense, once you start looking at some of it, then you're like, well, OK, I need a lot more to actually make an accurate measurement.  And so the Apple could come in and be, I think, a player in this.  And that's where I hope they're going with this watch thing, not not kind of what Pebble is doing.  But I have to actually like Natalie, I'm hoping that it's more of a fitness or activity tracker.  And then it creates an ecosystem, right, where the same way the iPod and iPhone has, where, you know, you can then connect to whatever their ecosystem is.  Unfortunately, it'll be a closed Apple ecosystem, but maybe it'll be a start and there'll be others as well of ecosystems of activity where these things,  through Bluetooth or whatever, then can connect to and give you more data, for instance, in a gym and with gym machines and that kind of stuff.

Start time: 2552.68
End time: 2618.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Google tried to do this with Google Health, but that's since been closed down.  But I think what you're trying to get at here is the term for it.  I think we can call this an issue of standardization because the data exists in various kind of platforms.  Like I wear a Polar at the gym, which is a heart rate monitor, which does talk to the treadmill.  But then I have to go and actually physically connect that to my computer and it doesn't go into lose it, which I like to use to track my weight.  And it doesn't it can, you know, talk to Fitbit.  And so my husband Clayton's talking to a doctor recently and he said if there was someone could be private enterprise that came along and enabled us to access that data of the  quantified self and then as a physician, you could treat someone so much better.  But now, you know, physicians have their own software and consumers have, you know, the quantified cell software and mostly that's for fun.  But if that could stop being for fun and stop being used in the medical community, then we've got gold.  Is Apple capable of that?  I don't know. Google gave up a long time ago, but, you know, Microsoft did too.  I forgot about that. Yeah.

Start time: 2618.48
End time: 2639.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said that you both use an interesting word, though, addictive.  And if Apple is going to do something, I think that's something they're looking at.  It's what you want, isn't it?  You want something that's whether good or bad, so compelling that people can't stop doing it once they start getting these measurements.  I hadn't really thought of the eye watch as being a biometric device, but I think you might be on to something.

Start time: 2640.36
End time: 2643.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But even if it's not, you can create an app for us to make it that.

Start time: 2643.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Instead of pulling my phone out of my pocket every 30 minutes.

Start time: 2645.40
End time: 2657.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's that's what everybody assumed the eye watch was, was something that ties to your phone, tells you text.  And that's what Pebble does, tells you text messages, alarms and stuff like that.  But that's not as compelling, is it, as something that goes a little farther?

Start time: 2659.08
End time: 2685.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I agree. I mean, I have a fuel band and I use it.  And it's pretty basic in terms of the information that it actually gives you.  There's always questions about its accuracy.  But I also I don't I don't know if I see Apple being the kind of company that's going to bring all of this.  Well, they have the Nike. They really want to get involved in your medical.  They did the Nike thing early on, didn't they?  The Nike. Yeah, the Nike plus integration with the today.

Start time: 2685.58
End time: 2688.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2688.68
End time: 2695.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But and Runkeeper, which has been around for a long time, anybody who's a runner probably knows about the Runkeeper app and they keep track of your runs.  They've created a larger database system to keep track of everything there.  I think there is a move towards making an API for all this so that you're these these devices can write to some central.  Then there's the privacy issue, which you talked about last week.  And I think that's probably why Google closed Google Health is because people were too nervous about giving us about there's HIPAA and other stuff.  And I think people were nervous about telling Google.

Start time: 2726.28

But then Bloomberg really got the story with they said, no, there's two.  They had to name two executives.  They said 100 man team on this I watch.

Transcript:  Let's see.  And just as long as we got Apple in the news,  let's go through a few more Apple stores.  Amazing. Tim Cook was speaking at the Goldman Sachs Conference  and was talking a little bit about the the Apple stores,  120 million people last quarter alone visiting Apple stores.  The the the rate of growth is astronomical.  Store visitors versus the stores open the number the 20 of the stores,  they're closing, moving and making them bigger.  In addition, adding 30 more stores, 13 countries.  The average number of visitors per store going up dramatically.  Just the Apple store, huge success, huge success.

Transcript:  Yeah. This this gets lost too much when we think about the success of Apple  over the past five years, ten years.  The stores, I mean, it's such a it's such a opposite trend, right?  So much of retail is struggling.  So much of tech retail is really struggling.  And at the same time, Apple opens these stores and all of a sudden now,  not only is it making so much more money on products, right?  When it sells them itself through these stores.  But, you know, it uses it as a way to just get products to the market  and control the user experience and make more money than anybody else  in retail right now. It's insane.  It's completely counterintuitive.  It was a big risk when they started doing it.  And it's one of the main things that has driven their their success.  And like Johnson, it's actually smart that somebody like Microsoft,  why wouldn't you do it?  You know, Samsung should be doing it, too. They are.  Samsung is. And they are.  Actually, they are.

They've already been you see this in airports.  In fact, that's I think that picture is from an airport.

Transcript:  Yeah. But in the same way that the iPad was one of those products  that you couldn't necessarily get on board with, I think,  until you got it in your hands.  And that's what one of the Apple stores was one of the main things that drove that.  They could be the same could be true with Chromebooks.  I mean, people that I know that are using them, normal people, not like,  you know, people on this call actually like them.  I mean, you know, it doesn't really do enough for me yet to get that interested in it.  But most of the people that once they get their hands on it, they actually say,  you know what, there are some things I can't do and I wish I could edit photos better  or do that. But for most of the stuff I do, it's a fine as a second piece.  You're talking about a Chromebook, a Chromebook.  I'm sorry. Yes, a Chromebook.

Well, they're not just showing you a tablet and a phone because that sounds kind of boring,  but they're showing you all these cool ideas that you can maybe do with their technology.  You know, obviously in Kansas City, they're showing here's all the cool stuff we can do  when, you know, ubiquitous gigabit Internet is a reality.  And I think that's really would get people interested that they would, you know,  make a date, so to speak, to go out there and see these types of these types of  demonstrations and examples and setups.

It's kind of unclear.  And we will probably, I'm guessing, cover that announcement live right after triangulation on Wednesday.  So you can watch live coverage of the PlayStation four announcement.  Maybe Ryan, you'd like to come back before Twitch and join us and talk a little bit about that.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at audible.com, the greatest bookstore in the world.

Stephen Levy's in the Plex, How Google Thinks Works Shapes Our Lives.  They've got a lot of technology books, but they also have fiction as well.  A lot of great literature history, too.  I read a lot of biographies. Here's a new one.  I can't wait. Boy, this is going to be dynamic.  The Calvin Coolidge biography is now out.  Twenty one hours of Calvin Coolidge.  You hardly knew him.  Actually, I loved and highly recommend the John Adams biography, which I did read by David Attenborough.  Is it David Attenborough? No. Who wrote that?  Anyway, wonderful book.  Here's the deal.

David McCullough wrote that and narrates the great.  Oh, I love it. He narrates the unabridged.  But I mean the abridged, but I would get the unabridged because it is such a great story.

This is David McCullough's book, most recent book, The Greater Journey, Americans of Paris.  Edward Herman narrated that. I loved that.  That was a great story about how Americans in the 19th century all went to Paris.  That was the place to go.  If you were a physician, it was the best medical schools.  If you were an artist, if you were a writer, you had to go to Paris in the 19th century.  Really great stuff.  Well, you could see there's just a ton of great books.  So pick a couple.

So Wednesday afternoon, I think it's in the evening, East Coast.  It's in New York City. Are you going to go up for that, Ryan?  No, no.  Sony invited me, but I just I don't know if I want to take a day and go there and all of that.  What do we expect for the PlayStation 4?  You know, I got the impression, apparently, I misread the Engadget post on this, as others did,  that it wasn't going to be a very big deal.  But you say probably an AMD chip in this.

Start time: 3889.60
End time: 3966.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely going to be an AMD chip.  And I know that for a couple of reasons.  One is AMD has been heavily promoting a campaign there.  They you know, they're a four pronged attack and one of them is consoles.  And they say, you know, they said this at CES at one of their press conferences that we are in next generation consoles.  And, you know, they're basically coming out and saying that they're going to be the chip inside the new Xbox, the PlayStation.  They're already inside the Wii U.  I've also just been talking to a lot of people in the industry know that they are in there.  And then it was actually in late January, rumors came out, information came out, leaked out about the developers systems for the new PlayStation.  And we posted it on PC per on the 23rd of January.  And they were it was an eight core AMD bulldozer processor, eight gigs of system memory and an AMD,  what they call it, an R 1000 based GPU, which is essentially what we know today as the HD seven thousand series for for gaming PC.  So it's pretty obvious that it's going to be an AMD part, both X 86 for the processor and, you know,  more traditional GPU design than what you have in the Sony PlayStation three.  I think the cell is gone for sure.

Start time: 3967.14

Transcript:  AMD owns ATI, so ATI graphics.

Start time: 3970.76
End time: 4031.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ATI graphics, the same thing as AMD, Radeon graphics and that kind of stuff.  So what's what's interesting about that is you're going to have there's there's some debate on whether or not it's going to be an APU,  which is a single piece of silicon that combines CPU and GPU into a single chip or if it's going to be a discrete processor and a discrete graphics chip separate there.  I kind of lean towards having them separate because it allows them a little bit more flexibility on the manufacturing side.  And they'll probably be able to get higher performance stuff out of kind of separating those two those two components.  But if that happens, you'll see the new PlayStation, the new Xbox, the Wii U and PCs all basically using the same fundamental architecture.  And I think, you know, you always hear a lot on gaming where it costs so much to make games because you have to do all this work for asset creation and that kind of thing.  And you always have to worry about is it a port to a PC?  Is it a PC game with a port to a console?  And that would kind of be out of the discussion at that point.

Start time: 4031.78
End time: 4036.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, would you would it be easy to take a PC game and make it work on those platforms?

Start time: 4037.38
End time: 4096.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Interesting.  Assuming that Sony continues to use a Linux based operating system, you know, they're using essentially OpenGL.  The Xbox is using basically DirectX and the PC can run both of those.  And I think it makes it interesting.  If you have the same architecture across all those platforms, one, how do you how do these companies start to differentiate themselves?  How does Sony differentiate from Microsoft, differentiate from the PC?  And then what are these software developers going to be able to do?  I think it's it's great news for PC gaming as well, because they've over the last five years, they've kind of, you know, kind of fallen off, right?  Everybody develops for the high dollar income you get on the Xbox and the PlayStation.  And then, OK, we'll we'll throw some money and we'll make a port for the PC.  Whereas here, if you develop for one, you can start with the super high end assets and compute requirements and then just scale that exact same code down to run on whatever consoles we're at.  And meanwhile, it'll still run great on PCs, probably better.

Start time: 4097.64
End time: 4104.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably a much needed move since no company can develop.  Well, some do, but it's hard to develop for all the platforms out there.

Start time: 4105.40
End time: 4123.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. And it's really fallen on game engines.  So if you look at the Unreal Engine, right, that's one cross platform.  The reason it's so popular is because of how well they built the cross platform compatibility into it.  There's a lot of other interesting things that could happen at the PlayStation.  I'm still not 100 percent convinced that they're going to announce the hardware.

Start time: 4124.16

Start time: 4128.40
End time: 4165.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it'll be more of a software and infrastructure announcement that maybe gets started at the end.  And then they'll wait till E3 till June.  Yeah, it just seems really early, unless they're going to surprise everybody, announce that it's going to be available in the middle of the year.  But if they're still targeting, you know, a holiday 2013, it just seems I don't know.  You're giving yourself you're giving your competition too much of a window to figure out and change whatever they want to change to make themselves look that much better in product announcements.  You know, the reason you hold back as long as possible is because you don't want your competition to have time to react and change their strategy.

Start time: 4165.80
End time: 4168.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So don't announce the product unless it's available or soon to be available.

Start time: 4168.94
End time: 4183.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, announcing something in February that's not going to be available until October or November.  Doesn't make any. It doesn't make any sense.  That's why I think it'll be more of a maybe a software and philosophy type announcement that they're going to fly out.

Start time: 4202.17
End time: 4239.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. Yeah, I don't know. It could be interesting.  You're talking about a I kind of like the idea of maybe of a small display that was maybe also a touch screen.  I don't know if anybody remembers the Dreamcast.  Love the Dreamcast. A long time ago and had these little modules that went in the controller.  And it had it was, you know, really basic looking display.  But, you know, you could do cool things like pick a play in Madden or, you know, draw a card or whatever.  Your opponent didn't have to see it, even if you're playing it on the same TV.  And I think, you know, that would be useful if not particularly necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They they acquired a company called Gaikai about six to eight months ago, I guess, maybe six months ago.  That that does streaming games. Right.  They Gaikai is a company that made the stuff developed technologies and like Samsung TVs to do some game streaming on on par,  if not better than what on live does.  And Sony acquired them. And so everybody automatically assumed that some people assumed, well, the PlayStation 4 is just going to be a dummy console.  And you're going to stream your game. Right. That's not going to be the case.

Start time: 4290.36
End time: 4292.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yet some sort of compatibility is needed. Right.

Start time: 4293.98
End time: 4331.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it used to be when PlayStation 3 first launched, it had backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 titles.  Remember that later PlayStation 3s did not have that.  They actually took that feature away and it didn't seem to cause too much of a pain.  You know, I don't think that's really an expected feature at this point anymore, which is disappointing.  But I don't really think I don't really think it's a necessary feature.  But if they can offer if they say, hey, for fifteen dollars a month, you have access to your to our full PlayStation 3 library streaming, then it's not ideal.  It's not perfect, but it's it's good.

Transcript:  And Xbox 720 in June.  Or next generation next generation. Well, Microsoft, I think even said, yeah, the next.  Well, maybe not. But that's the impression I got.  The next generation Xbox would be at E3. E3 is in June. Right.

Start time: 4349.52
End time: 4377.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that would make sense. I, you know, if I think that was that is where all the big announcements are happening.  I'm planning on flying out to L.A. for E3 for the first time in seven or eight years because I imagine there's going to be a lot of hardware discussion that goes on.  And people want to compare the implementations from Sony and Microsoft in that regard.  Nvidia is going to talk about their shield gaming device and all that kind of stuff.  So June will be particularly busy for gaming hardware.

Transcript:  Is there a race? Is there a race to announce between the PS4 and the next version, next version of Xbox?  That's the only thing I wonder is maybe maybe there's a race to see who announces first.  It might be a little bit of a game of chicken because kind of like, you know, it's it's one of those things of you don't want to announce pre announced too early.  But at the same time, you do a lot of times want to announce before your competition to look like the first to the party.  And so I don't know. Just throwing it out.

Start time: 4436.56
End time: 4478.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think maybe the the problem is if if if there's so much news at E3, nobody really gets the time to focus on your particular product.  So it's kind of like you keep seeing earlier pre announcements at CES, right?  Everybody wants to do something today before.  Now everybody wants to do something two days before because they want all the attention on them.  The problem with the E3 schedule is typically that one day is the the Sony press conference, like is at night.  And then the next morning is the Microsoft press conference.  Right. And that doesn't give the media enough time to maybe digest all the PlayStation news that they would have.  So that would be the only reason I would think they would want to go early.  I just think this is really early to be spilling out all the details about a next gen console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. If you're doing an AMA, you know you're going to be asked that ahead of time.  And actually, he he has some sense of humor.  He he tweeted that.  He says, Bill Gates, thanks for a great AMA Reddit.  And then in the tweet, he puts the picture of that picture, that horrible picture of him mooney modeling,  modeling on a on IBM PC and captioned it, still trying to delete this photo from the Internet.  Any ideas? That shows a little sense of humor.  I think he's got somebody doing that for him.

Start time: 4562.04
End time: 4589.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a smart guy. Yeah.  But when you're a CEO, you're not going to say a lot of stuff.  So when you're kind of you know, he talked a lot and this was all about promoting his chairman at the CEO.  But that's what I'm saying is now that he's not the CEO, he's still the chairman.  So, yeah, I don't know. I think he's a little more forthright than he used to be.  You can't be yakking away. He was promoting his vaccines for Africa.  Yeah, well, that's fine. He was on an 80 inch Windows 8 tablet.  He did say Windows 8 was a huge advance. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he did.

Start time: 4592.46
End time: 4599.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  As used. Well, you know what he said that I thought was interesting, I bet you, Ryan, this is what you're talking about.  He said when they asked him if he had any regrets or there was anything that he wished he'd put out that didn't get put out, he said, when FS the file.

Start time: 4638.10
End time: 4652.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember getting briefed on that and the idea of a database, a database based storage system still sounds really compelling rather than just a simple file structure.  But it never came to be. It still hasn't.

Start time: 4664.62
End time: 4697.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The cool thing was it was basically blowing up the whole idea of the hierarchy in the way files are organized in your system.  And it actually was pretty much ahead of its time.  Right. It was the idea that, you know, your stuff in your system, your data would be organized by tags, essentially by by the data that was actually in the files.  And you could you would more use your system by searching for things rather than going and digging through folders and files.  It would be the files would be associated with each other based on the data, the metadata that's in those files ahead of its time.

Start time: 4697.30
End time: 4713.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe this head of its time actually appeared in the I believe the late 60s when the PIC operating system first appeared or the 70s.  So did Microsoft license this by this?  No, they did. They never even hired anybody.  Dick Pick is the guy they should have hired.  I remember that. And this has been done.  Forget it.

Start time: 4714.56
End time: 4760.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the way systems are now.  Right. It's databases have gone this flat.  You know, we used to have these hierarchical databases that ran the Internet.  But before long, it was just it was too labor intensive for the machines to run them.  Right now, they're all run on these, you know, these flat NoSQL databases, they're called.  Right. And it's based just on this kind of thing.  So it was ahead of its time.  Although, to be honest, it's one of those things that's sort of a I don't know, it's sort of a given now.  Right. It's just stuff that's there.  I don't know how much of an effect it would have had on Windows.  And it sort of felt like a dodge to me that he picked when FS.  I don't think he was going to say anything that he was really upset about because they may still do it.  Right. So I think Bob, they'll never do it.

We decided to go to invent new vaccines for things like malaria and AIDS, to invent new seeds for farmers who need to go more.  He's plugging his foundation.  So if you're a poor farmer, if you're a child growing up who hasn't had access to these vaccines.  We'll give you money, but you know.  Those resources are for you, but otherwise we've already picked where all the money's going to go.

Start time: 5037.84

Transcript:  Yeah. The Valve SteamBox, which will bring PC gaming to the living room, in effect.  I apparently be running Linux, but we'll have Steam games on it.  Am I right on that?

Start time: 5051.50
End time: 5076.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So the Valve SteamBox is still up in the air exactly what kind of hardware it is.  But if you can get it around 300 bucks...  Yes. Well, yeah, that's kind of the idea.  It'll probably be AMD based as well,  just because they have a good combined CPU GPU thing.  Gabe has come out and said it will run Linux.  And the problem that that creates for Valve is that...

Start time: 5076.64
End time: 5078.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We heard Gabe Newell say how much he hates Windows 8.

Start time: 5080.16
End time: 5113.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but maybe to his benefit, Windows 8 hasn't really taken fire, right?  But the problem with saying it's going to run Linux is that there are very few games  in the Steam library that run on Linux.  If you look at it compared to what the Windows library is versus the Linux library.  So he needs to convince people to start building their games with Linux support.  And then you get into a little bit of the intricacies of which distro you're going to use.  You know, the graphics drivers aren't quite the same and easy to operate as they are in Windows.

Start time: 5113.56
End time: 5125.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the fact that Valve just laid off Jerry Ellsworth and 20 others  kind of imply that maybe they're not going to do a SteamBox?  I mean, she was working on hardware.  I have to get Jerry on the horn.

Start time: 5125.94
End time: 5210.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When they announced the layoffs, they said no current project was being cut in CUSPIC.  So I still think they're going to do it.  They've always said that they're going to make an official SteamBox,  but then they're going to give the plans out to other people to make derivatives.  The thing is, theirs was going to be more locked down.  You weren't going to be able to access the hard drive to install your own operating systems  and mods and that kind of stuff or play around with the operating system in the way you would  want to.  But the idea is to get PC gaming in front of the TV.  They did that with big picture mode that's currently available on Linux and Windows versions  and Mac versions, I think, of Steam.  They're doing it by kind of telling people to get controller optimizations in for all of their titles.  I think it's a great move.  Like I work in front of a computer all day.  So if I go home and I want to play a game, I really don't want to go upstairs to my office  and sit in front of my computer again.  So the idea of having it in front of the TV is really nice.  There's still the complication of hooking up a home theater PC to your TV.  You've got this whole keyboard mouse issue.  Do you really want to have a keyboard and mouse sitting on your coffee table?  I would say for the majority of consumers, they don't want that.  So you've got to rework all that kind of stuff.  I think Valve is probably the only company in the gaming world that would have the power to  really get that moving forward.

No, we aren't canceling any projects.  No, we aren't changing priorities or projects we've been discussing.  No, this isn't about Steam or Linux or hardware or insert game here.  We are not going to discuss why anyone in particular is or isn't working here.

A handful of employees visited a mobile developer website that was compromised.  This has happened to everybody.  You go to a compromised website.  It hosted an exploit.  I believe it was a Java exploit which allowed malware to be installed on the employees' laptops.  It sounds like they caught it right away.  They probably have very good security at Facebook.  It did raise the issue and some have written about it.  That it must only be a matter of not if but when Facebook has a major breach that reveals.

Transcript:  And then what happens?  Then what happens?  As soon as we discovered the presence of malware,  we remediated all infected machines and formed law enforcement.  Began a sophisticated investigation.  No user data was compromised.  But that happens all the time because if you've got a laptop,  you get out on an unprotected network.  And if you've got Java installed,  they said all the updates were on the security was on that laptop.  This thing happens.  This happens.  You said you wanted to talk about the gadget purchase.  AOL brings Ryan Block back into the fold and Peter Rojas,  the founder of Engadget, Peter Rojas and its editor-in-chief, Ryan Block, back at AOL.  They left AOL.  They left Engadget.  They said not with bitterness in our hearts.  That's the way it sounded to me.  I seem to remember if I think back that they were very glad to get out of AOL.

Transcript:  Not a bad payday.  I think gdgt.com is very different than Engadget.  They really turned into a review aggregation site,  which I think was a smart move.  And so because they did that,  it integrates very well into Engadget's offerings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all user-generated content, really.  They did some really interesting things, I thought,  that they were trying to get users to talk about their experiences  with the product and crowdsourcing, essentially,  the idea of some of these user reviews.  Because let's face it, a lot of the things people do  when they want to know if they want to buy a product or not,  they're going to Amazon and checking out what users say about it.  And so I think that what gdgt was doing was trying to say,  well, let's take advantage of some of that.  Instead of just a basic review, let's let them do some more stuff.  And then let's let you pick the products you want to follow.  And then when there's new stuff said about those products,  you can get updates on that.  I think it's a pretty good strategy.  And probably AOL, if it wanted, could use that  to expand beyond technology reviews.  They could apply that to other categories and stuff.

Transcript:  It's kind of a Rotten Tomatoes thing,  where they combine official reviews with user reviews to give a score.  It's very clearly based on Rotten Tomatoes.  So for instance, the gadget score for the Windows Surface 8 Pro  is a 75.  They give a short synopsis.  And then they show a synopsis of critic reviews, user reviews.  So you get an idea of how people who use it are feeling  and how people in the trade press reviewed it.  I think this is very valuable.

Transcript:  If you have the right tools, it could be pretty good.  Our good buddy, Russell Tammany, who is our IT professional here, he works at Exponential.  He's what they call a managed service provider.  And it's very interesting to hear how he does his job.  He's got over 500 clients, three people, and they can handle them all.  And it's because of...  He was using another program.  We've got him moving over to go to assist.  He says, this is exactly what I'm looking for.  It's less expensive than what I've been using.  And it gives me all the tools I need to do this kind of managed service.  Take a look at the different modules now.  You're probably familiar with go to assist remote support.  That's the original, the best, the fastest.  Deliver live support to PCs, Mac, to mobile devices from anywhere.  You could do it unattended.  You could do up to eight sessions at once.  They have apps for iPad and Android devices, so you can do it on the road.  It is fantastic.  But now they've added two new modules.  The monitoring module, which lets you track performance.  So what you do is you set up a dashboard.  They have some pre-designed stuff, but you can also create your own  that monitors things like server and network health, hard drive capacity, toner, cartridges.  You can inventory all the IT assets, hardware plus software, track network usage patterns,  and then get text messages or instant messages or email when there's an issue.  So you can immediately get in there with remote support and fix it.  The service desk optimizes your workflow, lets you keep track of things,  including release and configuration management, track and resolve tickets.  It's just, I want you to try this.  You get all three of these modules for free for 30 days.  If you go to the website, go to assist.com, click the try it free button  and use our offer code TWIT.  30 days free.  The new service desk is really cool.  This is everything you need to be more effective, to be a support hero.  Go to assist.com.  The offer code is TWIT.  Please do try it free today.  So I like this Tesla S.  I've driven in a 17 inch screen, a beautiful car,  and they claim the largest range of any electric vehicle out there.  What is it?  223 miles, something like that?  Or 230 something.  It's a large distance.  And they approached a New York Times motor reporter.

Start time: 6040.22
End time: 6048.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, no, I think he was a different, he wasn't technically a motor reporter.  Oh, he isn't.  He's a regular general interest reporter.  He does his political stuff.  John Broder.

Start time: 6048.88
End time: 6098.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he does a lot.  But they did go to him.  And they said, John, we are so proud of the range.  We think you can drive a Tesla S and take a road trip.  Now, this is something you typically don't do in an electric vehicle,  because the range isn't so high.  But we've got so much range.  And we've got these superchargers all up and down the East Coast.  So we invite you to test drive it driving from, I think, New York to D.C.  Or no, I'm sorry, D.C.  To Boston.  To Boston.  Now, he is the Washington Bureau reporter for the Times,  responsible for the coverage of energy, environment, and climate change.  So he does cover this, but kind of peripherally.  He's not an automotive reporter.  Right.  He had all sorts of problems.  It was very cold, for one thing.  And one of the problems you have with these lithium ion batteries is  their charge, their capacity goes way down.

Start time: 6098.44
End time: 6102.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of problems with them in cold weather.  Not to mention.  There are people that are working on that.  Of course.

Start time: 6103.08
End time: 6117.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not to mention, you also want to turn on the cabin heat  because you're freezing.  It's below 30.  And that depletes the battery even more.  Well, it shouldn't do that much.  He got to Brantford, Connecticut, couldn't reach the supercharger station in time.  Car broke down, had to be towed.

Start time: 6118.58
End time: 6153.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the funny point of this was that when the battery went dead on him,  he couldn't and he needed to tow the car.  It has one of the...  And I do not like these, by the way.  Cadillac Volt has this.  It has one of those...  Chevy Volt?  You know, I've always thought...  Because if Cadillac makes a Volt, I'm bothered.  No, the Chevy Volt.  I make that.  That's a mistake I make because ever since I tested that car,  I kept saying, why don't they put the Cadillac moniker on this thing?  Why is it a Chevy?  But anyway, they have this brake that's an electronic brake.  So you push a button and then your brake comes on.  However...  It locked because the battery was dead.

Start time: 6153.64
End time: 6164.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you turn off the car, he admits, I made a mistake.  I knew I wasn't supposed to...  I turned off the car.  Now the brake no longer functions.  Yeah, it was locked.  It stopped.  So they had to call Tesla.  The tow truck guy had to call Tesla and say, how do you move this thing?

Start time: 6164.92

End time: 6200.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.  The way I saw this thing, and people should read my column in MarketWatch.com.  He was speeding.  And that's the key.  He just chewed up the batteries by going too fast.  He was supposed to set it some 50 something miles an hour so he can max out.  But he was doing 80.  I mean, this thing was not going to last.  It was just basically burning out the batteries.  This is what happened on Top Gear when the guy's racing it around and the thing dropped dead.

Start time: 6200.90
End time: 6234.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the funny thing.  It did not drop dead on Top Gear.  Top Gear, in fact, Elon Musk said, we found the script where they had written,  okay, and then we're going to push the thing into...  It had plenty of charge left, but it was part of the story on Top Gear that an electric car  could run out.  It never did on Top Gear.  So Elon Musk in his blog post says, ever since that happened,  we started logging what's going on with these cars.  They got a black box.  They got all this information anyway so that we could rebut any lies.  He went on.  He said this is...

Start time: 6234.64
End time: 6263.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way he got to New York Times guy, the Times guy admitted in his blog post that,  well, yeah, I guess I wasn't keeping...  I did put the cruise control on for a while, but I've tested these cars, not this one,  but you can't...  Especially these newer cars that got these great suspensions.  These cars want to do 80.  And so you're driving along at really high speeds trying to get to where you're going.  And in this case, he ran out of juice.  Well...  Yeah, there it is.  There's the blog.

Start time: 6263.72
End time: 6268.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He shows the charging and he points out that at one point at the Norwich Supercharge,  he stopped even though it was only 28%.  Musk makes the claim that Broder was trying...  He wrote an intentionally negative...  I don't believe that.  Hit piece.  I think...  Hit piece.  And I think Broder's rebuttal is fairly clear that he didn't write a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with the fact that it doesn't do all things.  No car does everything.  And if you're going to buy an electric vehicle,  you should probably not be using it in the freezing climates.  You certainly shouldn't try to hit its 265-mile range.  There aren't enough superchargers out there to help you in this respect anyway.

Because all these things that you're using,  there could be tracking technology on the smartphones or laptops  or other things that people review.  And yeah, it's interesting that Musk had the chutzpah, right?  To say, you know what, go pull the logs and we're going to look at what he did.  And I think he's...  I don't think he's being forthright.  We're going to look at him and if he's not, we're going to publish him.  And we're going to take this to task.  Out him.  So we're going to out him, exactly.  So that's what he did.  And I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen again, right?  It's part of the world we live in where privacy is not privacy.

Transcript:  Matthew Ingram wrote a great, I thought a great piece that really,  to me, this is the big lesson of all of this.  The leveling of the media playing field, he calls it.  He says, here's what's different is that Elon Musk is not merely the CEO of Tesla.  Tesla is not just a car company.  It's a media company now.  And because Tesla has a blog and Musk has a blog, they can, instead of just, you know,  going crazy and calling the editor and saying, hey, how dare you retract that?  They can write a piece that gets absolutely every bit as much attention,  maybe more than the New York Times piece.  They can respond.  That's a big change.  That's maybe the biggest change of all here.  Matthew says Tesla is a media company now.  And every company is a media company because every company can have a blog  and have videos can do all of this.  Yeah, you can take that one.

Did you know that?  You look it.  Yeah.  David Weiner, Matthew Ingram talks about Dave Weiner who says,  it's the sources going direct.  People's identities that used to be seen primarily as sources of information for the news media  to rewrite are now just going direct, whether it's politicians, celebrities, or car companies.  They just go, and I think that's true, and I don't know if that's a bad thing.  It's confusing because you don't now know, do I trust John Broder?  Do I trust the New York Times?  Do I trust Elon?  It's more confusing.  But you got more information.

Transcript:  It's got to be better to hear both sides of a dialogue, right?  I mean, just in general, if you're only hearing one side of an argument,  regardless if it's supposed to be from the press that's supposed to be on the consumer side,  they should be allowed to respond.  Especially, this might be a little bit overly aggressive, I think, is an understatement maybe.  But I think it's useful.  You're talking about how much damage can this one article do to their brand and their future sales  if they believe it's completely false?  They should be able to defend themselves.  If they happen to be able to do it in the public domain, then that's fine.

Start time: 6640.86
End time: 6673.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  I thought the whole thing was actually pretty fascinating.  And in the end, we learned a lot more about what really happened in the test drive,  and we sort of sussed out the whole thing that this car isn't necessarily one that you should  take a long way.  Or as Leo said, if you're in a cold climate or if you're going, you're going to push that  200 miles, 250 miles, really think again about it.  And I think that's the takeaway that all of us learned from the whole thing.  It was kind of interesting theater as well.  And I don't think it was a bad thing.

Transcript:  From a PR standpoint, it may not have been the smartest thing Musk did, honestly.  I would have never read this story if Elon Musk hadn't responded to it.  Right.  I would have never known hardly anything about the New York Times story.  The fact that he blogged about it and then it turned into this whole incident  brought a lot more attention to all of the criticism.  So that's the thing.

Start time: 6835.66
End time: 7017.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They keep on doing it.  You know we talk about squarespace.com all the time.  They're a really fabulous place to host your website.  They've got the best servers, best hosting out there.  Never goes down.  Can handle all sorts of traffic.  They've got the best content management on system on top of it.  Now they've added Squarespace Commerce.  This is so exciting.  It lets you set up an online store, manage and sell products through your Squarespace site.  Everything you need.  You create a professional website, blog portfolio, online store.  If you're a photographer, you can sell your photos.  It is just incredible.  The price is right too, as always.  The e-commerce solution is integrated to work with every single template on Squarespace.  You can sell physical or digital goods.  If you don't have a merchant account, don't worry.  They have a setup that makes it very easy so you can accept payments from credit or debit cards  right away.  They can even give you tracking of inventory, email updates.  It'll print shipping labels, add coupons.  All you need is the business plan subscription.  So go to squarespace.com, set up that site.  You don't need a credit card.  You've got two weeks.  Just sign in and set up the store.  Set up an all-in-one platform that has a great website, hosting that never goes down,  and then a store.  Look at the pricing on this.  It's fantastic.  They don't take a cut of your sales.  You go to squarespace.com.  The basic plan, of course, $8.  The unlimited plan, $16 a month when you buy an annual plan.  That includes unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, unlimited bandwidth.  You never get a bill for excess bandwidth.  You never get shut down for using too much.  Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  $24 a month.  Now you've got fully integrated e-commerce and everything else,  including the unlimited bandwidth and storage.  You get tax, shipping, coupon controls, inventory, tracking.  Man, this makes this even better.  If you're looking to sell online, if you're looking for a great website,  if you're looking for a portfolio, this is the place to go.  We've talked about Squarespace before, and this was the one piece of the puzzle.  And now that they've added this, and of course,  it took them a while because they wanted to do it right.  These guys are the best.  Squarespace.com, as little as $24 a month.  Do sign up for the annual plan for a couple of reasons.  One, they'll register a custom domain name for you and hook it up.  But the other is you can take 10% off your first purchase as a new account.  When you use the offer code TWIT2, that 10% saves most, of course,  when you buy an annual plan.  Squarespace.com.  Use the offer code TWIT2 when you decide to buy.  You don't need that, though, when you just want to try it.  There was a great video.  Let me see if we can find it on the verge of the CEO of Adobe.  He's being asked why Adobe products cost $1,400 more in Australia  than they do in the US.  And that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a question, which I know my readers universally ask.  What I'm going to ask you.  How can Adobe possibly justify charging up to $1,400 more  for the exact same software delivered in Australia,  delivered over the internet with no boxed copy compared to US prices?

Start time: 7054.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

We're not talking about the future of the company.  And we think that's the best offering for customers.  We really believe that if you look at what we've done with pricing.

You're going to rent it from us into a yearly subscription.  There was such a backlash, right?  And they were a little scared of it.  So they backed off on that, but they've wanted to do this since 2001.  Since they released XP, XP was supposed to be the end of numbered windows.  Right.
