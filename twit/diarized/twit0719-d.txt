Start time: 335.05
End time: 376.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It okay  So I this is my feeling towards it is that once you make a mythos or characters  Development you need to follow through with that if some character has a certain set of personality traits a certain  Lineage a certain way about them  You can't then make a 180 switch or change that or just throw out like the the threads of story that you've started that  Bothers me you have to follow the own rules your own rules of the game that you play and so once they deviated from the books  They didn't really have this great template and they just kind of did things willy-nilly for absolutely no reason  Characters that are brilliant are suddenly idiotic characters that are conniving are suddenly naive that intensely bothers me

Start time: 377.14
End time: 386.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they say that George RR Martin sat down with Benny off and the other guy and  Told him what was gonna happen. So they had the outline

Start time: 387.76
End time: 414.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But once once they they got they did not place in a certain character  From the books and change things and then George RR Martin was really angry with them. Oh, so you've been keeping up with the gossip  Way  Far into the gossip actually and so they were kind of left on their own and then they do things just  Because everyone knows about it. They're like, oh everyone thinks it's gonna be this thing  So we have to shock just for shock value and I think that's bad storytelling

Start time: 415.50
End time: 469.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really good article and I won't go too deep into it because it is a spoiler laden article in Scientific American by the great Zainab  Tufekhi who is a brilliant sociologist and  She came up with a sociological  Explanation that she says the real reason fans hate the last season of Game of Thrones somewhat what you were talking about Georgia  She says most  Television is  Psychological it's based on characters and their development and their arc and the psych their psychology  She said one of the reasons we loved Game of Thrones is it wasn't it was  Sociological so that the characters in Game of Thrones  It was why in Game of Thrones you could kill off main care  You could spend a whole season with Ned Stark then kill him because it wasn't about the individuals  It was how about it was how individuals are affected by their circumstances  That's the sociological part is what's going on and and they followed those rules

Start time: 469.96
End time: 502.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did follow those like I used to be angry at the characters because they did something stupid and then they paid the price  Because of that now I'm angry at the writers because they like people have plot armor  They can go through like a hundred thousand like I will just say like the zombie apocalypse  They can go through a hundred thousand people and you know  Their plot armor will keep them safe and nothing is gonna happen to them and you either shouldn't put your characters in that place  Or you shouldn't you know, we should kill them off if there should be killed off  It shouldn't be that you don't have any worry or fear and things don't make any more logical sense

Start time: 503.42
End time: 506.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then I'm gonna tie this to technology in a second. So don't don't worry. Go ahead

Start time: 508.04
End time: 542.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just they they why are we only getting six episodes, right?  Something happened in the last episode that I'm gonna try hard not to spoil. Wait, you've seen it already  No the previous episode. Okay. Okay. Don't tell me I know this character was gonna do a thing throughout the whole season  All the books this character was always gonna do this thing  And then a character in the last episode turns to this other character and says you don't want to do that and the character says  Oh, no, you're right. I'm gonna bounce  The problem is is that we used to get spent two or three episodes of that building out

Start time: 543.64
End time: 546.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  69 episodes getting them ready to do this thing

Start time: 546.74
End time: 551.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So never mind just had two additional episodes this season. I don't think anyone would be angry

Start time: 552.66
End time: 729.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So to to fecky is saying in sociological storytelling the characters have personal stories and agency  Of course, we don't get rid of that, but they're also greatly shaped by institutions and events around them  The incentives for character behavior come from external forces and even influence their inner life. You're a psychologist George  I think you'll you understand this. This is actually how life is  And in plot driven fiction, especially television we throw out the circumstances and it's all about the internal life  People then fit she says their internal narrative to align with their incentives justifying and rationalizing their behavior along the way  I mean you could that's Game of Thrones, right?  She says  Understandings here's another example understanding Hitler's personality alone will not tell us much about the rise of fascism  So that question, you know the time machine if you could go back in time  Would you kill baby Hitler is irrelevant because it isn't the fact that Hitler existed that created Nazism  It was the times and and it didn't matter if Hitler was born because somebody else would have done it  Anyway, that's the sociological narrative as opposed to the great man theory or the the psychological narrative  She says this the problem we have now understanding what's happening in technology  Comes down to this exactly  that  It's we're in a sociological environment trying to understand it by saying what's going on in Mark Zuckerberg's brain  Does that make sense?  She says whether done well or badly the psychological internal genre leaves us unable to understand and react to social change  Arguably the dominance of the hero antihero narrative is also the reason we're having such a difficult time dealing with the current historic  technology transition and  She sees this in her research and writing  She says I encounter this obstacle all the time  There are a significant number of stories and books that talk about Zuckerberg or Sandberg or Dorsey or Bezos and going back to  Steve Jobs  And of course their personalities matter but only in the context of business models technological advances the political environment the  Lack of meaningful regulation the existing economic and political forces. It's much more complex  So to focus on the hero or antihero narrative is to is to simplify it so much. You can't understand what's going on  All right. I've said enough  Notice there were no spoilers there. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell Brian was talking about  So  Was not a I can't even know who you meant, but we'll talk next with you Brian  She got it  So was that make sense is that one of the reasons we're having difficulty understanding this very dramatic transition  We're going through I didn't mean to get so deep and philosophical right away  But I thought it was really interesting is that we were still thinking in terms of people

Start time: 731.14
End time: 742.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and is it is it also a question that the  So called characters in this story of tech maybe aren't even in control of their own narratives at this exactly

Start time: 743.46
End time: 764.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm. It's you know to say let's punish Mark Zuckerberg or even to say let's break up Facebook is to miss  What caused all that? It's like saying well if we killed Hitler as a baby  Did none of that would have World War two would never have happened. Of course it would have  If we if we didn't have Facebook we would have been compelled to invent them

Start time: 766.94
End time: 809.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you think  Well certainly someone I mean, you know Google laid the groundwork for the whole surveillance capitalism to quote  Yeah, that's what sure son as a buff says yeah all that all if if if you know you want to assign any sort of individual  Narrative to it. The only thing that happened was Zuckerberg was like, alright  That's a good business model for us people forget that that everyone was like well that they've got these trillions of page views  But what does that mean? They're just a better Yahoo. And and so he was smart enough to latch on to this larger  business model and and and trend in capitalism that that Google had pioneered and then  Did it just as well or maybe better than they did? So do you think really we can say? Oh, yeah

Start time: 809.74
End time: 825.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if it weren't if Larry Page and  Sergey Brin hadn't come along if Sheryl Sandberg hadn't then gone from Google to Facebook and handed the DNA  Over to Mark Zuckerberg. None of this would have happened. No, but that's what I'm saying is that this is

Start time: 826.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  those those were business models the idea that the most valuable thing in the world is information and data and  the the the thousands of data points that we emit like the ox the  The breaths we exhale like someone was gonna figure that out and it just so happened that Facebook needed a business model at the time  So right someone else would have come along so there would have been another, you know, maybe it would have been my space

End time: 967.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Humans we love the individual story because we kind of understand people because we are one  But it's a lot harder to kind of take in the whole scope of everything and say well  These are the forces and and I would say that if you're gonna regulate  Or if you're gonna try to solve this problem, you have to understand it at that level  You can't understand it at a level of well  These are interactions between people and we can fix this if we just get rid of the people or fix the people or throw them  It's the same thing for for liberals who look at the 2016 election and say oh that you know, what a miscarriage of justice  Even if Donald Trump hadn't come along  this is a trend worldwide this trend towards authoritarianism and nationalism is a trend worldwide and  It's you're not gonna understand it. If you if you say well, it's it's that guy's fault  I just by the way, I learned I hope this is true the ASL symbol for Donald Trump  By the way, if you'd like to know I think this is president and this is Trump  I was taught this a speaker of ASL  Don't know what that means, but I'm just saying  Now don't write me cuz that's could be just completely wrong  I just think it's if we're gonna understand it. We need to understand it in a broader sociological  Context than in than we do because we like to talk about people. Yeah  Yeah, and I mean it isn't about the people we'd like to blame sir. You know, it's all her fault  Nothing don't say anything don't say  Mr. Mobile nation, are you a mr. Mobile? Are you still into this? Are you all over the game? We talking Game of Thrones?

They just suddenly just stick whatever happened to ever died or was me last week on Game of Thrones  So I avoid the internet completely until I've watched it so I feel a little bit of relief either way  At least I'll be able to watch it.

It's like this will tell you  Not off not only how often you use your phone, but it will encourage you to not use your phone  If companies like one plus putting out Zen mode  we have all these companies building in features to stop you from overusing their own products and  I think there is an argument to be made that well, how much of that is  Leo as you said like virtue signaling and how much is we genuinely are worried about what these products are doing to you actually credit to

I still do things. I have people that don't do anything else. This is their avoidance technique  They lose themselves in technology and I love tech  I love tech like very strongly  But I don't have my kids freely just on technology because I know how addictive it can be and I see the  Aftermath of what happens as people get lost in technology  How many women and men young men do I see that you know see all of these wonderful beautiful people on Instagram?

People will show up for controversy like this is the one of it's caters to our basest instincts and YouTube has been  Making as a platform has been making money off of it for a long time  And so a bunch of creators and I mean  I think it's legitimate to do that in this obviously in the context of a television show or a  Film or even a legitimate enterprise on you know on a streaming media platform, but when you're ginning up fake  Conflict just so that you can get I mean, it's just not good for me

Transcript:  Yeah, it seems to me though  There's a little bit of cynicism among all of these people like Logan Paul and PewDiePie  Who are in now engaging in this as well? They see it generates views and it's a culture  that  Actually, what am I saying? Because I just read an interview with Howard Stern in  Which he disses podcasts  Because he says these podcasters ought to be in an environment where they have to get audience then they then  What when they get an audience like I have then they know and as I'm looking at you Howard  I think the things you did Howard, of course generated an audience, but there's nothing to be proud of  I'm proud of the fact that we do podcasts for a small audience because we try to we assume our audience is intelligent  Always a guarantee for pad ratings  And try and try to feed their brains not their libido's

Transcript:  Yeah, and the nicer part about that is that sometimes it works  I recently had an experience where I thought you know, I'm too late to cover this product. It was a galaxy fold video  I ran it with a stickier headline than I ordinarily would wasn't clickbait because I delivered on the question I asked  But it was a but what was the head? Let's hear pretty BuzzFeedy headline  I think it was something like did the galaxy fold kill foldables?  Well, thank you, but but it's so far a field from a normal headlines that  Actually, there was quite a bit of blowback and they'd be you know  Because YouTube shows you all the analytics and you can see what the sentiment is at very things like on reddit people were like  You're gonna you're not gonna last you're much longer if you keep putting headlines like that. So I'm like, okay. Well, thank you  I appreciate that. I appreciate that some people still appreciate, you know  What would today be characterized as a dull headline? So I think Leo you're right

Transcript:  but it's because it is the check of  At some point you have to come to terms with the fact that  Certain things are happening and you don't understand them, but that's because they're not for you  You know, I know they're not for me, right?  But like that's the point is that's sort of what what we've just been talking about  Like what George has been saying is like these are not the stars that we need to care about. They're not for us  They're not for us. Yeah, and so part of it is is  again, like, you know, my dad checked out of music in  1976 right and so, you know, he could appreciate rap and things like that  It's not for him it's like so but it's there's a difference between what you have to watch yourself is well, this is no good  Well, it's good for somebody and maybe it's not good for you, but that's fine  It doesn't have to be good for you.

Start time: 1967.63
End time: 2022.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  I think that that's why this is so important because you can like the wonderful thing about  Twitter and and many other podcasts there are others we can still have a civilized debate where we disagree with things and we are not going to  Attack each other personally and then you know, the pitchforks are gonna come at us  I think that that's the one problem with social media is that we have this  Hair-trigger effect of people become frightened of just saying one thing and then suddenly everyone's gonna hate on them  And they're gonna like lose all of their followers and it can be really horrible  But I think that we need to always check ourselves discuss things and be open-minded to the fact that maybe I'm wrong and I don't think that  That's often what happens and so we have this debate  Maybe I'm wrong  Maybe you're right when we kind of discuss it and then we can  Come to agreement think about it and deal with it if you are able to do that  Usually we'll come back to a semblance of you know  closer to the truth

Start time: 2023.96
End time: 2070.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Leo, I also want to come back and say having said all that and trying to be like, well, you know  I'm trying to have a governor on myself  What I said, I want tech to be better  There is bad stuff happening in this world that tech is the root cause of there are bad products out there  And so at the same time  Even I'm not saying don't call a bad actor or a bad product or a bad thing  You have to call it if it's bad  So it's what I'm saying is is you don't have to be old man waves cane at everything just because it's new  But there has to be some legitimacy to being 41 51 61 7 and be like it was better  There were things that were supposed to change the world for the better that it turned out didn't

Start time: 2071.16
End time: 2080.63

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I'm that's all I'm arguing for is arguing for doing things better. So identifying, you know, hey

Start time: 2089.24
End time: 2109.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something that's so powerful is the thing is that when companies who are now people at least in some parts of the world are now  Larger than many governments and countries make more income than many countries  How do we how do you rein that in once?  They have that much power and control and money and influence

Start time: 2110.24
End time: 2163.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the argument that I would make is that I think and this I I think this is coming true  In this very moment is that there are market incentives for doing things better as well  You know the the reason that  Instagram is so popular on you know, it's inside Facebook  So it's a it's a mood argument  But it's because it's not as painful to people as Facebook became  And so i've made the argument before that that the next the next  Generation of startups is going it's there's going to be an incentive to create a product that doesn't make people feel bad  One of the problems that we have is for the last decade or 15 years  You had when you never and you could never create a product where your addressable market was every human being on the planet before  and so that led to  Essentially the whole move fast to break things get big fast like but all of that low-hanging fruit has been picked

Start time: 2164.54

Transcript:  Invented in except for the fact that it's not just oh, this is virgin territory plant my flag  And get it you're going the only way you're going to be able to get  The the next billion users the five billion users or whatever is to not just be the first with the product that scales  but the product that scales because it offers a  Qualitatively better experience and you don't think it's possible

Start time: 2191.78
End time: 2207.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I do. Oh  Okay, so that's what i'm arguing. It's a good question. Can somebody come along and  Asked google or facebook after the network effect is kicked in  Is it possible to come along and make a better search engine or a better social network that it's going to be harder for the next generation

Start time: 2207.70
End time: 2216.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2216.56
End time: 2289.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To pick the low-hanging fruit. I would submit it's even more difficult but more it's going to be orthogonal  It's going to be it's not going to be the it's the wrong question to say who's going to make a better search engine than google  It's going to be what's the next thing  What's not going to you know, what's who's going to be a better social network than facebook?  it's what's the thing after social networks because  That happens all the time in technology those kind of they call them. I hate to use the phrase paradigm shifts happen all the time  discontinuities  There's a I would never have expected this in a million years in new yorker  This week in annals of technology talks about the indie web cal newport writes about mastodon  and uh  Microblog and these were the these were the top secret  Not intentionally, but they were the top secret replacements for twitter  and uh, you know, uh facebook  and  And there's actually an article about it in a massive mainstream  well respected article, uh the new yorker, uh, I don't think it's going to change anything but  There are people trying to i've been on both micro blog and uh mastodon and  The sad thing is there's nobody else there

End time: 2354.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right and I think the potential exists for people to get behind that though for ordinary people  I mean obviously seeing it in the new yorker is evidence enough that people are  That this facebook fatigue is is real and is the thing that is happening just outside tech circles  I had a lovely dinner about a month ago with three of my friends who I made before I got into the tech world  So they're theater friends. They are the they're the opposite in my circles of tech people good  Yeah, most of the time and we we sat down and all three of them had within the past six months left facebook  Of of their own accord and that was a that was a moment for me of of realization that oh wow  This is actually hitting normal people in a way that's  You know that eventually will affect  facebook's  numbers  and I I do wonder what the replacement for that is because i'm not leaving without a without a significant, uh,

Start time: 2355.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alternative, you know that does things better actually. That's exactly what cal newport writes in this new york article. He says, uh,  according to edison  Uh 15 million people have left facebook  Increasing numbers of teenagers are rejecting the ceaseless pressure for digital performance in march  Edison research released a report claiming that young people made up the largest  Share of the 15 million users facebook has lost since 2017  I should point out that when you have two billion users  Losing 15 million in two years. You probably lost more people than that because they died  Right, so that's gonna skew the numbers a little bit have an older yeah  To be 16 and offline  And this kind of supports what you said georgia has become countercultural like a cool thing  I'm offline man  So the theater people are offline, but you know what's different about theater folk?  And there are many things  But they have a very strong social network, uh real life social network, right? Oh, yeah, you know, they don't need it  That's a that's a really good point I think that what georgia said is going to be my  Beacon which is and we try to do this with twit. We try to bring as many diverse  Voices as possible because that's what's going to keep me from falling into that trap is people saying you're full of it  No, that's not bad. I love I mean we try to get young people on we try to get people of color. We try to get  Women or the ladies as I like to call them on  Sorry georgia, just kidding. Uh, you're no lady. Uh, no  Because I think that that's really important that you have to get a lot of different voices  Uh, and in the early days, I think twit was a lot of people like me  And that wasn't probably a good thing.

Right. That's wonderful  But but at the same time I I often think about what you're talking about where i'm like well how many  What is the percentage of people in this group who are just like me from either an economic or a social background?  And it's you know, it's it's it's high. There's not a lot of ladies in the group not because they're excluded but because  All of these you have this constantly self-reinforcing like sameness  Uh to this human tribalism that it's like we're trying to sort of do work to get out of that filter bubble  And it takes a lot of work to get out of the filter bubble

We know about we use I know a lot about thousand eyes  I've done events for them. I really am impressed. It was created at ucla some years ago as a graduate project to figure out  When you go into that puffy little thing called the cloud what's going on in there?  Turns out if you have a service or a product or an app and you deliver through the internet very often, you know  Exactly what's happening?  From your desk into that puffy little cloud, you know what's happening after it gets out of the cloud  But you can't tell what's going on in the middle and that means essentially  You're at risk  With thousand eyes now for the first time ever  It's like somebody took a squeegee to that dark window and you can get an immediate unmatched view of all the networks  All the dependencies that impact your user's digital experience right down to the coffee shop wi-fi that they're on  Cloud, I mean everybody's moving to the cloud  And I think people get nervous because it feels like yeah, you're gaining agility. There's a lot of power  But maybe you're also it's risky and most importantly you feel like you're losing control because you're riding on networks. You don't control  And when your cloud app or service goes down you you it's hard to know what we're wrong  Instant visibility into the entire service delivery path  From the cloud to your end user including the portions you don't own or control. That's thousand eyes  It's incredible a cloud-based platform  For organizations like you to help you do the cloud right a massive array of vantage points spanning the entire global internet  both public and private  cloud providers  The wi-fi in in your starbucks  Old school it monitoring is passive. It's siloed. You can see what's going on in your data center  But again, once it's in that puffy little cloud, who knows what's going on thousand eyes unique path visualization technology extends beyond those boundaries  So you can see understand and improve the experience for all your apps services and website. It is  An eye-opener if you've not used it.

You'll agree with everything but this you can give to the boss  While you say and boss we need thousand eyes  If the cloud is important to you today or tomorrow  Thousand eyes dot com slash twit and actually they have some very good white papers on the site dig around a little bit  About different cloud providers where they excel where they don't some really surprising conclusions  They did an event.

I don't know why it's a national emergency  But suddenly it is prohibiting us companies from using telecom services that are solely owned controlled or directed by a foreign  adversary  Which includes Huawei  Huawei's been in the spotlight since 2012  I think when the Department of Commerce said be careful with Huawei ZTE and Xiaomi  They're all Chinese companies people have pointed to the ownership of Huawei  It seems no one can really be sure who owns it while way says we're owned by our employees  But without without much proof and sir also in Huawei's case the founder

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huawei says we've never done anything show us that's exactly what I was gonna say  So you know I mentioned the or you mentioned that we're doing the the weekend episodes now  And so last weekend I had Dexter Tillian on who's a telecoms analyst  I think in London because I've been reading these headlines. I'm like so what is this Huawei?  I'd never heard of them and now all of a sudden  There's a huge trade war that they're at the center of and the three things that I learned were a like you just said  one of the reasons that other countries are not  Willing to ban Huawei is because and even the British and the Germans have said this apparently straight up like if there is  intelligence that  Huawei is spying and is too close to the Chinese government the United States government has not shown us that  Like maybe we'd be willing to get on board with this banning, but we haven't seen the proof  And again, I I'm not an expert in this and Dexter is more than I am and he said yes as far as I know  There is no there is no smoking gun now. That doesn't mean if there was some sort of a conflict or a war  Maybe China wouldn't lean on Huawei and be like, you know  Maybe shut this or that down, but then the US has been able to do that for years  So is part of this just somebody else can do the thing that we  Was implicit that we could always do but the two things aside from that that there's there's no  Actual proof that anyone seems to know of that. There are these close connections. I  The second thing was is how come they how come they're the only ones basically that can do 5g and they're not there's also  Ericsson does it Nokia does it Samsung does it but the problem is number one is  Huawei by far  Their number one they have the most 5g patents and then what happened is over the last 10 years or so  They like they've it's classic they come in and they do it cheaper and better  So if you're Vietnam if you're India if you're Argentina and you got to dial up a national 5g network  Not only is the company that will do it for you the best Huawei  It's also the cheapest so if the US leans on all these other countries like they're trying to do to say no  No, no, don't use them  It doesn't make economic sense. And then the third thing was that you know, I said well  How come how come they're the only ones left standing like and and Dexter said well, it's like whatever became of Motorola  Whatever became of Lucent Alcatel. He's like, yeah, it's just over the last 20 years  It's everything has has shifted to where while no one was paying attention  this Chinese company  Came came up from below and and can now do is the best at doing the technology  That is as everyone tells us the key to the next generation of tech. I

Transcript:  Should also point out this is gonna be a big on the other hand  Segment that much of Huawei's 5g switching gear is software bound and so  When it was just hardware you could look at it and say well, this is okay  It's not phoning home. But once it's software there's and it's getting regular updates  Anything could happen and if you're a Chinese company, I wonder how much freedom even if you're not owned by the Chinese government  I wonder how much freedom you have if the Chinese government came to Huawei and said, okay  We'd like you to put this in your firmware could they say no  Hmm, but I noticed we don't say it's just Huawei. We don't say ZTE. We don't say  Xiaomi we don't I mean 1 plus 1 plus  Mm-hmm, and most of our gear is made in China  So I'm sure Foxconn would have the same problem if the Chinese government said hey according according to Dexter

Transcript:  It is the so the way that Huawei  In the late 80s early 90s, I think that's the timeline  Became got off the ground is their first  Contract was with the PLA. So in the late 80s early 90s army. Yes  So when the the Chinese army says we need our own national network telecoms network for security purposes, right?  It's Huawei that gets that contract and delivers and then there have been these whispers behind the scenes that why does Huawei have a  Apparently this access to unlimited capital in certain instances to win certain contracts  And so people are assuming that then sure that's because why do you think it's so cheap?

Transcript:  Well the other shoe  Dropped today because Google according to Reuters  This is not yet confirmed at least not as of press time as if we had presses as of press time  But apparently Reuters says Google has suspended business with Huawei  Will no longer  Update Android phones made by Huawei  That's not a concern inside China because of course Google doesn't do business in China  So those phones are not you know, they're open source Android, but they're not using Google Apps and furthermore Huawei phones will lose  Google Apps Google services including the Play Store and YouTube apps  That is a big penalty. And by the way, the Huawei phones are  Beloved in the United States you can't buy them, you know from a phone company  But but people like Paul Thurad of Windows Weekly. He loves his Huawei.

It's almost it's almost the reverse of what we're saying  Like you can't do a 5g network without Huawei

It's hard to  Isn't that funny you you if you ask somebody?  What do you think the key components for the Huawei phone are you would where do they come from you wouldn't say us  But that's what's different about the world today  It isn't just a Chinese phone  nothing your car is not just a  German car or or a Japanese car. It's a global economy  So  You know if there's a security issue  Of I mean and you could certainly see that it might be prudent to say well, let's not build our national infrastructure  particularly critical infrastructure on  Products from a Chinese company that could at any point pull the plug

I love it if you're hiring  You know the right person's out there, you know, good shot the right person's out there  But where what job board are they haunting what what social network are they how how do you reach them?  With your job and then how do you you know kind of say hey you you should apply to this job zip recruiter makes it easy  It starts by posting on zip recruiter by doing that you're posting to more than a hundred job sites including Twitter and Facebook all the  Social networks so your reach is phenomenal  I mean you're basically getting anywhere job hunters are looking but then they go the next step they use smart technology  To look at the millions of resumes they have on file to find people who have the experience to fit the job  You're posting and they invite them to apply  No, I love it because those applications don't go into your inbox or they don't ring your phone  They all go into the zip recruiter interface. They reformat all the resumes  So they're quick to read you can have screening questions so you can narrow it down and zip recruiter will even  Analyze each applicant and hot move the best candidates to the top so you don't ever miss a great match. This works so well  That on average four out of five employers 80% of all the people who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate through the site  Within a day and that's been our experience  Lisa will post a job at breakfast by lunch. In fact, I remember this we were looking for a new bookkeeper  She's supposed she's kind of depressed because she's gonna have to do this work if if we can't hire somebody fast  We got two weeks two weeks notice. She posts I said post on zip recruiter  She does it at breakfast and it was so fun to watch like within an hour. Oh, I got I have an applicant  Oh, they're really good. Oh another one. Look, she lives right here. Perfect by lunch. We had three so it really really works  You could try it free right now because you're listening to twit at zip recruiter comm slash twit  Please use that address.

We thank them so much  for making twit  possible  Face  Recognition under the gun San Francisco has now passed a city ordinance banning  Face recognition tech on Tuesday the board of supervisors passed the stop secret surveillance ordinance. Oh  I love living in the Bay Area  But I actually am thrilled about this because as we know  Well, here's here's what supervisor Aaron Peskin said this is the sponsor. I want to be clear  This is not an anti technology  policy  it's an accountability measure to ensure safe and responsible use of surveillance tech and  It passed by eight to one  And it clearly we're starting to see the the flaws in face recognition  And I'll give you a really great example from vice this week  So when the police department interviews you it says well the guy who did it  What do you look like if you say well kind of look like Woody Harrelson?  they'll take a picture of Woody Harrelson and  Feed it to the face recognition technology  Law enforcement. This is a great piece in vices identifying suspects based on all manner of  Probe photos photos of unknown individuals submitted for search against a police or driver's license database that license database  Including celebrities  Harrelson's photo in this case returns  So a guy was caught was caught on camera stealing beer from a CVS in New York City  The surveillance footage was so low quality. They didn't get any suspects no hits on the NYPD face recognition system  So the detective swapped in Woody Harrelson  Saying well, he looks kind of like Woody and  Yes, they got a lot of hits  Including the guy who did it now you tell me  If I'm Woody Harrelson  I'm gonna be a little insulted  He looks more like Colonel Sanders

Who had a problem with stalkers and she used face recognition to?  Who was it?  Richard huh?  It was Taytay Taytay Taylor Swift, that's right  And so they used face recognition at the concert entrances to look for bad guys  We know other stadium have used it to block ban people who are known disruptors or problems  On the other hand if you get a false positive and you can't go to the Taytay show that sucks

Do you think that that's what they're doing?  They probably just try everything  Exactly. Oh, yeah, and then they compare the the the accept rates. We notice that whenever we call from the caller's number it really works  40 48 billion 48 billion robocalls placed in the u.s alone  Last year most estimates are that more than 50 percent of the calls you get in my case more than 90 percent of the calls  You get our robocalls  Because it's cheap  There's no risk. You're not going to get caught  Because there's no enforcement notice that even now the fcc is not saying oh we're we're going to enforce it  We'll let the carriers do it  It's a profit thing  So, I mean, you know this sounds like he's doing something really great

Okay  Uh nso tools were found  Well, it's it's interesting story how it happened  um a uh human  rights activist claudio guanieri  Uh found that a colleague of his he was at amnesty international was targeted by nso spyware  um  and  Actually, is that the story of how it was discovered?  It was discovered by a as a human rights activist. It was it was yeah

Start time: 6054.56
End time: 6058.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it was a lawyer that was that's it suing. Yes the nso group

Start time: 6059.34
End time: 6063.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and yeah, he he noticed some odd behavior, right?

Start time: 6064.10
End time: 6098.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't remember the details on how he saw it on his phone  But the point was is that he's in the business of  On behalf of human rights people on behalf of like amnesty international on behalf of dissidents  That are you know overseas?  Trying to flee their their government's wrath  suing them for essentially selling these tools allowing those governments to track these people down and to monitor their stuff and so  Some of the things that he was working on on behalf of his clients some of the things his clients were reporting  He started to see happening to his own device. He I got it now

Start time: 6098.62
End time: 6117.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was representing five mexican journalists who are suing the nso  They say their phones were hijacked with the company's pegasus spyware, but the lawyers started receiving weird calls  On whatsapp over three weeks ago from sweden  So he caught he was like what's going on? He contacted citizen lab

Start time: 6118.20
End time: 6145.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because here's the key  that the way that this  Thing could infect you is that it would call using the call feature  You didn't even have to pick up and receive the call  All you had to do was be called you would your phone your device would be infected  And by the way, if you didn't notice that the phone came in it would often be deleted from your call records later  So he would see these calls come in from sweden and then notice that an hour or two later

Start time: 6145.28
End time: 6244.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't in his call log, right? So it was very suspicious. He was already aware of all this because of his work  Uh with these journalists and fortunately  Citizens lab was able to find it. They were able to tell whatsapp  Whatsapp mitigated it by changing their server code and then updated the software  So the good news is has been fixed but here's the story that worries me a motherboard lorenzo franceschi becara  Becara, I becara  Writing it's almost impossible to tell if your iphone has been hacked  And this is a weird consequence of apple's  security on the iphone  There is no way really to look at an iphone without jailbreaking it to see if it's been compromised  It's so locked down you can't get a tool on it to look for strange anomalies  You have to jailbreak it to do so  Um, they they quote a researcher  This guy claudio guarneri at amnesty international  He said security controls have made mobile devices extremely difficult to inspect especially remotely  Particularly for those of us working in human rights organizations  Lacking access to adequate forensic technology because of this we're rarely able to confirm infections of those  Who we even already suspect being targeted  Frankly we are on the losing side of a disheartening asymmetry of capabilities that favors attackers over defenders  Is it possible to have a something so secure that you can't tell it's been hacked

Start time: 6245.68
End time: 6254.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if it was more open would there be more attacks in the first place that would make it more vulnerable in the end  Well, like you'd know but they'd be more of them out there

Start time: 6255.50
End time: 6309.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vaunted security was no defense against whatsapp being hacked, right?  that  The whatsapp hack allowed bad guys to get right into iphones  So it didn't work to do what it was supposed to do. And in fact, it's working to do the contrary  Ios security researchers who spoke with motherboard i'm quoting again agree that the iphone is too locked down for its own good  I've always said  The bad guys will find a way one way or another shouldn't we enable the good guys to do their job  This may be georgia to answer your question comes back to that old argument about which is more secure open source or closed source  similar to that, right  I've always said open source is more secure even though  You know security people and bad guys have equal access to the code  At least you can find issues and fix them  With apple you have no choice but to rely on apple to find it and fix it

Start time: 6310.00
End time: 6317.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But do we have actual numbers for you know?  How many phones are hacked versus you know an ios versus on android?

Start time: 6318.14
End time: 6359.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but you see that's what's interesting about this nso stuff is that  The point of this a lot of a lot of articles about this made this point like it's unlikely that you  Are compromised on this right?  Because what this is what they're in the business of doing is going to governments and being like are their  Pesky journalists or human rights people that are bothering you if you pay us a certain amount of money  We will get into their devices and tell you who they're organizing with where they're going to be  It's in general at least at this point. It's unlikely that anyone cares about any of our phones  It's like super targeted drone strike level stuff that this software can do

Start time: 6360.32
End time: 6392.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't have actual numbers, but uh, they talked to zuck abraham  Who is the founder of zympirium and a well-known security researcher who studies ios attacks?  He said in the last few months. He's seen a lot of targeted attacks against iphone users so many that it's mind-blowing  But he wouldn't provide numbers  The point here is I think a lot of people I hear it all the time  Oh, I never go to defcon with an android phone. I only carry ios even phil zimmerman the creator  Pgp told me that  And maybe that's a fool's paradise

Start time: 6393.24
End time: 6404.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? I wonder I thought of the bezos phone  Situation, I know that that was just straight sms  But i'm wondering like this idea. I don't know if any of you well, we don't know because

Start time: 6405.20
End time: 6410.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that's the question with the bezos phone is it was it really the saudis and not the his girlfriend's brother?

Start time: 6411.44
End time: 6417.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, this is what i'm saying because that apparently is one of the big clients of nso. Yeah

Start time: 6418.22
End time: 6421.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's you know, it's okay because we only provide our software to governments

Start time: 6422.29
End time: 6449.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but okay  So what i'm gonna ask is does anyone did any of your security shows get into the thing that was weird to me about this?  Is like even as i've learned, you know all my life dealing with spam and things like that  You only really get infected if you click a link you only get infected if you download the file if you  Execute the file like this idea that that day those days are over. That is so old-fashioned brian  So so now all I have to do is turn my phone on and there's a vector

Start time: 6450.34
End time: 6456.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good zero day, right? We're all I have to do is call you  And you're and you're done. I own your phone

Start time: 6457.20
End time: 6466.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's what i'm saying is that apparently we maybe need to be thinking that that's out there and that's just the the state  Of the world right now is that you just you connect to the network and you're compromised

Start time: 6468.18
End time: 6539.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jonathan levin this is again from the motherboard article a researcher has written books about ios and mac os internals and security and provides  training on iphone security  Said the reason we know of so few ios is zero days is because they're worth so much money  That only a government can afford them. They're for targeted attacks. Nobody's going to use a zero day  To try to get into everybody's phone and get you know, it's I mean in some ways that should reassure you because  But I think it's you know, there's not mass attacks  You know, you have to be some target a person of interest to the saudis or  somebody  To exacerbate the situation. He says payloads are often tested and perfected for weeks or more before deployment  Thus ensuring a high chance of exploitation and inversely a low chance of detection  Especially in the case of attacks requiring no user interaction  But again other researchers say the problem is  There's no practical way to tell an iphone got infected and of course  As we know it's illegal to do research to reverse engineer or get into anything that's protected  And so that discourages researchers as well

Start time: 6541.54
End time: 6546.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that should be changed but also in this case like you had to download the app

Start time: 6547.78
End time: 6555.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You had to have whatsapp on you but yeah, yeah. Yeah, so you're right and iphone would be a lot safer if you didn't use third-party apps  Yes

Start time: 6558.18
End time: 6562.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm you know the funny thing okay, here's the irony of it here's the irony of it

Start time: 6565.64
End time: 6598.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People like you know, these these ngos and and and people are going to not use iMessage because they know that  Apple knows what's going on in iMessage and if subpoena might give that information the u.s government or whatever government that you're in  Whatever country you're in so they want to use a third party that is encrypted and everybody thought  Oh, what's app it's encrypted end to end. It's safe  Not not thinking about the fact that nothing is safe if if your phone is owned  And as it turned out, what's app was the vector to get your phone owned?

Start time: 6599.66
End time: 6609.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also if it's a call, isn't it using some  lower or higher level basic call functionality in ios  So in theory anything that could receive a call

Start time: 6611.00
End time: 6644.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could be vulnerable. Maybe yeah, I hope i'm obviously apple's going to fix this but  another security researcher who declined  to be quoted  Said the fundamental problem is that i or to be named rather is that ios is a bug rich environment and apple's strategy only works against hobbyist attackers  But it's quite counterproductive against professional attackers  So now I mean, you know take this with a grain of salt everybody's making their own decisions  I would say that anytime you're using  Uh a computer of any kind you're always at risk  And uh, you're never 100 safe, right?

Start time: 6646.68
End time: 6652.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it really salty of me to say that anything that any company that is owned by facebook?  There's probably going to be some sort of security risk

Start time: 6653.56
End time: 6658.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think that's the case. Although I would I mean if you're really an activist don't use whatsapp use signal

Transcript:  I love this just a word of warning pro publica, which is a great, uh citizens news organization  Uh published an article actually it came it was also published in the guardian  Uh firms that promised high tech ransomware solutions almost always just pay the hackers  So if you're in business and you've been hit by ransomware and you go out and you hire a data recovery firm  Almost always they just send the hacker the money and hope that that'll all work out

Start time: 6705.34

Start time: 6719.16
End time: 6752.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, and the way pro publica found out they you know, people think bitcoin transactions are anonymous  Actually not you could trace them back to the wallet if if you get the number and so pro publica was able to trace four  of the payments set in 2017 and 2018 from an online wallet controlled by  Proven data to one specified by the hackers  The money was then lauded through as many as 12 bitcoin addresses before reaching a wallet maintained by the iranians  You know what leo hold on I just I think we should send a carrier and hit those iranians

Start time: 6753.28
End time: 6767.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm, sorry, but some just occurred to me. Isn't that the definition of insurance though? If you charge enough people enough money  When the house burns down you're able to have enough money to rebuild the house, right true  It's just that they're not telling people that that's what they're doing

Start time: 6767.84
End time: 6854.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're actually saying this is more ethical than paying that they're actually claiming to offer an ethical way  Not paying the hackers most law enforcement says whatever you do  Don't send money to the hackers partly because it just encourages them partly because chances are good  You're not going to actually get your an encryption key  Often they don't you know, that's just that's just taking a chance  What are you gonna do? Can you say hey?  I paid you where's my key?  Sam-sam was the ransomware and in fact last november  the doj and indicted two iranians on fraud charges for developing sam-sam and  orchestrating the  extortion  So  Anyway, just you know passing that along if you I guess you could think of it as insurance  But it seems like you might have expected more than you know, just get a good backup program, please  Zombie load  There's you know, you thought specter and meltdown were over and we've got the fixes now. There's a new one same thing speculative execution flaw  hits intel chips  All but the most recent two generations  It's being patched, of course  Here's the bad news like some other speculative execution patches. It could hit your performance by up to what 40 percent

Start time: 6857.52
End time: 6863.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No  I saw I earlier this week. I thought it was only three to nine percent, but apple says three percent

Start time: 6864.72
End time: 6900.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well actually no big difference. Yeah  During testing this month apple says it found as much as a 40 reduction in performance  Depends on what you're doing  So  You'll slowly get it really the it I think as an end user  None of these speculative execution attacks are too much to worry about  Unless again, you're a human rights worker or something like that  More often it's a problem in the data center where you're on a shared processor  There are many people using the same processor and if one of them is malicious he could then  Get information from the others

Start time: 6900.86
End time: 6906.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and also even a a three to nine percent hit in a data center would kind of be well

Start time: 6906.74
End time: 6949.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem. That is a problem, isn't it? Yeah  So, uh, you know as long as we're talking the annals of hacking the big the big hack, uh that went down in san francisco  This week  A top california executive has been arrested by the fbi  Chief  financial officer of a school lunch program called choice lunch  Was arrested  Allegedly he grabbed details from the lunch master  By hacking them on finding out what youngsters across the san francisco bay area like to eat  And are allergic to  It is apparently a war out there between the lunch master and choice lunch

Wait a minute before you get too upset  I stopped using gmail for a variety of reasons. They did say a few years ago  We're no longer going to scan emails for advertising keywords, right?  but  And see this I think is a misleading headline google has been tracking nearly everything you buy on online  because  Well, for instance google will notify you when a package is on its way, right?  Google late for the airport. Yeah google uses this information for you  Georgia, it's oh no, it's not giving me anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I think that that's maybe one of the  Key reasonable arguments here too is essentially  What you're saying is that you can't opt out at this point?  You know what I mean? Like so georgia if you if you're like, I don't like this, but how can you live a modern life?  And completely wall it off. You know what I mean? So like it's almost like you you have no agency anymore  Or you have to go through so many insane hoops if that's your choice  so like even if it's just oh it's just it's a it's a personal preference of mine, but you just don't  Really have the ability to do that anymore because you know your your trip emails have to go somewhere  And that's owned by one of five companies georgia

Transcript:  Is it are so then then to me the notion is I I like the idea  that  My world will be customized for me based on what I do and my preferences  I think that's kind of cool. For instance uber has just launched a quiet mode setting  When you book a car you could say and by the way, I want them to shut up  I like that and I would like that. I would like uber to notice that I use it all the time and then from now on  Tell the driver  What's wrong with that?

Transcript:  If I was asked I think that consent is a big issue in this for me in that  If I was asked would it be okay if we you know followed this if it was more transparent?  I think I would be more comfortable with it as well. So I think transparency  I think consent. I think that I I also think you know what then what else are they tracking and following that?  I don't know of and I know that that would be even more terrifying because you know  So many articles come out that we find out that they know even when your phone is off where you are going or they know  Where you've stopped off for this long or what you've been doing in certain places  And so I think that those two pieces are quite weak in the companies and there are no laws that are in place to make  sure that they're more transparent and that they ask for  specific consent before they they you know track things what they track and what they do with them  And so I don't think that there's going to be a real easy solution for that  And I think that it's still going to be creepy and every time I find out  Um, and I read the privacy I read these long, you know difficult to read before and that's why I don't use a whole bunch  Of products that would make my life more easy

Start time: 7556.24

Yeah easily opt out  Uh disclosure I agree with all that stuff what I don't want is for  Government or to come along or the consumer outrage to be so loud that companies stop doing this because I personally like it  And apparently so do so does michael. So yeah  Uh, I don't want to be prevented from using this because some people don't like it. So let's agree  Uh, it's a it should be a personal choice. You should it should be disclosed and you should have explicit opt out choices

Let me let me come back to your original point about you want to taste  Like if they this is the problem  Let me rephrase it a different way if they discover tomorrow that there's some enzyme in human breath that is more powerful than gold  And we just need to mine it and collect it  and so here brian put this mask on and uh, we're going to uh,  Because I you I can't stop breathing and that's sort of like what the data is now  I can't stop emitting data that all of these companies are monetizing without my consent or without giving me a taste  If they ask me to put on a mask to mine the gold from my breath  I might do that, but i'm going to ask before I do it like well, what's my share, right? Yeah, that's fair

I mean that's pretty good  Like that's a good array of sunday reading for me. I I like that and I like that it knows that already and when it surfaces a story  about  you know, whatever pewdiepie or or  Something else i'm not interested in I say show me less and then it learns over time  But I don't really have to do that all i'm gonna feed your paranoia georgia

Okay, I mean fine. I like that. Yeah, like I I don't mind knowing tap here for donuts. What's wrong with that?
