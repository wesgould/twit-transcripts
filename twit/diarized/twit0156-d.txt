Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  U-C-T I  miss you at NUMediaExpo, Pat.  Everybody, your co-host was down there.  Jim Louterback was there.  Prager, even.  Sarah Lane.  It was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I've been told.  Thanks.  Rub it in some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you, well, you have a baby.  Was that why you didn't go, or were there other reasons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nah, it's just I wasn't invited on any panels.  And I didn't have a panel to give.  And I'm not management.  And there are other people who had good reasons to go.  So I stayed home and did the kid thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man.  I would have loved to have you on Twitter Live and everything.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Feel free to invite me next time.  I will.  Not that I'm bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I will.  I mean, I just figured everybody would be there.  Sorry, Rose wasn't there either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been there in like three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick, did you turn to your guns and your religion?  He's bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's bitter.  If he lived in a small town, he would have.  Also here.  Go ahead, Chuckie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, I like the way the British like to chime  in on our politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, one of my favorite conversations  with a British expatriate who was going off  on the Second Amendment as being the worst aspect of America  and talking about how no one was killed with guns in Britain.  And I looked him dead in the eye and smiled and said, yes,  yes, your soccer hooligans kill people with rocks  in the ends of their socks.  Pick the living snot out of people with their boots  and tie their dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick, our soccer hooligans kill people with their breath.  The breath is enough to do it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Gonjah, I've got my breath.  So I was looking at him.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Second Amendment killing  people, blah, blah, blah, guns, guts, glory.  I'm like, look, man, there's a reason they put the Second  Amendment next to the First Amendment.  It's because the American government can't be trusted.  I mean, we were founded.  I mean, just look at the revolution, man.  What a politically complicated thing to look at.  I mean, it's basically a bunch of entitled older gentlemen  that were pissed off about paying taxes for the services  they'd received from their government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is, you know, this is also not  a small island where people are crammed in.  We have a lot of wide open spaces  where you're probably better off carrying some heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never know when a Wolverine's  going to try to rip your face off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, or some sort of a weirdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, did anybody go to the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We may introduce me before we go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak, ladies and gentlemen, needs no introduction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Needs no introduction, but once one anyway.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did anybody go to the Bigfoot press conference down in Palo Alto  last Friday?  The guys, you know, this guy's caught a Bigfoot.  Allegedly.  Turns out it's a possum in a gorilla suit,  which is kind of an odd combination.  They they wouldn't even they wouldn't even bring it with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Possum in a gorilla suit.  They said they said, yeah, they said the DNA to an into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, some guy, some guy, he sent a email back and said,  this is possum DMA.  And they said, well, see that proves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It must be Bigfoot.  They said they thought the Bigfoot maybe ate a possum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that was their way around it.  I ate a possum.  The funny thing is, this guy wasn't even like a real expert.  This guy was just some guy they found in the email.  And he still, you know, he still didn't cooperate.  Oh, no, you're supposed to say it's Bigfoot.  It's a possum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fair with the second catch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's supposed to say it's Bigfoot.  So do we have any tech news this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I like that story.  I thought that was a good story.  There's lots of are you kidding?  Will Harris has been going wild with the tech news.  New BlackBerry coming out.  Nine hundred. The bold. You excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like how John likes to keep us moving along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like this one.  You know, here's a story.  Gasset says Apple played chicken with mobile me launch.  I haven't seen this story before. Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from. They didn't play chicken.  They ran it right off the cliff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Louis Gasset was a former Apple president who was kind of forced out some years ago.  Remember, he wrote B or subsidized BOS.  He was a scully. But he's not bitter.  He's not bitter. He says a long blog post in which he says  the machismo that leads to playing chicken with launches is what.  Screwed up the mobile me launch, he said.  No one always says it in French, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one had enough brains and guts to risk humiliation and raise a hand and say,  chief. Everybody calls Steve Jobs cheap.  Apparently, chief, we are not ready here.  Let's stop everything.  As a result, the mobile me badly crashed on launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that doesn't I mean, that kind of stuff.  I love it.  It's like, hey, chief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, I guess what he's saying is that  but, you know, he understands the Apple culture.  He's saying that people were, you know, as always with every Silicon Valley  launch, going right up to the wire and you go up to the wire.  You got the launch and somebody should have stepped forward  and say it's not ready. But, you know, with the Steve Jobs running the show,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're not going to say no to Steve Jobs.  Do you want to be the guy that steps in and says, Steve, you know  how we are planning on do this thing?  We can't we can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Options invested. Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty I mean, that's and, you know, this is the problem  with a little bit with the corporate culture at Apple is that you can't say no  to anybody. But don't you think Steve fired people anyway?  I know he did. The guy who ran mobile me was ousted.  He was. Well, I think, you know, he was moved upstairs or something.  They brought in a new guy to run mobile me.  Reshuffled, reshuffled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think we worked into oblivion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it's fairly  self-evident to say they play chicken with launch.  They tried to get it done for the launch like you would do with any product.  They failed and just decided to punt it out anyway.  It works now, though. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's well, it's I don't know if, you know, they decided they didn't.  They didn't have a public beta. They didn't have an open beta.  They didn't do a lot of what most companies would consider due diligence  with, you know, straining the servers pre-launch, you know.  And are you sure it's fixed?  I thought they promised to have it fixed sometime between now and Christmas.  Well, the mail that was the email I read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a white year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's I mean, it's working for me.  Works for me. It's a cloud.  It's a cloud. The cloud is we don't know if the cloud works or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cloud is a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So me.com. How many people want a me.com email address?  Chirp chirp. Is that it? Yeah.  Apparently, according to  a story in the IDG news service and computer world.  If you happen to be, for instance, I am the greatest at Gmail dot com.  According to the University of Leipzig, some professors there.  You're very actually, you know, people will assume you are a narcissist.  He says people really judge you based on the email address you choose.  So if you're at AOL dot com, they go newbie or old dud, old dud, newbie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it say about you if you have an entire domain name  named after yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Narcissist. You got in early.  Will Harris dot com. Do you have that? I have dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, he has. Will Harris is so damn hot.  He's too goddamn hot for Britain dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a paper in the Journal of Research and Personality,  the scientists took a look at under 600 email addresses  just under and had people who created them fill out a brief  personality questionnaire, then they asked 100 students to rate  the same addresses to find out if the email names seemed to be neurotic,  open, agreeable, conscientious, narcissistic or extroverted.  If somebody were, say, Leo at Leo Ville dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, so they had student they didn't have the they didn't have the test group to it.  They didn't have a large group to it.  They didn't have a diverse group to it.  Students decided whether or not they were what they were trying to see is  you picked 100 very, very mature college students to make decisions about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I know, but students are like normal people in the sense that no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not true. They tend to have a student in your house, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and as do I.  They tend to judge people based on their addresses.  For example, people who used words like little, sweet or baby  combined with cute animal names like mousy or bunny.  Little baby bunny at AOL dot com.  What would you say?  What would you say? Neurotic, open, agreeable, conscientious,  narcissistic or extroverted? Pick one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exploidable. How about idiot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it? It's not on the list.  They say agreeable and neurotic.  On the other hand, words like king or the best were linked to narcissism.  Even more interesting, these judgments is judgments tended to be right  in five of the six personality characters they measured.  In other words, they gave these people  than MMP eyes or some sort of inventory, and they said, yeah, they are narcissists.  Openness is the easiest thing to gauge.  Students would miss the mark on extraversion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So your next boss is not a good name.  And I think me.  That's under Redstone's name. It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Is that his email address?  Your next boss at me dot com.  That would be pretty good.  I often wonder, though, you know, you see, you know, AOL, for instance,  can you be a business like person if your email address is at AOL dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've seen actually like a lot of eBay type shops and and  non particularly tech centric places that still use AOL addresses.  And they're always, you know, kind of, you know, it is.  You look at it and you're like, huh?  And they're like, oh, well, this is a guy who, you know, builds machine parts.  He doesn't really care about having a a serious address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John McCain at Web TV dot com.  What does that tell you? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that right? Email somebody's face.  That's a fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talking about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the fact that you actually entertain that as being possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't think I'm unreasonable in that regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says he's he doesn't use a computer.  He has people to do that for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many people actually bought Web TV the second time around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no. I think it's kind of scary that I'm not going to get into politics again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's hear from the great Britons about our politics.  Well, I just ran into something on the one on the web that was showing posters  and bumper stickers in England that saying UK for Obama with that  Obama logo and the whole thing. I think what is wrong with these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Bored.  Just on the subject of of Apple and jobs,  did you see that Apple is now worth more than Google?  Wow. In terms of net worth, 159 billion market cap, 157 billion market cap.  It's all paper, though. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I do. Guys in funny coats and Wall Street are going over the price of a stock.  It's mythical. It's fake until you cash out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's not so doesn't signify in some ways  that the market thinks that Apple has better chances than Google, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something like that. It's not the way it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not how it works.  It's not not chopped liver. Give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, what's what's the market?  What's the what's the what's Halliburton's value?  That would be really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Take a look at GM. It's about one tenth of either of those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that really Facebook with more on paper than like Ford?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're going to do a leverage buyout by those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what do they call that?  The capitalization? What do they call that?  What's that term? Market cap. Market cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Capitalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's refers to the amount that the stock is worth on the open market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at the closing price based on the number of shares available times the price.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's see. Hold on one second.  Yeah. Halliburton's like 38 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow. Cheaper than Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google's market capitalization is like  four point something times Halliburton's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I would say, yeah, who cares?  But we pay so much attention to stock price, which really isn't  I mean, isn't market cap more significant than stock price?  Because stock price doesn't say how many shares are outstanding.  So at least this this combines the number of shares outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's eight hundred seventy six million shares of Halliburton.  And there's three hundred and fourteen million shares of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shouldn't you be talking about this with Horowitz last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You didn't like that show so much, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I didn't mind the show.  I just didn't like the fact that that twerp Jason Calacanis  had to jump all over Eric's Craig's finding, not knowing anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I think Craig's finders kind of back up with some sort of odd  proxy set up or something that Eric gets back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they took some of the stuff down.  So what Eric has decided to do is and by the way, he did ask for permission  to use the thing, which is what annoyed me about Calacanis, because he didn't.  You know, he was speculating.  Yeah. Well, that's all he does.  So anyway, he's just basically going to release the code to the public domain.  Anybody who wants to run this thing and run it off their own server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. Let let a million flowers bloom and let let Craig play whack a mole  with that. I think Jason remember Jason's friends with Craig Newmark  and maybe felt a little defensive.  But I think Jason, like the rest of the panel last week, said  that, you know, ultimately the reasons Craig and Jim gave for  shutting it down were bogus.  He said that. Yeah, they're totally bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said it was to protect our community.  But that's bogus. There's other systems that are running under it.  I've got a bunch of Twitterers that said, hey, what about this one?  And that one is about three or four other these kinds of devices.  And then meanwhile, why is Craig going around telling everybody to use Google?  I thought he was like a community oriented guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an interesting response. Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's trying to he's trying to create a bunch of local communities.  And it's just it's, you know, it's annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One global Craigslist community.  Each community is local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's what he considers the dividing line between Craigslist and eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but that doesn't explain the Google thing, because if you go to  and look up something on Google and you use site, colon, you know,  Craigslist.org, it looks at all of them all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I think it's what he does in the view of, you know,  throwing out chilling effects, cease and desist orders.  You know, use Google instead.  Luding his. Yeah.  Don't do something.  Don't don't do something with Craig in the name,  because eventually I'll have to sue you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, were you guys watching the Olympics on TV or were you watching it on the net?  Here's a bunch of savvy Internet types.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been amazed.  People whining about the television coverage and being completely ignorant.  You can watch like for all of the sports that you, you know,  except in the 70s on wide world of sports where you'd see like,  you know, Olympic class, you know, marbles or something.  You know what I mean?  Like, you remember wide world of sports when it was just, you know,  it'd be like, you know, all these serious sports and then something completely bizarre.  Yeah. Yes.  PN eight.  I mean, I was watching like online like you can watch,  you know, three and a half hours of, you know, wrestling eliminations by class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you and I like it because there's not much commentary.  It's just it's the event.  I kind of enjoy it on the online.  Twenty two hours are putting up online.  But they were very concerned about it cannibalizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the trouble was, though, they were concerned about it  cannibalizing their TV coverage, but then we're putting out Twitter  messages spoiling the results.  So if you're following, you want to watch live,  if you're following them on Twitter,  they were telling people the results before it was broadcast.  And it's like, well, that's been annoying.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it's also they've already had more viewers than the last Olympics.  They've got more of the 18 to 34 demo watching the coveted.  Sorry. It's the coveted 18 to 34 demo.  And everything says, you know, they sold a ton of advertising.  They've sold millions of dollars of advertising since the start of the Olympics.  I mean, they're you know, it sounds like they're rolling in money  and their numbers are really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what NBC learned.  They were very concerned.  In fact, you remember they didn't put the opening event on line  until after they broadcast it on TV because they're afraid  people would watch it online and then not watch TV.  The research is out for the first week.  And Alan Wurzel, NBC's president of research, says, quote,  the Internet hardly cannibalizes.  It actually fuels interest.  Half of the online users want to catch up with events they may have missed.  Another 40 percent want to replay something they first saw on TV.  Eighty one million people watched the men's  swimming relay on television.  Another one point seven watched it later again on the Web.  The Web is actually driving TV viewership and vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What we've always known happens.  That's one of the effects of the web.  People we've been hounding people about this.  And let me make a comment about I mean, I've been watching on both.  I tend to watch these a lot of obscure events.  I might want to check out and get them online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wrestling, the judo, the kai.  I mean, they've done this amazing.  They've shot this beautiful video of like the K one and the canoeing  competitions, the whitewater.  And it's like incredible to see all of the eliminations on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  90 percent of people who follow the Olympics watch it only on TV.  The other 10 percent used every medium they could find.  The Internet, mobile phones, video on demand from cable.  Only two tenths of one percent use the Internet exclusively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the one thing I wanted to mention is that I think the Olympics are successful  this year because there's a shortage of very there's hardly any of these  sappy, crummy features they did the last couple of years.  Up close and personal. Yeah.  Up close and personal garbage that nobody cares about.  About someone had a club foot when they were 14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they've been getting some of that and they've just been very,  very brief about it.  But not. Yeah, I agree.  It's it hasn't been an overwhelming like, you know, people need drama  to care about the Olympics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that was I think that was always conventional wisdom,  is that people won't care about these silly sports like field hockey  unless there are star, you know, unless they know the people playing.  Unless there's a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't call field hockey silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarah Sarah with my butt, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whatever I think the point is, is that they don't understand that the games  themselves are dramatic.  And the other thing is the only people that would feel that way are people  that don't like sports, which is what I think were the people that came up  with these idiotic ideas to do all these stupid, sappy features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I think the best.  Is that like putting celebrities,  mainstream celebrities on a tech show because non-technical people care?  John never heard of such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a crazy idea.  Nobody be that foolish.  Nuts insane.  So in Britain, you've been watching the Olympics in Britain, Will Harris.  Yes. Is it very different?  The coverage on the beach?  Well, it's much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  straighter and less glitzy.  It's BBC.  So it's quite down the line.  But they've actually been broadcasting on the web simultaneously.  So like the opening ceremony, for example, you could watch live on the BBC  news website via Flash as it was on the TV.  By far the best thing I've been watching is definitely the beach volleyball.  Well, everybody loves that.  Oh, yeah.  That's worth the price of admission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I was up in Canada, I was watching it off the CBC.  How were they doing?  I'm sorry. I was up in Washington.  I was up in which we get we watch the CBC up there.  Right. What was that coverage like?  It was I think probably like the BBC's a little bit.  It was a little it was different people.  They were less amenable to the Chinese.  I mean, they weren't kissing the Chinese butts as much as the Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's been interesting, too, hasn't it?  They have not word one about the Chinese hosts.  I mean, it's like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So the Chinese are a little more objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bob Costa called actually kind of called out President Bush on it  when he interviewed President Bush before later on that day.  President Bush was caught with the infamous and I'm sure  will spin following this.  The Misty May trainer.  Would you like to, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That where he slapped slapping, but he didn't slap her on the butt.  He had the good sense to slap her higher.  I think it was close.  No, I watched it in slow motion.  They hit the target.  No, no, no. You know, I look I'm not a Bush defender on this one  on most things, but on this one, I'm going to stand up and say no win situation.  First of all, I probably shouldn't have been there, but he was there.  And she turns around, says, slap my butt.  What are you going to do?  You look like a dork no matter what you do. Right.  So he did the only thing he could do, which I thought was quite sensible.  We kind of he taps her on her back on their back or lower back.  It was high up above the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also weird when it's like that was a tough thing for him.  You're watching the Olympics.  He's hanging out with Vladimir Putin.  Yeah. Watching ceremony.  Apparently, you know, we find out later on when cost is asking him  talking about the whole Georgia incident.  You know, the next day he's basically hanging out with the athletes,  which on one hand has to be incredible for your president to come out to support you.  And on the other hand, you've got to be sitting there like,  can't you do something about the economy, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wonder. It's kind of odd that he wasn't in a luxury box.  It looks like he was just sitting in the stands with everybody else.  And he didn't look kind of bored.  I can't caught him looking at his watch a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was odd. It was quite interesting.  The coverage in the in the UK was much more cynical about the Chinese.  There was there was segment after segment where, you know, there are a couple of  British reporters that have been arrested for reporting on various different things.  There's a lot of coverage of the Chinese police arresting these reporters.  Like a lot of thank goodness for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a really interesting Twitter exchange.  It was in Chinese, but you could probably get I saw a translation of it.  A Chinese blogger who went to Beijing to cover the Olympics,  not necessarily a a political blogger,  Twittering as he gets arrested by the secret police.  Well, it's funny because this guy is 27 and childless.  But it was the one child police who came and got him.  He says, I mean, I don't have any children.  So you have more than one child.  I don't have any children and get him to go back to the country where he belongs  and get out of town.  But because of Twitter, he was he has Blackberry and he was Twitter  burying the whole thing.  You know, I think that's quite technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the future of the sort of change of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We met I met somebody at at New Media Expo  that's doing a really interesting site, all voices dot com.  Just went just went online.  And they're using a kind of Google News style aggregation  to get citizen journalists, text messages, tweets,  SMM, MMS, photos, blogs.  And then they're going to use software to pinpoint it on the map.  And so if there's something going on, let's say Russia invading Georgia,  they'll be able to get on the ground from citizens.  These posts, I think it's really interesting.  All voices dot com.  And even though it's brand new, there's some real coverage here,  even of in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you are our enemy this week, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's like a silverlight application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. Is it? That would be too bad if it is.  Maybe it's Flash.  What do you mean?  Silverlight worked pretty well for Microsoft's for NBC, didn't it?  Yeah, I thought they did a pretty good job.  So, yes, so you can hover your mouse over the map  and see where there are events going on.  And I like this idea, ultimately, of citizen journalism, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I saw the same exact app on the Silverlight developer site.  I was looking at some of the things people were working on.  And the exact same thing some guys developed.  It's part of a.  Oh, wait a minute. I take it back. Sorry.  I saw this exact same app exactly on pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, maybe Yahoo pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Huh.  And there's a guy who developed this thing with these  with the same little markers that were some news is taking place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're using this technology because I talked to the founder  and she said it's all computer generated. So then I imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This guy had this really cool pipe.  It was like it went from the news feeds from Reuters and some other places.  Then it went to the then it found out where they were coming,  where the sites were that were producing the news.  And then it went to a map and then it went to this and that.  And then it ended up with this exactly. It looks exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's George's president eating his tie on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to say, I love I love the concept of a sort of open media site  from all around the world.  But the sort of proof of pudding is the is in the eating and the front.  The stuff is on the front page.  It's like, well, it's brand new. Launched two weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that the key is getting in fact,  that one of the reasons I want to plug it is to get people to start using it,  sign up for it, especially if you're in a war torn region of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're in the war torn region of the world,  the first thing you're thinking about is Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter now. Twitter now we want to get the reports direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm not I don't know.  This doesn't look I'm not impressed. Not impressing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is there anything exciting that came out of NMA that you enjoyed in particular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or well, our coverage is pretty exciting.  We spent, remember, Patrick, a million dollars going down  as CES and Comdex before that to cover it for Tech TV  and basically did the same thing for 50 bucks in a box of Cheetos.  I mean, it was. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, but covering covering like NME, you know, that's  that's like covering the Chawan Chicken Racing tournament versus Super Bowl.  Well, what do we do?  So different? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what I don't know what we did so different, really.  I mean, we just we sat there in a stage.  People came to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twelve thousand products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't cover twelve thousand products.  We sat on a stage and people came to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Well, yeah, you showed up and people came to you.  I spent nine hours a day  meeting with vendors and getting the products in for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not bitter at all.  I'm just reminding Leo that there were a couple of producers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were producers.  Well, I'd be curious.  You know, I wanted to do this as a test, you know, proof of concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, Leo, we've covered we covered CES twice.  Once doing live shows and once doing tape stuff with DLTV.  And we did tape shows.  You know, I mean, we did live stuff using a TriCaster with DLTV.  And the biggest problem, actually, in most cases, is getting bandwidth  during CES to upload to your. Yes. Absolutely.  Yeah. I mean, we did it for, you know, a tiny fraction of what  tech TV would have cost, but we also did, you know, a much more modest show.  We did, you know, a couple hours a day for four days.  You know, we did it with our.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is pretty exciting.  Yeah, I think it's pretty exciting.  We'll try CES in January.  I'm torn between CES and Macworld because Macworld so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Figure out your bandwidth.  The bandwidth issues at CES are dramatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had it. Yeah. And this worked really well.  We had we were in the LVCC, but we had a dedicated DSL line  that nobody else was using. And that worked pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing is, though, usually in the LVCC, what they call a dedicated line  is actually a split line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no, no, no, we had a DSL modem on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK. Yeah.  Well, if you had a DSL modem, then that might have been it's weird.  I've run into stuff where they claim it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I understand. They sell it to you as if it's dedicated.  But it's, you know, 15 other people are also buying the dedicated line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they basically they only have a single vendor in there  doing all of the accents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to find out how they did it.  Sticam did it for us.  I have to find out how they did it, because that that's exactly the model for next time.  John, on your blog, you have the blue screen of death on the  opening ceremonies. Is this real or is that a reflection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that was confirmed by Gizmodo and a bunch of independent people who,  I guess the stands were filled with enough people that saw that thing  that they all took pictures of it.  So there's about there's about 10 or 15 pictures of it from different people  all over the place.  So initially, when it came in, we thought it was like an obvious Photoshop job.  Right. No, no, it's the real deal.  It was a blue screen of death at the Olympics during this thing.  And the big giant thing on the on the side of the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's the screen that they had in the rim around the bird's nest  where they were projecting the water and so forth.  Obviously, they were using PowerPoint projectors and a PC to project it.  And whoops, a little B.S.O.D. there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My understanding is Gates was in the audience when that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're kidding. No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I heard. I could.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds a little too perfect, doesn't it?  It does. Can you imagine being Bill Gates and looking at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I may have like crash it on purpose.  It'd be so humiliating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never seen it.  It's yes for like four years in a row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. But you know, that blue screen of death is like  that looks like a Windows 98 blue screen to me.  I don't know. I don't even see that much anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like they paid for the license anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ha. Yeah, that's true.  If you were probably a bootleg copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were watching our broadcast, our Twitter cast last week, actually,  with the the Twitch show, I had a blue screen of death right at the beginning  of the recording on this Avista machine to my left.  Died and set set and it stayed blue the whole show because I didn't.  I was in the show. I couldn't turn it off.  Fortunately, we had a backup recording, but  so they still happen.  They still happen.  It does look like it doesn't, you know, let me zoom in on it.  It doesn't look like.  I don't know if I can quite read it.  It's not in Chinese, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, John, did you see the report that GE made one point seven billion dollars  off of all the work they did for the Olympics for China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Because they're one of the main sponsors of the online stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do they do?  Do they do they set up a lot?  I mean, because I certainly was a lot of like networks to interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  power supply infrastructure, everything from like, yeah, pretty much everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because because because a lot of what I certainly my interpretation  of what I saw at the opening ceremonies was China saying  not only do we have a lot of people who can work in perfect synchrony,  but we also have great technologies.  It was American technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting to know how much they spent in total  on all of the Olympics.  Well, you don't have to tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I actually admire the job they did.  I think overall, even though there was, you know, there's a we have a couple of reports.  You know, they they have a protest area that if you go in,  do you want to protest? They arrest you.  They say, oh, yeah, and they were going to have a special protest area.  You know, you go there.  I want to protest. You're under arrest.  Yeah. I mean, that kind of thing.  Yeah. But at the same time, it's not what they've been doing with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with the couple of the conferences that have been going on,  the economic conferences in the United States.  Oh, wait, there's no area to collect you.  They just arrest you in the streets now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. That works.  But anyway, but I think overall, it's been an outstanding product over.  And I want to call it a product because that's what it is.  It is a product. Yeah.  And it's an outstanding one.  I think I really got, you know, and the fact that they can get all these people  together is like a giant party with all the best people.  And that American basketball team is just the fun is  that it's more fun than anything to watch.  They're just terrific. They look like they're having fun.  And, you know, it's just astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, this has been an enjoyable Olympics.  Very commercial, though, if you watch it on TV.  I mean, every five minutes, they're breaking away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to stop it.  Well, I think it's interesting because it's really the only major TV event

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that you encounter on these days as TV audiences get so fractured.  It's very rare that a large chunk of the populace comes together for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I got to you know what?  They're still getting like 10 or 15 million people showing up  for the Dancing with Weasels or, you know, America's Next Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so so your weasel can dance. I think that's it.  Well, you know what I mean? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of those shows will here are gathering in, you know, OK, maybe only,  you know, so they if they have 30 million people watching Olympics,  that's one in every 10 Americans.  And it's not unusual for a lot of those bizarre shows to get like, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you think American Idol got better ratings in the Olympics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so. Oh, wow. At times it has. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, also the Olympics are segmented.  There's not just one challenge.  The NBC channel, which is mostly the volleyball,  which, you know, you get a little tired of.  And no offense to the girls with the nice whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, but Misty May is like 48. I mean, come on, let's say they're getting pretty old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but anyway, but if you.  Oh, stop. Stop right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a joke. It's a joke.  20 year olds. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. I'm just joking.  What do you expect?  But anyway, the point is, is there's a whole bunch.  You know, USA Network has it. CNBC has it.  There's two dedicated Olympic channels on the satellite.  You know, Olympic A, Olympic B.  And so, you know, you could go watch.  You don't have to be.  So I think the numbers, you know, even aggregated probably maybe are pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend is went out of town.  He's on vacation and he realized he forgot to set the DVR to record the Olympics.  So he called me and I went into his house and he knew I'd be the only person  to be able to figure out his crazy for cut hysteria.  So I did. I figured it all out. Plug it all in.  And I thought, well, what am I going to record?  I mean, there's as you say, so I just I gave him, you know, have they have the  the secret word pass, you know, whatever it is in the DVR.  So I just typed in Olympics and said, record everything with Olympics in the title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God. The guy seems to be full of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just hope he has a big hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing else on there. He wanted to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One day. You'll have one day's worth of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have to have that if you have if you've got HD recording,  he's got less than a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man. That was probably a mean thing to do.  But I didn't know what he wanted. So I just I recorded it all.  So it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So talking about terrible regimes that are that are mildly successful.  How about the RIA almost shutting down Pandora?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they are. I think they will.  So this so this is the copyright.  It's really not the RIA.  It's a dreadful set.  The copyright folks are now pushing forward.  And I guess it's going to go ahead.  This new royalty structure that will make online radio stations pay  twice as much as real radio stations per play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Pandora says it can't afford it anymore.  And it's on its last legs and may go away very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Westergren says if this goes through, we're not going to be able to survive.  That's 75 percent of our revenue. And they're big.  The little stations say it's more than we make.  We're going to just shut down.  So this is that thing that we fought so vigorously a year ago.  Orc is didn't win its back.  But there are some happy occasions.  There are some occasions to celebrate.  There are two people now who've won lawsuits against the Recording  Industry Association of America.  And that is reason to celebrate just a little bit.  You know, Jami Thomas is still waiting to hear back.  The judge said, though, about about a week ago, said  he was tempted to call for a mistrial because he was on.  This is kind of an interesting admission.  He said, well, the RIA told me that the law said  you didn't have to prove that there was actual downloads occurred.  So that's the instruction I gave the jury.  In retrospect, I think probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As the coder would say, well, fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's one.  A single mom.  This is this is your typical RIA BS story.  So this this woman  is a single mom.  She has, I think, an eight year old.  This is another story.  Eight year old daughter.  Four years ago, the Recording Industry Association of America said  that she and her eight year old were downloading gangsta rap  to their home computer.  She said, what are you talking about?  She offered investigators the chance to look at her PC.  They said, no, we're just going to prosecute unless you pay us.  Her quote is, they said, you're going to have to pay us or we won't go away.  She said, no, I'm fighting it.  She was served with papers.  The court case began.  Fortunately, she found a lawyer that said, I'll I'll cover you if you don't win.  You don't owe me anything.  During the case, she submitted her PC to the music industry's  own legal team for analysis.  After the analysis was complete, the RIA refused to release the report.  The judge said, dudes, you got to release it.  They they did release it and said, no, there's no evidence of piracy.  Of course, the the the course was the case was thrown out.  Then she said, oh, wait a minute, I got some legal fees.  She countered sued.  And the court has awarded her.  Get this, the RIA said, we'll give you 30,000.  She said, no, we'll give you 60,000.  She said, no, the court has awarded her one hundred seven thousand dollars, nine  hundred fifty one. Nice.  From the recording industry for legal fees.  Yes. That's the result.  That is what we like.  Bad news for the RIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But one company that won't be getting very much money here or is struggling for it  is Twitter, cutting all its worldwide.  This you may not have realized this.  No, I did.  It's Twitter has basically killed all its SMS services outside of the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can use a short code four or four or four in the U.S.  But you can't use that plus forty four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there was never a short code that worked in the U.S.  It was a long full number.  But they've now it used to be that you could get all your updates from Twitter  via SMS and they've just switched it off and said, sorry, it's costing us too much money  and it's never coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but did you just use the Web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the whole point of Twitter was that it would fit in the SMS limit, right?  The one hundred and forty characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SMS is an important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never realized they'd have to be paying sixteen thousand MS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, yeah. Can you imagine what it must cost them, actually?  Must cost them a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what would be better surely would be to give people an option to pay to receive SMS.  For example, if you feel the person that relies on SMS for your Twitter,  wouldn't you pay, you know, three or four pounds a month to have your Twitter?  And they can even make a little bit of profit on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole thing's a scam.  We're already paying 20 bucks for unlimited SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you guys pay to receive SMS over here, which is crazy.  How do you why? Why would you need to pay to receive SMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're using their network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but you guys in the seven hundred dollars a megabyte  when you multiply the price out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't have to pay to receive SMS in the UK.  That seems crazy to me.  We pay to receive cell calls, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You must pay to receive cell calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, only in terms of having a service plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, we pay for every call we pay a minute.  So when I make a cell phone call to you, not only do I pay to call you,  you pay to receive the call in the US.  No. Yeah. Is that really true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're not paying to receive the call.  You're paying for the use of the network.  That's bonkers.  Yeah. Well, have you ever taken a look at health care in the United States?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and this is why I think, you know, it's so interesting to compare,  you know, like the iPhone price plans and things, because we have  because in the UK, you know, things like the iPhone, you've got basically  unlimited send and receive SMS, unlimited data.  And, you know, 500 to a thousand minutes of of call time to somebody else  for a price that's barely any more than any standard cell phone plan in the UK,  which is I think makes the iPhone a lot more attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bono played his stereo a little too loud.  You see this story?  Talk about old school piracy.  So four songs from U2's newest album, No Line on the Horizons, got out  and everybody was freaking out.  They were leaked online.  How did they get them?  Turns out Bono was listening to the stereo in his villa in the south of France.  Little too loud.  Some fans recorded it.  A passerby says, I recognize the voice and I recorded it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and released it onto the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How loud is his music?  How loud does he play his stereo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The irony being that the U2's manager has been absolutely outspoken  about how evil peer to peer networks are, how terrible it is that everybody's  pirating U2's music that they should be paying for.  And then Bono goes and sort of hands it to them on a plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to I want to find the recordings because I imagine that.  I mean, how good they could they be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't be good.  But they're good enough for fans, right?  Think if I Googled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been up to surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  It's enough to hear the song, right?  See the song Sexy Boots.  Let me see if I can find it.  Look on my peer to peer network.  U2 Sexy Boots.  This is what Google is so good for.  See, they should really shut down Google because it's really a music piracy tool.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Until they can keep.  Let's shut down Google.  That's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then what will we do?  Then what will we do?  U2 Sexy Boots.  Oh, this was their strategy.  All the results are like news articles about how sexy boots leak.  That's their strategy.  They keep you from finding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole thing's a marketing publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Damn.  And if I look on Seek Pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surely just YouTube.  YouTube's always got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's no video.  Maybe. Yeah, but people just like fan montages of Bono pictures.  You think it's a way to promote the album?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're being scammed.  We shouldn't even be talking about it should be boycotted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never mind.  Never mind.  Forget we said anything, you stinker Bono you.  You fooled us.  Netflix was out.  They don't say why.  You couldn't get them.  Did anybody anybody missing their movies?  You missed your movies?  They were late because Netflix shut down the distribution centers.  Fifty five distribution centers.  But that's a lot of them.  And they shut them down.  They said they never said what was wrong.  They just said,  but they're back online.  Did you get the movies yet?  We got we got two listeners in studio, Dave Kelly and Jamie Linker.  Dave, did you get your movies?  Yeah, they came.  They got them now.  See, we are nothing to see here.  Right on the edge, right on the bleeding edge of the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's move along.  There's nothing to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talking about moving along, you know, I'm looking at this story.  What is this about Microsoft money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not going to sell it in shrink wrapped anymore.  This is the new trend.  I think this is interesting.  You know, we are we got an accountant in here and I had bought QuickBooks  because I thought, oh, you're supposed to use QuickBooks.  And she said, no, no, no, no, no.  You don't buy QuickBooks anymore.  You just use the online version of QuickBooks.  Cloud.  Thirty bucks a month.  And apparently that's what Microsoft's going to do with money.  Thirty bucks a month.  Well, it won't be that much for money.  QuickBooks is expensive anyway.  So this is not much different than getting the deluxe version of QuickBooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's always basically moving money from software to software as a service.  Yes.  This is Microsoft's big strategy.  Get everyone paying monthly and then monthly.  Microsoft's want to do this for ages.  Well, it makes it sound cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does. It's probably, you know, ten bucks a month.  Yeah. Five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like rather than spending a hundred bucks for a forty nine dollar product.  Yeah. Yeah. And you don't even get a box and you don't get a book.  You don't get anything.  You haven't got a book in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you think they love it so much?  Because it's, you know, minimal cost, maximum profit.  It's it's, you know, it's anybody think about the customer anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any more servicing the customer, giving him his money or her?  Giving the customer the customers.  John, that's crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's crazy. Back servicing customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Money's worth maybe something you get value for that amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sound like an old guy.  You want some physical product? Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I want my money's worth.  Here's the deal. This reminds me of the bank tellers.  All of a sudden, they put everybody on.  Oh, let's make it do automate the bank teller.  So we have a diversity, you know, one of these machines, a bank teller machine.  And then the next thing, you know, they're charging you extra money to use it.  It's supposed to save them money to begin with.  They don't they get to fire somebody or two people.  They keep the thing going all the time.  It doesn't cost anything to maintain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, it's a free market. Go to another bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do. I do. I go to a good bank, the mechanics bank.  Do they have people behind the counters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a small, locally owned bank, basically epic customer service.  My car loans through them. I had a checking account with them.  I gave up. Like, you know what?  If somebody's giving you bad customer service, leave them.  I do. I would actually mechanics in there on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mechanics Bank is an old bank from the it's an old East Bay Bank  that goes back forever as a family owned bank.  And I remember every time, like if I want to do some small business  to sell some discs or something, I can walk down to the bank, my local branch,  and grab one of those, you know, credit card crunchers and, you know,  and then you just give it all this stuff in the little.  You don't have to go through a rigmarole to get, you know.  I mean, it's just an amazing bank.  And then, by the way, if I use it, John, is most banks used to be like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But after they've been like bought four times and in order to pay for the  for what it costs to buy every regional bank in the state of New Jersey,  they end up charging you, you know, it's yeah, it's absolutely insane.  All of the fees that are out now for a lot of the press and the really big banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if I use if I use one of those money machines,  you know, the whatever you call them, tellers, the automated things is a T.M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, but Leo, Leo, there's an entire generation of young Americans  growing up believing that music is free.  It comes from the Internet.  I should money comes out of a slot.  I, you know, I should be treated like crap by the bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, have you ever had a really good experience with a financial services provider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you have. Tell us about it.  How about Visa?  How about Visa?  I'm going to give you I'm going to give you an example.  Yes, I will. Visa.  This show is brought to you by Visa, you know, that's that's that's  we all like to, you know, bitch and moan.  But let me tell you something.  I've been getting emails by the dozens from people who say, you know,  you talk about Visa and you're absolutely right.  Guy sent me an email the other day, said my mom bought something really expensive.  What was something really expensive?  And it turned out to be a ripoff.  And I was we were really worried.  And Visa said, no, no problem.  We'll take care of it. We'll take it from here.  Here's your money back.  We'll pursue this matter.  And they did. And it was it's a beautiful thing.  When you go online to buy, you don't have to worry when you use your Visa card.  All purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.  They prevent they detect they resolve online fraud.  So you don't have to worry.  All you got to think is zero liability.  You are just not liable for unauthorized purchases.  That's peace of mind. Safe, secure.  Visa. So you see, I have had a good experience.  Thank you, Will Harris.  He's looking at me. He's looking at me.  He's thinking you're going to do the Visa spot now, aren't you?  Thank you for that segue.  Will I owe you one?  So what about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This jobs confirms the the iPhone app blacklist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's a so the idea is this makes sense.  The idea. No, they had to do this.  So that what there is, it somebody noticed that the iPhone  would periodically check this Web address.  And the Web address is an empty right now, but but could have  something on it later and a list of blacklisted apps.  The idea being if an app is a rogue app and they discover it,  they could put it on this list.  The iPhone would check and disable this app.  They have to have a kill switch.  In fact, that's what jobs says.  He says, you know, would be irresponsible not to.  Is there a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how would it get on the on the app store in the first place?  It was rogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did that, you know, I am rich application get on the app?  That's true. Obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? The I am rich application was awesome.  Anybody who's stupid enough to buy a thousand dollar item on their credit card  and they go, oh, my God, I thought it was a joke.  Give me my money back.  You know what? That was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you do that voice again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, John, they don't have any tellers.  And I have to go to the ATM.  I want my old bank back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you know what?  I went home depot to get some freaking clerks on the checkout line.  Now we go watching somebody.  Yeah, those are like the dumbest invention ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's the self checkout thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, I have to say, I saw technology go the other way.  I was in Fry's electronic store yesterday.  And you know how in like banks and big checkout things,  they have like the big numbers above the check out and the little voice  that goes, please go to cashier number four to tell you to go the right thing.  So obviously, the system wasn't working.  They literally had just this little Indian woman standing on a crate of boxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going, cashier number four, cashier number three.  Go to four. You were in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually cheaper to do it with a person than it is to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that whole electronic system without without having that person in Fry's  on a Saturday afternoon.  You would never actually get in line.  You do have to have that.  It's you laugh.  But like if that woman goes on a bathroom break, the line stops moving for 10 minutes.  It's the saddest thing. Well, there's nothing more pathetic than a bunch of weeks  next to the rack of chocolate.  You know, not wearing their contacts.  So they can't see Google Mail down. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long the mail down and the apps are down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was intermittently out for business for Google Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can Google go down for 90 minutes?  I don't understand. It's a cloud. It's the cloud.  I just don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't trust the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there were lots of people complaining  because obviously a lot of businesses run on Google Mail and Google Apps  for your domain, et cetera.  And if your business goes out for, you know, a few hours in the week  and it occurred a couple of times in the week as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw the bitching and moaning, but I just don't I mean, I don't rely on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't think of Google ever going down, do you?  I don't understand how it could go down. It's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, therein lies the rub.  Can you imagine when Microsoft gets up ahead of Steam with its cloud crap?  How long that's going to be crashing left and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So between mobile and Google and Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If everybody's going to rely on this cloud stuff for the, you know, for their apps  and do you want to do their tax?  Can you imagine what the tax thing is going to be like?  You're going to you have to do your taxes.  You're going to use one of these online apps and it's going to be April 14th.  This thing, and it goes down at six o'clock in the evening, the night before,  the 15th, before you have to finalize.  It's ridiculous. It's a disaster waiting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rafe Noodleman does a great list in his CNET column Webware 2.0.  Ten worst web glitches of 2008 so far.  Amazon S3 goes down. Twitter goes down.  Firefox says we're going to sell, you know, download a million apps  and then the day starts and it's not working.  Amazon goes offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Docs goes down.  Surely Twitter is all of those top ten.  Well, me goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool.com Google competitor down first day.  Then he mentions the Scrabble Scrabbulous thing.  Gmail going down. Netflix going down.  You know, you got to wonder how are we going to rely on this infrastructure  for the backbone of our economy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not if you're sensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's weird about it to me is the fact that we've been in that, you know,  we've been in the Internet game now for, you know, forever, for at least minimally  since the Web evolved around, you know, the early 90s.  So, you know, we're going 15 years into it so far.  And we have not really gone completely, even though there was a belated attempt  in the late 90s to move everything to the cloud, as we like to call it now.  And the fact of the matter is the system is so unreliable  and we have never really seen an entire generation of people all move to the cloud  because it's only a hit and miss thing now.  I mean, I I don't use anything on the cloud except, you know, I blog on the cloud.  But, you know, that's about it.  It's it's it can't handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just hear the Rolling Stones.  Hey, hey, you, you get off of my cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I agree. I think it's a problem.  On the other hand, I love cloud computing.  I mean, I just love the idea of money being online, of Gmail being online.  I mean, I love cloud computing.  So we just what can we make it more reliable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, like the other thing is, what about the performance?  The performance sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I think that there are a few apps that are really suited to being  email is obvious. Email is the obvious one, right?  Having all your email in the cloud rather than local seems  at this point to be a bit of a note, you know, if it seems a good idea.  Yeah, because then you can get anywhere.  You can have your word processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. What's the game there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you can't see myself sitting down at somebody else's machine to write.  If you're in a work group, OK, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you want to do your taxes online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I want to keep that stuff to myself on my own machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that makes sense.  Who's making you do your taxes online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody, but it sounds as though that they're going to do this  with the with the QuickBooks and the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the idea of doing it online is if it interfaces with  with the government's internet filing service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can do that locally if you have.  That's how they do it now.  You install the application on your computer, then it accesses  the information it can online.  This is all about reducing costs.  It's about reducing packaging.  It's about not having to pay for SKUs in the big box stores.  You know, I mean, in terms of like moving your tax stuff online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as you move stuff online, then you also have to consider privacy.  You know, we just saw the admission by Cable One  that they were for six months monitoring their customers' internet movements  to to amass, they say, a refined data  base of web server habits that could be sold to advertisers at premium rates.  These are those that Nebu ads technology.  A small cable company, Breznan Communications,  said they did a similar thing from April 1st to June 26th.  They don't tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think all these companies are just trying to find new ways to make money  like everybody else.  Yeah, but I mean, on the on the packaging thing, you know,  that you could make an argument that we sort of  there's a big environmental drive right now to reduce packaging,  reduce distribution, reduce air miles and everything  isn't moving to the cloud sort of environmentally responsible.  Or is that just too hippie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's way too hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because, you know,  I just I just think that there's no you never want to buy software  on this now, do you really?  I mean, if you're looking to get a new piece of software,  where's the first place you go? You go to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My program, I would.  But anyway, you can take your bong  and come up with some better excuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. John, with the smackdown, did you go to Cal Berkeley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, ironically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you were the guy  not doing anything naked in the campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was selling the bongs, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, complete change of topic.  Patrick, have you been following this thing about the DEFCON?  The the hacking talk being banned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually not unusual.  Once every year or two, somebody runs a foul.  Somebody's somebody basically gets a chilling effect  based on the subject of their conversation and the subject of their talk.  And they back out rather than risk.  They basically they either there's one of two reactions.  They either resign and fire up the lawyers or they back down  from giving the talk and and, you know,  you know, a select group of people in the audience figures out enough  to start chasing down whatever the anomaly is on their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't go to DEFCON this year.  No, you used to go all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been to every DEFCON for almost 10 years now, I think.  I understand.  Just, you know, scheduling family and some production problems.  But yeah, we've been building a projector with system  and every possible thing that could go this particular project is going wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so this is not unusual, though.  I mean, I could think of other DEFCONs where authorities have tried  to stop people from giving their presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happens often enough to, you know, it happens.  You know, I'm pretty sure it's happened at Black Hat  and at other security conferences, you know, especially.  I mean, you know what I found out recently is like,  Debold changed their name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see that was an amazing story about the virus software?  Yeah. Oh, my.  What happened? What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's blaming.  They're basically they're OK.  XKCD.com was a great cartoon site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Amazing comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If you've never been there, go there now.  Read all their cartoons. They're wonderful.  But they yeah.  Premier Election Solutions, formerly Debold,  has blamed Ohio voting machine errors on problems with the machines.  McAfee anti-virus software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. They're running McAfee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I like the, you know, there's a virus get on an election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is the conversation in the comic, right?  Which is, well, surely it's better to have virus software on there than not.  And the obvious answer is, well, why on earth have you got an infrastructure  where your election machine needs a virus software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if they're relying on McAfee, we're all in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think I think they have a great analogy, which is  it's like your your high school teacher at a parent teacher evening saying,  whenever I teach, I always use condoms.  We think sure, sure, it's better than not.  But someone's doing their job very wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there's McAfee actually does a pretty good job on a lot of things.  But the what's fascinating about that is, yeah, what are they connected to?  What kind of open network are they connected to that they would need?  Anti-virus software?  What what internal incidents causes that?  Or is that just some bizarre belt and suspenders?  You know, approach to the security on these devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This needs looking into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the Debolds need looking into for years.  I mean, Debold has their ass handed to them so hard,  they basically changed the name of the company.  They did that because they thought premier election solutions would  would be a big draw for, you know, all of the electorates  that are trying to replace their hanging Chad machines.  No, they did it because their name got trashed because they did a bunch of things  wrong and then made it enormously difficult to make it, you know,  for outside sources to verify the veracity of their code.  That's a sentence.  Verify the veracity. That was something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now I know where the bong went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, before we go any further, this is a I love this subject,  but we'll talk about it in a second.  I want to mention audible dot com.  Your free audio book awaits you at audible dot com slash twit.  We've got so many great selections.  Audible has just really been a great sponsor for us.  Fifty thousand books, radio shows, lectures, newspapers, magazines,  everything you'd ever want in audio.  You can listen to at audible dot com.  Dot com slash twit.  Did we ever get we ever gotten you an audible?  No, we got to get you one, Will Harris.  That's it has something to do with you being in the UK, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's they have slightly different systems, different rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, have you been reading?  You know, I got some good news, actually, for you, Patrick.  I know you're reading anathem.  Yes, I talked to them.  I said, you're going to really set an audio.  They said, you bet. They're recording it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's funny. I'm actually it's going to be a few weeks before I can get to that  because I'm going through the through the  John Adams.  Isn't that great?  I think it's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's by the way, that is an excellent audible book.  Just love that.  And it just really reinspired.  You love American history.  It really inspired me to to kind of get back into American history.  That's it. Let's make that our pick.  It's David McCullough's John Adams.  But any of these 50,000 books can be yours.

And I know you're going to love your audio books.  If you listen to podcasts, why aren't you listening to audible dot com?  A U D I B L E dot com.  Oh, any other big stories in the news this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're learning about the Diebold election systems conversion to premier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  elections. Why do they change their name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They changed the name of that division.  It's a subsidiary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also because Diebold has such a bad rep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Diebold, Diebold actually has a really good rep.  They probably made the ATM machines that John has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They make everybody's. Yeah, they make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they're good. I mean, they do a lot of good stuff.  They just the they acquired global election systems in 2001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they're the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there was the whole Georgia Secretary of State did a contract with Diebold.  And then the chief executive Diebold was doing a lot of fundraising for the Republican Party.  And then there's all sorts of all sorts of stuff.  But basically, like in March 2007, it was reported by Associated Press that Diebold  was considering divesting itself of its voting machine subsidiary because it was,  quote, widely seen as tarnishing the company's reputation, unquote.  And actually, in August 2007, a Wikipedia scanner found that edits via the company's  IP addresses occurred to Diebold's Wikipedia article, removing criticisms of the company's  products, references to its CEO fundraising for President Bush and other negative criticism  from the Wikipedia page about the company in November 2005.  Yeah, so. It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just I think that everybody agrees that there's no way an election  electronic election system can work without a paper trail.  I know people are fighting that, but I think now election commissions in every state agree.  And that's pretty much the standard, isn't it?  It's a no brainer, isn't it? Yeah.  Some kind of back up.  Just wait a look and see if it, you know, if the machine lied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that makes sense. Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no next. Let's wrap it up. What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, anything I was going to say is that there's a the big Intel conferences this week.  So look, you're coming.  IDF is coming up. You're out here for IDF.  Yes, that's this week.  There's going to be quite a lot of Intel news on the way.  We'll get you back on next week and talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He you will know some stuff you can't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can say some some broad things, which is Intel is going to be talking about  in a halem, which is its new desktop processor, which is going to be bigger,  better, faster than than core two and core two quad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear I hear it's going to do something kind of interesting,  that it's going to allow you to run and dual core if there's no reason to run a dual core.  But if you but it's but it has a quad core,  you want to confirm or deny that? Have you heard that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does it got to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that way, the buying decision is a lot easier.  You just say, well, I'll buy the halem quad and and I'll have more power  because it'll overclock in the two in the dual core gets a little faster.  I'll have more power for programs that you don't use all four cores.  But when I need all four cores, I've got them.  So is that clever?  Chirp, chirp. It's to simplify the buying decision.  And I can verify that because we had to really agonize over that with the ultimate  gaming machine, we go quad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's too many, too many skews even, you know, and there's going to be  because they're not going to eliminate a bunch of skews when they when they  release the new processors.  There's like 25 different skews for for Intel processors right now.  I should just be one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One server chip, one desktop chip, one laptop.  Well, they're going to be talking about some about Larabee as well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is their new graphics card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larabee, Larabee sounds like a sidekick and gets smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larabee stuff is really bizarre.  It'll be interesting to hear them get a little more in depth.  It sounds like basically a bunch of like DSPs bundled together.  You know what I mean? It's like a bunch of parallel processing pipelines.  It can be almost seems like it's less interesting as a graphics processor  than it is. Yeah. It being exploited like a cell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's they're all so Larabee is all X86 cores.  So that so they're all it's like taking 20 Pentiums  and putting them on a graphics card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hopefully something faster than Pentium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Pentium compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's I mean, that's what's really interesting about it as an idea.  It's I think it's less interesting as a graphics processor than it is  and what sort of custom applications people might come up with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think in time it's going to get  I think that'll certainly be initially in time.  These things are going to get more and more closer to real processing  rather than just graphics processing.  Because if you've got X86 flavored tasks to run on your processor  and your graphics card is idle, if your graphics card is X86, just farm it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think calling it a GPU is kind of a MacGuffin on Intel's part  rather than what its primary intentions are.  I think they're calling it a GPU so they don't got any of their potential sales.  And some are. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, eventually it'll just be.  Well, I think, you know, what you're seeing with AMD  is where they're starting to integrate everything onto the same core.  Eventually, if you've just got, you know, 10,000 X86 cores,  you'll just assign them as you want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Assuming they actually  assuming they actually scale the way they want them to. Yeah.  It's always kind of interesting when you start bundling a whole bunch  of disparate elements on a single die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's not good to just do all of us are computing in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to the clouds right now.  Will Harris is at Channel Flip Dotcom.  That is a great place to go if you want to watch the next generation  of television on the net, including Jello and Girls.  What more could you ask for on this channel?  The Jello and Girls. You call it jelly in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bit surreal.  It's English humor, but it's very Monty Python.  But you might get a grip.  Somebody said that we should combine the Jello and the Girls channels together.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's another another show at another time.  John C. Dvorak is online at Dvorak dot org slash blog,  but also catch him on No Agenda, Tech Five, Cranky Geeks.  Many other fine shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the real Dvorak at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, follow him. Please.  You can also follow Patrick.  He is Patrick Norton on Twitter  and watch him on Tekzilla at Tekzilla dot com and system.  S.Y.S.T.M. All of them at revision three.  Well, thank you.  And we'll see you all another time.  I'm Leo Laporte. Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you went into some sort of a loop on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Loop loop loop loop loop loop.  Loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like that? No.
