Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a 42 sport? 42 sport I  have. I have a 42. They let us  get one at inside because of  the developer kit so they just

Start time: 347.16
End time: 348.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sent us one early. So your

Start time: 349.10
End time: 413.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  inside app is on the watch  already? No just the SMS but  they featured us so we have a  good relationship with them and  I think when you're a top  developer they'll give it to you  like first shot at bat. So I  also have another one coming  like a doctor but I have to say  I think this is going to be a  $50 million a year this year if  they can produce that many  because the act of getting your  SMS messages here and your  alerts here is so delightful I  think that once people see the  early adopters with it they're  going to want it and at Christmas  there's really like people went  back and downgraded their iPhone  6's to 5's like Ev Williams was  like I don't like the 6 I'm  going to go back to the 5. Really?  Yeah and I think a lot of people  don't feel the necessity to keep  their phone on the watch so they  buy the watch because it really  does enhance the experience when  you're waiting for an Uber or  you're getting like news and you  can just look at your wrist and  in meetings and I was at the  movies yesterday and I had alerts

Start time: 430.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  completely wrong. Wow. Here we go.

Start time: 508.30
End time: 565.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome back to the show. I feel  like I suddenly got it because I've  worn these all now in Android wear  and Pebble and you're wearing the  basis. You're actually wearing two  watches. You're crazy. Yeah. I  finally realized as much as I want  this category to take off, they're  too damn small to be useful. The  UI is too difficult on something  this small. It's the same problem I  had with Google Glass. It's too  fussy. It's too finicky. It's too  hard to get it to work. It's  too small. It's too small. It's  too hard to get it to work. It's  especially when everything I do on  this I can do on my phone, which is  right here. I was hopeful that  Apple, just as they have in the  past with the iPod, the iPad, the  iPhone, would take an existing  category and figure out the secret  sauce that would make it sing. Now  that I've had this for 10 days,  nah, they didn't. I disagree  entirely. I think this is going to  sell worse and worse. No. I'm right  in the middle. First of all, I

Start time: 566.26
End time: 567.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  think it's going to sell worse and

Start time: 568.22
End time: 609.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  worse. No. I'm right in the  middle. First of all, as average  consumers, people wanted a big  phone. The sale of the iPhone 6  and 6 Plus show that. People  holding on to iPhone 4s waiting  for an i6 and i6 Plus. So why do  they want this little stamp-sized  duke? That's my point. That's  something that will be a novelty,  but I don't think that's a  necessity. This watch is not a  necessity. It doesn't change my  world or my lifestyle that I need  to be. The reason I'm not saying  that is because I don't think  the old and new things are  expensive. The old things are  much more expensive than the new  things. And I'm not trying to  come up with a new thing. I'm  just going to go look at it and

Start time: 611.16
End time: 622.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say, well, all Apple's going to  do is come out with a better one  next year. Why? If I get one, I  have to get the cheapest one  because there's no way in the  world I'm going to spend more

Start time: 623.10
End time: 656.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  money than I have to knowing the  new things. I'm with Jason on  this. I think that I use it just  like I don't use it for many  things. I use it for use case  scenarios where I want to do  something quick, fast and  seamless without any bugging  anyone. So I use it for turning  on my lights, changing my hues,  turning off my lights, opening  my door, shazaming music and  answering calls and just  checking notifications so that I  know if I have to get out my  phone or not. And that makes my  life easier. I think that it  makes things faster and I enjoy  it. I don't really interface  with it very much besides that.

Start time: 658.10
End time: 680.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The apps are going to need to  catch up for sure. That's the  issue. Right now, having to hunt  and peck to get what you want is  a real bummer. You absolutely  can see that. But when you get a  nice delightful alert like, hey,  here's the SMS, here is your  Uber's arriving, your food's  arriving, when those just gentle  notifications come and you don't  have to take it out, I think  people are going to become  addicted to it. How lazy have we

Start time: 680.10
End time: 685.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  become? How lazy have we become?  I don't understand why it's so  hard to look at your phone. Have

Start time: 686.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 690.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 701.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  drive, which was fabulous because  it was on my wrist, it was easy  to see and it was telling me  which way to turn. I actually  agree with you on that. I

Start time: 702.63
End time: 722.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  discovered that last fall when we  were in London with the Android  Wear and I said, take us to the  Tower of London and it bought,  just like the Apple Watch, it  buzzes. You don't have to do  that. It buzzes. You turn left,  turn right. I think that is, but  you have to be walking and you  have to be trying to find  something you can't find. There's  WALL-E, thanks. Now the wall is  busy, nobody's going to want to

Transcript:  take this test too. I like

Start time: 725.01
End time: 755.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  smart watches when I'm up and  about and walking around because  when I'm walking around I don't  want to be using my phone and the  smart watch works really well. I  also think that basically almost  all the Apple Watch apps that  exist were written by people who  had never seen an Apple Watch  when they wrote the app. That's  absolutely true. Therefore it's  going to take at least 60 to 90  days before it's really clear  what's going on. I think the  killer apps for the most part  will not be written by Apple to a  larger extent than usual. It's  going to be the third parties  that either make this thing  compelling or fail to make this  thing compelling. And I grant

Start time: 755.77
End time: 775.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you that we've talked about this  on MacBreak Weekly, the ecosystem  could change things. Apple Pay is  interesting for instance. Although  again with Apple Pay I don't find  it so much of a convenience  because I still have to debit or  credit, do you want cash back? I  actually have to sign a  card over at the grocery store.  I had to sign. I don't do that.  Well I think it's card specific,  it might be merchant specific.

Start time: 776.10
End time: 776.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm not such like. Yeah it should

Start time: 778.75
End time: 816.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be you just do that. But even  then that's still not such a huge  savings in time. I feel like it is  possible and I'm going to be open  minded, I'm going to continue to  use it, that the ecosystem and the  apps could make a difference. But  I also think that there may be a  really a structural issue which is  it's very hard to create a user  interface on something this tiny  that's functional, that's good,  that's not fussy. This thing has a  button, a crown, two buttons, a  crown, force touch and you still  have to you know, fumble around  quite a bit to do something. And  voice, have you been using Siri?  Yeah I've been using Siri when it  works. I was hoping they would

Start time: 817.16
End time: 822.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have a much bigger screen. I  thought it was going to be more  like a bangle or just a little bit  taller or bigger. I want a, yeah

Start time: 823.14
End time: 823.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  could be a little bit bigger. Who

Start time: 824.30
End time: 829.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Flavor Flav, but Apple.

Start time: 834.11
End time: 865.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The other point is you named a  whole ton of watches, you named a  Pebble, all these other things and  Jason's big thing is the  notifications that easily come and  tell you. A lot of watch companies  do notifications and they aren't  mass market adapted yet. People  aren't just saying, oh wow you're  getting SMS's on your watch, I  need one of those. Regular people  aren't doing that and the bubble  we live in, that's what I think.  That's the best watch in the world.  Regular people don't look at a  wear or an app phone, they're like  oh so I can get an Uber alert.  What's Uber? I live in a regular  town, I don't know what Uber is.  That's why I don't think you're

Start time: 866.12
End time: 873.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to have the sales figures  that you were quoting Jason.  Because normal people, yes our  group will, but normal people are  not. I agree with you 100% on this.

End time: 888.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to see a social  product arrive for this, like an  Instagram or a Snapchat, that will  be made for this. We just haven't  seen it yet. You're going to see a  game like Clash of Clans or Solitaire  was for Windows. We just haven't  seen it yet. Apple does not

Transcript:  actually allow animation on this.  The only way you can have anything  at all like animation is with a  slideshow. There are some severe  limitations to doing anything  compelling on this right now. But

Start time: 900.10
End time: 919.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  it's pretty clear that the apps  you can write now, which are  really more like front ends for an  app being on your phone or a stop  gap, and at some point there will  be full blown apps on this and at  that point it will get much more  popular. You'll also have an Apple  watch which does not require your  phone to be there because it will  have a connection. Those things in

Start time: 940.12

Transcript:  first used multi-touch, a light  bulb did go on, didn't it? Even on  the first iPhone which was very  limited, had no app store, multi-touch  was kind of a revelation. It's like  ah, oh I don't need a keyboard  anymore. I can do this and I can use  multiple. I don't know what the  multi-touch is for this. And I have  to say what's very obvious is how  much thought was put into this. You  know, I think it's a very  interesting activity thing that Jay  Blahnik, the Nike guy was spending a  lot of time. We'll do circles, it'll  do this, you'll get a little star.  There clearly is years of thought  that went into this and that's why I  may be a little discouraged that if  even with all of the brains that  Apple threw at this for years, they  weren't able to come up with that

Transcript:  amazing. I mean the activity  tracking alone I think is a major  win. I've been using the Spaces one  and it really has changed my  behavior. I try to every day hit my  steps. I try to hit my run club. The  Fitbit did that. Yeah and I think  that those changed behavior. Now if  a company like Apple can make it  elegant and compatible with the  iPhone in a very easy way without  having to worry about the  cost of the iPhone. That could be  an entire category health book that  really, really compels people to buy

Start time: 1034.30
End time: 1046.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  just to get healthier. I do agree  with that because I had the jawbone  and I had the Fitbit and I made  myself stop using both of them  because I was waiting for my new  watch to come and apparently Apple  Watch by all tests is more accurate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  than all of those devices also. But  the software sucks. I have to say  I'm super disappointed in their  health kit so far and I really hope  that Apple Watch will be able to  make it. That would be killer if you  could use any of the other apps with  the Apple Watch as the input to give

Transcript:  other point. It's a first gen for its  interface and I think that they're  going to get better as they realize  how people interact with it. Plus  Apple fans are just huge fans of  their products and we're talking  about a million user base of people  that have iPhone 5s and 6s. We're  talking about 2% and we've already hit  our 5 million. We're going to be, I  think that 2% of Apple users are going  to, way over that percentage are going  to be ending up using, getting an  Apple Watch to test it out. These are  going to be bundled by Christmas. Yeah  it's going to be pretty easy I think to  hit huge numbers for Apple and then  we'll have to see where it goes from

Transcript:  there. The other thing I came away  with is how brilliant Apple is in two  things, design and marketing. It is  beautiful. I mean you have two of the  best designers in the world, Andy, I  don't know who Andy is, Johnny Ive and  Mark Newsome. And I think they've done a  very, I mean given that they had to make  it thick enough to put a battery in,  they've done a very good job of design.  It feels good. It feels good, it looks

Transcript:  hand. I don't like the crown. When the  Apple iPhone came out they had lapped,  they lapped everybody in the business.  There was nobody even close, right? I  don't feel like that's the case today. I  think that in fact Android Wear is pretty  darn close and could easily keep up, look  at what Apple's done and say oh we can do  that and we can best it. So it's going to  be, that's good for consumers, that's going  to mean there's going to be a lot of choice  and it's not just going to be on iOS.

Transcript:  Android Wear even though it is coming to iOS  just as Pebble it will never really be a full  peer as Apple Watch is to iOS. On the other  hand if you're an Android user I would say  don't feel left out. You're going to be just  fine because the Android Wear watches, they're  already a second generation that's starting  to come out. I'm going to get the LG Urbane  on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  said it costs $80 to make. Well, by the way Tim  Cook in his analyst call said I hate it when people  say how much it costs for us to make. He hates it  for two reasons. One, because you see the profit  margins. Two, he says because you can't possibly  we don't use off the shelf components. So you can't  tell me that you know how much my special VLSI CPU  cost because I make it and you don't. Right. Or the  Taptic engine. By the way, okay Taptic. It's just a  freaking vibrator. It is not, this is Apple's  marketing skill. The engine is a Taptic engine that  will make your wrist feel as if somebody's touching

It is not an invisible tap on your wrist. It  sounds like a buzz and I can hear it when you're  buzzing so stop it. They did over sell that a bit.  They over sold it and they sold it. That's what they  do. That's what they're going to do. They find new  words for everything. The intersection between  humanity and technology. The Taptic engine is the  thinnest. That's good.

And once you have this everything CGI, I think the actors can't act well in it and I don't  think it looks real.  So when you look back to the models and full-scale models of the Millennium Falcon, it's easier  for them to act.

The fact that we could change the world now if we do X, Y, Z, and it's possible if you  guys help me, I can help you.  I don't care what he said.  It was 18 minutes of pure joy.  I sent it to two of my friends who are basically in huts right now.  They travel the world helping sick kids in Africa and the other friends in China helping  animals and stuff.  And my one friend was like, I'm literally crying right now because you don't understand  the places I go to that have solar power and then they can't have power at night and they  can't do it.  There aren't options.  Like the batteries like he was saying are junk.  They literally are.  And people that are in those countries one day will be able to have sustained power.  He changed the world.  Him, his team, everybody.  I want to go work for that man.  I work for that man for free right now.  I love that man so much.  It is a powerful, powerful thing.  It's amazing.

Charge your battery.  Right?  So when you have a Tesla, you can set it to charge at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. when you know that  the load is low and you get cheap electricity.  You have a Tesla, right?  Yeah, it's right outside.  You got the first road.  That's serial number one.  Yeah.  Elon gave it to me.  That's nice.  I'm behind it.  So, yeah.  And so ...  That's right.  You were the first person I knew to get a Tesla.  Well, what happened was the company was going out of business and I was at dinner with them  and he was really ...

And so we're out at dinner, just the two of us in LA, and I said, well, certainly there's  some good news.  He's like, well, I blew up the second rocket.  I said, what happens if you blow up a third rocket?  He goes, SpaceX is done.  I said, well, how are you doing personally?  And he was getting divorced from his first wife at that time.  And I said, certainly there must be some good news.  Tell me something good that's going on.  And he took out his Blackberry.  That's how old it was.  And he said, well, don't tell anybody, but here's the clay model of the ...  The Roadster.  No, the Model S. We had the Roadsters.  And he showed me the clay model of the sedan.  And I said, wow, that's gorgeous.  What do you think you can get it for?  And he said, well, don't tell anybody, but I think I can make this for 50 grand.  So I went home and I wrote two checks for $50,000 and I put them in a FedEx envelope.  And I said, E, looks like a great car.  I'll take two.  And I told my wife, we're never going to see this.  This is going to pay for a couple of days of payroll at Tesla.  It's going out of business, but I have to support my friend.  That's awesome.  Two years later, the checks were cashed.  And it said, congratulations, your serial number reservation is 00001-000073.  And I forwarded it to Elon.  And I said, Elon, you don't have to give me the first one.  He goes, I want you to have it.  You ordered it before anybody.  You deserve it.  That's a great story.  And I said, OK.  And so I got it outside.  And then I was just offered a quarter million dollars for it from my collector.  No.  Twice what I paid for it.  Because it's one.  It's certainly a certain amount.  So I'm going to put it on.  That is amazing.  But you know, he's a transcendent entrepreneur, obviously.  But what you see here, what I loved about this keynote was he was going up there talking  about not his business, but the problem that the world faces.  And 99% of the keynote was, hey, everybody's denying climate change.  Here is the chart of carbon.  Here is a solution that will work.  And he's trying to explain to people who are in climate denial and who believe that the  world cannot solve its own problems and saying, you can solve your problems.  If we put out 200 million of these in the world, we can get everybody off of fossil  fuel.  It is possible.  And to give you an idea, if we put a billion of these in the world, well, we put a billion  cars out in the world, every X number, two billion cars in the world, like every 20 years,  we can do this in our lifetime and we can make carbon go sideways.  So this was a pitch to stop climate change, not a pitch for his own bankroll.  And that's what blew everybody away.  It was like, it would be like if Steve Jobs got on stage and was like, hey, the reason  we're going to get these watches is because if we have everybody's health data, we can  help everybody with that, you know, big data cure cancer eventually, because we'll have  everybody's data.  This was transcendent.  It wasn't about him.  It was about climate change.

I would love for other companies to come in here and help me.  Now, how many of these companies are going to sit around like Blockbuster looking at  Netflix saying, oh, well, nobody's going to want that.  That doesn't matter.  And the next thing you know, they're ramping up.  They're like, wow, nobody's really coming into the store.  And why is the grid not producing as much power as these two?  Oh, because people are getting these batteries.  And the next thing you know, they're left out in the dust because somebody else is doing  it.  And that for some reason, the older dinosaur carts of the world think about the future  and change things because he literally said, hey, it's open source technology.  Help me do it.  Help me change the world.  Here's how we do it.  He gave you a plan, a blueprint, and he's given it to you on a platter.  Let's go.

Transcript:  Yeah.  You put the battery on the wall like this.  Boom.  And what's really interesting is the story arc for Elon was when he was starting SpaceX,  he started bringing in metal into this side of the factory.  And I remember him touring and he said, this is the metal we're going to use to make that  rocket.  And then he had a machine in between.  That's going to press it.  Then when he did Tesla, he's like, he took those same lessons he learned and put it to  Tesla to build a car.  So when you go to the Tesla factory, materials come in here, car comes out there.  He's not making any of the parts from somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the other end.  And the thing that he was supplying, the two things he was supplying from other places  was the steering column was from Mercedes.  And then, and I don't think it is in the next one, but the batteries he was getting from  China.  And he said, I remember him telling me, they're not going to be able to make enough batteries  for me.  I got to make my own battery.  Right.  That's where the Gigafactory came in.  And because one of the things that's happened is the stock price of Tesla has appreciated  so much that he's been able to use that to take on bigger projects like the Gigafactory.  The Gigafactory is going to produce batteries for everything.  And this wall battery idea could change everything because if you store that electricity local  and you got 10% of people to do that, we might not have to fire up the coal plants.  We might be able to stick with nuclear, hydro, and solar.  Cleaner choices.  And the cleaner choices.  And if you think it's impossible, in Germany, they're phasing out nuclear and they've had  days when they've been 60, 70% renewables.  Now these are weekend days, whatever.  You have France, which is 90% nuclear, and then you have Germany, which is 30 to 70%  renewables.  This can happen in the United States.  We're going to get to the point where we'll have either free or close to free electricity.  If we do that, desalinization is currently running at a penny a gallon.  There's new nanotechnology, basically mesh filters, where water can get pushed through  because desalinization is just about energy.  The energy to push it through these nano things, it's going to go down to a tenth of a penny  per gallon.  If that happens, if we can have the solar and the batteries and a decentralized grid,  we could be sucking the water out of the Pacific Ocean and we could make the deserts into oases.  So the whole world's going to change in our lifetime.  And I think it's going to be part of the legacy that Elon has.  It's going to solve all these problems.  And so I'm a techno-optimist, but mainly because of my friendship with Elon and seeing him  do it.  He's quite impressive.  He does not have the fear gene.  He has the courage.  Zero fear in the man.  I saw him on the brink of a nervous breakdown and he's told the story publicly about how  he almost had a nervous breakdown during all this.  And he was living off a loan from one of our famous billionaire friends.  And he told that story publicly recently.  And he brought it all back.  But I mean, to have $200 million in personal wealth, shove it all into two companies, be  living off a loan from your friend, and then come back from that, I mean, he has no fear  gene.  And he, one time, I remember one time he was like, hey, oh, you're playing poker.  I wonder if I should learn how to play poker.  I was like, no.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  I mean you put solar in you would charge.  I would like to do that.  Yeah.  I'd be off the grid right.  Yeah and then when you have these things like I was just texting with Elon the other  I was like if we have another New York situation when New York lost power for three or four  days everybody in that city is going to put one of these in.  And so that's going to be the tipping point.  And nobody really got this on Thursday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well that's that's like what I was going to say.  There are people that are in struck areas of this country where there's storms there's  outages that would want something like this because one it's fixated.  You know what it is a generator a generator could go bad in a different way.  You have to you have to have them outside your house.  They cause fires.  There's all kinds of other problems with those kind of generators and backup systems that  you have currently.  If you did have solar great you're going to get free power.  If you don't and you're in Alaska or somewhere down south or in the wooded area or off off  grid anyway this is where that's going to start and then it'll expand out.

Start time: 3044.22
End time: 3064.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll also be people love that feeling of being in control of themselves.  I think that that makes them feel much more empowered so that you're controlling the electricity  that you deal with and you're helping out the environment at the same time.  It's not just about monetary gain.  So I think that people will enjoy being able to do it all themselves and producing their  own electricity and if they can being able to give back to the system.

Transcript:  That's even better.  It's a great product.  Stamps is what turns your fulfillment operation pro.  If you sell on eBay or Amazon or Etsy and you're selling out.  You know it's so funny because Lisa buys a lot of stuff on Etsy and we always get these  boxes and it looks like a monkey wrapped it and then it's got 800 stamps on it.  It doesn't project the most professional look.  It's so easy with stamps.com.  First of all you don't have to go to the post office anymore.  So a lot of stress is off your head because you can do it all at your desk with your computer.  You get that USB scale so you always know exactly how much postage.  When you print the postage, by the way you can print it on envelopes too.  It's not just for packages.  You can print right on envelopes with your company logo.  The return address is automatic.  You can pull the addresses out of QuickBooks or other address databases or right from the  website.  If you're sending a package you see how professional it looks.  And your logo is on there and you look like you're a real business.  I can't tell you how important that is.  It just makes a huge difference.  First impression, absolutely.  So you're going to love it because you don't have to go to the post office.  You get a discount you can't get at the post office.  And you get convenience factors like it will automatically send an email if it's one of  those kinds of priority mail that you have to sign for or express mail.  So the email goes out with a tracking number.  All this off automatically.  I want you to try it and we've got a great deal for you.  It's our no risk trial.  If you go to Stamps.com click the microphone in the upper right hand corner there.  The offer code for this is TWIT.  Just put TWIT in the offer code.  Then they know that you heard about it here and you'll get a $110 bonus offer.  That includes that digital scale, yours to keep.  $55 in free postage a month of Stamps.com.  It's really a nice deal.

So like the idea of selling a book for like two or three bucks and then you have to ship  it for seven or eight dollars because it weighs a lot.  It's crazy.  So the US Postal Service came out with this thing called media mail, which is like two  bucks or something.  But it's slow but it's still cheap.  Yeah.  It gets there in under 10 days.  It's five, six, seven days.  But you can do it through Stamps.com and we basically sell all of our books every year,  all of our media and you can just get rid of it.  I didn't even know you did books.  Yeah.  I like to read.  No, I just like to read.  I'm a big reader.  I like to learn.  I do.  I love books.  I love books and I love audiobooks.  My two things.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you're talking about 20, 30 minutes.  So there.  I would love that.  So Elon's not doing it, just to be clear.  But he proposed it.  Yeah.  So one of the SpaceX engineers is now doing it.  And I invested in it and a couple of other people have invested in it.  And we're going to make a two mile test track.  And then from there, once we get the two mile test track and people can and we're making  a life size one.  And so when people can see that.  What do you mean life size?  Is that going to be doll size?  I'm glad to hear that.  It was actually going back to Elon Musk.  Little H.O. sized trains.  People were suggesting make a small one.  Right.  There it is.  That's it.  So we're actually making a full two mile track.  And are you going to ride in it?  I don't know if humans will be in it, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if it's tested  enough.  But here's the thing.  What Elon learned with doing the space with the engines, they were like, oh, make a small  size model.  And it was like, you know what?  The cost savings of being a small model is the difference in materials.  Right.  It's not actually that much.  It's not the building.  The engineering and the time cost of all these engineers.  So we've hired a couple dozen engineers and we're off to the races and we'll have a two  mile track in the next two years.

But anyway, the Hyperloop, if it works, it could change everything because it could go  underground into water to China.  And it's going to, what people think is about moving people.  Oh, it's not going to LA.  Well, LA, Vegas, everywhere is a possibility.  But here's the thing.  The magic of it could be shipping.

And so it would you basically would have it sneaking to China underwater at a certain  depth that you would have to be make sure that people don't like drop anchor in that  area.  So like I was like, what's the biggest danger?  Like an anchor.  I was like, yeah, that would be bad, wouldn't it?  But here's the very interesting thing.  So that would only be that wouldn't be used for humans in all likelihood.  But I was like, well, what happens if this tube gets compromised or like, well, that's  the greatest thing in the world in terms of safety, because then it slows down because  there's air in the tube.  Right.  So the second you compromise the tube, like I said, terrorists were to break it open.  Right.  Everything just slows down and you stop.  No problem.  Like a ride at Disneyland stopping.  It's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is and it isn't.  You know, it's like a lot of the things that we think are science fiction, the technology  is caught up to.  Just think about this device.  What this device has done in terms of batteries and sensors is now allowing this next generation.  So in the way DARPA and the Internet allowed this whole level of commercialization to occur  with the Internet, the smartphone revolution and the sensors in here are allowing the drone  revolution.  You couldn't have the drone revolution without the batteries in here.  You couldn't have the Tesla revolution with the batteries in here.  So everything builds on itself.

Transcript:  Actually, Father Robert, who's our, we call him the quad father, he's our drone guy, says  it was actually the Segway that the technology for the Segway was what led to the capability  of doing these drones, the self-balancing and all that stuff.  That makes total sense.  So let's talk about another futuristic idea that may not be as good as we thought, the  HoloLens.  Harry, you wrote about this at Fast Company.  So you got the demo at Build?

Start time: 3744.68
End time: 3750.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

End time: 3768.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Paul and Mary Jo got both of those demos and they were both crazy.  They were so excited after the first demo.  You know, the Mars Rover thing, the ability to put augmented reality on top of reality  itself so that you can manipulate.  But they were very disappointed with Build.  Me too.

Start time: 3768.78
End time: 3823.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, it was partially because on the first day of Build, they had the keynote, we're  on stage, they would have somebody walk out wearing HoloLens and then to give us an idea  of what the experience was like on these giant video screens, they would overlay the holograms,  the 3D objects on top of video of the person wearing the headset.  And there'd be giant screens on the wall that were holograms, there'd be a dog down here,  there'd be a spinning globe over here.  It really felt like you'd see the stuff all around you.  The units that we got to try a day later, which I mean, they're much closer in terms  of industrial design to the final product than what we saw back in January.  You don't have a fanny pack, there's no wires.  It's a headset that works well, it worked fine with my glasses.  Windows 10 is built into it.  Windows 10 is built into it.  But there's this small window in the middle of your field of view where you see the hologram.  And at first I thought there was something wrong with it because...

Transcript:  It's effective.  There was these little balls and ramps on a little platform and I couldn't see the whole  thing and I was moving my head back and forth and I realized if I went back a few steps  and bent my knees I could see the whole thing.  And it turned out that that's the way it is.  There's just a little sort of subset of your field of view where there's a hologram.  And I was way more bothered by it because a day before Microsoft had made it look unbelievable.

Start time: 3855.16
End time: 3858.88

Transcript:  Well, we're watching the demo on stage and it looked so much...

Start time: 3858.94
End time: 3889.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And if they had said, well, of course in this first unit you're just going to see it right  in front of you and that's fine.  I talked to somebody from Microsoft who said that after you've used this for a while you  start to forget about it.  Which I can believe because even after an hour it was less bothersome to me.  But I think they are setting expectations way too high by having this truly science  fiction-y on stage demo experience.  And I hope before they actually ship this thing that they push people's expectations  down so low that it becomes mind-blowing again.  Because even with the limitations it's pretty incredible.

On their website for HoloLens it looks even more amazing than it does in that demo.  I mean, does it have something to do with the screen or the processing power or something?

But see that's kind of what I liked about augmented reality like HoloLens versus virtual  reality is that I'm not sealed away inside something else.  I'm actually seeing the world around me.  But I'm getting additional information about it.  It seemed like a great user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I was so excited because I'm waiting for like my Star Trek holodeck.  And so I'm so excited about it.  But I think that they also like the way that they marketed it as like a user interface  inside of your house.  I don't think it's its best application.  I think that using it for research, being able to take a look in three dimensions of  a brain or do surgeries and see actually how everything's interacting with itself would  be better because all I'm thinking about is like Leo, think about being at home and everyone  in the house is wearing their HoloLens.  What's happening to our social dynamic?  Well, we're all looking at our phones and watches anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why the watch is better than the phone is because you're not looking at it most of  the time.  We're not only looking at it, but we've released most of like body languages is dealt with.  How do we talk to each other?  Languages mostly like 80% is looking at facial features.  And so we've lost most of them.  So I worry about using a whole bunch of people in their house with HoloLenses.  I think that it's going to put a little bit of a damage to our social constraints as each  of us are dealing with our virtual world.

I don't need to stand up and Skype somebody.  I got the computer sitting right here.  I got it on my phone.  I got it on my tablet.  And just to FYI, people do stare at their phones for one more thing.  They stare at their watches because ain't nobody scrolling up on Facebook on their watch.  And that's why people don't look at their phones all day.  Instagram and Facebook.  I don't need no holiday.  I don't need no bubbly thing on my eyes.

We remember generally you're telling us we're all going to fly through like Yahoo directory  and click on arts and entertainment and pull out a folder.  And that's going to be faster and better than our normal searches on Google.  It's never happened.  And with Oculus, certainly they're made great advances.

And HoloLens, the most compelling demos they did during the keynote were things like architecture  where you're standing around a table looking at a large model.  Or Minecraft.  And anatomy where you can see these full sized bodies with skeletons.

We're sitting in somebody's living room looking at a little waterly bubble thing with the  weather is stupid to me.  And I don't care.

You take out your iPad and you would say, I want to put shelves over there.  And it would just put how many shelves would fit there.  And you say, well, I want to have deeper shelves or wider shelves.  They go, I love that.  And they could hit buy and it would then ship you all the pieces.  You put it together from IKEA.  It was like, whoa, that's kind of trippy.  That sounds useful.  So I think in architecture, in furniture and like what's going to be in the space and education,  especially the HoloLens stuff is going to work really well.

Transcript:  Georgia, this is going to be good for your practice, right?  Is this, are we going to, do you already see people who are kind of disassociated from the  real world, kids who grow up associating with screens better than humans?  And is this going to increase?

Start time: 4338.92
End time: 4403.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the unfortunate thing is that whatever we do, we end up getting better at,  right?  So whatever you're practicing, you're getting better at.  So people are not really dealing really well with reading each other's social cues.  And so social skills are going down because people are interfacing more with a unreal  world.  And so it unfortunately increases social anxiety and people feeling depressed because they're,  if you can be a god in a video game and you're in school suffering in real life, who's going  to, who would ever choose?  I'd always choose a god.  It's going to win out every time.  Plus the games are marketed to make people, to increase the reaction of dopamine.  So that off on switch of making us feel good.  And it's becoming closer and closer to feeling more and more real.  So I think that it's a huge time sink and unfortunately not great for our brains.  But I think that in the other hand, I think that we can also use virtual reality to get  over different types of fears and to help people that are dealing with the manner in  which they interact with the world as well.  So I think that it's how we use it more than if the technology is good or bad.

Getting out and making a friend could help you do that.  Like, no, I mean, I know people don't, I guess.  I just live in a world where I see kids and people say, oh, kids don't get out and play.  My daughter plays every sports, her friends play stuff.  They come over here.  I've got everything.  She's got her own TV in her room, her playroom, Xbox, Wii, you don't worry about it.  They still go outside and play.  They go outside and play catch.  They go across and play basketball like they have everything and they still go do stuff.  Some people do, some people don't.

And with my kids, I actually don't have them play video games or deal with tech, even though  I have like a full grown arcade cabinet, name and every single video game and technology  piece in my house.  Can I come over?  Hey, sure.  You can bring us to the rose.  We can have fun.  But what in some ways it can be helpful.  So say that you have a really strong phobia of spiders and such a phobia.  We start really, really small.  So we would get a picture of a spider and then a picture of a spider that's moving.  And then you can think how the virtual reality would make it one step closer before I actually  bring in, which I do.  I wrangle real spiders and bring them in therapy.  But it would be great to have a virtual experience where they're interacting with a little tiny  spider on their hand virtually, which would increase their anxiety response.  They could then plateau with it.  And then it would be much easier to take that next step when I bring a live spider into  session.

Well, that's what the public doesn't understand what they're talking about.  Or care.  I thought that was great.  Yeah, it's so accurate and weird when they were nagging and they were getting all the  term sheets coming in higher and higher and then everything went away.  I mean, it reminds you of Secret, which we saw last week imploded where like, they took  too much money.

Transcript:  I have two accounts.  I love it.  What do you have two accounts for?  One for each company.  One at launch, one at inside because we use it.  I do about 10 GoToMeetings a week.

Start time: 4842.96
End time: 4920.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do, I don't do that many, but we do them almost every day because it's a great way.  It's so easy because once you have the GoToMeeting account, you just click a button and the meeting  is set up.  It's so often you just want a conference call, so it sets up an easy conference call.  But then if you need to, you can share your screen.  So if you've got a presentation or images or you just want to show them the picture  of the first Tesla, you can show them that.  And then if you want to turn on your cameras, suddenly like you are meeting in person, you  can see them in high-def video and you can meet on anything, a computer, a tablet, a  smartphone.  You can literally present from an iPad in your backyard.  I've done it.  It's awesome.  So here's the deal.  It's a no-brainer.  In fact, even if you didn't try it today, if on Monday or Tuesday you got a conference  call or meeting with somebody, just try it.  Go to meeting.com.  It won't take you any time to set it up and the nice thing is it won't take your conferree  any time either.  And that's nice because if you're doing a sales presentation, you don't want your client  to have to jump through hoops to hear your pitch.  Make it easy.  Make it fun.  Make it engaging.  And then if you're doing a presentation, you don't want to have to jump through hoops  to hear your pitch.  Make it easy.  Make it fun.  Make it engaging.  Go to meeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button.  30 days free.  You do not need to give them a credit card.  There's no obligation.  No salesman will call.  Go to meeting.com.  Try it free.  What?  are, it just works.  In one click you're in.

But the really killer feature they have now is there's a Chrome extension that I use that  puts it into your Google Calendar.  So when I'm looking at my Google Calendar, I press one button and it's there.  It just sends everybody the meeting stuff.  So literally the friction between putting something in my calendar and then having the  GoToMeeting set up is zero.  I used to have my assistants set that up, send everybody the instructions.  So much easier.  Just, you can Google GoToMeeting Chrome extension and it just works in your calendar.  It's genius.  Genius.

Transcript:  According to Microsoft it's super easy.  Of course it is.  It's not just recompiling it and boom it works, but it's somewhat close to that.  Although of course you wouldn't want to do that.  You'd want to add Windows specific functionality.  And I think when all is said and done you'd want to write Windows apps using the kinds  of tools designed to write good Windows apps.

Transcript:  The applications they use as an example Candy Crush and Cut the Rope 2, there isn't a Windows  API, UI.  There's no menus.  For games it's a little bit easier.  It's swiping.  Of course that works fine, but I'd hate to see somebody...

Start time: 5080.60
End time: 5083.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting because startups are so tied to the LAMP stack and Linux and Open  Source.

Start time: 5084.80
End time: 5158.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it just works with all that stuff.  And they went into Y Combinator and gave everybody a half million dollars worth of free credits  that they could use at any point in time over three years.  Which is like, okay if the startup decides in month 30 they want to be on Azure they  could spend it all from months 30 to 36.  The other thing that's very interesting is the Outlook app on iPad is tremendous.  It's the best email app on iOS.  Because they bought it completely.  And then they also bought Sunrise which was the number one calendar app.  So what you're seeing is, you know, Bomber and Gates were like, hey, not built here,  no good.  Now they're saying, hey, let's buy Calendar, let's buy these other things, let's be competitive,  let's put it on everything.  And I can tell you the real secret that's going to come out in the next year or two  I think is the embracing of the Android fork.  So this company Cyanogen, which a couple of friends of mine have invested in, I'm not  an investor in, they are going to bundle all the Microsoft apps.  Now what I think is going to happen is at some point Microsoft is going to put up the  flag on Windows Mobile and I think what they're going to do is buy Cyanogen or they're going  to say, you know, we'll just incorporate Cyanogen somehow into the Microsoft suite of phones.  And then if they bought it, then Android would work everywhere.

This is the last ditch effort.  We make iOS developers and Android developers comfortable moving.  They are giving away Windows 10 so that they can get a billion people using it.  This is a Hail Mary play to save Windows Phone.

Transcript:  The Surface is an incredible product too.  You think about that.  You know, if Microsoft sticks with it, they get it right in version 3, 4 or 5 typically.  So we all saw this story where WordPerfect was so much better than Microsoft, but Microsoft  Word 4 or 5, you couldn't tell the difference.  Surface 3, great product.  People who have it love it.  They sold a billion of them last quarter or something crazy.  Did they really?  Wow.  Yeah.  If you look at apps, the iOS app now, Outlook is fantastic.  Word, I opened up Word for the first time in five years just because it was available.  And I was like, wow, Word is pretty tight on an iPad.  As much as a very different app on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting you say that.  I think if they gave us some kind of a deal, like in bundling, we would definitely consider  doing it, but not just yet.  And so the desktop is really interesting.  If you can, if you look at Slack and HipChat, they both made desktop clients because it's  a great marketing tool.  You can get all those Windows people and there's not a lot of competition there.  So I think you'll see it on the enterprise stuff first and then consumer second.

Transcript:  I want to step right up and say there will be a Twit app on Windows 10 because the guy  who developed it, who works for Microsoft, works in the tools division, Dimitri Leialin  was here on Friday after building.  He said, I am rewriting the Twit app in XAML.  It's going to be a universal app.  So it'll work on Windows 10, Windows Phone and Xbox.  And he's going to open source it.  So we're thrilled.  I mean, one of the things that we've been doing is we've we're in the midst of a website  redesign.  I've talked about this before where Drupal, which has been running our website, will be  headless.  You won't be interacting with Drupal directly.  It will be an API engine that will offer a fairly rich, much richer than RSS API to our  content.  And we're going to Dimitri and Craig Mullaney, who's in the chat room, wrote the iOS app,  are already going to in the API, looking at our API.  They're going to write these apps to this API.  Even our website will be a consumer of the API.  It's going to be a Node.js, but consuming the API.  And I think that this is what's happening, isn't it?  Yeah.  You're starting to see this move.  So it's really what's great about the cloud is it doesn't care what OS you're using.  No.  It really doesn't matter.

Start time: 5330.08
End time: 5340.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Inside is built on an API as well.  So whenever we fire up a new app, and we're going to make it public to anybody.  Makes it easy, doesn't it?  Yeah.  So anybody will be able to just hit and say, give me the top 10 stories from drones from  the last month, or tell me who the top 10 drone authors are.

Transcript:  Anybody can do it on any platform.  What do you think they're going to do?  Now, they made .NET open source, which was a big awesome move, I think, because there's  so many people who use that in the enterprise.  But is Windows going to ever be open source?  Have they given an insight to that?

Start time: 5357.50
End time: 5364.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you said something about that.  The Azure guy said, it wouldn't be surprised.  I don't think that's ever going to happen.

Start time: 5364.64

Start time: 5367.16
End time: 5392.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't there, there's got to be proprietary pieces in that code that Microsoft can't just  open up that they don't, you know, they license that they're using.  Stuff they license.  Yeah.  I have a feeling that that's just not legally possible.  It's just not doable.  But I do think it's interesting that they're making .NET more widely available.  Do you as an investor, when you go and come along and you look at a startup, if they're  on Azure and .NET, is that a mark against them?  You don't care.

Start time: 5393.32
End time: 5430.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, really, the state of the art in terms of startups is you just pick one platform  and do it perfectly.  So I've seen people start on Android, get it perfect, take a year, piss off all the  iOS people and then go to iOS.  I've seen many more people do iOS only, piss off all the Android people and then they get  it right and then they move over there.  Because what happens is if you try to build an app on three or four platforms at once,  you can't do it.  And because then every mistake you do, you've now magnified four times, you'll run out of  money.  And so where people start is very interesting.  It used to be you have to start on iOS.  Then it became, hey, Android's got more people.  Now it's kind of back to iOS first because those are the best early adopters.

Start time: 5431.66
End time: 5461.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have to say one of Microsoft's challenges is to this day, usually when I meet with somebody  who has a cool new mobile app, if it can be done on iOS, iOS is almost first.  You ask about Android, sometimes Android ships at the same time, but very often Android is  a few months later.  Sometimes even Android is, well, we're intrigued by the Android opportunity, blah, blah, blah.  If it's tough to do Android, which has more users than anybody, it's really tough for  Windows Phone, which is very distant number three.

He's coming down here a lot.  They've had numerous appearances.  And when he comes down.  Who's he talking to?  He's been coming down and doing a lot of meetings with startups.  So he'll come down, he'll meet with 10 startups in a day and go back.  And I think you'll see the center of gravity start to shift a little bit to.  To Seattle?  No, no, I think you're going to see.

Then they're like, oh no, but you know, Android is of course totally open until we get market  share and now we're going to make everything you have to use search.  You have to use Google Maps.  You have to do the stuff.  So Google is completely hypocritical.  And now you have Microsoft who's losing.  Wouldn't it be amazing?  We're the open company.  Exactly.  Well, you know what?

I don't know if people know what stingrays are, but the government's flying little bots  over your house and they're picking up all your cellular data.  They sell your data and now we got something you can detect with.  That's all.

Start time: 5581.96
End time: 5607.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is a good thing because apparently now the source code for creating a stingray is  so widely available that any idiot with a PC can make his own stingray.  So, a stingray poses as a cell tower and grabs your phone briefly just to see where you're  doing, what you're up to.  But the problem is you can't make any phone calls while the stingray's got you.  So then they pass you back to the cell tower.  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.  If only we had Dvorak.

They also added calendars.  So we can do our calendar and we can do our commerce right on the site.  So if you have, you don't have to put Magento or Shopify or any other software in it.  No, what are they using?  They're using something really good.  No, it's built in.  It's their own commerce.  They built their own.  It works.  It's amazing.

You want to be just where you are right now and make the most of those moments that you  have because if you live in the past, you're dealing with regret.  If you're living in the future, you're dealing with anxiety and you're missing all the good  stuff.  Time slows down when you're in the here and now, just doing what you're doing now and  trying to be the best and get the most out of it.

If you dip your feet in the ocean, you actually experience the ocean.  Just like a swimmer might.  Just like a scuba diver might.  So just going up to your knees in the ocean, that's actually experience in the ocean.  So if you do a five minute meditation and there's a woman named Diana Winston from UCLA  who runs the mindfulness and trains the meditators down there and she has these two albums for  free on iTunes and on her website, Diana Winston UCLA, amazing and free.

I got a year's subscription.  The company's worth five times what I invested in that.  And it is taking over because if you think about yoga.  It's so calm.  I feel calm just looking at the website.  Well, if you look at yoga, like yoga was something you had to, it seemed like crazy that everybody  would do yoga.  I would go to any hotel, they have yoga classes every day.

But when you put it in an app and your real situation in a circle of people,  then you start feeling weird about it.  You start feeling a certain way and it's too close to home.  Then you got people trying to think about,  well, who is this person?  I should help this person.  You get so guilt in your heart.

Transcript:  The intent really matters when you build these startups.  And I think their intent was to make a bunch of money and to grow.  In fact, they took a lot of money off the table.  And that was the really weird thing is I remember when this was...  They took six million off the table.  I passed on investing, obviously.  I didn't want to be associated with it.  But some of my friends invested.  These guys took three million each off the table.  And it was, from my understanding, a requirement to invest in it  was for them to be able to take this $3 million each.  This is not unusual.  Founders will sometimes say,

Start time: 6891.18
End time: 6988.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if a founder in year four or five gets an offer for $100 million from Facebook,  the venture capitalists or angels might say,  hey, we'll buy some shares for you so you can buy your house  and you have idiot insurance against it going to zero.  Right.  And so that's reasonable if you've built $100 million of assets  and you've built $100 million of business.  Sure, we'll buy two or three million dollars of shares from you,  and then we get the upside from here.  The problem is these guys did it in their A round.  When the product wasn't proven at all,  as the price of admission, it set off all kinds of red flags.  Yeah, but that's smart, right?  I mean, they got six million bucks.  Well, I mean, there also might be hucksters and fraudsters.  And so it kind of felt like none of the employees got to do it.  Only the two founders got to do it.  In fact, they didn't even tell the employees.  Yeah, the employees read about it.  On secret!  It was really, really done in a...  It set a horrible precedent.  But I'm an investor in a company called Whisper,  which is sort of the good version of this,  which is Whisper didn't take your address book and say,  hey, let's spread rumors amongst your address book.  It just said, tell me something about yourself that you want the world to know  and we'll share it by location if you choose to do that, all opt-in.  So people who maybe were in the closet  or maybe had anxiety about something going on in their lives  could use it as a way to share it.  Then people would write comments of support  and you could start discussions with them, right?  And so Whisper has this much like post-secret,  which I think is a lot of the inspiration for these services.  It was a way for people, I guess, and I'm interested in George's position on this,  but a way to sort of release that energy and share it with people  and maybe be heard just like therapy can in a safe way.  But secret was designed, take your address book,  and we're all going to talk SH about our friends.  And boy, was it nasty.  It was nasty. It was really nasty.

And we have a tradition in the poker game we play and you draw for seats.  And as fate would have it, he drew the seat next to me and we sat there all night and laughed.  Like we had 100, 200 other times we played cards together.  And, you know, it's just like if you made a list of all the guys in the poker game, you know, you get older in your life.  And one of the things for the people who are young in the audience, like you deal with a lot of people in your life maybe you don't want to deal with.  As you get older, you get the choice to pick who you want to hang out with.  And, you know, the good people gravitate towards each other and you hang out.  And amongst that good group of people who play cards every week for the last decade or so, he was like the best guy.  He was the guy who was the best dad, best husband, best leader.  And in fact, he designed Survey Monkey.  I remember talking to him about this.  He said, you know, Jason, I'm designing Survey Monkey as the place you can go and still have a life and have kids.  And that's my pitch to people who come work for me is come here and have a life.  And he would just, you know, he's the kind of guy who would just talk to you for hours about you.  And you'd finally, I have to say, I'm like, what's going on at Survey Monkey and how can I help you?  And, you know, we went on a trip two weeks ago.  A bunch of us went to Monsanto because one of our friends coming up bought by it and we played cards the whole way there.  And we learned about GMO Foods and just the most generous, amazing person.

Transcript:  The best part about hearing you talk about a friend like that is it makes you think about yourself and think, man, should I be doing better?  I could be doing better. I was telling you about how that Elon Musk changed my world earlier this week.  You talking about somebody that you care about makes me think about the things that I do well and the things I should do better.  And I got to go hug my kid this week extra.

Transcript:  I'm like, I can't leave my kid. I want to spend time with my kid. That's what matters to me.  I hope that one day somebody thinks that I did a good job.  The way you talked about him, that's great. It makes somebody who doesn't even know the guy feel for you and feel for that guy and his family.  It's rough.

Transcript:  Life is very perplexing. We got to have the padre on.  It's very perplexing when the best person you know goes first.  That's the thing I've been struggling with over the last 48 hours.  Why?  I was talking to another friend who played cards with, David Sacks.  We were lamenting how if you took this list of the great guys, we'd all put him number one.  I told David, you and I would be number seven, eight, nine on the list.  We should go first. We could just miss less. Why does the guy who's the best go first?  It doesn't make any sense.  You think, gosh, the poor kids are going to have to grow up hearing these stories about how great their dad was.  There's something horrible and tragic, obviously, but it's also something great that his legacy is being captured.  Even the Facebook page was very powerful. I've spent at least an hour a day reading the stuff on the Facebook page.  That's a phenomenal thing that exists.

Transcript:  It's hard to comprehend when you think about the unfairness of death.  This is something that I don't know any of us will ever be able to comprehend.  After 9-11, I had this very existential crisis being a New Yorker and having been there.  Why did these people die? How is it fair that these people die? What does it mean?  You don't ever get over it, but I think you can change the way you live.  You can change the way you treat the people around you.  A lot of you people know me because I'm a public person. I haven't always been the best person.  I haven't always been nice to people in my writing. I've been a little bit of a brawler in my life.  I've been reassessing that over the last couple of years and trying to be a better person and better to other people.  What will be your legacy?

Transcript:  That's the one lesson that you can take from that.  Our time is really precious here and relatively fleeting.  You don't know what cards you're going to be dealt.  You can only say, how am I going to deal with the cards that I get?  It's a really hard thing to deal with.  Our culture does not deal exceptionally well with death.  We don't have really great means of helping people through it.  It's nice Facebook and memorializing and talking about it is really helpful for everyone.

Transcript:  Annie Lamott wrote a book, All New People. She said, 100 years, it's all new people, right?  What that really reminded me is that, of course, some of us go sooner than others.  We're all going sooner than later, really.  What we have that's remarkable is we are all alive together in this space.  This was our cohort of the people we got to share the planet with.  It includes people like him, like Goldie, like Steve Jobs, the people we know around us.  Some of us are going to go sooner than others, but really we're all in this cohort.  This is our group. In 100 years, we're all going to be gone.  We're all going to be gone.  What do you leave on this earth?

Transcript:  It's like the Lord of the Rings where Gannif says, all you have to decide is what to do with the time you're given.  I'm butchering the quote, but it always stuck with me.  We have this time. We have to decide what we do with it.  It's kind of freeing in a way.  You have a limited amount of time.  Choose to do with it what you will.  Just know that it's limited.  I have this really deep conversation with my wife.  All this success and all this, I lucked into so many different things in my life.  What am I going to do with this last 10, 20 years or months or weeks or days?  Holy shit. I'm going to really start to think about this.

Transcript:  The coolest thing that I ever learned was when I did therapy at a very expensive old folks' home.  I was dealing with the movers and shakers of the world, people that were multi-billionaires that ran huge companies.  The one thing I took from it is that they were on the last part of their life and they didn't talk about their companies or how much stuff they had or how successful they were.  All they said is, I wish I could spend it with those that I love for a little longer.

It's a social thing.  I check in with my friends every week and we spend eight, nine hours playing a game and laughing our asses off.  It's great.  It's not about the money, the cards. It's not it at all.

Transcript:  What's up, dad?  Listen, listen, listen.  You know, Uncle Jason is talking about, you know, not being such a great guy and all that kind of stuff sometimes and trying to be better.  You know, I met Jason a long time ago and I met him at a couple of events and never really talked to him just in passing.  Hello, whatever.  You know, I'm down here.  He's up here.  And one day I go and get on a flight and they're like, oh, do you want to upgrade to first class?  It's 25 bucks.  I said, sure.  I sit down.  Jason's down next to me and he's like, oh, doctor.  I'm like, oh, Jason remembers my name.  Hey, what's up?  Talk to him 20 minutes.  He tweets out my website.  He shuts my website down.  He says he says, oh, he's like, I see these interviews with people.  I come by the studio sometime.  And sure enough, he answered my email.  I came by the studio, have my little crappy equipment.  He's like, don't worry about it.  I'll videotape everything.  I format. I'll send it over to you.  I had a nice afternoon with the guy.  Let me get stuck in his Tesla.  And I've seen him once or twice before.  Well, in my mind, I defend Jason all the time because when people say, oh, Jason's this  and that, I'm like, you don't know him.  You see someone on the Internet and you think that you know somebody and maybe had a problem  with this person or this person didn't like him.  You don't know him.  And again, for somebody like me, I'm not important, quote unquote.  I'm not special.  He took the time out to talk to me and I'm a regular dude.  So you don't know somebody until you get to know them.  And just being online and reading a tweet does not make you an aficionado on anybody.  So I've always loved you, Uncle Jason.  I love Leo.  Yes, you're a hard headed person.  Uncle Leo's hard headed.  But I'm just saying when family comes together, we break it down.
