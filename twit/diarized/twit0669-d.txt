Transcript:  It's a road podcaster. Oh see, okay, but it looks like  It looks like it looks nice. Do you do an electric podcast? Yeah, we do every Friday at like 430 5 o'clock  Nice. I have so many questions  About electric vehicles and we actually were talking before the show  But I'm sure there'll be more to talk about as the show progresses also  Where are you located Seth? Are you in the West Coast?

Start time: 227.42
End time: 232.38

Start time: 273.61
End time: 279.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, the road podcaster is one of the very first really good microphones that you could use USB microphones

Start time: 279.42
End time: 300.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could use as a pie. Yeah, I use I use road for everything. I use it for the when I do YouTube  I'm using the road  Video micro Pro which goes on the back and runs off my iPhone and that's how I do all of my YouTube  I used to have this massive, you know camera rig recording in 4k  And I've ended up just plugging my iPhone into a hand rig. That's all I ever use

Start time: 301.14
End time: 314.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love I have a road stereo mic for my my Canon  Yeah, yeah big dead cat on it and I'm not saying that because I don't like cats  Although I don't but so I just use a there it is. That's a big puffy muff

Start time: 315.48
End time: 322.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a glyph and this is my road  Little rowdy video thing and then just click the camera in and plug it in and that's how I do YouTube

Start time: 322.96
End time: 354.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never showed you the microphone that CBS issued me for field work. Oh this I gotta see. Yeah, nothing great  This is from the Tiffany Network this Mike if you look at it really closely probably can't see it says mutual  Mutual like a million years ago. So that like is literally from the 60s it is so I plug this guy into it  It's a little sure it looks like a sure SM 58. Well now it's now it's a USB it right?  So this is the USB the icicle on it  So when this when this mic rolled off the assembly line USB wasn't even a pipe dream

Start time: 355.42
End time: 362.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But should take off the muff because I want to see what the top of it oh gosh  I could tell you what it is from there. Yeah, you probably right. That's an SM 58 sure is no, it's no

Start time: 363.70
End time: 382.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is a the SM 50. This is an electric voice. Oh, it's an EV 35 a yeah  They made one very similar is a big is bigger. Yeah, this is a real this Mike is like the Mike for I think Edward  Armuro used that Mike  Particular Mike he actually could have that would not have been impossible for him to view this

Start time: 383.82
End time: 394.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just in case you ever wanted to know how little voice has changed in 40 years  You've just witnessed it right there the XLR jack. Yeah, there's nothing you invoice technology. Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed

Start time: 395.22
End time: 472.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so dub dub DC is tomorrow the worldwide developers conference and  I hope you don't mind Seth if I invoke mark German  No, no, we're still good friends great guy. Of course cut his teeth. He was like 15 when you hired him at nine to five Mac  I think so maybe even younger. He was a kid and  He was 22 two years ago when Bloomberg stole him away from you and he's done a good job over there  He's kept all of his contacts and he said something quite surprising on Friday  I would I can't tell you because I don't pay for Bloomberg. They've put themselves behind a ridiculous $35 month paywall  Oh my god  But he says his sources tell him Apple will not unveil any new hardware tomorrow and  I have to give first of all, it's German  So it's you know, his sources are impeccable and he's rarely wrong, but also this close to the event  I have to think this is a leak from Apple  Trying to dampen expectations because if people didn't know that the expectations been high though  At least be new MacBooks possibly new iPads  Maybe even a new iPhone SE and if they hadn't told people that ahead of time there'd be a lot of disappointment tomorrow

Start time: 472.87
End time: 474.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that Robert Mueller leaked it actually

Start time: 477.44
End time: 483.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing comes out of Robert Mueller's office this we know  So do you think that's credible?

Start time: 484.37
End time: 518.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so  Well, I don't think Apple leaked it. Um, right not to German if Apple leaked it be the Wall Street Journal  Yeah, you know how it works, yeah, so clearly  You know, there's probably there might be you know, they could announce something's coming way down the road or something  But there's not gonna be any it doesn't sound like there's gonna be a new hardware at WWDC  You know, there's a lot of stuff that's in the pipe like like there has to be some new Macs coming soon  Everything's kind of long in the tooth there  You know, we know about

Start time: 519.74
End time: 528.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you really think that there's actually going to be some new Macs like Intel hasn't got any new CPUs  There'll be no wait a minute. No, wait a minute. This was the exciting. This was the thing

Start time: 528.68
End time: 540.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was waiting for I was waiting for a MacBook Pro with one of these new six core Intel processors an i9 and  Optane I think that that actually is some pretty compelling hardware which just came out

Start time: 541.90
End time: 578.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Intel announced it and then said it but it won't be shipping until mid 2019 this week what the i9 won't come out  No, octane what no what no octane and no no cannon legs  Nothing will ship till mid 2000 like they'll release sampling quantities  I was reading an article about they're releasing like a hundred thousand or something and then all the makers will share a small number  So there'll be something that ships and Intel will meet the promise that something will ship in 2018  But there'll be no volume CPU so there's a fair chance that Apple won't commit to a small production  No, in my opinion. Yeah, what do you think Seth? You're the expert in this field?

Start time: 579.42
End time: 586.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple hasn't been very aggressive in their ever Mac world anything lately. I mean I feel like ever

Start time: 586.82
End time: 596.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it was always the case that  Actually, no, maybe there was a there was a time when Intel would have a new processor then shortly after that Apple would have  Numatics, but that has not been the case for some

Start time: 599.12
End time: 611.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microphone that I showed you I mean it's getting it's getting crazy. I could be you here. My Mac Pro is from 2013  But but the Mac that I have doesn't look any different than the one that came out what 2010

Start time: 612.64
End time: 647.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did they first ship that the truth is because I hate these new Mac keyboards so much this butterfly key is off  Yeah, I bought when the 2016  New MacBook Pros with the touch bar and the butterfly key came out. I bought one  Immediately I hated the touch bar so much it would I would hit the Siri would start up randomly  So because I would because I would hit it and I didn't and I thought well if I've got a touch bar  I can't disable it. So I just said okay  I'm gonna trade this in for the one without the touch bar, but the keyboard was still bad  So I went back to the 2015 MacBook Pro, which is frankly the last decent MacBook

Start time: 649.67
End time: 658.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to do so you agree with that  There's a lot of people who don't like the keyboard and a lot more people who don't like the touch bar  Yeah, so yeah. Yeah Apple still sells

Start time: 659.66
End time: 674.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still sell this 2015  15 inch MacBook Pro that tells me  There's a reason that tells me. Yeah, well that there's a market fine  Yeah, well the I imagine those people too. I bet they must or why would Apple keep them in the

Start time: 675.26
End time: 738.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fold there's it's still a Haswell processor. Well, I think there's a couple of things here one is  Sky Lake was the  2015 CPU and that was the last MacBook that Apple released that had that and that was the major  CPU release since then in 2016 we've had the Intel server CPUs  So we've had Kaby Lake was the successor to Sky Lake, which was really the talk not the tick  It's not in 2000 talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk  Then you had Canon Lake in 2017 and coffee lake which was meant to but they sort of hadn't shipped in volume  So their die shrinks so so Sky Lake was a 14 nanometer  Canon Lake is a shrink of Sky Lake to 10 nanometers or less power more on the die  It gets a little bit faster. Then there's coffee lake, which was meant to be a 14 nanometer price  I'm reading from Wikipedia here and I'm because I can't memorize all this just in case you think I'm looking smart  And then there's supposed to be a thing coming which is called ice lake, which is the successor to Canon Lake  Yes, and it was supposed to come out at the end of 2017 then they said 2018 and now it's  2019 somebody

Start time: 739.24
End time: 742.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's what you're saying is there's no reason for Apple to upgrade

Start time: 743.04
End time: 750.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's no CPU  Updates I think you know how we keep hearing all about this arm CPU thing that keep people keep going on that Apple is gonna be

Start time: 751.24
End time: 756.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Switching away from Intel and switch to arm for all of its stuff. I imagine that you know, if Intel keeps

Start time: 757.58
End time: 797.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Upsetting the supply chain here, which is exactly what they're doing  I imagine if I was Apple I'd be sitting there saying to myself if Intel can't ship these desktop CPUs  Whatever the reason might be whether it's difficult to shrink the dial where they can't get the production runs or nobody's buying  desktops or you know  Whatever the mechanics are Apple might actually start looking at the the PA semi team and saying, you know  Can we boost this arm CPU and turn so they can turn away from?  Intel as a supplier because every time they go public with the Intel CPU  You know saying we've got MacBooks in the pipe or they start to sort of feel people out to see if there's any interest for  A new frame Intel fails to ship  Now I agree with you I'm shocked I was I

Start time: 799.36
End time: 829.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You this is bad news. I I thought the i9 was imminent  No, it's open and I was gonna I was I was I was what I was hoping was that tomorrow  We'd see new MacBooks with new Intel processors and perhaps in a concession to the class action lawsuits a somewhat improved keyboard  That and then when I when Mark said well, no, there's not gonna be a new hardware. I credited him  I thought well, it's Mark German. It must be true. So I started looking at Lenovo, but they don't have the i9s  And they won't I guess until next year

Start time: 830.90
End time: 846.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean they talked about the isolate chips in August then they announced them then remember of course they talked about Optane  We were talking about Optane 18 months in 2016. I came in  I was on the show with you. That was the crosspoint. That was the new crosspoint memory technology

Start time: 846.58
End time: 855.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they became up to HP and just shipped a new laptop and I actually have it  But I don't know what processor it has I haven't cranked it open. You know, be KB Lake or coffee lake, right?

Start time: 856.04
End time: 900.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean they're good. They've got some beautiful laptops. I think yeah, I mean, I mean also let's not forget  Spectre and meltdown and and even the you know, the chips that you're getting from Intel today  Are vulnerable to these you know?  issues and there's  To my knowledge still three specter flaws that have not yet been disclosed  The the newest one was disclosed and presumably patched but there's three more we don't know about I mean, this is just bad news  So did you see why Apple might I do credit you Greg with one thing?  You could see why Apple might say screw it  We you know, and by the way, these aren't even really arm chips  These are Apple a chips that that are licensed arm architecture, but they do a lot of customers

Start time: 900.92
End time: 1000.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've done a lot of stuff. Mostly what they've done is refocus the die. So a lot of the arm cores are the same  And they do a lot of optimization so especially around the memory buses if I remember rightly and  Also to get a more of them on the die  Anyway, lots of tricks and things that you can do but fundamentally it's a base arm architecture  At the best they can tweak it at the edges and integrate the bus the fastest bus architectures to the GPUs that they put in  Them and all that sort of stuff. So that's fine  But I keep in mind that Apple only wants to make one notebook  Unlike HPE and Dell who will happily make ten thousand of one notebook or twenty thousand of one notebook and then ship it with a custom  Scoot just so that Best Buy has a unique one  You know that fiddle that like when you go to the shop to buy fridges and they say I will have the cheapest price on  This fridge anywhere and that's because they're the only one with that model number because it's a unique model number to them  That's why you can't shop them, right?  And so this is what HPE and Dell do in the retail channels and they do with enterprise as well  They'll produce ten thousand of this and twenty thousand of that and fifty thousand of this Apple won't do that Apple wants to do one run  It wants to do, you know a million units or two million units over a life cycle  they'll take one chip like they've done with the the sky like from  2015 or the KB Lake and just keep running it out the door and every now then you get a bump but they don't  Futs around with you know breaking up their production schedules to be able to accommodate a new chip and a new controller and a  New memory and I suspect my sense of this and this is just me  My gut feel I'm not on the inside to like Seth is is that Apple's come up with several designs based on Intel's commitments  To them about the production Intel hasn't been able to deliver and so they've just pulled out  But because Apple doesn't communicate with its audience, it doesn't share what it's doing. It doesn't

Start time: 1004.80
End time: 1022.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who really care aside from you know, the the people who are designing rocket ships and you know  Does the average person really need or care whether they have a  2013 or 2016 processor in their laptop  I mean how many people really complain that their processor is too slow on their on their PC?

Start time: 1023.00
End time: 1026.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't hear that a lot of video professionals kind of

Start time: 1029.04
End time: 1081.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Photographers videographers, yeah rocket ship designers  But but that's who buys but I hate to say but that's who buys max coder  I have to say coders to coders are very sensitive to compile times  If you had a six core processor and you had a threaded compiler that makes a huge difference  And so that that cycle that you know, right compile build run  Cycle the faster that goes the better they are  So there are what it is is it's the people Apple should be and has traditionally cultivated which is the professional market  It doesn't seem like they're doing much for the professional market  I have that iMac Pro and to your point exactly Larry for 90% of what I do  It's no faster than my not 2015  MacBook Pro because you have to have software that's tuned to use I have 10 cores  Nine of which do nothing

Start time: 1084.40
End time: 1097.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I turned by my one-minute podcast every day into a video and I don't even remember I've got a  I5 processor on this  Short videos right there sure it takes seconds to render. I suppose that they were long videos

Start time: 1097.68
End time: 1114.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was trust me if you're doing, you know, I got the gopro fusion 360 camera  Takes eight hours to to render that video on an attend core iMac Pro  Yes, there are things you do and people do a lot of people do pros do that do need that power

Start time: 1114.60
End time: 1142.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's more than just the CPU though  It's not stop focusing on the engine and start thinking about the gearbox and the suspension  The new generation of Intel's will support  Faster SSD buses. Hopefully we'll see some NVMe. Maybe does obtain make a difference  Obtain I think what is a big difference and I think from Apple if you think about  This idea of 3d NAND replacing memory and SSDs or acting as a cache in the architecture should drive power consumption  Way down in my opinion

Start time: 1143.90
End time: 1147.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so that's another that's another spec. That's very important power

Start time: 1149.35
End time: 1186.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the CPUs although the extra performance would be good  There's also a whole bunch of modernization around how the CPU interfaces to the rest of the equipment  So SSDs obtain memory new dims new dim architectures that are more power efficient using  Smaller processes so they consume us power  And it's all of that stuff, which is actually what we don't we don't need the CPU  But if you can get data in and out of the CPU faster or get deeper l3 buffers or whatever the current generation of  Features are in in ice lake then that's actually going to drive your experience  Everything feels snappier even though you're still running at the same clock speed and that's what we want. I can't better

Start time: 1187.38
End time: 1207.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've given me some hope because I really felt like Apple is  Abandoned the pro market, but what may well be the fact is Apple knows that well when we can get an obtained system  And when we can get maybe a you know a six core processor, this will be a pro system worthy of calling a Mac Pro  That's why that's not going to be available till next year

Start time: 1208.34
End time: 1253.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we look at how popular external GPUs are with the enthusiast market  Everybody's getting a Mac iMac and they're hanging off and there's any number of YouTube articles of people hanging these external  Just used to get the features that they want such anemic GPUs in the current crop  And then what's in the processor the GPU is built onto the CPU die  Right, or they're using a generation of GPU from five years ago  Then the bus speed between the CPU and the GPU is too slow  That's why we want the new generation of CPUs that Intel hasn't delivered and isn't going to so that's why I don't think we'll see  Hardware if Apple and I think it's too early for Apple to do arms  But I'm perfectly confident that Apple sitting there in front of Intel saying  Getting six months closer to an arm CPU better get your finger out. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 1253.84
End time: 1262.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zack there's other things that they could update as well  Like, you know, we saw recently a new Huawei laptop with a kind of edge-to-edge screen

Start time: 1262.02
End time: 1264.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that a gorgeous laptop that that what is it the honor it is?

Start time: 1264.84
End time: 1297.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sold on the camera coming out of a keyboard thing, but  Everything else looked pretty good. And then you know as you said, oh, yeah the mate. Yeah, and then the  Yeah, so they the the ports on it on MacBook they could add  You know like micro SD slot or you know, god forbid a USB a port or you know  There's a lot of things they can do. I'm you know, I don't think that's gonna happen  But I feel like there's a lot of things they can do  To get a new laptop out before

Start time: 1298.18
End time: 1333.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before they do is fun with the keyboard and a few slots and edge-to-edge screen people are gonna how  Yep, people are just gonna whine and say why is this not fun?  The the the the chief nerds, you know the loudmouths the people like us who you know think we're just gonna say  Why did they even bother so they're screwed either way they go because they're not willing to be open and say this is what we're doing  This is where we're heading when we know if they could just stand up and say this is the problem with bringing out a new  Laptop and be honest about it  Instead of trying to come out with the the trash can, you know Mac Pro type mistakes that they've made

Start time: 1334.06
End time: 1336.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I wonder if they'll ever come out with a touchscreen Mac

Start time: 1336.36
End time: 1340.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's something that I think they've been very unequivocal in saying no, do you agree Seth?

Start time: 1341.74
End time: 1351.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the touchscreen Mac will be a iOS device that has a keyboard  Yeah, right. I don't think the Mac line will ever go there. Yeah

Start time: 1352.88

Start time: 1358.96
End time: 1363.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it looks exactly like a MacBook. So right why why can't Apple make that screen?

Start time: 1364.60
End time: 1370.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great question Wow, yeah, what's the power? What is the battery life on that guy? You don't ask questions like that

And there wasn't anybody with machines that let you mill  Aluminium it was much cheaper  in fact  You could only extrude al you a plastic to make this case that you want and so Apple gets out there  Starts buying up these aluminium milling machines and lo and behold aluminium cases become standard

Start time: 1795.42
End time: 1828.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Normal people is the point. Yeah, what could they announce in hardware that would actually move the needle?  Like the difference between the iPhone this year to last year is about five percent better  You know arguably the performance is a bit better, but I don't think people notice the effect of face recognition is  You know and the camera, you know the multiple cameras. Everybody's got that now  You know if they come out with the there's an article here for Mac room is talking about triple lens cameras  You know like again good to have nice to have I will say I'm not gonna get one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're saying that if I do smart like the portrait mode in the iPhone 8 that I have is just extraordinary  But that's not a lens. That's not me changing the lens. I think that's a little bit of a difference  Changing from a you know 50 mil nifty 50 to a to a 24 millimeter lens or something like that  That's just put the phone up and the software does some processing and boom. I've got a portrait mode  I think we're gonna see much more in the software much less improvement on the hardware. Where do they go?  What do they do put a bigger power bigger faster CPU in with a better GPU and more memory? I mean

End time: 1997.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Personally augmented reality to me is a bit of a yawn. It's gonna be like 3d TVs  I think it's gonna be like a decade before that comes anywhere  But do you think Apple's gonna try and do a song and dance around AR and then pretend that it actually matters?

Start time: 1999.52
End time: 2053.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  Think they will try to do a song and dance around they are I think that's kind of their what's they're focusing on right now  You know, we've seen like, you know where you point your camera around even at Google I oh last month  Google  Demonstrated a bunch of cool stuff. They added a way which is actually a useful feature  Very useful. Yeah, so I think Apple's not gonna see the lead in AR and there was that Reuters report about  You know and and AR stuff where you you're sharing an AR screen with somebody else and it's not bouncing off any servers  So, I mean, I think there's some room to improve there. There's some room to be creative and show some really cool stuff  I don't think  You know, I don't think Apple's gonna see that AR lead they have to Google anytime soon  and and and that may even affect their hardware and the the short term with the but to me the

Start time: 2079.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a way, that's really what Apple did a year ago at WWDC  they announced a our kit and they showed a lot of apps with it and  Ironically didn't use the fancy array facing you that would have made a much better AR  Toolset they use just a regular camera on the back  Google which had a very fancy elaborate hardware based AR platform called tango  Took one look at the success Apple had with this kind of bogus  AR kit because it you know stuff doesn't quite sit on the surface. It's it's it's okay. It's adequate and they said oh crap tango was  We wasted all that time. So they made AR core  Which is basically an Android version of AR kit and and I agree with you Greg. I thought I think what we're seeing  the AR we're seeing  today is  to  headset based real AR HoloLens like real AR as  Today's artificial intelligence is to hell 9000. I mean  It is a long I think I think real AR is a long way off and that's acknowledgement from the companies Apple and Google chiefly  They got nothing. So they're gonna do this

Start time: 2150.58
End time: 2197.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of the times these Silicon Valley companies like to tie their shoelaces and then trip over themselves  Yeah, you know their idea of being useful is to do something and then pretend it's awesome  And then everybody ignores them they go  And have a good cry like Facebook does every other week I  Just feel like AR is is something that's it's gonna be useful, but nobody actually knows what it's useful for  You know, let's look at Google Glass, right? Google Glass is actually now continues on  It's what it is a joke for any normal use case  But there are several industries that use Google Glass for mammoth task medical in particular  Where there's massive stuff actually happening and in 10 or 20 years  Maybe the Google Glass thing will turn around and come back into the consumer market

I don't still don't get it  They're gonna let they're gonna have tools that let two iPhones share augmented reality without storing it in the cloud.

So if you had your smartphone and  You know you're looking through here, you know and and looking at a game on a desktop and you're playing it by yourself  That's kind of not very interesting. Why not just play a game on a screen?  Why would you map out an AR and watch the or go in and stamp the guy with a wand or whatever it is?  But if you can get three or four people standing around a table holding it  But again, you know when you think about if you're holding your phone like this while you're doing a game your arms get tired  That's why we have computers. So you sit down at a desk and play a game for hours

It's iCloud to some degree. They never break it down  So we don't know how much but it was almost 10 billion dollars last quarter. It's uh, it  I'll give you an idea the apple services revenue was more than mac and ipad combined  It's their number two revenue generator

Start time: 2803.56
End time: 2870.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the number two revenue generator the thing that strikes me about the app store generally  Um is a how much money the games make there were some numbers around games. It's just astonishing  Amazing how much money they're making out of those games, but also the fact that the ecosystem of the developers is collapsing  So the developers are saying we can't survive as is it originally came out as like this great big independent  You know indie developers, but apple's got this platform squeezed so tight  That if you're trying to build a business on top of it  You're never going to win because apple's got this  Paranoia that if anybody can make more money out of the platform than they can then they lose control like  You remember so microsoft office and windows the idea behind windows was that we enable other people to make more money than we do  So the more people using windows the more money other people make and we get dragged along behind them  So our platform follows those people in apple's case. They say this is our platform. We own it. You can't have it  right, and you have to live with the the consequences of what you get and  It's up to you to decide  You know whether you want to be on it, but we don't actually let you survive

I think we have like 300 000 people  On nine to five mac and and you know a few less on the other sites  so  We're you know, we use facebook like everybody else, but we don't really  Promote it.

Transcript:  Yeah, why why I think a lot of them got onto facebook because they got analytics that worked  And it was all because you know a bunch of smart developers at facebook put some analytics  So when people went to the page you could see people coming from the page and then come into your website  And that made you feel like you're in control  it was a false dawn of course because  Nowadays these these publishers are realizing they have to build their own technology and they're hiring the same developers  They're building their own code. They're building out their ditching their old  40 year old content management systems and growing up and getting something a bit modern  And now the analytics engines that they have are of a quality that they should have had 10 years ago  They have to be technology companies and they've kind of been through this, you know  Oh, we'll get facebook to do it for us. We'll get facebook to do our ads  We'll get google to do our ads and then realizing that was the dumbest thing we ever did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They sold the vision of I can track every click  I can contract every impression and that's going to be better than what you're doing now  And of course what we're seeing of course is big consumer brands pull out and go back to television and radio  They're pulling out of youtube isn't that interesting? Yeah  Because they're not getting the traction that they want. Yes, they can the only time that  Targeted advertising works is when you're really trying to reach a really specific audience like the poll like the political one  so if you're trying to get somebody who lives in a suburb of you know, like if you're trying to target people who live in  Cheltenham in the uk where I live and you just want people who are in the upper echelon and you want to target them with your  High-end clothing brand or you know, these types of analytics driven systems are perfect  But if you're proctor and gamble and you're trying to promote, you know washing liquid or something like that  Why why are you on facebook? I I don't think that's actually useful overall. I think that's example of the analytics

Start time: 3585.94
End time: 3600.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Persuaded them, but I think the analytics is a chivalrous people are people treat it as if it's you know  The holy grail for advertising is turning out not to be I don't think all that useful  I guess if you're a really interesting the big I had not heard this big brands are turning are going back to

Transcript:  A scam in history. I mean watch another wix ad. I swear i'm gonna put something through my screen  I mean  But the the the challenge I think with the is the illusion of control and remember a lot of the times that you they put  These ads on these platforms and there's some salary slave there with a high school education  Who's looking at an analytics platform trying to justify their reason for earning minimum wage in an office job?  That's pretty cool. You know, it's a good job. They don't have to do a whole lot of work  They just have to put some hands on a platform and pretend and if you can click a button and show that you did 10  Percent better than you did last month. Well, hello, you know job done. I i'm a legend. Give me a pay rise

Start time: 3649.66
End time: 3686.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's interesting because I mean in a way the reason we have gdpr  Is because of you know, the the european privacy regulations is because of ad tech and the and the concern of consumers that they're being  Tracked and surveilled by companies and really the reason companies track and surveil them is for targeted advertising  And would it be ironic if advertising targeting didn't work?  And so the whole thing brought the house down  For no good reason that you know  I don't know. Seth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I I think there is some value to targeted advertising  specifically as you you know kind of pare down you're right the procter and gamble stuff that everybody needs maybe doesn't make sense for but  For instance iphone cases like what's a good place to advertise iphone cases probably nine to five mac, you know or or you know apple sites

Start time: 3708.50
End time: 3717.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3731.28
End time: 3763.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean  That that it's it's crazy because they have these our roi budgets that they can't like escape out of their brands  Right, so they come in and they say well, you know  I don't we need to make you know, and they track the people from like  Our site to their site to the cash register and do they make a purchase right and then they come back and they're like  Well, we didn't really make  you know exactly what we paid you or we you know, whatever and  I'm just kind of like well, you know, like oh you got a lot of eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you sell some cases? Just tell me it just sells, you know, we all of our ads are direct response ads  Which is why you hear in an ad you'll have a custom url or a promo code and all of that and and  I shouldn't say this out loud, but so  Advertisers sometimes we'll get advertisers say well this show doesn't work  And we say well, what do you all the promo codes i'm getting are twit?  Yeah, but you didn't even buy ads on twit  You bought ads on that other show. So honestly if you're getting ads promo codes from twit, that's us. That's that show  And they and they don't know but it doesn't match. It's uh, and yeah, there's a lot of that  There's way way more than i'd like to  acknowledge or admit  Uh, ultimately for an advertiser, it's of course and i'm looking i'm a business person  You're going to spend money on advertising you have to do that. You hope that that will make you more money than you spent  That's the real roi  And if if you sold more iphone cases  That it cost you to buy the ads on nine to five mac, I think that's a success regardless of what the analytics tell you  But they want more absolutely, I guess right

Transcript:  The problem is when you rent a bike, it's hard to have they don't rent they don't include helmets with the bike  So that's a that's a tough one  In fact, new york city had a law that you had to rent a helmet  But the new york was actually sanctioning bikes  They they know one of these bike things in new york where you can't get a helmet so they had to modify the law as I understand it  So people who rented the bikes could legally ride them without helmets, that's that's one way to solve it.

Transcript:  Now i'm trying to think of uh, there's an email that I get every week  As a french analyst and he's predicting that this idea of micro mobility is going to be the next biggest wave  And what he's trying to point out is that  You know 80 of all journeys are like one to five kilometers long, right? So why are you owning a car?  You don't really want a self-driving car. You just want something that's better than walking or whatever. So  This idea of hiring a scooter or a bicycle does matter especially in europe where a lot of the streets are  You know driving a car is pointless most of the time like london  For example, you spend more time getting down to the tube than you spend on the tube  You know be a lot easier on a good day to just ride an electric scooter from point to point

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, because it worked that way  Well because microsoft's azure business is going to be worth a lot more money  So google's working in the consumer market putting ads in front of eyeballs, right? But then market has reached its maximum size  There's not more eyeballs to reach whereas  Microsoft through azure and like have as we've seen with amazon's aws  They're just starting to get open up the market in cloud computing. So the potential for future revenue growth  Um and the ability of and microsoft's demonstrating the ability to transition people  Away from their legacy infrastructure and suck them into the azure and trap them in the cloud so that all the future revenues get  fairly firmly  forwarded to microsoft shareholders  Um, and what we're seeing is that microsoft's investments so microsoft's now outspending google on rnd and capex  In terms of building out its cloud because it's already got the revenue on the board you can you know

Transcript:  They're spending heavily so, you know, I don't want to under rest over understate what they're doing  but microsoft has very strong business in asia  And africa and europe they have more data centers are up and running now  They're not as big as aws aws has tended to build  Uh less numbers of data centers, but make them phenomenally larger  And of course they're running into power problems. So they're not able to get enough power to keep that model going  So microsoft's decision to have smaller and more data centers is generally worked out interesting  Better. Yeah, that's a good they have so everybody's struggling to get power because when you want to get like, you know  10 megawatts 50 megawatts 100 megawatts  And you want to put like 250 000 computers in four data halls  You know, you trying to sign a 20-year agreement to get power. That's the whole output of a power station  And or a bitcoin miner  Yeah, that's right. Wow  I think the bitcoin mining thing is just one of those industries. It's a flash in the pan until  Uh, we see the next generation of assets. There'll be some re-spins  We'll see an fpga or an assic or dedicated today. We're using general purpose gpus to do  Cryptomining it would make more sense to have custom assets for those and it'll be a few more years before they come around  And then we'll see the power curve drop right off

Transcript:  Yeah, it's all crypto. So there's plenty of crypto chips out there  but i'm not a i'm not a blockchain expert, but it does make sense that when there's a market big enough and  When it becomes when it becomes static like at the moment there's too much iteration around the crypto algorithms and the  the software but at some point that that market will reach a  You know a plateau and that'll be the point when we see custom asics  Just for bitcoin mining come out. I would imagine that that there are companies out there designing them, you know  Caviam broadcom the usual criminals

Transcript:  Well, the gpu does the functionality quite well, but you know cavium for example has been producing a crypto chip  That we've been using in network appliances for the last 15 years  And that has just been used for the tls and the htps and the ipsic  And that chip has been widely used that must not be easily adapted for use in these or maybe it's not fast enough or  But they've been using gpus now gpu is a general purpose graphics processor. It's like what intel is on the x86  It's a general purpose  piece of silicon  But at some point when the market gets big enough, it makes sense to make a custom asic that does just the things that you need  That's actually though not necessarily that may be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a benign influence on the problem of bitcoin mining because it just continues to concentrate  The mining into a small group of people right because these are very expensive presumably going to be very expensive chips  Well, you know, this is what I mean the the there has to be a plateau there has to be enough demand

Start time: 6718.10
End time: 6733.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There has to be enough people who want them, you know that sort of stuff and then that plateau hasn't been reached and it's not actually yet  Actually guaranteed that crypto currencies or crypto, you know, the blockchain is actually going to be a thing what right?  Like it's not a thing. I thought it was a thing not a thing for me

Transcript:  Yeah, and it's no question that bitcoin, you know is right on the edge of the chasm, you know crossing the chasm sort of a thing  But until the government's  Come around and start to say these are currencies and they have to be regulated and that's a that's the next step  and until we see that sort of acceptance by  You know the incumbent financial institutions that this is a viable form of value exchange  We're not going I don't see how these crypto currencies will survive. Certainly. There'll be a massive shakeout  Only a few of these crypto coins if they become legitimate. What's the point?  Well, that's the question like ultimately even the bitcoin network today runs so slow and is so expensive that it's not a threat to visa  Visa can process a transaction for three cents per transaction and charges that basically I think it's like 15 cents  And so it actually makes out pretty well, but a bitcoin transaction costs about 15 in electricity to run through  And so it's a very good way to do that. So it's a very good way to do that  And so it actually makes out pretty well  But a bitcoin transaction costs about 15 in electricity to run through and takes roughly four days three days  I think last time I checked i've stopped bothering because i'm just tired of getting blockchain pitches  But and so the problem with the blockchain is if you have a transaction today and you exchange coins  You need to wait three days before the the network's complete before the transaction completes and it's so volatile. You don't know what you paid

We're gonna take a little break  Get to the last the bottom of the at the end of the show all the all the good stuff sinks to the bottom  Or maybe it's just the seeds and the stems we're going to get to that in just a second  But first a word from moogsoft. You probably know about moogsoft greg farrow. It is a little bit about them. Yes, indeed  algorithmic itops  That's the ai in moogsoft ai it is a brilliant solution for people who are  On pager duty, you know that you're you're the one who gets the incident reports  You're the one who gets all the notifications and it's kind of like a pachinko machine in your head  It's just bing bing bing bing bing and at some point when all those alerts and tickets are lighting up your monitor like a christmas tree  You're just not you're so stressed out. You're not being productive. You nobody can analyze those alerts and respond intelligently  To all those tickets, but that's where moogsoft aiops comes in  It reduces the it alerts and tickets by up to 99 percent not by turning them off but by consolidating them  Correlating events into actual work items. They call them situations  So you can say I need to handle this you handle the stuff that matters. It's brilliant  It works with all your it tools. So all of those all those pingers can all be at work  But moogsoft's aiops platform correlates them and makes it easy for you to respond to here's a customer testimonial actually from  A company called hcl technologies. They are a global it managed service provider. That means  They live in the pachinko parlor. They they got multiple they got multiple clients multiple alerts coming from every possible  Bit of telemetry  They actually created something called the dry ice platform and they use moogsoft aiops as their event management layer  People love dry ice. It's award-winning and it's helped their clients streamline operational workflows reduce time in the detect  to correct life cycle of incident tickets  Actually by a lot 33 reduction in the mean time to restore just because of that  Means they can support more customers with service quality keeping operational costs low efficiency high. It's been really great for hcl technologies  It could be great for you, too  With moogsoft aiops you can reduce your it alerts and tickets by up to 99 right now. Wouldn't that be nice?  Visit moogsoft.com to get a demo moogsoft. You see the logo. It's got a cow  That's the moo. I don't know what the g is and then they're soft  Actually, I got the story from the founder he's big cow fan he wanted to call it moosoft  He couldn't get the domain. He's also a fan of the moog synthesizer  So he said oh, we'll just add a g. We'll call it moogsoft. Oh, that's moogsoft.com moogsoft.com  And get a demo we thank moogsoft so much for their support of this week in tech  What actually i've been meaning to ask you since we've got you got you on seth  Um, there have been just  I have to say there have been in the time since the last tesla accident there have been probably 30 000 accidents  with thousands of deaths  With gas normal gas vehicles, but because these are self-driving cars or autopilot or whatever you get a lot of attention  Seems like there's been a lot of accidents  lately  Um uber decided to stop working on this self-driving technology entirely. I think  Is that right?  Um, what's this? What's going on?

Start time: 7046.88
End time: 7142.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I think you're just gonna like with any new technology you're gonna see a lot of fits and starts stops and starts. Um  You know like we get so, uh, I think we're one of the bigger, uh ev sites and autonomous sites so we get  Probably one or two tips a day from some, you know small local  Paper that a tesla was in an accident, right? And there's really no  Yeah, there's no news there. Yeah  Right. So, you know when it's  Driving autonomously and a lot of people say they're driving an autopilot and aren't so sometimes you have to wait for tesla to verify  Then it becomes kind of news if if you know, somebody's been driving an autopilot and they hit that um,  You know that center divider thing and and dies with sadly  um  That becomes you know  a story, I guess um, but  I kind of feel like this is how it's going to happen like  Like these things aren't just going to automatically one day be perfect  um, and I think that's kind of the narrative that's happening in the media right now, it's like  A few people are saying that  You know people are going to die sat, you know, this is not happy but people are going to die as this technology matures  but I think this  the long term  uh  You know end result is going to be that more people will live  because a lot of these accidents will be avoided and but I think the takeaway right now is that  Don't take your eyes off the road like in any car. Yes, you mentioned the cadillac

Start time: 7143.80
End time: 7180.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ct  Six I drove that I drove that also  That's actually a really smart much smarter. I think than tesla's it has a camera that's looking at your eyes  And if you look away it says wait a minute, you know for five seconds it vibrates the seat  Vigorously, it's violent  I don't I don't know if you tried it because it was very hard for me to look away for the road for any like  The time I finally put my hands over my eyes and peeked and it thought I wasn't looking because I couldn't I want  We're driving at highway speeds. I can't and I don't trust these things, but I think I think gm actually has done it pretty well  I think that cadillac system is good

Transcript:  They had a toyota research spoke at ces and a couple other places and he talks about a couple things one is this  Lulling, you know, you get this sense of false confidence  But he also talked about how we have a much higher expectation of autonomous vehicles that we do for human driven vehicles  So we we have learned to tolerate  Thousands of deaths per year or maybe millions

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right a million and now that's unacceptable. I'm sorry by any standards. That's unacceptable  But we have two or three horrible situations with tesla and suddenly that becomes a major crisis  So I agree with with the cesset that at the end of the day  I think these cars are going to save a lot more lives  Even though there's going to be some tragic situations, but I think they're going to be relatively few. Yeah

Start time: 7236.78
End time: 7254.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the interesting thing about this is how few deaths there have been to this point  And the and that all of a sudden when you start to have them that is actually a surprise and is becomes news  They've actually almost done too good a job  We sort of expected there to be problems when there wasn't in the early days

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can you can confirm this but my experience has been it gives you a few minutes before it even  Notifies you that your hands aren't in the wheel you have to actually move the wheel for it to know your hands are there  That was the nice thing about the cadillac had a had a capacitance system  It knew if your hands were there or not you didn't have to jerk

Start time: 7282.58
End time: 7301.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know that without the ct-6 you don't actually have to have the uh your hands on the wheel  Yeah, but your eyes have to be yeah  And the other thing is like they have that green light across the top of the  steering wheel which is like it kind of keeps you  You know focused on the it goes green when you're in autopilot

Start time: 7301.32
End time: 7314.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't do lane changing like the tesla does which is probably a good thing  I always makes me really nervous  But it does the lane keeping and it does the adaptive cruise control and I thought it did it quite well  And I like that green light because you know if it's engaged or not. It's very clear, right?

Start time: 7316.22
End time: 7375.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  but to go back to like the the bigger picture thing like  uh all these people who have done like incredibly stupid things like we so for instance, we got a  a tip from somebody who had fallen asleep like out cold and the tesla drove through a  tollbooth  oh jeez  At highway speeds and it clipped  Uh, this is like a model s.l car clipped one of the curbs in the the tollbooth  The guy flipped over like six times. He walked away which is like, you know a good thing  I guess uh  But you know, we never reported the story because we were like you idiot  Why did you go to sleep on the freeway? You could have killed like 10 people  and you know, clearly we weren't making friends with this possible story, but  You know at the same time it's just so frustrating because these people like tesla's clearly saying don't  Take your you know, like pay attention. This is not  You're not you know, I actually

Start time: 7377.08
End time: 7401.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I love the autopilot use all the time and I wish i'd had it when I commuted  Because I was at the end of the day when I was coming home and I always get sleepy  Yeah, and I was always afraid that I would nod off and while I wouldn't recommend doing it on purpose  At least I knew that if I briefly nodded off the car wasn't going to veer off to the side that it was going to keep  The lane well, and so that I think I would have loved to have that  I don't have autopilot

Start time: 7401.22
End time: 7424.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do have adaptive cruise control and I just took a road trip from the bay area to seattle  And it was a much more relaxing trip because I didn't have to worry about starting and stopping I got in traffic  I took my you know, oh, yeah traffic's great and I actually find that I that it actually helps me  Be less tired because I don't have to work as hard  Driving as I used to do and I presume autopilot is even easier in terms of relaxing.
