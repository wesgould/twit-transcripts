Transcript:  No Tony Roberts the tall guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tall guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The self-help guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  My close personal friend.  No he's where Amber's working with him and I think I may be misunderstood this but I  got the impression that he was going to join her and take a tour of this new studio that  we're building downstairs.  He'll bump his head.  I know I'm worrying about the ceilings now.  That female voice you heard is the wonderful Veronica Belmont of Mahalo Daily M-A-H-A-L-O  dot com.  Hello.  Hi I'm Veronica.  You were of all of the gang here.  I'm sorry Steve didn't mean to use that word.  That's alright.  You're the only one who went to South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I know I was kind of expecting you to be there.  I really wanted to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never been.  I know you're busy.  I had a conflict.  Tell me you know what it looked like on Twitter and I know there were people on Twitter were  getting very irate about it.  Was it like just a big frat party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I wouldn't call it a frat party but there was a lot of partying to be had but I can  understand how Twitter users were probably sick and tired of hearing about it from all  of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most of the posts on Twitter are I'm at party A but I'm going to party B now.  This was at 9 in the morning.  You guys were just having a great time.  I've always wanted to go.  It's kind of a gathering of the Web 2.0 clans and I think everybody is there who's a Web  2.0 celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really nice to see everyone at all in one place for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real faces.  We addressed the Sarah Lacey Mark Zuckerberg interview kerfuffle last week.  In fact, it was breaking actually as we were doing the show last week because it happened  last Sunday.  Scobel called in and gave us kind of a live update.  Were you in the room there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You skipped it.  What did you go see and said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was actually at lunch at the time.  I think it was at 2 o'clock and so I went to go get some food and I ended up going further  away from the convention center than I expected and didn't make it back in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're far enough away you didn't hear the jeers, the cat calls, the screams, the  yells, the terror?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I did see the Twitter updates.  But I guess if you weren't there you couldn't get the full experience of the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  What's your reaction to the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At first based on what I heard from the blogs and from the Twitters, I was like wow, that  must have gone really badly.  And then when I actually watched the video on YouTube and the clips that I saw, I'm  like wow, they kind of picked on her more than they needed to.  The attacks seemed way more strongly worded than were necessary.  And so I felt bad for her and it is a hard thing to do to get up in front of that many  people and try to do an interview style to kind of pull a mark out of his shell, which  I've heard is very difficult to do.  But I think the reaction way overweighed her wrongdoings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people who are watching the video are saying that, that you can't really tell  that people are that upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then her response and her kind of reaction, I don't know, it kind of left a bad taste  in my mouth afterwards.  She did not do any favors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She should have just said, gosh, you know, I'm sorry it went badly.  I feel terrible.  I didn't do a great job.  I'll try to do better next time.  Instead, she was very defensive.  And the worst thing was, she said one thing I know that it irked you, and I'll let you  address that.  The thing that irked me, she said, well, they'll never get any A-List people at South by Southwest  again.  As if somehow that was, you know, the flaw was in the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't really speak for the audience because I wasn't there and didn't see the reactions  firsthand.  But it did seem like they kind of blew up when they didn't need to.  But I don't think that's going to affect who they get at South by Southwest next year at  all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, you want to zip it up?  We're trying to do a show here.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's packing up.  He's taking off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you leaving?  Actually, she's got it.  I'm trying to clean up around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't know how loud that was going to be, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's pretty cool.  I could probably record that as a sound effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but to represent what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what you really want to do is do the zip slowly.  Go ahead and do the zip slowly.  Yeah, okay, hang on.  Like.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the sound of water running.  There you go.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now let's stop right here.  This is not a morning zoo.  Poor Veronica is going, what am I doing here?  Help me.  Get me out of here.  Steve, what was your reaction when you watched all this going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just wanted to turn off Twitter and run away.  But unfortunately, I'm addicted to Twitter, so I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was kind of a brutal lynching, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, the thing is that Zuckerberg is not exactly, to say that he's a difficult  interview is really kind of not putting it correctly.  He's an impossible interview.  He never says anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why we don't have executives on this show, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think it's not like he's been told by somebody not to talk.  I just don't think he wants to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's some suspicion he's been told by the CIA not to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  No way.  What, are they using Facebook to keep track of known subversives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying, you know, if I was up there interviewing, I would ask him the question  about the rumor going around that the CIA is the guys that are actually running this  thing or they're the ones who are financing it or financed in the early days.  Wait a minute.  Really?  You haven't heard this?  No.  I haven't heard this either.  I've heard it.  Talk to Molly about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She knows about it.  Yeah, Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would be the...  She does.  I brought it up with her and she says, yeah, I can't believe that nobody brings it up.  I mean, when they start interviewing him, at least have him deny it.  What was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would the CIA invest in Facebook?  Oh, please.  Access.  Access to people's information?  Yeah.  To know who's stooping whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I'm putting the tinfoil hat on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, there's got to be a lot of terrorists or terrorists wannabes or people that use  Facebook for other purposes from maybe overseas.  Facebook's a really good platform for like, sales.  I mean, not that I think this is true.  I'm just telling you, this is a question I'd be asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would think they'd be more likely to finance something like Bebo or MySpace where people  really are kind of out there and saying stuff.  I guess you feel more secure on Facebook.  You're more likely to say, hey, let's get together and make a pipe bomb.  You and me, we'll go there, we'll blow up the embassy.  What do you say?  Come on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this kind of a Russian...  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to be kind of indistinct so that nobody will take offense.  Oh, yeah, that's you.  If I had that range of voices, I'd be offending everybody.  It could be Israeli, it could be Russian, it could be Arab, it could be anything.  It could be whoever the bad guy of the du jour is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, anyway, to take it back to the conversation a little bit, I think...  Why?  We're getting so hilarious.  Why talk about serious things?  Wait, stop, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, please, Veronica, get us back on track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back in the days when it was just like an IRC back channel kind of discussion, this kind  of thing never would have made it out to the blogosphere.  It's true.  I think Twitter is possibly wholly to blame for the whole debacle.  Twitter's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It came out at South by Southwest last year.  Of course, it was already well known, so there was no way it was going to come out this year,  but it ended up being the story once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter was the killer app again, I would say, either that or Rock Band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I kept reading people were using Rock Band and Guitar Hero in all the booths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every single booth had either Rock Band or Guitar Hero 3.  Every party had Rock Band or Guitar Hero 3.  It was just kind of sitting out on the convention floor, just out there for everyone to play.  It was kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the karaoke of your generation.  I suppose.  I think it is.  And I think you're going to be just as embarrassed in a few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did your band play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell us about the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I have a Rock Band band with Casey McKinnon, Leah Culver, and Bonnie Pierzina.  We played at the Tumblr Next New Networks party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's definitely video.  Yeah, I put it up on Pounce and also Casey has it up on her blog.  There's a YouTube video.  But you get to see all our frustration as our Xbox 360 pretty much went foobar.  And we had to keep restarting and then there was disk errors and then it wasn't synced  up properly.  Finally, we rocked it out and it was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what is Tumblr anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tumblr is like kind of like microblogging, I guess in a sense.  It's just like a mini blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tumblr?  Not Twitter?  Yeah.  Tumblr.  You know the whole idea started with, what is it, Iconoclast?  I can't remember now the site.  Projectionist.  P-R-O dot J-E-C-T-I-O-N dot I-S-T.  The whole idea was it's a blog but more like bits.  There's no commenting.  People just throw up.  It's kind of closer to the original link blog idea than anything else.  It's kind of an aggregator in a sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a delicious competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  If you go to Projectionist, I think probably if you just Google Projectionist you can find  it because I didn't spell it very well.  It's project.ioni.st.  I got the dots in the wrong place.  Oh, and it also is down.  But the problem with Projectionist was what they were doing required some really custom  template programming.  And I tried myself.  There's a Rails version of this I never was able to get working.  All of a sudden along comes...  Is it Dave?  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Before we do that, let's add Patrick because Mr. Patrick Norton has just joined the club.  Hello, Patrick!  Hey, everybody.  Congratulations to put the baby to bed.  Well, I don't know about that.  The baby's nursing.  Oh, all right.  Not nursing you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have one of those Manzier things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I hold a bottle.  You know they make those.  Yes, yes.  There's a lot of things they make that will never enter my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To give men the experience of nursing.  They're... anyway, that's enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember talking to your wife about her swollen breasts and the feeling she had before the  endorphin release during the nursing?  I don't think the Manzier really qualifies for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, none of that.  You get none of that benefit.  I'm sorry, we're making...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The nine joyous perky months of pregnancy.  I don't think they've developed a man simulator for that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're making Veronica nauseous.  I think she actually went off and barfed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually, let me say something here.  I think it's interesting that Veronica brings up the point about us getting back on subject  rather than talking about the CIA and Facebook and we end up talking about her band and man boobs.  You know what?  Veronica's working for the CIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've finally got that out of the closet here.  She's a covert operative.  All right, I'll give you one.  Now that Patrick's here.  Is CNET buying revision three for $57 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $57 million?  Yeah.  Wow.  You didn't see that?  No, the first time I heard this, it was for $7 million.  And I told somebody I just fall asleep because my allergies kicked in on Friday and I get  this phone call like nine o'clock.  It's like, dude, heard you guys are being bought.  And I was like, what?  He's like, it's on Twitter.  You're being bought for $7 million.  It's on Twitter.  It's like million dollars.  Don't waste my time, dude.  I'm going back to sleep now.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite thing was on the on the blog post that I saw about it.  The first comment was Jay Adelson saying, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, we don't normally comment on these things, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Jay Adelson, our beloved chairman of the board and co-founder, has seen fit to comment  on it, it's probably Adelson.  If Jay has already commented on it, I have nothing to add.  There's nothing of use.  I can add to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that David Prager was confirming it briefly, but I think he was joking around  again on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that somebody should have played the game.  No, no, we're buying them.  And then the punch line would be for $7 million.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, have you been following?  The CNET board is very unhappy with the way CNET's been run.  Of course, they brought in Dan Farber, but I think you're going to see more changes at  CNET, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Farber had been there for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Farber was at ZDNet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the subsidiary, but not actually part of CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they, what's his name, retired?  You probably worked for him, Veronica, at one point.  Yeah, Jay Singh.  Retired to spend more time with his family, which I think that's the common cliche for  when somebody's been fired.  But in fact, that's actually what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like the common cliche where he quit so he could have less time with his family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Less time with you guys.  And then they Dan Farber, they brought Dan Farber in, who is I think a very good move.  Was it?  No, I'm sorry, not Dan Farber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Dan Farber.  It was Dan Farber.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would know that, Steve, because he's a regular on the gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Dan Farber is now editor-in-chief of News.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know what's going on at CNET?  Has he talked about it or have you got any insight, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a subsidiary of CNET.  That means he's running one particular business unit inside of CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he's the VP of CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big change for the news department, but I think there's even more.  The board seems unhappy with CNET's stock performance and in general with the way it's  being run, right?  Am I the only person who's been reading this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we've all read it and that's all we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The real problem is there's a bunch of raiders back in New York who bought a bunch of CNET  and they're trying to jack the price up and they're trying to get new people put on the  board.  They think the board's incompetent.  And a lot of it has to do with once Shelby left, some of the vision went away and they've  got all kinds of these weird initiatives like Bnet and a whole bunch of other little...  Bnet?  Yeah, Bnet.  You don't even know about it.  I mean, it's not very well marketed.  Yeah, Bnet.  It's a business network.  It's like CNET only is Bnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a lot of whiteboards and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they have a...  And then they have Tech Republic, which is actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Tech Republic actually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so they think maybe there's a little lack of focus.  I don't know.  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact, and I think Yahoo suffers from this, is I  think there's a slowdown in the effectiveness of online advertising at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but CNET stock price has got hammered back in the dot bomb and it's been suffering  ever since.  I don't remember any of my friends suddenly selling their CNET stock and buying houses  in the last seven years.  No, we got some, didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  I think if you look within the last couple of years, it was up in the 30s or something  like that and it's only recently.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to the internet.  Yeah, Veronica, you shout no and I'm looking for...  Veronica was a lot higher than it is now.  Yeah, she would.  You worked there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But in the past three years, it was between 15 and $9.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Mike Errington writing in TechCrunch.  CNET board has, quote, tense, uncomfortable meeting with Jana Consortium.  Jana has about 21% of the company.  From what we hear, says Mike, the meeting didn't go so well.  Quote, it was tense and uncomfortable, said one source.  The CNET board is, quote, in a state of denial, end quote, about the seriousness of the situation,  said another.  CNET stock slumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I'll defer to Veronica because she was at the company for a while, so she  probably understands that the stock was not as high as I thought.  But the point is, is what can they do about it?  Well, Veronica, being an ex-employee, might have some ideas.  What's wrong with CNET?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, geez, that's a big question to be asking me.  I don't really know.  CNET TV was doing really well when I was there, and that was the area that I worked in.  In terms of their business stuff, I'm probably the wrong person to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the content on CNET TV.  I think it's well done.  I think Tom Merritt's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're doing a great job, too.  Molly's great.  A lot of other programming from Geek Entertainment TV.  I believe some Revision 3 stuff is on there.  Is that correct, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, Tekzilla Daily's on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is awesome, because I'll be on there on Thursday.  I mean, one Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I neglected to mention when we were covering the Sarah Lacey story that,  John, you're going to have Sarah on Cranky Geeks on Wednesday, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to be the run we run on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, we've got a show.  Actually, it's kind of a throwback show.  I think we're going to have a couple of our ex-people on.  It's going to be an evergreen show we're going to do afterwards.  So it'll either run the next Wednesday or maybe a week after that.  So it's not going to be the normal news story.  It's going to be one of our typical, you know, where we get some people and talk about  issues.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I presume about the Zuckerberg keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it'll be in there.  I'm not going to focus on it by any means.  But we're going to talk.  I want to talk about my ideas, to talk about the effect of Twitter.  Twitter, again with Twitter?  Slowly I turned.  And here's the thing that, because when I did the years ago when the Des Moines Gnome  was still running before he moved it out here, it was the beginning of this period where  people you'd go, you'd give a talk to these people, this group, and nobody's looking up.  Nobody's looking at anything you're saying.  They're all blogging at the time.  Now it's they're all Twittering.  Not all of them.  Sure, there's a couple of people that aren't.  But generally speaking, there's so many of them that are Twittering and blogging.  It's creating a awkward situation for public speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with that.  Well, it's not just Twitter.  The minute you start to speak in front of a group now, there are all these laptops in  front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of fucking going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all looking.  Well, even if it's not a geek group.  I just spoke to a radio convention and they weren't geeks necessarily, but they all had  their laptops open.  And you know they're reading blogs, they're playing solitaire.  They're all doing something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the exact opposite.  I think that it's a blight on us laptop users that we are being interrupted by these idiots  on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll go with you on that, Steve.  Why do you even go into the audience then, Steve?  That's the point I would like to make.  I don't.  I stay home and watch it on Twitter.  Good.  Well, then you should stay out.  But why are people going in there?  Can't they find any place else to sit down?  Is that the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's it.  It's just a nice place to sit.  Maybe they'll give you some water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all about power strips, John.  That's what it's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After you've paid your $700 to $5,000 to attend your five-day conference, you want to make  sure you keep that seat warm.  Actually, here's the theory.  Even if you're just doing email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This comes from Dr. Irving Biedermann, a neuroscientist at the University of Southern California.  Actually, Lee Gomes wrote about it in the Wall Street Journal this week.  Basically, his premise is that our evolutionary and biological imperative makes it we have  a human need for information.  We can't stop grazing web data.  What he did, first he got some volunteer test subjects, showed them photographs of a variety  of things.  The subjects preferred a certain kind of pictures.  For instance, monkeys in a tree or a group of houses along a river over things like an  empty parking lot or a pile of old paint cans.  It turns out the pictures they liked best had certain common features like a good vantage  on a landscape and an element of mystery.  In some way or other, Dr. Biedermann said, they all presented new information that somehow  needed to be interpreted.  He then hooked up people to brain scanning machines and he found, in fact, those mysterious  shots are the ones you had to think about, cause more brain activity obviously than a  parking lot full of paint cans.  Which all of this seems fairly obvious, but his theory is that biologically, we're tuned  to scan the horizon looking for saber-toothed tigers and gather information that will help  us in survival.  He says that's exactly why students can't sit down anymore without having more inputs  all the time.  We need that information flow.  The bigger the flow, the better.  Does that make sense?  It's a biological imperative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not your child's lack of discipline or respect for his peers.  It's the fact that he's biologically tuned to be Twittering to his friends during class.  It's a crock of crap is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the new media theory.  When Eliot Spitzer has problems, it's all biology.  We're all controlled by our biology.  It's a crock of crap is all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've always wanted to be distracted.  What difference does it make?  That's why you say, sit down and pay attention.  You have to tell people that.  You always had to.  Some people would like to read books in the back of classrooms.  Howard Reinkel is doing an interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's teaching a class right now.  He realized, he said, nobody's paying attention to me.  The first day, he says, close your laptops for the next hour and just think.  I don't know how the class must be hating it.  He's trying to address this and say, what is it that is grabbing your attention?  What is going on here?  Is this a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In my high school, the class weren't paying attention.  The teacher would pick up a chalk eraser and fling it at whoever was writing notes.  I had that same teacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he also say, life isn't fair?  What makes you think life is fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was a different professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all right.  So you don't think we're wired to be gathering all this stuff all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, but we may be wired to be gathering all this stuff, but, you know,  in theory, we're wired to do a lot of other stuff.  And, you know, we can get into a whole lot of...  Why don't we just have sex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't we have sex in class if we're wired to do that too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you know, everybody should, you know what?  We're wired to get drunk and fornicate all the time.  Which class is that?  Can I get in that class?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to be in that class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are in that class.  Are you human, sir?  Then you're wired to get drunk and fornicate.  And that's what you should be doing, because self-discipline is not really  necessary in the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so classy that you say fornicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't he great?  Thank you.  Very classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  He's the Dr. Laura of this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you ever call me Dr. Laura again or I will publicly spank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that could be good.  We'll save that for Twitter live later once we start doing video.  Make some money on that deal.  Facebook, I'm sorry, the CIA is launching an instant messaging service.  Did you see this?  I am on Facebook.  I mean, this supports the contention that kids nowadays need 18 things  going on at the same time.  They're going to use Jabber.  You'll be able to use standard instant messaging clients.  My kid already uses MySpace as I am, basically.  Facebook is going that way, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is another Twitter story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it a Twitter story?  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, Veronica, I interrupted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's okay.  Go ahead.  I was just saying it's constant partial attention.  We're always in five different ways, if not more.  And Twitter is just kind of a symptom of that at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that bad or good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's bad.  I mean, I just haven't figured out how to parse all that information  yet in a way that it's effective.  You know, I mean, I'm getting so many different streams of information  all at one time from Twitter, Pounce, RSS feeds, instant messaging.  Where do you where do you turn it off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is getting worse, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's getting much worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a symptom or an accelerant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably an accelerant.  Yeah, to put it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you mean an accelerant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's more difficult to make it more.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there used to be a barrier of entry, right?  Could you afford a cell phone?  If you couldn't afford a cell phone, then you only got phone calls  when you were at home or at work.  Then you got a cell phone.  You get cell phones at any time.  Then email became a primary business tool.  But you have to have a computer for email.  And suddenly your cell phone can kind of do email.  And then somebody comes up with Twitter, which is faster than email.  Or, you know, I mean, you're saying it's a vicious circle.  Vicious cycle, maybe vicious accelerant, vicious spiral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see it as proliferating.  I think it's simplifying.  Really? Yeah, Twitter is taking over much of those functions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we talk about the last three shows we spent a lot of time  talking about Twitter, and I think there's a real divide.  Certainly in our audience, there's a divide among people who  are Twitter users and interested in this and people who just say,  what are you talking about?  Why is Twitter worth spending any energy talking about?  Is it that important?  Or is it just a bunch of A-listers talking to each other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the same thing about Crank.  Inside baseball. Is it?  No, I don't think it is. And I'm not.  OK, let's put it this way.  I find the whole thing important.  I don't like Twitter. I don't use it.  I read these things that people put up on Twitter from people  I know, like you and everyone else that uses it.  And I read these inane comments.  I think it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  But I think it's somehow important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm hearing cash registers ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When John says it's the stupidest thing I ever see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that every time I go on a podcast with John,  we have the same argument every single time.  It's just in frames. I love that he hates it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always framed differently.  It's compelling, though, in some ways to its users.  You see what Calacanis is doing.  He's offering a MacBook Air if he gets to 20,000 followers.  He's basically trying to buy followers.  But, you know, it makes sense for him.  And I know this is the calculus he's going through.  If he can get 20,000 people to follow his every word on Twitter,  that's hugely valuable to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that we should be the next Robert Scobel.  Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we should get Scobel to get 25,000, which will force  Jason to have to sell give away another air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Tesla. He's going to have to give away a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, now, this is Steve thinking, you know, like it like the mercantile  guy that he actually is. This is a great idea.  If you can keep cranking up Scobel's numbers, it'll be a Calacanis  will be chasing him forever, giving away more and more stuff.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So everybody, if everybody's smart, they should follow both  Calacanis and Scobel. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or double up on Scobel with some phony.  And then Leo, Leo comes in, you know, quietly and steals them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying a word. I'm just sitting here.  I'm up to 10,109 followers, but I'm not giving anything away.  No, I do think I think the value of having followers is clear.  I mean, you got to be careful.  You can't spam these people or they're all going to go away.  You can spam them once.  Right. So you got to save your save your wad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure people are going to go away.  I mean, how how easy is it to turn off the TV set? Not very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the next TV?  Of course. Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More so little tiny URL links.  And they start executing code.  Then, oh boy, then we know what. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.  Now I'm scared.  What about Facebook?  Facebook is is this is Twitter?  This would be interesting.  I mean, everybody's been saying, well, what could be Facebook?  Is is something as simple and stupid and dumb as Twitter?  A Facebook killer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. I think they're for different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they? Do you use them both? I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Facebook is still mostly for networking for most people,  and I don't think that's going to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how do you use Facebook? I'm just curious.  What do you stay in touch with your friends that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, actually, most of my friends are my like friends that I've known  from college and from from, you know, real life, I guess you could say.  Are still my friends.  Exactly. They're all still on my space, which I don't use.  I just keep it on there in case they want to get in touch with me.  Facebook is more of a just kind of landing page for me at this point.  I mean, I've got links to all my my different projects there, updates.  It's mostly that kind of mostly that kind of mostly that kind of mostly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. I just opened my Facebook page and there was stick them on it.  I apologize. I started feeding myself to myself.  That's funny. That was amusing.  A snake eating its own tail. It was. You opened a wormhole.  Yeah. Cross the beams.  Did you see that AOL bought Bebo? Bebo, of course, is the big.  In fact, I didn't know.  I had never heard of Bebo until I saw that last year on Google Zeitgeist,  it was the number one search term.  I thought, what is Bebo?  But Bebo is basically a MySpace or Facebook more popular, I think, in Europe.  Yes. I don't know where it's.  Yeah, it's it's.  Well, I thought it was a content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I thought it was a user content site. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't MySpace a user content site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, like a lot of videos and, you know,  kind of a YouTube thing with social networking attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of those. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess we don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it make sense for AOL to be buying it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got apparently they have to do something.  I brought this up to a number of people in the industry and they say, well,  you know, those guys, they got to do something.  It's true. They have to find a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, which is getting bought by Yahoo would then be bought by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft, Microsoft and Yahoo finally sat down for the first time  since the Microsoft attempt to buy Yahoo.  Is that a breakthrough?  Is the the meeting occurred on Monday at Yahoo's headquarters?  This is according to Yahoo News, which I don't know.  Although I don't think they had any insight into this.  No investment bankers there.  No discussion about the offer, although they must have talked about.  Something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're gathering one of the reports, one of the reports had him  talking about the Microsoft vision,  and that was the word used regarding the two companies getting together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so they were wooing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.  And I don't know the way Microsoft operates, so I don't know how, you know,  because Gates already said he's not going to pay any more money.  And then there was one report that came out saying that they may actually lower  the offer just to just to screw with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good way to put the screws to him, isn't it?  OK, well, every every week that goes by, we'll pay you one hundred million dollars less.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we'll put it into Twitter infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve, do you have a Twitter problem?  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're an addict.  I've been addicted since the first day that I used it.  I had no idea what it was good for and no hope of ever having anything  that it would be good for.  I hear a song here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is it good for?  I mean, I seriously think that it is completely dominant.  To your question to Veronica before, I think Facebook and Twitter are  accelerants of each other.  They're neither is going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, actually, a lot of people when they Twitter that updates their Facebook  status, so I guess there is some integration that way.  And what happens to poor old Pounce is Pounce and also ran or never was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use Pounce differently than I use Twitter, so I can they can live side  by side harmoniously in my world.  But a lot of people don't see it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, John, you were implying that Microsoft has no vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would like to hear that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is our vision? What is the vision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently, they have some concept, I guess they were throwing at him and  they said, come on, you guys should do this with us.  I don't know. I have no idea.  I don't know. Those meetings are always, you know, their sales meetings.  You guys are good salesmen and there you can do it.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like Microsoft is just kind of an amorphous blob that's going feed  me and trying to absorb as many different things in different areas as  it possibly can. Yes, they're being assimilated.  Yeah, I feel like it's these two.  Well, it kind of goes without saying.  But, you know, Google and Microsoft just trying to reach out and grab,  take as much land grab as they can before everything's all sucked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Patrick could do this.  Patrick, you're a Microsoft VP.  You've been sent to Sunnyvale to talk to the Yahoo folks to convince them  that Microsoft is the next big thing and that this acquisition is going to be  great for you. What would you tell them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys, here's the way it is.  You're all going to get crushed like a narco at a biker rally,  or you can join Microsoft and try to rally against Google, which is one of  the you all love the whole idea of retiring before you're 70, right?  Do you want to wake up one day and find out that  you're vacuuming the hallway in a casino in Reno?  Not that I don't enjoy the idea of vacuuming a hallway, casino in Reno,  but you know what I mean? I can see the conversation being a lot like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really that negative, like, come on, you have no future, no hope.  We're the only chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other way of doing it is doing the whole like, you know,  you guys have this search thing, which which isn't as successful as we'd like.  And you've got this whole online video thing and ours hasn't been as successful  as we've like. And you all bought Flickr before we were smart enough to realize  we could have bought Flickr.  And it would be a long laundry list of, you know, merging their synergies.  Because basically, you know, Yahoo, for all its complicated managerial issues  still seems to be a lot better than  Microsoft at building community sites.  That's true. And they haven't stopped either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They keep cranking them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So to buy for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say again, Veronica, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They pick good sites to buy.  I mean, compared to Google, who has bought a lot of different sites  that haven't gone anywhere, for example, Dodgeball, which is basically  just sitting on one server in some guy's closet and is checked on every three weeks.  Sites like Upcoming and Flickr are continuing to grow and do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good point. It's a good point.  They may be losing the money, but they but they as in terms of the audience,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're still maintaining the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the community is there.  Mm hmm. Well, it's not a small thing to do.  If I'm going in there, I'm saying, hey, guys, Google just acquired DoubleClick.  It just went through.  We better get together now.  What about this to get the DoubleClick  merger with Google approved by the EU?  That three point one million billion dollar deal went through.  Does Google now become the evil empire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just now become the evil empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Google.  I don't want to believe ill of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you can like them and they can still be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Should we worry about them?  Should we worry about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need them to be evil.  We need them to be evil so that Microsoft is the good guy and they can catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we want Microsoft to be the good guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you saying that because we need competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because Silverlight is going to win, dominate everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got the he went, you know what?  He went to Mixo and they had this punch and he drank some of it.  Silverlight did have an excellent Guitar Hero 3 booth at South By also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I have to say that made me feel better about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, were the developers gathered around seeing how they could  implement Silverlight on their websites?  I don't know. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they weren't gathered around implementing Flash either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all you need is a YouTube and a Google video,  and I don't think you need to go any farther.  I mean, Flash is there, right?  How about Air versus I mean, they're already if they know Flash, they like Flash.  Why not just do Air? Why do Silverlight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because there's money in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft has got a lot of money to spend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Microsoft is going to pay them to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've all traditionally spent a lot of money on developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that short term make the money for Microsoft for a product nobody will use  and retire before you have to take what's left of the earnings from the Microsoft  payoff to develop with their tools to develop your 3.0 product  because nobody downloaded your 2.0 products.  They can figure out that Silverlight wasn't a virus.  Oh, that's a good way of putting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not I have to say I'm not convinced.  I think people, you know, people have been people don't like  Microsoft technologies, especially web developers.  These do you really think web developers want to get in Microsoft's pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you know these visual basic developers?  Well, I know there's I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know these could I know there are a lot of corporate developers.  I know there are a lot of corporate developers and intranet developers  who use dot net and they they very much want to make a dot net site.  And I'm sure Silverlight will be Silverlight will be all over the intra web.  But what about the internet?  I mean, I just have a feeling that at least the South by Southwest types  are not going to be jumping all over Silverlight.  I'm but that would have been an interesting thing to do is to sit by that booth  and just see what kind of reaction they were getting besides the rock band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I know you guys don't believe this, but then did you think Twitter was going to be  as huge as it is now? I joined Twitter in October 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does anybody know how many members Twitter actually has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't. Anybody anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody? Bueller?  There. Yeah, actually, I think Comscore says a million.  A million. I'll see if I could find it.  Let's track them down. Yeah.  I've seen numbers, but, you know, of course, they're all of these  are external numbers, not  not Twitter's numbers. Twitter's not saying.  Three, according to a Comscore media metrics in.  Let's see.  370,000 unique visitors in June, according to media metrics.  But that was June. I'm sure it's twice that now.  That's pretty low. If that's if actually that's the uniques, that's pretty low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then how come everybody's talking about it so much?  Well, it's it's us, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a it's very inside, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, when Zuckerberg and Sarah Lacey, you know, happened,  I think it pretty much took over TechMe.  But still, that's the technology news sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not outside of that too much.  Fair enough. So what what else is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's the Obama Clinton campaign.  That's kind of interesting.  I mean, I think that I don't know if people have covered this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as much as they ought to, but I have to have a feeling that Obama's secret sauce  may end up being a very adept use of social networks, certainly for fundraising.  There's something to think about.  Here's something to think about.  Obama follows back all his followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hillary does not.  What does that say about their campaign?  And look how many followers Obama has.  It means that they have a lot of follow on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm just playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Hillary's campaign couldn't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It's a simple thing.  They could have done that and they didn't figure that out.  This means they don't get it.  Right. The one person on their team who's in charge of managing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  their social network, right?  The one program doesn't get it.  John Edwards was on Twitter before either of them were,  and I certainly followed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And initially, John seemed like he was actually using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, he had the good grace to when a staffer was posting,  it would say staff.  And then I presume when it didn't, it was in first John Edwards, first person.  He was actually doing it.  I don't know if when you see a Barack Obama post,  it's clearly a staff member, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's clearly a staff member, right?  I mean, I don't think Barack's whipping out his Blackberry and saying,  I better tell Twitter what's going on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you look at what Obama's done in terms of winning states,  he's won in caucus states, which is caucuses are a perfect proving  ground for a Twitter or social media type of environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  No, I agree.  I would say that Obama's secret sauce much more so than say Howard Dean  four years ago was a real ability not just to use blogs and the internet,  but to use things like Twitter.  I mean, if you look at the Obama groups on Facebook,  they're very active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, but did it help Ron Paul?  No.  I mean, he was the darling of the internet on dig and on Reddit and everywhere else.  And where did that go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it didn't help Howard Dean either, but it helped John Kerry.  He picked up all of that stuff and used what's going on in the Dean campaign  in a couple months later.  And then the Republicans picked up on it and beat Kerry with social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can't polish a turd, but you can promote the hell out of it on social networks.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bingo.  That's exactly it.  Ultimately, you're not going to win votes for somebody who's not, you know,  electable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's ripping shreds of paper over there?  Should be weaving a basket out of paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now what are you doing?  That's not me.  I wasn't making the ripping.  I think it's Patrick, actually.  Are you opening mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm down in the garage and was pulling an article out of a magazine.  I'm terribly, terribly sorry.  Oh, it's great.  I love it.  I do this.  Hey, speaking of numbers and love, CNET hasn't been above like 15 and change,  like 15, 60 something since 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not so bad.  That's right.  Okay, I'm sorry.  But they were up in some ridiculous sky.  Then the crash took place.  But at least it was level at 15.  It was actually hanging in there at 15 or so.  And then all of a sudden took this big drop.  Now it's down the middle of nowhere, six or seven.  And I can see what's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They took all of 2005 to get up to 14, 15 bucks and then spent a few months in 2006  and dropped down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Leo yawned and the whole network went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You only know that because you were watching the video.  I have to remember the video.  There's video.  This was not a great Newsweek.  I have to confess.  I didn't see any stories that really caught my eye.  Anybody have anything that you noticed that you picked up on that you thought was a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big deal.  I did just get a Twitter that it was Leo with the paper according to Twitter user Cafe Ninja.  Hey, knock that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw you doing it.  Knock that off.  The video, I'm busted once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody read the article with Steven Levy accidentally throwing it at a smacker?  I thought that was awesome.  He has a...  He's thrown up to that in an article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if he was sure of it.  I think that was his theory about what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he got stolen.  No, he doesn't.  It's a crackpot theory.  Give me a break.  I think it's a great theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you had an air, it would be so easy to...  This is what he says happened is he left it on the coffee table with a Sunday Times.  This is what he thinks happened.  He doesn't know what happened.  He thinks his wife scooped it into the Times.  It's thin enough and just recycled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now listen, I've got an air and there's a whole thing going on with this thing.  The first minute that I opened it, I said to my wife, this is just...  Who gives a s*** about this?  Oh, sorry.  You know, it just didn't seem to have any real value.  Now, I carry it around with me when I go to the bathroom.  I carry it out to the car.  I just...  I can't get rid of the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in fact, you're...  I'm sorry.  Now, see...  It's mesmerized.  We're just going to have to bloop this out.  It's just unbelievable.  So not only do you give a s*** about it, but you take a s*** with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eww!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, let me just make a mark there.  Where's the zipper effect?  Bloop that one out.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are goops.  No, but this machine...  I mean, how many people on this call have actually used the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have one.  I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've typed on one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, by the way, it's going back to Apple on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's heavy and...  You keep saying that, Leo.  It's heavy enough that it's not going to be picked up.  Usually when you pick up something, you got like a laptop stuffed in there.  You know it's the three pounds that it weighs.  It would either slide out or you'd say,  Jesus, something else is in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a stack of newspapers is heavy enough that it would blend in.  I mean, do you read newspapers anymore, John?  Do you remember the heft of the newspaper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, but it's three pounds is a lot and the fact that it's in there.  What's it doing in there in the first place?  Why would you slip it into a stack of newspapers in the first place?  It makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't slip it in, you list it on top, somebody's not paying attention.  Haven't you ever read a newspaper or somebody else in a coffee table and stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't this a Sunday paper for all those circulars and calendar matching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like somebody to try to test this and YouTube the results.  I just don't think it's that easy.  And the other thing is where's the flexibility when you pick up the stack of newspapers?  There's always going to be some flexing in there.  You got a hard item like this laptop is not going to flex so much.  You're going to notice it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm inclined to agree with John on this one.  I think that Stephen Levy just kind of did it as an attention grabber, frankly.  All right, we're getting him on Twitter next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to get him on Twitter next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he got Newsweek to pay for it and he gave it to his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did, in fact, get Newsweek to pay for it.  So, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Newsweek isn't enough exposure for Stephen Levy.  He had to invent throwing out...  Couldn't he have done something cooler?  I mean, something less, you know, mortally embarrassing?  Or is it some sort of geek cache to be like, I threw out my air book and I got my job to buy a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I think it's actually fairly reasonable.  The thing is light enough and kind of airy enough that I think it's not so unreasonable.  What it is, is telling anecdote about the fact that the air really is...  Oh, it's a crock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a typical...  It sounds like a bunch of promotion to me.  The other thing is he was at some radio station or whatever and he can't quite remember if he picked up the air or not.  And it was like, if you read the whole story and he's like, I can't imagine what happened.  Well, and he's trying to dream on it.  And they said, well, don't worry if it ever has to be repaired.  We'll have the guy's serial number because he went through that process with the company thinking it might have been stolen.  And, you know, he could have left it anywhere.  It could be in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sounds like you analyzed the story very deeply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't analyze it.  Well, I read it when I was just kind of going, this is a crock of crap, this story.  Because I remember reading somebody going on and on about what a hilarious story it was.  And I said, well, let me go see how Steve...  I know Steve person.  I don't think he's that funny.  Although to be honest about it, when he does it, he has a stand up he can do.  He's hilarious.  Really?  When he's...  Yeah, he always...  He kill you.  It's unbelievable.  But his writing is not known for its humor.  And so I'm thinking, well, that's interesting.  It's changing.  I read there's nothing in there that I thought was funny, except the idea that he might have had crushed in the trash compactor.  But, you know, what are you doing putting newspapers in the trash compactor?  I think that was mentioned too.  That doesn't make sense.  He's supposed to recycle those.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, a lot of urban areas, they do the recycling at the...  Basically, they haul everything and it gets sorted in a big warehouse and sold out in a warehouse.  I bet.  They do that a lot in San Francisco, actually.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to take a break for a moment and mention audible.com, the sponsor of this program.  And I'm sure they're very glad to be here right about now.  Audible.com slash twit.  If you'd like to sign up today, get a credit toward a free book.  There's always great stuff to read on audible.com.  I like to recommend a book for you for your credit.  Of course, you can choose from 45,000 titles.  The beauty of it is, you know, unlike other audiobooks, you get it right away.  You pick it, you download it within a minute or two.  You've got it.  You put it on a CD.  You listen on your computer.  You put it on almost any portable device.  Take it with you.  I listen to a lot of books on audible.com.  I thought for the group today that Warren Buffett Speaks, the wit and wisdom from the  world's greatest investor, might be a good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From the world's richest man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a speech.  He is now the world's richest man.  He's number one.  All right.  Let me read you some quotes.  With enough insider information and a million dollars, you can go broke in a year.  Or here's another one.  What I am is a realist.  I always knew what I'd like.  I always knew I'd like what I'm doing.  Or perhaps it would have been nice to be a major league baseball player.  But that's where the...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not dissing Warren Buffett.  The dude came up with his concept.  He's held to it.  He's met a lot of people who invested with him.  Really wealthy.  Done well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I had some Berkshire Hathaway, I'd be happy.  And you know, he's also...  He's like Bill Gates.  He's going to give away all his money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, all but a few billion.  Yeah, he's going to have Bill Gates management.  That's what manages it.  That's the big joke.  Yeah.  He's giving it to Bill and Melinda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What makes that a joke?  It makes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the joke.  And I won't say who told me this, but it's a venture capital.  He says, why don't you bring up the fact that how does Warren Buffett manage to get  Bill Gates to quit his company to manage Warren Buffett's money?  Now, Bill's not the number one guy anymore.  He's actually dropped to number three and the world's richest man.  And meanwhile, Bill's like managing Warren's money because Warren has got other things  to do like run a business.  I mean, if that's not funny, I don't know what is.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a sign of Warren Buffett's brilliance.  He's brilliant.  Don't piss him off, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'll come after you.  Totally.  I agree with that.  That's the point.  It's like Warren is obviously the smarter of the two guys.  You see?  That's why this is a good book.  Bill's working for Warren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wall Street is the only place that people ride to work in a Rolls-Royce to get advice  from those who take the subway.  I don't know what that means.  It's just in the book.  Warren Buffett speaks the wit and wisdom of the world's greatest investor and now the  world's richest man.  It could be yours absolutely free.  Now, how do you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought Gabby Hayes was dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, it's Gabby Hayes.  Go to audible.com, swash twit.  You get your own copy of that there.  We got beans for supper, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Read a couple more quotes in that Gabby Hayes voice.  I don't have any.  Come on.  Why?  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I actually have run out of quotes.  There was only four on the page.  I got to get the book and then I can do some more for you.  Audible.com, slash twit.  We do thank them so much for their support of the Twit Netcast Network.  They are our primary sponsor and they are renewing for another great year of Gabby Hayes  impressions.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's art people.  You should tell the audible people that you could read that whole book in a Gabby Hayes  voice.  I could do it like Walter Brennan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wouldn't be good that way, wouldn't you?  Come on, Luke, let's tell you some stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually Leo Laporte reads the classics.  I would find that.  He wouldn't.  You're mixing your people up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Luke is not related to the Gabby Hayes guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Walter Brennan.  Was you ever stung by a dead bee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I was watching that movie the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great movie.  Great movie.  Okay.  God, the whole thing's just come to a rapid.  What do you do when this happens on the gang, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just leave the recording going.  You do, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For hours.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he walks away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do quit from time to time.  I was talking to Arrington yesterday and we were reminiscing about the good old days  when I fired him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was great.  Was that a stunt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  He fired me for having the temerity to have Nick Carr on the show because he didn't like  Nick Carr.  In those days, Valley Wag thought this was interesting.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was a stunt though.  That's the kind of thing you do in a radio station.  I remember Don Imus was feuding with Pete Franklin on WFAN.  If Franklin did the afternoons and Don Imus did the morning, I worked with Pete.  Pete was a character.  Talk about inside baseball.  Oh man.  They were feuding back and forth.  At one point, Pete goes in and steals all the microphones from the studio.  Imus comes in at 5.30 to do his show and there's no microphones in the studio.  He actually goes to the payphone out in the street.  This was in the days when they still had them, and does the show from the phone.  Now, obviously a stunt, but a great stunt.  It got all in New York talking.  I think Prager deleted his Twitters on this CNET to buy Revision 3, but fortunately somebody  has saved this on his Flickr account.  Here's the Twitters.  I would say this is a day ago.  Anyway, Dr. Tiki says the real number is 57 million.  Prager says, oh, he tries to direct message Dr. Tiki, but he accidentally types DS.  Uh oh.  And so it's public.  DS, Dr. Tiki, this is totally NDA.  Call me.  Dr. Tiki then says, okay, here's the real deal.  CNET is trying to get Revision 3 for 57.  And then Prager says, time to buy some Cristal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's baloney.  They're just playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think it's a stunt?  Yeah.  Why would CNET buy Revision 3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, I never see Prager as a guy who does either stunts or has much of a sense of humor.  He has a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  Have you seen any of the videos he's done, like the Facebook videos and the music videos?  Were you in the music video that he did with the Zuckerberg sisters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  I never thought of him as a comic.  Let's put it that way.  Or a prankster.  Am I wrong?  I think he's more deadpan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's more deadpan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's more a wankster than a prankster.  Well, deadpan.  I can see the deadpan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why is it so crazy that CNET might be trying to enter this new media?  It actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're already running...  You said, Patrick, they're already running your show.  They know how well it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're carrying it on CNET TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that gives them a very good idea of their value, of your value.  Maybe they said, wow, this stuff works well.  Let's get it.  Aren't we starting to see a bunch of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For example, I saw something on TechCrunch today where Arrington wrote a story, and of  course he tweeted it.  And he said in the tweet that this had been picked up by Yahoo News.  And so he's got 900 comments on this particular thing.  Are we getting this kind of acceleration going with the big media picking up the littler  media and essentially becoming syndication hubs for these new media plays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense.  It solves a lot of the problems.  I mean, you don't have to worry about bandwidth.  You don't have to worry about infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't solve the problem of the poor reader stuck with a 900 comment post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there really a 900 comment post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  It's something about Japan...  Oh yeah, 1015 comments.  Did you read that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Japan has decided to beat France and the United Kingdom, both of whom have similar proposals,  to become the first country to ban file sharers from the internet.  It's coming not from the Japanese government, but from Japan's four ISP organizations after  pressure from the record and movie industries.  Yeah, wow, I'm not surprised you're getting a lot of comments on that.  They're banning...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ban for life from the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  File sharing.  Wow.  But see, that's the difference between the Japanese and us.  And I think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, wait a minute.  The difference is that they're obviously the bigger a-holes.  I mean, who's going to jump on this thing?  Oh, I want to be first at being an a-hole.  So I'm going to ban this thing before anybody else does so I can be number one?  At your peril, I might add.  What are they thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At your peril, I might add.  I think that that makes you...  You start blocking the internet, it makes you a second-rate nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's also how alternative networks get launched.  That's true.  Or alternative internets.  I mean, how are they going to ban people from the internet?  How are they going to...  How are they going to use your personal identification number?  You have to type it in every time you log in to be signed into the government server system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The government will have to buy Cisco in order to make that stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cisco and every Cisco alternative, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but if you get it into the Cisco packets, into the routers, then you've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that there were pirated or I should say counterfeit Cisco routers being sold from China that in fact had backdoor code in them?  They were labeled Cisco.  The Chinese government apparently or somebody in China, I would guess the government, although they always deny this,  trying to infiltrate networks exactly that way, selling a Cisco router with firmware that is corrupted.  Wow.  Isn't that an interesting story?  Yeah, that's great.  That's how you take over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who needs an army?  See, we found something finally to talk about.  Who needs an army?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it the end?  It is for me.  You don't want to talk about Yahoo Buzz?  Mike also talking about that in TechCrunch today says that Yahoo has apparently, Buzz, which is their dig clone, been very good at sending traffic to outside sites.  In fact, Yahoo says they've sent 16 million visitors in the first two weeks to outside sites.  Salon claiming they got one million unique visits in one day from a story on Yahoo Buzz.  Us Magazine had their second highest traffic day ever from Yahoo Buzz.  Huffington Post reporting 800,000 uniques from a Buzz story.  This is a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that because they spammed everybody with a Yahoo email account?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buzz is a dig style website where you vote on stories and apparently it's doing very well.  This is why, by the way, they believe that the thousand comments on Duncan Riley's post on TechCrunch.  They have a really good place on the Yahoo front door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people see that, don't they?  I mean, if people have Yahoo as their homepage, and I'm sure a lot of people still do, they'd see that and it says, vote for the web's hottest stories.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike says that that Japanese ISP story went live at 545 as one of the bottom four links in the news box on the front page of Yahoo Buzz was up all day.  He says, despite the fact that it was a Saturday, which is the slowest day of the week and was only up a quarter of the day,  we had our highest traffic day ever and 1015 comments on the post.  The traffic almost brought TechCrunch down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buzz is, that's got to be driving Kevin a little crazy.  This is a dig clone and it's already completely out of control.  Dig never did anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing, well, one, digs crushed a few websites in its time and two, I think the more important thing is Veronica and I are now thinking,  hey, this is a great way to drive traffic to our respective videos.  I'm on there right now promoting it on Yahoo Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  Come see me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so here's just to point out to Patrick how Silverlight's going to dominate.  Once Yahoo is bought by Microsoft, which will happen very soon, then they're going to put a little Silverlight icon on every page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what it shows you is, and you're absolutely right, Steve, it shows you that as much as we get excited about things like Twitter and dig,  that when a really big site, a mainstream site like Yahoo does something, it has, that does carry a lot of weight.  That's where people really are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of the executives at all of the company that have Yahoo as their homepage for their personal email are going to see Silverlight  and they're going to go tell their CTOs that they have to use Silverlight on their products or projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, they're already using Flash.  It's a 30 second or 10 second download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the John C. Doesn't Buy It Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently.  Well, when I'm on with Steve, it's always going to happen because he's like an idealistic crackpot.  He's worse than me, isn't he, John?  No, no, you're just a goody two shoes. You're a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to be like that, though. I used to be like every new technology was great.  And then John taught me the world sucks. Everything's going to hell in a handbasket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm an honest state, the CPM.  Most products suck. That's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love the idea that I'm idealistic talking about Microsoft dominating. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you ever like did you work for Microsoft?  Why is it you like why have such a love for Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been loving Google for five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got bored. Oh, yeah, I'm bored, too, with Microsoft.  I got bored. I agree. I know what you mean. You need a new love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever happened to staying true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, hey, by the way, just offhand, who's the people? Because I just installed this today.  Who's the guys behind Remember the Milk dot com? I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're an Australian company. Isn't that a great site?  It's kind of cool because you it's a to do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically a to do list. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Online to do list. Our milk dot com interfaces with Google Calendar.  So you never really have to go to the site.  Yep. No, remember the milk is the best one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hook me up on this one. It's amazing. It's the best online to do site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've used it for about a year, year and a half now.  Our milk dot com is a short the short form of it.  And it actually integrates with everything. That's the kind of neat thing.  They've done a very good job of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does anyone try this then?  You take their list and then you put it on Google calendars or Microsoft calendars.  And then does it cross post because Google and Microsoft both cross post now?  Does it double cross post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then it all gets sucked into a wormhole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do not cross the posts.  Just wondering. I don't know.  That's a big problem. It's actually a very big problem.  You can start doing this kind of RSS propagation because you start getting duplication.  And in fact, you can start getting an endless loops.  I've had that happen with Jaiku. I had my Jaiku posting to Twitter, posting to Jaiku.  And I got an endless loop and the entire world ended.  It all went down a vortex.  This is all a simulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like friend feed and social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Which do you use? Friend feed or social thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like social thing better.  It's pretty, isn't it?  It looks a lot better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm on both, of course, because that's my job.  But I can't decide. I don't spend any time on either. I go to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, let's stop right there. It's not your job.  It's my job.  You would be this way if you were not even involved in all of these podcasts and everything else.  You'd still be on all these things.  I'm not denying that.  He loves his job.  But it's not his job. That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As the Chinese say, if you love your work, you will never have a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is to his job. How is it not his job?  People look to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kick my butt right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but what I'm saying is what he's using is as a rationale as though if people weren't looking to him, he wouldn't be doing any of this crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be on the beach right now. I'd be reading a paper book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd be probably even more. You'd be coding in PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was watching him all morning while I was washing the dishes as the tech guy. I mean, that's his job.  That's all I do.  He's got a TV show called The Tech Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a radio show, but it's now it's video.  Well, it's a TV show for me. I'm looking at it right now.  I can't believe you watched it, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did because I was forced to wash the dishes.  I have a new theory.  I took my air, which I don't take with me everywhere. I take it only to the bathroom or to wash the dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for sharing.  At least it's clean.  I ran my keyboard through the dishwasher, actually. So there's kind of a relationship there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried to do that and broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you got to let it dry thoroughly, like for weeks.  Then you can use it again. Once there's no moisture involved, you can use it again after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll probably also do with the fact that I put syrup in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't put syrup in it. Just dishwasher detergent.  I think I learned that from Patrick. Didn't you use to wash the keyboards in the dishwasher at Tech TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've done stranger things. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I learned that from you as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did you get syrup in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it was a Mahalo video that went horribly, horribly wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you flew. You flew on Mahalo Daily the other day.  I did.  That was so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I went and took an introductory flight lesson over at Santa Monica Airport with American Flyers. Yeah, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really like what you're doing with Mahalo Daily. To me, this is a great... Daily.Mahalo.com. Everybody should watch every day.  Is it daily now? I mean, Monday through Friday daily.  Yep, Monday through Friday now. Yeah.  Yeah. And how to become a private pilot, how to become a recreational pilot? You do it all. Getting a flying certificate.  Not the episodes, but how to get your private pilot certificate.  Yes. And are you going to do that or is it just kind of fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like $12,000 to get your license there. Maybe sometime. Maybe someday in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the number one downloaded, most downloaded Mahalo Daily yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The number one downloaded is the Mac World in 60 Seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Steve Jobs keynote. Yeah, the keynote.  Those are great. She did that. You did that with the Oscars too. I love that. Some poor guys got to spend all day editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're pretty good at picking out which parts to put in. They're excellent. It's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's your plug. Daily.Mahalo.com with Veronica Belmont. It's not live streaming like this, but hey, it's the next best thing.  Thanks. Who was it? I think it was Chris Perillo was streaming from his car today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh gosh. Hey, I have a question for you guys. I saw a video today of him freaking out because his Mac crashed while he was on the air,  basically, you know, whispering sweet nothings into its ear and saying how much he loves Macs now. Was that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. No, he's abandoned Windows and became a Mac guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But was the whole Mac crashing as he was talking about that stage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, who knows? We can't tell with Chris anymore because he's known to be staging things.  He freaked out. It was pretty funny. He does. He does freak out. I think it was probably fake. I think so too.  You have to ask Chris. But, you know, a lot of what he does is theater.  It was funny. Either way. Yeah. Good theater. The theater of Chris. The theater of the Perillo.  He's my inspiration for doing this streaming video. I mean, he's been doing that for some time now.  Patrick Norton is on Tekzilla. T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A. True. That's revision3.com slash Tekzilla.  And you're still doing this co-host search, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had a co-host picked and then something went horribly wrong. And we're still working on finalizing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You cannot build androids from marshmallows. I keep telling you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's an entirely different conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tekzilla is a really great watch. And yeah, now you can watch it on CNETtv.com as well as revision3.  Fifty-seven million. That's good. Do you get any of that, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I refuse to comment on any rumors of revision3 sold or being unsold.  Because if I do comment, I'm going to get my ass kicked on Monday.  So as far as I know, it's whatever Jay said is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Adelson knows what's going on. I would hope.  Yes. John C. Dvorak. You know where to find him. Dvorak.org slash blog.  And now he does like 80 other things too. Like you're doing Cranky Geeks on Wednesdays.  You do Tech, what is it? Tech5? Take five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tech5. Tech5. Tech5. Podshow.com daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you didn't get laid off, did you? Because I think a bunch of people got laid off at Podshow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I didn't, as a matter of fact. And what it was is, of course, if anybody wants to know the story,  they finished developing version 3 and they ended up with too many engineers.  And they had to essentially get rid of about half of them because they actually aren't going to need them anymore.  And then they also changed their business model just enough so that they also had to emphasize sales.  So they're actually hiring people to do sales and getting rid of people that are kind of producer types that aren't needed.  So it was just a typical thing you run into in these things, these startups. It wasn't a big deal.  I think a more interesting big deal is actually the bankruptcy at Ziv Davis,  which also doesn't really affect anything because it's just a way of putting off the bondholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's not important either. They went Chapter 11, but that was because some bondholders were saying we want our money now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't mean that the magazine industry is a little soft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the magazine industry is soft. But in the case of Ziv Davis, from the way the books are, being in bankruptcy is a lot better.  It's good for me to say this, but this is the way the economy works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they were saddled with a ton of debt back in the day.  No, the debt load was outrageous. Outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, no, everything's nothing's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody just told me that you can watch Revision 3 on the iPhone at m.revision3.com. That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is true. You can also watch it on an Apple TV on your Xbox 360.  M.Revision 3 just got launched last week, which is the mobile portal for all of the Revision 3 video for your cell phone.  It's exciting, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've actually watched Mahalo Daily on my Apple TV, too. It's neat.  Very much.  Yeah, it's really cool.  Steve Gilmore is, in fact, going to be doing some video and audio, I understand.  He is now a blogger, blogs.eweek.com slash news gang. I look forward to that, Steve. That should be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. And also, I'm going to be pointing at all you blogosphere guys from the site that we're setting up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. And Steve Gilmore's gesture lab is gesturelab.com.  And of course, you've got to participate in the news gang Monday through Friday and listen to the gang on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And speaking, by the way, of Chris Perillo, he just I.M.ed me saying, why aren't you live streaming yet?  And I said, are your ears burning? And he says, no, I just caught your article.  Ask him if it was fake. Ask him if it was fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clueful and clueless.  Clueful and clueless. Yeah, ask him if he was faking that, Daria, that outrage.  You want me to see if he's on if he's on Skype, we could just call him. Let's see.  Yeah, he is. Why don't you do that? Let's just add him in here.  That's the easiest thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Veronica, should we should we fake some anger on Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Veronica is like everywhere.  She's going to she was on Twitter today. She's going to be on on techzilla on Tuesday.  You're, by the way, the best co-host on techzilla.  Just want to say that. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Everybody agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're bothering me so much. We're trying to get around cranky geeks on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cranky geeks. Come on, let's make it the hat trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should do it now, Veronica. You've already said everything you wanted to about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't know if I could say let's not talk about it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Perillo is going to voicemail, unfortunately. He's not he's not picking on you.  I know. He knows now he knows we're after him. We're going after him.  I got you in my sights, Perillo. You're on my list, dude.  Thank you, everybody. Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, anyway, so I was going to say that I talked to Sebastian Rubley about getting Veronica on.  And the first thing I said to her to him was we need to get Victoria Belmont on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It begins with a V and ends with an A. I know. I know. I've gotten him a whole life.  Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's OK. I'll just make fun of you if you do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You call me Lonnie.
