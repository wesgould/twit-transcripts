Transcript:  You talk about the tech boom and of course you write a lot of feature stories about other subjects as well.  It's great to have you back. You and your bike.  Oh yeah. Bikes.  Bikes. Her Brooklyn bikes.  Also with us from, in fact, I think we've got an all East Coast team this week.  Steve Kovach is also here from Business Insider. Do you live in Brooklyn, Steve?  Manhattan.  Manhattan. Oh, he's an urbanite. Big city dweller.  People who live in Petaluma, as I do, think of Brooklyn as a pretty big city.  It's huge. It's huge.

Transcript:  Also, David Pogue, are you back East or are you back here? You are bi-coastal, I think.  I am back East at the moment.  Great. So all of you will be staying up past your bedtime.  Welcome. David Pogue with Yahoo, of course, where he is a tech columnist for Yahoo Finance.  At Pogue and a longtime friend of this show.  And it's always great to see you, David. Thank you.  Haven't had you on Twitter in a while.  Yeah.  Glad to get you on.  A while.  A while.  So I think the big story this week was Friday's DDoS, distributed denial of service attack,  that slowed or brought down sites like Netflix and Twitter and GitHub and a lot of sites.  And I think the real story is that this attack was not your traditional DDoS.  It came from pretty much Internet of Things devices, particularly Internet of Things devices made by  one Chinese manufacturer, cameras and DVRs made by, was it, Shang Mi?  And then branded by others.  The problem with these Internet of Things devices is they often have default passwords,  which can't be changed.  And so bad guys scan the Internet for them.  There's this case, the virus, there's a couple of viruses, but this one was Mirai.  M-I-R-A-I. It scans, it looks for the device, finds it, logs in with the default password,  puts itself in memory, and now you're on a botnet and your device, your camera, will be used to send  false packets, in this case to DynDNS, which is a DNS provider that apparently was used by these other  sites and so brought them down.  Mirai is, well, according to Brian Krebs, was originally written by somebody, a hacker with the  handle Ana Sempai, but Ana Sempai has released, was in the DDoS industry and writes, greets everybody.  When I first got in, go in DDoS industry, I wasn't planning on staying in it long.  I made my money.  There's lots of eyes looking at IoT now.  So he or she released, it's time to GTFO, which you probably can figure out what that means.  So he or she released the source code from Mirai.  Brian Krebs posits that maybe the police were hot on her tail, and so she preserved plausible deniability  by making sure everybody else had the code so she could just say, oh, I don't know, I just downloaded this thing.  I didn't write it.  Krebs was brought down last month with a 620 gigabit per second attack, such a nasty attack that he, was he on Akamai?  His provider actually pulled the plug on his site.  But most of this came from generic routing encapsulation, a particular kind of data packet used to direct,  establish direct P2P connection between network nodes from Internet of Things devices that had been hacked by Mirai.  Here's the worst news.  Even if you have been hacked and you've, you know, your service slows down, maybe that's why you keep getting knocked off, Erin.  I don't know.  Let's say you unplug that.  I wouldn't know it, right?  You wouldn't know.  But let's say you said maybe, and you unplug the device, but it's the virus is stored in RAM, so you're off the botnet.  But as soon as you plug it in, within minutes, you'll be reinfected.  That's how bad it is.

Start time: 397.42
End time: 398.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all your fault.

Start time: 399.97
End time: 411.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, of course it's not.  It's interesting that the company who made a lot of these Internet of Things things is Xiaomi,  because when I found out that both the New York Times and Spotify had been knocked off, that's exactly what I said.  Xiaomi.

Start time: 413.00
End time: 415.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was the New York Times also down?  I didn't know that.  Wow.

Start time: 416.27
End time: 421.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Business Insider was down too.  Was it?  Yeah, we went down for a while.

Start time: 421.06
End time: 432.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure I understand exactly that point.  Why would Dyn going down affect all these other sites?  They're not, you're not customers of DynDNS.

Start time: 434.15
End time: 444.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not exactly sure.  I just know that our IT guys were sending out frantic emails saying, it's not our fault.  It's Dyn's fault.  We're waiting for them to fix it.  Wow.  And I think it was only people.

Start time: 445.59
End time: 451.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  I mean, couldn't it just be that whoever your web host is, is a customer of Dyn?  Maybe.

Start time: 452.35
End time: 453.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's probably what it is.  Yeah, we use AWS.

Start time: 454.00
End time: 455.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, AWS was brought down as well.

Start time: 456.12
End time: 459.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably what it was because we use AWS.  Yeah.

Start time: 460.76
End time: 520.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We use AWS, but we have a bunch of different interlocking things because we've been DDoSed  before.  In fact, we used AWS for DDoS protection.  The only real way to fight denial of service attack is to just add more bandwidth because  you can't, you can't, there's too many IP addresses to say, well, block that IP, block  that camera, but then there's a hundred thousand more somewhere else.  Here's the scary part.  According to Gartner, there are, what was it, six and a half billion IoT devices in  use this year.  And, and I wish I don't have the number in front of me.  I was something like half, half a million more going on.  Let me see here.  I'll find it right here.  Gartner estimates that there, the 6.4 billion connected things worldwide up 30%.  This is the one that scared me.  In 2016, five and a half million new IoT devices are connected every day.

Start time: 521.14
End time: 546.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  I'd like to know what those are.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, I've seen the internet of things, water bottle, the internet of things, toilet  paper dispenser.  That's what they are.  Internet of things, dog dish dispenser.  I mean, even, even the things that make sort of sense, like an internet of things, doorbell  camera.  I mean, I don't, I don't know anyone with those things.  You're telling me six billion people have, I don't buy it.  What are we talking about here?  Well, it's actually countable.  So I mean, yeah.

Start time: 547.34
End time: 551.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So your Nest thermostat, there's a couple million there.  There's a lot of...

Start time: 552.34
End time: 556.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Keep adding until you get to six billion.  How do you get to six billion out of that?

Start time: 556.59
End time: 559.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Maybe Gartner's wrong.  I should have been more skeptical.

Start time: 560.82
End time: 565.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Two million thermostats you're saying and all the rest are water bottles.  And toothbrushes.

Start time: 566.01
End time: 592.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How, almost everything's connected now to the internet.  Think of all those Wemo and Belkin light switches, the Hue lights.  The Amazon Echoes.  The Amazon Echoes.  They've sold millions of those.  There's a lot of devices that they're at.  The problem is I'm sure the Amazon Echo is fairly secure.  I'm sure Amazon knows what it's doing and it doesn't have a default password, which  can't be changed, that the firmware gets updated by Amazon, one would hope.

Start time: 593.59
End time: 598.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What about TVs?  Are TVs included in that?  Cause that would be huge.  Absolutely.  TVs.  Absolutely.

Start time: 599.16
End time: 606.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Smart TVs.  Sure.  But that's not a general purpose computer or a phone, I guess, would be an IoT device,

Start time: 607.73
End time: 621.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right?  Oh, okay.  Well, usually when people are hitting me up with PR pitches for an Internet of Things device,  it's an ordinarily unnetworked device that they have now added a phone app for.  Like a coffee maker or a refrigerator.

Start time: 622.00
End time: 650.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  TV counts, right?  I mean.  Okay.  Well, there you go.  What about phones?  Does that count?  No, I think that's a computer, right?  Anyway, the real problem is with these cheap Internet of Things devices that are not designed  with security in mind at all.  They're just being put online.  And I would bet you that every home has a couple or three of them.  That you don't even need the TV.  I've got how many TVs?  Three TVs hooked up.  I've got.

Start time: 651.00
End time: 657.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can't buy a not smart TV anymore.  Like every TV you buy is Netflix installed or whatever.  So that makes sense.

Start time: 658.24
End time: 679.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cameras.  Security cameras, spy cams.  There are a lot of.  But you're right.  That seems like a large number.  Five and a half million new ones a day.  Wow.  Not buying it.  You're not buying it.  So let's say it's one billion, David.  Can you get behind one billion?

Start time: 681.39
End time: 684.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe if you include China and TVs.  Well, you have to.

Start time: 685.46
End time: 694.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to include it all, right?  All of these can be used maliciously if they don't have proper security.  And so are we counting routers?

Start time: 695.31
End time: 695.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 696.57
End time: 739.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, we absolutely routers.  In fact, this has been a problem for some time.  Last Christmas, a year more than a year ago.  Remember when the Sony PlayStation Network was brought down  and the Xbox Network was brought down on Christmas Day.  It was brought down by the Lizard Squad using routers.  Hacked routers.  And the problem is companies are putting this stuff out  and they're not patching it.  They're not keeping it up to date.  Routers become such a cheap, commoditized device  that the companies don't update them.  Their attitude is, you should buy a new one.  I guess there really isn't much commentary on this except that, wow.

Start time: 742.38
End time: 771.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's amazing there's just not a standard yet.  Apple is dipping their toe in.  They have their own standard.  Well, it's also there are so many standards, right?  There's the HomeKit standard.  There's whatever Google has with Nest, WeMo, you name it.  There's a new standard, SmartThings.  Zigbee's.  Yeah.  Right.  So, I mean, that's the problem.  It's just so fragmented that one of these is going to have a flaw  or a hole in it that someone can exploit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  You know who it is.  They use the US Postal Service on the weekends because the...  Oh, really?  Yeah. The Postal Service trucks  and many of their employees aren't working on Sundays,  so they use contract employees at Postal Service trucks.  So if you're getting Amazon deliveries on Sunday,  often it's from the USPS, believe it or not.

Start time: 809.55
End time: 824.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we've all learned something today.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Well, I picked a bad starting topic.  I thought there'd be something to talk about,  but as I think about it, besides the fact that, you know,  what are all these devices?  There really isn't that much to say, is there?  I have a comment, Terry.

Start time: 824.58
End time: 830.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My question is, because this isn't something I cover super closely,  but my question is, is this just an arms race  that we will constantly be losing?

Start time: 831.37
End time: 832.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good question.

Start time: 832.53
End time: 890.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  David, you have a thought?  Yes, I have a commentary.  So part of it is you have the wrong guess.  None of us are security experts.  We all cover it, but we don't know it, right?  We couldn't defend a government computer or hack into one.  Right.  But the thing that's so frustrating to me about this is  almost any other problem in the world,  there are steps we can take in progress that's being made, right?  There are people attacking climate change by, on the state level,  moving to solar and greener programs.  With health, there are programs to dissuade you from smoking  and getting more exercise, like every other problem in the world.  But this one, like people ask me, and I'm like, I got nothing.  If Sony and Target and the biggest, smartest companies in the world  with professional staffs get hacked routinely,  we have zero chance at our level, zero.  It is, you know, it's a problem.  The answer is we're screwed.  Is that what you're saying?

Start time: 891.41
End time: 891.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Basically.

Start time: 892.16
End time: 904.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have nothing to offer my readers.  I got nothing.  Well, this will get better.  No, it won't.  It's only going to get worse.  And it doesn't matter if you change your password  and make it complicated and don't duplicate it.  It doesn't matter.  You'll still get stolen.

Start time: 905.61
End time: 906.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because you also, you have these...

Start time: 907.00
End time: 921.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think though that, do you think that any kind of regulation could,  like, you know, forcing the companies that are making these cheap,  kind of crappy connected devices to like go up to a certain standard,  do you think that would make a difference at all?  Or is that just like already too little, too late?

Start time: 921.20
End time: 963.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it will make a difference.  In fact, that's the, I mean, there's a simple fix,  which is to require that all of these devices have updatable firmware  and that the companies are responsible for making sure that if they're,  I mean, look, you can't make software without a flaw.  But if you look at the example of Microsoft, Apple, Google,  when the flaws are found, they patch these flaws.  So what really is an issue is that companies are irresponsibly making devices  that are A, not fixable and B, not being fixed.  So step one is to make sure that all devices can be updated  and step two is to require companies, make, somehow make companies responsible  if they don't keep their devices secure.

Start time: 964.12
End time: 989.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure it's a panacea though.  I mean, that's a start, but I mean, my employer, Yahoo,  gave 500 million addresses to the government.  There was no hack there, but people were upset about that  because the government wanted it and Target was an inside job by an employee.  No amount of good housekeeping and good protocols would have saved them.  You know, there's, it's always going to be a thing.

Start time: 989.45
End time: 1006.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well, it's never going to go away,  but I think that there are things we should be doing to fight it.  I mean, I shouldn't just say, okay, throw up your hands or what,  or just maybe don't have any Internet of Things devices anymore.  This is why we can't have nice things.  Stuff cash in your mattress.

Start time: 1008.06
End time: 1016.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Stuff cash in your mattress.  Don't use banks. Don't use anything.  No, I think it's solvable.  I think the problem is that here's, there's problems twofold.

Start time: 1016.70
End time: 1058.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One, there's huge demand for the cheapest possible webcams and routers  and all of that price driven down.  And then you have manufacturers all outside of the US who are making,  you know, cheap products.  That's so problem.  Problem one, we got to stop buying those and we got to start making rules about those.  That's not going to stop them being sold in other countries. Right.  And I don't think China is ever going to do anything about this.  So, and by the way, a Chinese device can bring down DNS,  dying DNS just as easily as a US device.  So in that sense, I don't know, we'd have to have global regulation about this.  That doesn't seem likely.  No.  We're screwed.

Start time: 1059.24
End time: 1062.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can't even get global regulation for climate change.  We can't even figure that out.

Start time: 1063.02
End time: 1104.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, and we've seen this coming.  We've known this was going to be coming.  Brian Krebs wrote an article saying he's seeing, and others have noted this,  probes from state actors into various infrastructure and Internet infrastructure  to see what the defenses are, what the security is.  He has anticipated, and I think he's right, we're going to see massive cyber attacks.  You probably saw a couple of weeks ago in Meet the Press,  Vice President Biden saying,  we're going to cyber attack Russia with a proportionate response  to retaliate for their hacking the DNC.  This is not going to get worse.  That kind of dialogue escalates it, right?

Start time: 1107.79
End time: 1122.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. We're doing it too.  Just as much as China and Russia and Bulgaria or wherever it's coming from,  we're doing it just as bad to them as well.  So it's kind of like a Cold War again in cyberspace or whatever.

Start time: 1123.30
End time: 1156.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  David, you and I have been covering this for a long time.  I vividly remember in the mid-90s when the Internet,  when Mosaic came out and then Netscape,  and the Internet became widespread use,  kind of this utopian sense that we're going to see the democratization of the world.  Everybody's going to be able to talk.  We're going to see an amazing, thriving economy grow out of it.  I was very, and I'm sure you were too,  and I think we all were very almost utopian about this,  and it's turned into a dystopia in some ways, hasn't it?

Start time: 1158.28
End time: 1179.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's both.  I mean, the good happened,  but we didn't anticipate just how bad the bad would happen.  I mean, the bottom line is, anyone who's been with the Internet long enough,  the bottom line is there are a lot of people who are really terrible people.  I mean, not just the hackers,  but the cyber bullies and the people who leave comments.

Start time: 1181.56
End time: 1202.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's what's interesting is this democratization is also given a bullhorn to a tiny fraction.  I think most people are good.  Most people are not hacking IoT devices.  This is a small fraction,  but all it takes is a small fraction because they are using the Internet's leverage to have massive impact.  That's right.

Start time: 1203.46
End time: 1309.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's terrible.  By the way, the more we try to defend against it, the more complicated it gets.  So I was writing about this new feature of the Apple Watch that lets you unlock your laptop just by approaching it.  Yeah.  But to do that, you have to turn on two-factor authentication,  which, if you can believe this, is not the same thing as two-step verification,  which Apple launched last year.  So two-factor authentication replaces two-step verification.  Like, anyone is supposed to be able to understand any of this.  So I did it.  Well, first of all, you try to turn on two-factor authentication,  and it says, I'm sorry, your iCloud address is not available for this feature yet.  Apparently, they're rolling it out.  So Apple tech support escalated it, and they agreed to turn it on for me, which was great,  except that now everything disappeared from my calendar,  because every program that taps into your iCloud account has to be updated with the two-factor thing.  And I called Apple support, and they didn't know.  They said, well, escalate it, but the guy won't be back till Monday.  So I decided I'll turn two-factor authentication off.  And at that point, I was cut out completely from all iCloud services.  So I, at this moment, cannot get texts.  I cannot get, I cannot watch any of my movies or listen to my music or get into iCloud.com.  Nothing. And of course, my calendar is blank.  So, I mean, good protection comes with it complication.  And we're going to see that happening more and more, too.  The bigger, the more complex the defenses, the more inconvenient it's going to be for the little guy, if I might call myself.

Start time: 1309.56
End time: 1349.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My story is much better, but it's pretty bad still.  I wanted to do the same thing.  And then it said, OK, well, you have to answer your security questions, which good Lord,  I don't remember what the questions the answers were.  I must have done this 10 years ago. I hate security questions.  Couldn't figure it out. So I called Apple and they said, oh, yeah, no, it's not.  Of course, we'll reset your we'll verify your identity.  They did. They asked some other questions and verify my identity, reset my security questions.  Then I went back to turn on two-factor and it said, oh, well, you've changed your account.  You can't turn on two-factor for 30 days now.  Oh, my God.  So in the process of setting up two-factor, I actually disabled two-factor.  But now that I hear your story, David, I think I was blessed.

Transcript:  And I actually went online to research this to see what other journalists in the tech world have written about it.  And guess what? The tech people.  We can't get the two terms confused. I didn't know what they were writing about.  What's the difference?  Oh, there's a big difference.  One of them.  I can't remember.  So two steps.

Start time: 1381.77

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the idea of two-factor is there are three.  You need to educate yourself.  There's three ways to do it.  Something you know, something you have, something you are, something you are as biometrics, something you have as your phone, something you know as your password.  Two-factor would be using two of those three, thereby making it harder for somebody to impersonate you.  Two-step sounds like you have to know a password and a security and like the security questions.  That's two-step. It's not two-factors.  Both of them are something you know.

Start time: 1408.28
End time: 1421.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but both of these Apple things involved every time you try to use a new device or log in in a new browser or use a new Apple service, they would text you a six digit code.  Yeah.  That's two-factor.  Okay.

Start time: 1422.02
End time: 1474.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's I thought two-step.  Because that's having that's their password, which you already know.  That's something you won't know.  And then something you have, you have to have your smartphone for that to work.  However, as we've learned, the weak link in all this is it's really trivial to impersonate somebody and take over their smartphone number.  So in fact, I just read an article by a security expert who said actually having a phone number attached to your Google account creates a security flaw because it's a matter of social engineering for a bad guy.  If they're targeting you, there you go.  If they're targeting you, they can call your phone company and say, hello, this is Leo Laporte.  They need to change my phone.  Can you send me a SIM?  And they send me a SIM, send him a SIM.  And now he has my phone number and can reset my Google account.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and even the National Institute for Standards and Time, NIST, has issued a warning that text messages are not a good form of two-factor.  Despite the fact that every bank, every financial institution, Apple and Google all use it because SMS messages, that's a weak link.  It's tied to your phone number, which can be easily hijacked.

Start time: 1513.04
End time: 1551.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a better way to go because that's something you are, right?  Biometrics is something you are.  Your iris or your fingerprint or the shape of your bottom, whatever it is, that's something you are.  It's not looking...  None of this is perfect.  The idea is to have a speed bump so the hacker can get...  Okay, let's say I steal your target.  I get your password from your target account, but I still would need one more step.  By the way, as long as we're talking about this, had Colin Powell or John Podesta used two-factor authentication on their Google account,  they would not have been hacked.  What year were those emails though?

Start time: 1552.00

Start time: 1559.12
End time: 1704.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a great article, by the way, from Vice, from Motherboard, and kudos to Lorenzo Franceschi Bichera, who wrote it.  Now, I find this interesting, but apparently what happened is both Colin Powell and John Podesta got a message.  We've all gotten from Google, or looking to be from Google.  Someone has your password.  Someone just used your password to sign in your Google account.  Blue button, change password.  You click that.  It does not, of course, lead to gmail.com.  It leads to...  Well, it's a bit.ly link.  And the reason we know this is they neglected to make it private.  You can have private bit.ly links.  This bit.ly link was clicked twice in March.  That's all.  By John Podesta.  Twice.  Twice.  It was a link to...  This looks pretty good.  My account.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk.  That's the real URL.  But if you only stop to myaccount.google.com, you go, oh, yeah, yeah.  A couple of warnings.  There's no HTTPS.  That tells you it's not really Google.  But also, you're going to com-securitysettingpage.tk.  When they clicked that link, it took them to a page that looked like a gmail account  and they logged in.  Now, had they had Second Factor, it wouldn't have made any difference, right?  Because you'd still need to get a text message.  The bad guy would have had to steal John Podesta's phone number  or Colin Powell's phone number.  Again, not perfect, but additional speed bump.  So, yeah, now we know how Podesta's email was hacked.  The interesting thing is this bit.ly account is tied to Fancy Bear.  I know you're happy to hear that.  Fancy Bear is, according to our intelligence agencies, a Russian state hacker.  But I'm thinking it's a little bit suspicious that Fancy Bear neglected to cover his tracks  and didn't do the easiest thing possible, which is make this bit.ly account and this bit.ly link private.  So, hey, I, unlike some others, am not saying I know more than the seven US intelligence agencies  who have all concluded, apparently, that it was Russians.  And probably they have other evidence.  But Fancy Bear left some breadcrumbs.  So turn on Two Factor even if it's not perfect.  I guess that's the point. Even if it's not perfect, it's better than nothing.

Transcript:  And I actually, whenever I write about fingerprints, I always get blasted on Twitter for suggesting that fingerprints are good.  That the argument is always, yeah, but if somebody compromises your fingerprint,  and I don't know how that's supposed to happen, cut off your finger when you're sleeping, you can't change it like you can a password.

Start time: 1723.04
End time: 1743.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point. A fingerprint is something.  But you know what? I think a fingerprint's fine. I really do.  I think the bigger issue for some people with fingerprints is that courts have held you could be forced to give the law enforcement your fingerprint.  What just happened a couple of weeks ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not self-incriminating any more than it is to give a regular fingerprint or a strand of hair  in the same way that telling them your password is self-incriminating. Courts seem to have agreed on that.  But recently, the FBI, what was it? They wanted a warrant to march into somewhere and force people to unlock their phones.  The Department of Justice got a warrant specifically saying when you search these premises, you can then force, I think it was drug dealers, these drug dealers to unlock their phones.  That warrant said that. There it is. DOJ warrant to force people to use fingerprints.  Again, I think the motto of this show is we're screwed.

Transcript:  I know. Wired Magazine says there is a law enforcement database with 117 million American faces in it, more about half of all US adults.  This actually comes from the Center for Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law School.  And there's no restrictions on how they can use it.  It's widely available. It's a national biometric database, mostly law-abiding people because it comes from driver's license photos.  And there's no real restrictions on how you can use it.  It's available to state and local level police.  So that wasn't the cheery story that I was looking for, was it?  Here's one that will cheer you up. Larry Lessig. I got to pat him on the back. He's been on this show.  Speaking of the Podesta emails, maybe you saw this. Larry is a classy guy, law professor at Harvard.  He is the creator of Creative Commons. Really smart fella.  He ran for president. You may or may not remember this.  In this cycle, his plan was, he said, nothing's ever going to happen unless we get campaign finance reform.  But no incumbent is ever going to support campaign finance reform because that's how they get the money to become the incumbent.  So I'm going to run for president. I'm going to pick a really good vice president.  When I get elected, I am going to initiate campaign finance reform.  As soon as it's done, I'll resign, let the really good vice president run the country.  All fixed. Didn't work, obviously.  But apparently it was bad enough to annoy John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, who referred to the smugness of Larry Lessig.  And then in an email correspondence with Nira Tandon, Nira responded, I f-ing hate that guy.  She's talking about Lessig. I'd like to kick the crap out of him on Twitter, but I know that's dumb.  This was leaked.  Lessig, who could reasonably have taken Umbridge, instead posted on his blog, I'm on my way from Iceland to my parents to see my dad.  He's not doing well. Sorry, Larry.  Landing in JFK, my inbox flooded with questions about this leak.  Here's a single and my only response. I'm a big believer in leaks for the public interest.  That's why I support Snowden and why I believe the president should pardon him.  But I can't for the life of me see the public good in a leak like this, at least one that reveals no crime or violation of any important public policy.  He's arguing for the privacy of the two people who slimed him.  We all deserve privacy. The burdens of public service are insane enough without the perpetual threat that every thought shared with a friend becomes Twitter fodder.  Nira has only ever served in the public and public interest sector. Her work has always and only been devoted to advancing her vision of the public good.  It's not right she should bear the burden of this sort of breach.  He basically apologized to her for the leak.  Now, is that upbeat enough? No.

God, I'm so sorry. Look, let's talk about we got more. We got happier things.  There's an Apple event coming up on Thursday. Are you flying out for that, David?  I am. All right. So we'll get some speculation on that.  It's funny. Microsoft knowing that there would be an Apple event in October, but not knowing the date because Apple,  I think kind of mean spiritedly won't tell anybody to the week before forcing you to buy the most expensive ticket possible.

End time: 2085.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know. That's nice. But Microsoft says we want to have an event too.  We've got new hardware to announce. Last thing we want to do is announce the same day Apple does.  That's the kiss of death or even the day after because they're going to own the news cycle for a while.  And they didn't know. So they just threw a pin in the calendar, a dart at the calendar.  And they said, well, Apple moved its quarterly analyst call from Thursday to Tuesday.  So probably that means Thursday is the event. So we're going to do our event on Wednesday.  So Microsoft's event on Wednesday. And when Apple set up the invitation, they went, we got it right.  So we can talk about that. Some other. That makes me really sad.

For a year now, I have been traveling with Nova, the PBS science show I sometimes host, making a special called The Search for the Super Battery about batteries.  Batteries are so I mean, they're not like double A's for our toys anymore, and they're not even just our gadgets.  Batteries are the key to everything. I mean, electric cars, of course, but the grid, like everyone says, oh, there will be solar and there will be wind.  But what you don't understand is that solar and wind, there's no electricity from the wall when that's not shining or blowing.  It's not like the faucet where the water is just waiting for you to turn it on. Electricity when you turn a lamp on is generated now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We're going to talk about that when we come back. We'll talk about the Microsoft event.  First, I have to talk about my new luggage with a battery in it.  Oh, no, this is a good battery. This is the Away Luggage.  This is really nice, high quality, smart suitcase starts at $225.  They have a carry on. That's what this is. The medium and the large. It's all under $300.  But I love this. If you look under the first of all, it's a four way roller, which I don't buy bags now that aren't four way.  You got to have four wheels. They call them spinners, right?  And it just it's so much easier. You walk into the airport and just roll it in.  But also look under the the handle. There's two USB ports, a USB 3, USB 2 charging port and a little 10,000 milliamp hour battery in here.  It doesn't really add to the weight, which is nice. It's a very lightweight luggage.  So that I mean, how many times you see people searching for a plug at the airport and how often do you find it?  And if you find it, how many times are there 18 other people plugged into that same plug?  Now you got you don't show anybody, but you got your own charger right here.  TSA approved combination lock, of course, to prevent theft.  Patent pending interior compression system. And I really like that really saves you space.  You can get a week or two even worth of clothes in this with the compression system and carry and still carry it on.  And any any professional traveler knows the only way to fly is carry on.  You do you do not want to check baggage of any kind.  So the compression system means you can overpack and fit it all in without having to sit on your luggage.  There is inside a removable laundry bag. So that's washable. So you can keep your dirty clothes in there.  This is a really, really nice luggage lifetime warranty.  And as with a lot of the stuff we saw on the Internet these days, a hundred day trial period.  I think that's great. You can return it after any time in a hundred days and get your money back away as a special offer.  Just for you, twit listeners, twenty dollars off your order.  If you go to away travel dot com slash twit and use the promo code twit at checkout.  And it's as I said, risk free for a hundred days. If at any time you say it's not for me, full refund, no questions asked.  There's no risk. Free shipping anywhere in the continental U.S. as well.  Away travel dot com slash twit. Use the promo code twit at checkout for twenty dollars off your order.  This is the only bag I carry now because I don't I nowadays phones just don't get through the day.  And I also now have to charge my headphones too and my watch.  You need a battery everywhere you go. As David was saying, away travel dot com slash twit.

So he says Apple will have a new MacBook as well.  That's the thin one. That they're dumping the MacBook Air, which kind of makes sense.  The MacBook. Really? You're not happy about that?

But in principle, they seem like a great solution.  Like they work for your phone. They work.  They switch seamlessly to your Mac.  The only time you're screwed when you have those wireless headphones, earbuds of any type, is when it's like the airline seat back.  Right. Or your car.  Right. You have a Jack.  So why doesn't Apple or somebody sell a button, a little transmitter button that snaps into any Jack you ever find and transmits to your AirPods?  Is that not brilliant?

You can answer the phone or adjust the volume or switch tracks or pause and play.  With these, you can't do that. You have to use Siri for everything.  So if I want to turn up the volume, I have to tap it. Siri activates.  And then I say, Siri, my music pauses.  And then I say, raise the volume or lower the volume.  And then my music resumes, which is just a terrible experience.  I think they really mess that one up.

But if you have a really nice, expensive pair, you're going to bring the case along with you wherever you go and like make sure that you remember them and you don't put them on your head and stretch them out.

The biggest change will be, of course, the OLED touch bar, right?  Which I like. I think that's a great idea.

Apparently Apple feels the same way because they haven't updated it and it's completely unupgradable.  So it's just the way it is. It's just a perfect, perfect little snowflake.  All right. Apple event. Apparently Microsoft event the day before will also be new Surface hardware.  Not sure exactly what it's the all in one.  It's their IMAQ competitor.

Transcript:  And I guess we probably won't see any more Windows phones.  That's toast. They're done with that.  I think you're probably pretty sure of that.  I like the idea of an all in one. Other Windows OEMs of course make all in ones.  But Microsoft does not yet make one.  And they've really entered into hardware in a big way.  I have a Surface Book and I like it a lot once it got the proper firmware upgrades to fix.  It had a myriad of problems apparently associated with the Skylake processor.  Microsoft said it was a hard computer science problem.  It took six months to get it working, but they did.  All right. So we'll be covering, I should mention, both those events.  I'll be up very early West Coast time, 7 a.m. on Wednesday, to cover the Microsoft event.  And then I think the Apple event is 10 a.m. Pacific the following day.  We'll obviously be covering that.  Did that cheer anybody up? Are we feeling a little better now?  New hardware? Happier? Happier?  Okay. Well, I can bring you down.  More than 90% of genuine Apple chargers and cables sold on Amazon are fake.  I could bring you down in any circumstance. Trust me.  Apple's filed trademark infringement cases against MobileStar LLC.  They're the primary maker of these counterfeit products.  They're using the Made for iPhone logo and everything.  Apple says they're not only illegally using the trademark,  but the fake chargers, get this, in this day and age have not passed safety tests and pose a risk to consumers.  So you thought you were safe once you turned in your Note 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because Apple has this Made for iPhone thing, MFI certification.  And I've always said, I agree with you, Erin, don't buy anything that isn't MFI.  But if it has the MFI label on Amazon, that should be safe.  Well, apparently not. It's a fake MFI logo.

Let me talk about Razors first.  You wrote a good article about the...  You asked the question, Aaron, is the Razor business a tech business?  Obviously, Razors are not high tech.  But what's interesting to me, and a lot of our sponsors are like this, is that they're using the internet and technology to kind of disintermediate,  to eliminate the middleman in businesses, to sell direct.  So Harry's is a really great example.  They bought the factory in Germany that makes the best Razor blades.  And instead of going through a drug store and getting 100% markup,  they sell them direct to you at about half the price that you would pay at the drug store.  And I've been using Harry's...  Gosh, why don't we start doing this?  I mean, it's been at least a couple of years.  It's for people who want a great shave experience for a fraction of the price.  And by the way, one of the things I love about Harry's, they're always improving their product.  They don't raise the price.  They just...  They're little improvements that make a big difference.  This is the Harry's Truman set, which is a great deal, but I'm going to give you an even better deal in a second.  But you get the Razor handle, you get the three blades, the travel cover, a full-size foaming shave gel, or the shave cream.  But look at these.  They've...  They've...  Whoops, I just took the blade off.  They've added to the blades.  Now they have a fifth blade in the back here, which I always missed on the Harry's.  And I'm really glad they added these because there's a little spot under my nose I can't reach.  They've got the lubricating strips are even better with better...  They just last and they're really help you get a smooth shave.  The flexible hinge has been improved.  Still $2 a blade, half what you pay at the drug store.  By owning the factory, Harry's can produce high quality razors and sell them for half the price.  I want you to check it out.  In fact, Harry's is so confident that you're going to love their blades.  They're going to send you a free trial set.  That's the Razor, a five blade cartridge, and shaving gel.  Free when you sign up for a shave plan.  The shave plan means you'll always get fresh blades and fresh shaving gel or shaving cream.  It's shipped directly to your door every month or every two months depending on your need.  And when you're a fan of the show, you're going to get a bottle of Harry's post shave balm added to your order for free.  Well, this gets better and better.  I love how this Harry's post shave balm smells.  It's a really nice way to soothe your skin after your shave.  So go to harrys.com right now, slash twit, harrys.com slash twit.  It's the only place you can get this.  Claim your free trial set and your post shave balm.  Love that. Love that. It smells.  Harry's, H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com slash twit.  It's funny that a razor company should be called Harry's because it makes you un-Harry.  But I never thought about that, but they call it Harry's.  Google has dropped the ban, the previously held ban, on personally identifiable web tracking.

Transcript:  Okay, fine. Tylenol.  When people put poison in the Tylenol, that's like saying, okay, there will be no more Tylenol  because no one ever will buy another bottle.  No, what the company does is they take extreme steps to reassure the public.  They redesign. They come up with new safety things and they carry on.  I mean, it goes on in every quarter of life.

Start time: 3659.49
End time: 3666.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could argue that they bumbled it so hard that they didn't.  The extreme steps part is it's too late for that.

Start time: 3666.88
End time: 3765.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The difference between Tylenol and Samsung is that Tylenol was some bad guy putting poison in Tylenol.  They didn't manufacture poison Tylenol.  And so they took steps to make sure it was sealed.  In fact, all products now on the drugstore shelves have all those safety seals.  And that's why.  The difference here is that Samsung, not only did Samsung does clearly at this point, it's obvious,  misdesign that phone because even the replacement phones continue to have the problem.  And the thinking now, I believe, is that they put too much battery in the phone and the battery was under pressure.  And as a result, the lithium was plating and short circuiting.  Samsung couldn't fix it, didn't fix it with the replacement phones that continue to blow up.  This is a GTA mod.  This is the band GT Red Theft Auto mod that turns that gives you a note seven to throw and blow up people with.  Samsung, by the way, got this pulled.  They're going to get this show pulled down. They got this.  You see, there it is.  They got it pulled down from YouTube as a violation of Samsung's copyright.  Fortunately, because we're news and we're using that for commentary, we're safe.  Anyway, I think Samsung was at fault.  And I also think at first I thought they're handling this well, but I think they mishandled the recall because first of all,  they didn't tell the CPSC right away.  They should have used a full CPSC recall, which would have made it illegal to sell the phone.  They didn't. They delayed that.  Then when they put replacement phones way too quickly back in the marketplace, they started having problems with that.  And to this day, there's a very large number of Note 7 owners who still have the phone in their pockets.  Some estimate as many as a million.

Start time: 3765.00
End time: 3814.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I agree with you, Leo, for a different reason, though.  It's not that this whole exploding issue.  It's like Samsung definitely this year leapfrogged Apple in terms of hardware design and in camera and some other capabilities on the hardware end.  But the software is still junk compared to how streamlined iOS is.  You load up the Samsung phone, you have two or three different email apps and two or three different chat apps.  And you're not guaranteed to get all the software updates in time.  And that's been this problem with Android since the beginning.  Right. And the Pixel just solves all that.  You get Android clean right out of the box.  You're guaranteed to get updates right away.  The hardware is nice.  Google Assistant just knocks Siri out of the water.  And I think the timing for the Pixel is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But don't you think it's not if there's enough choice out there that the consumer could very reasonably say, I'm going to take a chance.  I'm just going to get somebody else's phone.  I hear pretty good things about the Pixel or the LG V20 or some other phone and just say, why take a chance?

Start time: 3852.28
End time: 3928.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, we I have one from Verizon.  That was the only way I can get one in time.  I'll be honest with you.  If I had handed you an iPhone 7 plus and the new Pixel XL, same exact size phones and you held them both, you would say, well, the iPhone is clearly a better physically a better phone.  I agree with you, Steve, that in other respects, the Pixel might be better.  I think the camera might be better than the iPhone cameras.  A very good camera.  But what it misses and I kind of missed was this the two lens thing.  The ability to take a telephoto or a somewhat more zoomed in picture is really I wind up using that.  So I use it a lot.  Yeah.  And when I missed it in the Pixel now where I will agree with you 100 percent Google Assistant on the Pixel is remarkable.  It is.  It's great.  Siri isn't even close.  Cortana isn't even close.  Echo isn't even close.  It is Google leapfrogging the other guys.  And this could end up being a real advantage.  And it's not available on Samsung.  It's not as available on any other Android phone except the Google Pixel.  So this is Google's timing is perfect.  I don't think Google planned it, but the timing is perfect to say we're going to make a phone that's better than the OEM Android phones.

Transcript:  And I think David hinted at something, though.  They're not going to outsell Samsung or Apple anytime soon.  It's going to be they can't reach that scale yet.  They don't have the distribution.  They're not in care.  People still go to AT&T and T-Mobile and they go to their wireless carrier to buy these things and they're just not available there except for Verizon.  So it's you know, it's going to take another year or two before they can really reach that distribution point.  And I mean, you can't even buy it now.  It's just totally out of stock.  Yeah.

Start time: 3958.31
End time: 3971.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why?  Well, why do you think that they are even making this to begin with?  They've gone along for so long just having Android and being fine with other people making phones on their platform.  Why do you think they decided now that they need to own the entire phone?

Start time: 3972.84

End time: 4031.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, man, I hope I don't blow up your theory or something.  My theory is this is and I've talked to people about this there.  This is the way they can see the only way they see to push Android forward.  They're really into this whole assistant thing.  Because of the fragmentation problem, they are actually upset.  Security issues like the stage fright thing last year.  And they're upset that, you know, there was that list being floated around to their OEM partners saying,  here are the worst offenders of who can't update their devices on time.  And this is how they feel like they can help solve that problem.  I'm skeptical whether or not it will work that way.  The result is you get an awesome phone, but will it fix the major damage that's happened to the Android ecosystem over the last seven years or so?  Probably not, or at least not anytime soon.

Start time: 4031.84
End time: 4105.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What it really does is emphasize the two tier aspect of Android.  Most Android phones, more than half, are cheap phones sold around the world.  I mean, really cheap phones from Blue.  And, you know, just I mean, we think of the ZTE or the Honor 8 from Huawei as cheap phones, not a $400 phone.  I'm talking $100, $50, a $0 phone.  That's most Android by far.  Then there's a second tier, which is higher end and high end Android.  I agree with you, Steve, that in the short term, that's Google's goal is to kind of make Android a cleaner, better platform.  But I think in the long run, it doesn't really have much to do with Android.  My theory is that really this is a new Google.  This is a whole new way of looking at things.  And Sundar Pichai really hinted at this at the event when he talked about Google Assistant everywhere.  That really the product here is not the phone or the home or the hub or the routers.  The product is Google Assistant everywhere.  And I think that's really where they see the big growth being as and where they have a huge advantage, right, is the Assistant.

And then we'll get a little bit of a kickback when you do buy it.

Start time: 4191.00
End time: 4241.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I always thought it was Siri.  But anyway, the point is it links together multiple requests into one.  So I need to buy flowers on my way home from Bob's house.  Right.  Or I need a flight on Thursday, extra leg room, leaving after 8.30.  And then a three leg.  I mean, you can make these long requests.  I need to stop and pick up a bottle of wine around 20 bucks on my way home from work as I go to my dinner party.  And it will know about your calendar.  It will know about your work.  It will know about your wine taste.  And it will put all that together.  And the way they're going to make money is because where you haven't specified, I need a flight Thursday, blah, blah, blah.  Then the airline or the florist or the wine store will have paid a premium to be the one they recommend.  Exactly.

Transcript:  No, but I don't think they care so much about that.  I think ultimately, I think you're right.  They need to clean up Android.  I think that may be a lost cause because they're never going to.  The cheap phones are not going to be cleaned up.  So that means more than half the Android phones out there will always be security flaws.

Transcript:  Well, I wrote that.  I mean, and I'm the only one who's written this.  A number of people have kind of written different versions of this.  But the fact that Google is some of their moonshots are kind of falling back down to Earth and they're putting a lot of pressure on them to actually make money.  And it's causing everybody to sort of question the whole entire thesis behind the moonshots.  But they assured me that the moons there, they're very much still moonshotting and that they're not second guessing their their crazy innovation factory.  It is full, full throttle innovation, just maybe a little bit smarter and less.  They're not burning money.  But Ruth Porat is not shutting the whole thing down, as a lot of people have speculated.

End time: 4413.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And so a couple of like sort of high profile.  I mean, actually, if you look back there, I was looking at this recently.  There was a Bloomberg, a big profile in Bloomberg, maybe like two years ago, kind of introducing the moonshot factory and talking about all the crazy things.  And like there may be 12 execs that were that were interviewed.  It was kind of introducing all of these people that are that are really in charge of it.  And I think I counted over half of them have since left.  And these were like the people that are rolling out to show off how exciting it was.  And that was only a few years ago.  So I get that there's a lot of it's easy to get frustrated and and and leave if your thing isn't working out exactly how it is.  And in a really strange corporate environment like that.  But it did seem like a lot.  A lot of them had left.

And that is exciting as it is.  And there's so much hype around it.  That's still so far out from from being a money making endeavor.  I think that they're just trying to tamp down the hype because they realize it got way ahead of the reality.  And shareholders shouldn't be expecting to see a revenue line from self-driving cars for at least a few more years.

Transcript:  Yeah, they've killed fiber or killed or slowed down or halted fiber.  Pulled back. Yeah.  Look at Apple.  The rumor now strong and I think it probably accurate that the unannounced Apple car project is now the former unannounced Apple car project.  As many are starting to leave, some layoffs are happening.  The first crack was, oh, Apple said this was a couple of months ago.  Again, these are all rumors.  Apple's never said anything about autonomous vehicles.

Start time: 4505.02
End time: 4522.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in a way, isn't that so much smarter than doing the big cover story?  Right.  I mean, as a journalist, I want the big cover story.  But like having never acknowledged that it exists when you hear the rumors about it falling apart, at least you didn't hype it up.  And then it is that much worse when it falls apart.

Start time: 4522.18
End time: 4552.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not so different because Apple doesn't matter if Apple says anything.  It gets hyped up by all the Apple press that wants Project Titan to be, they've hired a thousand people.  There's clanking sounds coming out of a building in Sunnyvale.  It's you know, I mean, Apple's kind of there's nothing they could do to not get it hyped up.  Anyway, I always wondered what kind of business that was going to be for Apple, whether that really was Apple's looking for another.  I can't call it the second act.  Apple's had about eight acts, but whatever its next act anyway.

Start time: 4553.78
End time: 4569.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I have to say we're touching on something that's been bugging me lately.  I mean, it's this this Apple rumor story that the press loves a rumor because that's a story.  And then when it turns out not to be true, that's a story like what you made it up in the first week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't get more mileage out of a story because it didn't turn out to be true.  That doesn't work.  And like on the car thing, I mean, yes, they fired or lost five hundred out of a thousand people working on it.  But what you don't understand is that Apple, like Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Amazon, all of them is always working on new projects that they haven't announced always.  I mean, we know that the iPad was actually supposed to be the first product before the iPhone.  Right. But it's just it took a longer, longer time to percolate and get out there.  So all these companies are always working on all kinds of experimental projects.  You don't know which one's going to become real until you work on it and see if it's viable.  So the twisting of the story into, you know, oh, Apple's failing now.  It doesn't quite hold water. Yeah, but it's fun.

Start time: 4624.40
End time: 4635.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, that's I get the experimenting thing, but a thousand people, that's a huge investment that like, I mean, why don't shareholders know about that?  Well, they couldn't get it.

Transcript:  They wanted to keep it quiet, but they clearly thought there was an opportunity there and a massive opportunity.  They're investing billions in this thing.  There are indeed spending has just been increasing several orders of magnitude over the last couple of years.  And a lot of people think the car was sucking up a lot of that spending.  So, I mean, it is significant.  It is even though it turned out to kind of fail or failing, investors should care about that.  And people will care about that, even if it never happens.

We'll look for Pogue's Basics Money. It's the third in the series, right?  You have tech, then life, and now money.  I've got a tip for you. Here's a way to stop going to the post office.  This is actually a really good tech tip that saves you money too. It's Stamps.com.  If your business sends mail, U.S. mail, whether it's maybe you sell on Amazon or Etsy or eBay, or maybe you send out invoices or brochures, Stamps.com is a must.  It really makes this a professional fulfillment operation, and you can do everything you need to do from your desk.  You never need to go to the post office again.  It starts, of course, by buying and printing real U.S. postage whenever you need it from your computer and your printer.  You don't need special ink. You don't need a postage meter.  I see people today lined up at the post office to recharge their postage meter, and I want to say, do you have a steam-powered Stanley steamer out front, or are you still using horses?  It's like, folks, you could print postage from your computer and printer. You don't need a postage meter. You don't need to pay all that money for the ink.  With Stamps.com, it's a lot more, of course, because not only they give you a USB scale, so your postage is always correct.  You never have to put a little extra on to make sure it's not postage due.  I've seen people do this, lick five extra stamps. Don't put stamps on at all.  You can print right on the envelope on plain paper, or you can print a label that has your company logo on it.  The return address is automatically filled in.  The address of your recipient, you can take it right from the page on Amazon or eBay or Etsy or wherever you sell.  Or your address book. It works with all the major address books.  It tells you exactly what you need for postage. It'll even suggest the right class of mail, including certified mail.  It'll show you the cost for each. You can pick the one that's right.  And by the way, when you're doing a mailing, you stack it up, put it by your desk, push a button on the website, the mailman comes to you and picks it up.  You don't even have to go to the post office to drop it off.  By the way, I don't know if you know this, but since 9-11, the post office has had a regulation that if something weighs more than 16 ounces, you're supposed to bring it to the post office so they can give you the stink eye and look you over.  Not with Stamps.com. Any size package. They'll come and get it.  And we've got a really nice trial offer for you. If you go to Stamps.com and you click that microphone in the upper right hand corner that says, you heard us on the radio or podcast, and then use our offer code TWIT,  this is like pretty amazing. It's a $110 bonus offer. You get, of course, a four week trial of Stamps.com, but you also get $55 in postage coupons you can use over the first few months.  You get that digital scale worth $50. You do pay shipping and handling on that. That's about $5, but they give you a $5 kit of stuff you need with it.  And the supplies kit, I guess, is what you call it. And all of that is yours right now if you go to Stamps.com, click the microphone and use the offer code TWIT. $110 value. That's good. $55 in free postage.  You know when to do it? Do it now so you don't have to get in line at the post office while everybody's mailing their Christmas packages. Oh, you hate that time of year.  The amateurs come out. If you're a professional, if you mail for a living, if you do mailing at your business, you've got to have it. Stamps.com.  Fun week. This week we had a lot of fun, a lot of great shows.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo. Here are some of the stories we're looking forward to in the coming week. Over the next few days, there will be so many events on Wednesday, October 26th. Microsoft will hold a Windows 10 hardware and software event where we're likely to hear some surface news.  Their enigmatic invite tagline simply reads, imagine what you'll do. Then on Thursday, it's Apple's turn to finally update some Macs. Hello again, said our invitations that must have gotten lost in the mail again. Will we see new MacBook Pros with OLED touchscreens in place of function keys? Let's hope so.  In other Apple news this week, the Nike Plus branded Apple Watch comes out with that perforated band that I still can't decide if it's super cool or hideously gaudy. The watch itself is essentially the same as the series two Apple Watch, just with a few software and Nike branded swoosh tweaks.  Apple's wireless AirPods also in the cool or gaudy camp are set to come out in late October, so we might start seeing those this week as well. I know you ordered some Leo and I can't wait to see just how fast you lose them.  Also this week is the pep com holiday spectacular, which is a little bit like CES, but before the holidays and featuring stuff you might actually want to buy. We'll be there streaming all that good stuff live.  Jason Howell and I will cover all of this and a whole lot more all week on tech news today, each and every weekday at 4pm Pacific. That's a look at the week ahead. Back to you Leo.

Transcript:  Thank you Megan TNT Monday through Friday, 4pm Pacific, 7pm Eastern Time, 2300 UTC right here at twit.tv. I know what Bill Belichick will do with his Surface Pros.  Five minute ramp and he threw it. Fortunately, the NFL covers those Surface Pros in a fine rubber carrier, so it's probably intact.  And then of course the NFL brought up a bunch of other coaches like Andy Reid who said, no, no, we like our Surface Pros. How long is this Microsoft deal with the NFL for the Surface? Must be a.  We're in year three, aren't we? Yeah, and they must have spent hundreds of millions of dollars for this. Does it hurt Microsoft that Bill Belichick doesn't like it?

Transcript:  By the way, is this a Microsoft specific problem? I mean, wouldn't he be having the same problem with an iPad or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He ended up using a binder and as Paul Thurana, our Windows Weekly host said, you understand the binder has images taken with a digital camera and printed out field side with a printer and put in the binder.  So it's not exactly, you know, a low tech solution at this point. I don't know. I don't think anybody looks at Bill Belichick and says, well, if he doesn't like it, I'm certainly not buying one.

Start time: 5313.44
End time: 5319.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And for those of you, for those of us who missed the story, what was he unhappy about? What? Why did he throw his Surface?

Start time: 5320.18
End time: 5438.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the actually the problem is larger than the Surface. As you know, the NFL has a deal with Microsoft that they replaced any other tablets they might have been using with Surface Pro tablets.  I don't think even they were for a long time they were using the older Surface tablets. I don't know if they've even got to the Surface Pro 4.  It was a 400 million dollar deal in 2014. And part of the problem was that broadcasters kept calling them iPads.  Took them a while. Took them a while to get over that. And in a press conference this week after the Patriots game on Sunday, he went on for five minutes saying how horrible these tablets were.  But the problem, it turns out, is that the tablets are owned not by the Patriots or any other team, but by the NFL itself.  The Patriots IT guy had to integrate in all of these NFL owned wireless technologies like the headsets.  You know, they get paid for that too. They were Motorola for a long time. I don't know if it's Bose now or what they use.  The networks for the tablets, the networks for the press, all of this has to be integrated into the Patriots IT.  And in fact Belichick said the Patriots IT guy did a great job of handling them, but he had no power to diagnose or fix problems with the league provided equipment.  And so Belichick says, I'm not using these anymore. They never work.  And if you think about it, and this has happened in a couple of games, you're in a tight situation and suddenly this tablet stops working and you're supposed to send a play out.  That can be a problem. So he's going to use binders of plays and drawings on old fashioned paper.  By the way, we should mention Belichick has also complained that he can't set the clock in his Toyota.  So I don't think it hurts Microsoft that much, although it does make you wonder.  You know, when you're going to do product placement, you want to probably do it somewhere where you can really control how it's being used.

Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Microsoft did make a big announcement. I thought this was interesting.  I don't know if it's, you know, look at Microsoft sitting here with Cortana. They're watching Google and this amazing Google assistant.  They're watching Siri. They want to make sure you understand that they are doing their best.  They're in a paper published on Monday.  A team of researchers at Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence and Research said that for the first time ever,  their speech recognition system makes the same or fewer errors than professional transcriptionists and humans.  They reported of a word error rate of 5.9 percent. That's down almost half a percent from last month.  And that's about equal to that of people who are asked to try to transcribe the same conversation, the lowest ever recorded.  David, I know you always have used like Dragon NaturallySpeaking and stuff like that.  This is, have you tried the Pixel and the Google Insistence speech recognition? It seems to be remarkably good.

Start time: 5501.64
End time: 5548.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I haven't. But I can tell you that every year I review Dragon NaturallySpeaking,  which is the only remaining Windows speech recognition system that you can buy separately.  And every year I do the same thing. I take a random book off the shelf and I read a thousand words and then I count how many mistakes it made.  And I can tell you that if it made 5.9 percent errors, that's that's six words out of 100.  It got wrong and throw it out the window. That's that's that is not accurate.  This Dragon version, whatever they're up to now, 12 gets usually one word wrong out of a thousand.  That's really good. Yeah, no nowhere near six percent.  So I don't quite understand. Well, they're using this.

Transcript:  There's a task that's an industry standard called switchboard.  So maybe that's a challenging task. I don't know. Maybe there's noise in the background.  I don't really know the methodology for this, but I agree with you.  Six percent would be bad because in fact, I always said that Dragon NaturallySpeaking is really good.  But if it makes four mistakes out of 100 words, that's four words you have to fix.  That's right. That's a pain in the butt.  But it sounds like it's gotten really quite good. One in a thousand.

And I am I am very impressed with improvements Google's made with the Google Assistant.  It is remarkable. Even in noisy environments, it really does a good job.  Echo is pretty good, too, right? You can talk across the room to Amazon's Echo.

Transcript:  So Elon Musk, he put off the announcement was going to be on Monday.  He had it on Wednesday evening and said, from this moment forward, all Teslas that we make,  Model S's, Model X's, will have built in the hardware to do true autonomous driving.  He says the software is not there yet.  But as we improve the software, we hope to get it by the end of next year to the point where it's twice as good as a human driver.  You're twice as safe in a Tesla. What do you think?  Is anybody going to let people drive, let the Tesla drive?  You have to pretend you're letting that you're driving like.

Start time: 5685.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He really, he really doesn't care what the people think. I guess not.  The reaction to the to the autopilot fatality that he had was so callous, just like it wasn't our fault.  We don't know that they weren't using it properly. We told him not to do that.  And they did it anyways. And so it's not our fault.  And this is just another example of that. He's announcing this thing.  Who knows how it's exactly going to work or when it will really be rolled out and available.  And he doesn't really care at all that people are completely freaked out by this technology.

Transcript:  I have a Tesla and I use the autopilot all the time, but I don't think of it as self-driving.  I think of it as driver assist.

Transcript:  It's called autopilot. Yeah, it's misnamed.

Start time: 5731.00
End time: 5801.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, in some countries you keep I think was Germany said we don't want them to use that name because that implies it's self-driving.  It's not. It's assist. But this is what he's implying.  Now, this is on the order form for a new Tesla.  Full self-driving capability doubles the number of active cameras from four to eight, enabling full self-driving in almost all circumstances.  And what we believe will be a probability of safety at least twice as good as the average human driver.  Furthermore, the car will come to you. For instance, they give an example. You get to work.  All you'll need to do is get in, tell the car where to go.  If you don't say anything, by the way, the car looks at your calendar and takes you there as the assumed destination.  Or if you don't have any appointments, it'll just take you home.  So you get in the car and it just goes.  It will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets even without lane markings, manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed.  And this is my favorite part. You get to your destination.  You simply step out at the entrance. Your car will enter park seek mode and go look for a parking spot and park itself.

And what blows my mind is not the concept of self driving cars.  It's when you combine that with Uber.  I mean, if you fast forward 50 years, think of all the things that were designed to protect us that will go away.  Speed limits, driver's license, driver's ed.

Transcript:  Details of which will be taking the exact opposite tack.  Like basically every other self driving car company, be it GM partnering with Lyft and acquiring cruise automation or Google and Uber.  Also, their plan to get this into the market is to do robot taxis.  And he's basically saying that Tesla is doing the exact opposite of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also I think I mean, just sorry to belabor this, but I think it's smart to go with the taxi thing, because at least you can then control it.  Versus like you own these cars and you're in charge of keeping them up and in making sure everything works properly and everybody's happy instead of just kind of giving it to people and saying follow our rules.  And if you don't, it's your fault. And I hope people don't die.

Transcript:  This was right after the accident. I said, well, yeah, that's one great example of why Elon Musk's approach to this versus the auto industry's approach is wrong.  He's like, we'll build the technology and figure out the rest later. We don't have to care about.

Transcript:  I want to know how do you explain that? Is he is he like is he like Steve Jobs?  Is he is he a technical genius? Is he a visionary genius? And he's just gotten lucky over and over.  I mean, you're right. Every time he does something big, people say it can't be done.  You can't start a new American car company. You can't start your own private rocket company.  You know, everyone keeps saying that and he keeps doing it. So how do you guys account for that?

Start time: 6017.00
End time: 6052.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. But I mean, if you look at the scale of Tesla compared to the other big three auto players and how many cars they're making, there's a huge difference.  It's amazing what he's done so far. But I don't necessarily see like Tesla autopilot or Tesla self-driving cars changing the world at the same.  Aren't you aren't you rooting for him, though?  Yes, but I also am kind of tired of the like big announcements like in 2019, we're going to have somebody on Mars and like come 2019.  No one's going to remember this announcement. They're only going to remember how cool he was.  I agree. You need some P.T. Barnum to do what he's done.

Start time: 6054.54
End time: 6062.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6062.00
End time: 6078.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah, that's a big part of it.  But Tesla has also been late to deliver every single car that it has announced.  And so, I mean, there's just a little bit of a gulf between the reality and the announcements, which is why whenever there's a new big announcement, I'm kind of like, oh, I'll see you when it happens.

Start time: 6080.23
End time: 6091.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they are putting these the hardware in.  Now, the issue is, of course, getting the software working.  And then, you know, and one thing about a Tesla, you get updates every few weeks.  I mean, they're always updating it, tweaking it.

And so what really happens is you get you get hardheaded people like Erin, who are really absolutely right.  But then you're fighting against somebody like me, who has drunk the Kool-Aid.  And I know you're right, logically, but I want him to succeed.  His goal is nothing less than to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels.

It's always been valued as like, let's say a Facebook competitor or a traditional social network,  where it's clear it's just evolved into something totally different.  And it should be valued and operated as such.  And it's not.  I mean, they're making some moves with this live broadcasting thing.  And that's just kind of an interesting experiment, I guess.  But it's...  I mean, I think it's time for them, if they can't sell themselves,  to really ask some serious questions about what kind of product they are and how people use it.  And I mean, the core of it is there is a social aspect to it, of course, but it's a news product.  It's a media property.

Transcript:  Yeah, although my use of it is very strange because I'm sort of on a stage.  It's sort of like a...  We use it as broadcasters. Yeah.  We broadcast on Twitter. Yeah.  But I have to say, every time I hear a headline like that one, I mean, it is accessible.  The internet has become accessible.  But that problem, I feel like, is fixable.  Like, we've seen examples where companies have fixed the awfulness of the internet,  like when Amazon started requiring real names for product reviews.  Bam! Like 80% of the awfulness went away.  And like, I don't know if you guys are hung out on Slashdot, the chat for nerds.  Love Slashdot. Yeah.  They have the most effective, simple, brilliant system.  Basically, every time someone comments, everybody else gives it a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  And then you, the Slashdot visitor, have a slider.  How much of the garbage do you want to screen out of your feed?  It's brilliant.  So show me only the top 20% of things that people have rated to be meaningful discussion.  And all the garbage, you know, you're not stifling anyone's free speech.  You're just giving me the ability to say, I don't want to see it below level three.  And all that stuff gets hidden from me.  And I don't know why.  Like Twitter doesn't even have a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  I couldn't screen my stuff if I wanted to.

Transcript:  I mean, part of the problem is that Twitter has just had such an execution problem from the very beginning.  Like, if you look at this bullying problem that they had where, you know,  Leslie Jones was being targeted and she decided to quit and Twitter's like, oh, boy,  we're going to we're going to work on this and try to figure out how to filter out all these bullies.  The next day after that happened, Instagram rolled out the ability to filter out your comments based on certain emojis for Taylor Swift because she was being targeted.  Like they can just build this overnight, whereas Twitter will be like, oh, let us think about it.  I don't know.  And they're very slow to even build solutions or test them.  And that has been their problem for a very long time.  Basically, since they went public, they've had, you know, how many different heads of product, how many different people in leadership, COO, CEO, CEO changes.  And so it's it's kind of a matter of execution.

Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree that like from a like like the security problems we were talking about earlier, there's no silver bullet.  There's no obvious way to solve that.  This one, I feel like there is.  We have a minority of people, as Leo was saying, who are idiots and jerks and have problems who are making life miserable for everybody else.  But the everybody else sees that and should be able to rate and help screen them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I actually think that the whole idea that of these like self policing communities is really this like was this beautiful, lovely thing that we thought about at the beginning of the Internet.  And we found out that like, in fact, the Internet is different because we're alienated from people because there's a screen separating us from others and people who who would be normally enforcing those norms of like, no, don't be it.  Don't be a jerk.  Just don't care because they would rather be in the real world or they don't want to spend the time doing the policing and really investing in making the community great.  And so that's how we have the people who care the most, who are the angry, crazy trolls that are the loudest and able to gain the most momentum and make the biggest impact on networks like Twitter.

Start time: 6665.58
End time: 6683.94

Transcript:  But there are hundreds of thousands of times more normal people than the angry, crazy trolls.  That's what I can't understand.  And if there were a low friction button that you could click, like that's garbage, that's garbage.  And if hundreds of thousands of people did it, even if only three percent of us did it, it would screen those people out.

Transcript:  You know, I mean, there are various schools of thought, various degrees of mood about it.  But the one that I think prevails is when you look at Verizon's other acquisitions like AOL and Huffington Post and so on,  basically there was some consolidation of Salesforce and things like that.  But the content creators were basically left alone.  You know, AOL soldiers on and Huffington Post soldiers on.  And that's what I mean, it's likely they'll do with us, the writers and the creators of this stuff.  So that's my hope is that we'll be able to just keep on doing exactly what we're doing just without the incessant,  what's happening Yahoo?  It's going down the drain.

Transcript:  You know, I think that's just the way it is these days in journalism and content.  I mean, I worked in radio for 40 years as radios.  That's, you know, everybody's been through that.  If you work in radio for a length of time, having the station change format or sell most likely is universal.  Well, I'm we'll talk about this.  That'll be our wrap up story in just a second.  But first, a word from our friends at GoToMeeting, the best way to have.  Why do a phone conference?  Have a meeting.  Have a meeting.  You know, nowadays clients and colleagues are all over the world.  Perspective clients.  You're doing a pitch.  That person could be halfway across the country.  Could be in another continent.  With GoToMeeting, though, it's just like your meeting in person.  You start the meeting with GoToMeeting.  It could be just a simple phone conference call, basically, or seem to appear that way.  And it's very easy to do that, too, by the way.  You send an email.  They generate them automatically.  Your client, even if they've never used GoToMeeting, they click the link.  The software is installed almost instantly.  You're talking together.  Then you say, well, I would love to show you my PowerPoint presentation.  And you share your screen.  Now they're seeing what you're seeing.  You can circle stuff, show them stuff.  You can pass off control.  So if you have a colleague in another place and they have part of that presentation to give you, you can pass off control.  If you're working together, you can collaborate on documents.  My favorite part, though, is then turn on the camera and you're going to get crystal clear HD video coming right from your web console.  It's coming right from your webcam.  And now it really is a face-to-face meeting.  It's really remarkable.  The body language, the expressions, you are truly communicating.  Whether it's a sales demo, a presentation, collaboration, maybe just an ad hoc meeting.  I know there are teams separated geographically that keep GoToMeeting running all day.  Every meeting counts.  And by the way, if you ask GoToMeeting customers, nine out of 10 say they close deals more than 20% faster.  That makes a big difference because you're in effect meeting face-to-face without any of the expense or annoyance of travel.  GoToMeeting.  Don't phone it in.  Use GoToMeeting.

Down in Hollister, Larry Page's flying car has been seen, spotted.  Oh my God.  A mysterious aircraft in Hollister.  It has apparently, I'll turn off this bad music.  It has apparently a distinctive sound as you see it flying above you, strikingly different from the roar of a typical plane.  It sounded like, according to one person who saw it, an electric motor running, just a high-pitched whine hovering 20, 25 feet off the ground.  It's apparently a flying car from a company called Z.Arrow funded by Larry Page.  So forget self-driving cars.  Larry's segueing right to the next big thing.

But it seems to me this is the kind of thing a company does when it says our current business  is going to falter.  And look at Comcast, look at Verizon, look at AT&T.  All of them are pipe businesses, right?  They're delivery businesses.  And they're all getting into content.  Comcast buys NBC Universal, Verizon buys you and everybody else.  Is it mistaken?  A number of people are saying, oh, this is as bad as AOL Time Warner.  This is going to be a horrific nightmare.  Kara Swisher's article was hysterical.  I missed that.

Transcript:  A merger this big, how could you possibly integrate it in any way that is successful?  I think there's lots of data out there that says more than half of all mergers over a  billion dollars fail.  This is so big that there's going to be some major problems with it.  But at the same time, it's smart because Time Warner was going to sell.  I think everybody kind of has known that for a long time.  So it's a matter of whose hands it ends up in.  And AT&T kind of makes the most sense.  They don't want Verizon to get it.  They don't really want another larger competitor to get it.  So why not do that?  Steve, you said you were doing this story late last night because they were rushing it.

Start time: 7299.02
End time: 7304.22

Start time: 7305.04
End time: 7336.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the going theory.  And I think someone confirmed that.  They were asked about this on the conference call last night and they kind of dodged the  question.  But I think someone like right before we jumped on this podcast, someone confirmed that.  But yeah, it came out Thursday that there had at least been talks.  And it turns out those talks started in August.  They talked about that yesterday.  And then as soon as the news busted open, those talks accelerated so quickly that they  hammered the deal together.  And by Saturday night, they had it ready to go.  That's unusual.

Start time: 7337.58
End time: 7339.98

Transcript:  I don't cover business, but that seems very fast for such a big deal.

Start time: 7340.18
End time: 7372.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It happened fast.  I mean, I think the two CEOs met for the first time in August.  And here we are, third week of October, end of October.  And it's a done deal.  That's very fast for something like this, I feel like.  And it was just accelerated because Apple was sniffing around way back in May.  There are likely others sniffing around or they don't want anyone else sniffing around rather.  Right.  So that's why it came out at such an odd time.

Start time: 7372.58
End time: 7394.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it happened fast, though, because Time Warner has been wanting to sell or entertaining the idea of the deal all year.  It's not like a lot of deals take a long time to come together because the target company has to kind of become OK.  The CEO has to become OK with the idea of giving up control and selling the company.  But Bukas has been wanting to do it for a long time.

Start time: 7395.14

I'm 53 and this is the first time I've ever had benefits and a business card.  Well, it's about time, Mr. Pogue.  I know.  And apparently that business card is about to change.  But the thing I don't even get about companies is like, what is a company?  We're talking about all these people leaving Google and leaving Apple and then they go to Facebook and then Facebook people go to Yahoo and then Yahoo people leave and they go to Google and they come back to Facebook.  And like, what is a company if all the people have changed?  Is it still that company?  You know what I mean?

Transcript:  What is a company?  So many moons ago, the motion picture creators and movie companies owned the theaters.  In the 40s, big antitrust regulation split them up because it was felt and I can't disagree that the creators of content should not own the distribution of content that that should be kept separate for competition reasons.  This this Sherman Antitrust Act was used to split the cartel in effect.  Seems to me this is very similar.  But of course, times have changed a lot since the 40s.  And I could see the advantage if you're AOL.  I mean, I could see the advantage of going to a distribution company as a content company.  But I see from the point of view of consumers, the disadvantage because let's say as an example, AT&T decides well from now on HBO is only available on U-verse.  Or from now on when CNN does a story on AT&T.  I mean, there's all sorts of issues.  I think that there are regulatory issues, but I doubt very much in this current political climate we're going to see anything happen.  Well, anyway, we'll watch the story.  I think you're right.  I don't know what there is to say or even why this happens.  Some say it's ego on the part of AT&T.  Comcast has theirs.  Verizon has theirs.  We want ours.  Last story.  A couple of a couple of obituaries.  Leo Baranek of Bolt, Baranek and Newman, one of the first the company that really created the Internet at the request of the Defense Department, BBN, passed away.  One hundred and two years old.  He was an acoustic engineer, but ended up working on the first Internet in the 60s.  And then one of our peers, maybe he's peerless, David Bennell passed away also this week at a very sadly very young age.  He was perhaps the guy who created our business, the founder of not just PC Magazine, but PC World, which I always thought, you know, I've always thought IDG and Ziff Davis were at each other's throats.  But he created magazines for both and Mac World.  Did you know David Bennell?

Transcript:  All of us, I think, owe something to him.  Harry McCracken wrote a very nice piece about him in Fast Company.  I highly recommend it if you want to know more about David Bennell.  I did not know him.  I did not know him.  But of course, everybody I know either worked for him or knew him or something.  David Bennell passed away on Tuesday at the age of 69.  And that on that high note, because we've had such an exciting, happy show.  Geez, Louise.  We're going to wrap this thing up.  It's very nice.

I keep getting notices saying register to vote, register to vote.  Of course, I've registered to have been registered to vote since I was 20.  But register to vote.  And and I just got one that said, this is it.  Our last message to you.  You don't register tomorrow.  You can't vote.  It's like, thank you.  Your last message.  Thank you.  But I guess it's probably a message for some of our viewers.  If you haven't registered to vote.

Transcript:  That's the power of Facebook.  And actually, I think that's pretty cool.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  It does worry you with Google and Facebook could, of course, I guess, you know, it's really cool when they do things that you like.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe there you go.  But that's at least very nonpartisan.  It doesn't say who to vote for.  It says register to vote.  You don't get to complain if you don't vote.  So, yeah, good for them for doing that.  We can argue on and on about other influences that Facebook has on our culture.  But look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  It's remarkable.
