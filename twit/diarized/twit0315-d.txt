Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah well thanks very much for joining us and we'll see you next time.  This was a you know August. I usually think of August as a slow week for news.  A slow month for news but this was not a slow week. No this was absolutely not. Any memes.  Absolutely not. A couple of things. Let's start with the Monday.  We'll work our way through. Yeah practically. Big shock. Really before even the market opened on  Monday Larry Page announced that Google had spent 12 and a half billion dollars  and purchased Motorola Mobility. That's correct. Shock for anybody here. Shock

Start time: 236.44
End time: 254.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for me. Did you expect that Peter? Yeah I mean I was surprised. It's a big deal  because they're buying a hardware company. Right. Even if they bought it for  the patents or whatever reason. I mean the fact that Google which has always  been about software and services would you know get so directly into the  hardware business is a really big move. It's a big change for how Google thinks

Start time: 254.96
End time: 271.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  about itself as a company. Some people posited that perhaps there's a message  Microsoft partnering with Nokia. Apple owns their hardware business that maybe  if you want to make it in smartphones you need to have a hardware partner or  be in the hardware business. That doesn't seem... Do you think that's true? And not

Start time: 271.64
End time: 307.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for Android. Android's advantage is so many manufacturers. Well I mean there's an argument to be made right?  Though the counter argument is that it didn't work very well for Palm and then  HP. We'll get to that in a moment. But I think you know... Remember that was Thursday. Spoiler alert.  That was Thursday. They didn't know on Monday. Or did they? Yeah I mean it is you know it's about a battle of  ecosystems right and it's about a battle of who can create you know the best  experience and creating a great experience really means you have to not  just create good hardware or great software you have to really integrate  those two things together in a way that consumers are going to you know have an

Start time: 307.62
End time: 316.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  amazing problem-free experience most of the time. It's a risk though to Google isn't it?  That Samsung and LG and all these people will get pissed off. I mean what

Start time: 316.84
End time: 352.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know what Apple does is hardware software but at the end of the day  they're a hardware company. And they'll say that. And at the end of the day  Google is an advertising company. Not even a software company. And you can see that from Android.  I mean Android is it's although it is the number one mobile service right now  it's it's a mess you know it's they're doing what Windows did a decade ago and  I think that that it's going to be really really difficult for them to take  over Motorola and integrate it and create great products in the next few  years without you know shooting themselves in the foot at the same time.  It was about patents wasn't it Paul? Really ultimately? Yeah in fact I expect

Start time: 352.96
End time: 359.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them to get rid of the hardware a bit eventually. They don't need it and it  actually hurts their relationships with their partners. Right absolutely. Google

Start time: 359.44
End time: 366.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  had about a thousand patents going into this. They missed out on the notel  patents. Apple and Microsoft made an unholy alliance to swoop those. Cabal.

Start time: 370.44
End time: 386.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On the hardware side I do hope that they bring back the Skypager because it's  just a great device. You're kidding me. And a StarTac phone. And I think those were two  excellently executed devices that really saved the world. You're subtly making the

Start time: 386.76
End time: 390.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  point that Motorola Mobility hasn't really been on cutting edge for a while.

Start time: 390.82
End time: 423.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't mean to diss Motorola but I do think that those devices were actually  really cool. I love the StarTac. In terms of the patent thing I mean I joked earlier this week  like I didn't how many tech writers got into this business to write about patent  law. Right and suddenly we are. And it's just it's really like I'm not even a  full-fledged tech writer. I'm an enthusiast and I love to talk about this  stuff. But patents know these guys should just fight. They should go out in the  middle of a desert with like a sword. Some kind of broadsword or scythe or  something and just have it out. And Larry Page and Steve Ballmer go at each other's  throats and whoever wins gets the thing that they're fighting over. If it is

Start time: 424.28
End time: 428.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about patents. I wouldn't want to go up against that guy in a desert. He'd be crazy. He's a berserker mode.

Start time: 429.82
End time: 454.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's a big guy. But is he quick? You know scythe alone. I feel like Larry Page is a little squirreling.  He's all on Larry Page and he'd just sit there and suffocate. So in a battle this is what I wanted to bring our discussion to.  I won. We're not talking about patents. We're talking about physical combat. You did win. I like the sword thing. You forgot to mention Razer.  I did. I did forget to mention Razer. The sword and the Razer? No the Razer. The device. Foundable Razer.

Start time: 455.86
End time: 459.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a great phone too. Classic. I mean when they put Android on that it's going to be epic.

Start time: 461.28
End time: 466.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It will be 2.2. It's about patents. It's about mutually assured destruction. It's about having now what 12,000 patents to counter anybody who wants to come off.

Start time: 471.40
End time: 479.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's just about patents. I don't think it's just about patents. I think it's also about them being really concerned about Android's long term prospects.

Start time: 479.28
End time: 492.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well there weren't many if you get sued to death right? And you know Apple's going after Samsung saying you can't sell products in the US because it's running.  Because you're copying our phones. And I think that's preliminary suing Google or maybe they'll just sue everybody around Google.

Start time: 492.28
End time: 510.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to sue everyone around. I think the frustrating thing is that Google missed a really big opportunity with the whole Nortel thing to kind of come out and say look this patent system is fundamentally broken.  We're only playing this game because we have to and we're going to start putting our efforts into lobbying Congress to change and reform the patent system.

Start time: 510.64
End time: 520.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what came to my mind is there's $12.5 billion just basically thrown away that could have been used for all sorts of innovation because you had to defend yourself against patent lawsuits.

Start time: 520.28
End time: 521.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or buying every member of Congress.

Start time: 521.28
End time: 523.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How much could they be worth? Like $1,000 each?

Start time: 524.58
End time: 532.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well there's 538 of them and then you divide them. Yeah give each of them half a billion.  That should cover.  That should cover.  A couple of years of service.

Start time: 533.00
End time: 557.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem that we, this is a much much bigger problem that the patent law just doesn't cover.  Like software and you know I mean the patents for the ones that exist if I slide my finger across my phone to unlock it.  Like that should be really given a patent. I mean come on.  There are thousands of these things that exist for just the most esoteric little things on a mobile device and I don't think the patent office is any concept of what the hell is going on right now.

Start time: 557.59
End time: 560.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can we patent walking?  I'm sure somebody's tried.  Remember someone patented Toast? Did they?

Start time: 561.28
End time: 565.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah a couple years ago.  A couple years ago?  Yeah. Does that mean I have to send them?

Start time: 565.96
End time: 570.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What patent examiner would look at a patent application for Toast and approve it?

Start time: 570.64
End time: 575.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you know what they do is they just look to see if it's there already and if it isn't.  Nobody's done Toast before.

Start time: 576.23
End time: 577.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why? This is brilliant.

Start time: 577.28
End time: 580.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a patent.  No.  What's your patent?

Start time: 580.42
End time: 582.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My patent is.  So you're part of the problem.  Yeah.

Start time: 583.28
End time: 585.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nick Bilton of the New York Times.  We knew that already.

Start time: 585.36
End time: 598.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on now.  Thanks guys.  I have a patent for if you have an RFID on your phone and an RFID on your computer that  when they connect that they can communicate with each other and send information back.

Start time: 598.30
End time: 612.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now did you, to do this patent, just merely have a concept and patent it or did you have  a prototype?  Built a prototype.  See that's what it used to be.  You'd have to build something and show the process at work and that is a much better  way I think of making patents work.

Start time: 612.72
End time: 632.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah we did it with the New York Times so we built it.  As an experiment?  Well I used to work in the research labs and we prototyped all this stuff and so we had  this idea of content following you around.  So like let's say you're reading an article on your laptop and you don't finish it and  you pick up your phone and walk away.  Love that idea.  The RFID chip would say hey you left.  Send him the rest of the article on his phone.

Start time: 632.28
End time: 668.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way that is one thing that Motorola did have not only patents in but also some  products is NFC, near field communications.  Yes.  And that's something Google's very interested in promoting.  So that might be some value.  Absolutely.  And they make boxes also.  They're one of two big set-top boxes.  Paul and I talked about this on Windows Weekly.  We love Motorola.  We love them.  Terrible.  This stuff is crap.  Oh sorry.  Only made worse by Scientific Atlanta right?  Yeah.  The bar is very low.  The bar is low.  The bar is very low.  Yeah.  There doesn't seem like any way that they could put Google TV into these boxes.  What's Google TV?  $300 later he explained.

Start time: 671.62
End time: 690.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the problem is that when it comes to set-top boxes it's not a consumer device.  The people that are buying these are the cable companies.  The cable companies buy them.  Yeah.  And so if you're doing something the cable companies don't like, if you put some software  on that they're not happy about, they're just going to not buy them.  Such as Google TV.  They'll kill you.  Right.  The last thing they want is for Google TV to get in between them and their relationship  with their advertisers.

Start time: 691.28
End time: 693.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the first thing we want of course but it's the last thing they want.

Start time: 708.77
End time: 714.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  I'm going to look at my touchpad and tell you that it was time to take a break and talk  about GoToMeeting with HD Faces.  GoToMeeting, of course, we've talked about many times before, it's the video conference,  or the group online conferencing solution.  I just gave it all away.  I just, spoiler alert, it's now got video.  And it is so incredible.  GoToMeeting is the first GoToMeeting for all of our meetings because it's just the  easiest way to start a meeting.  If you want to share your screen with a client or a customer, it's so simple.  And now they've got this incredible quality video right across the top of the screen.  It just looks fantastic.  I want you to give it a try.  If you've never used GoToMeeting, this is a great chance to use it for free for 30 days.  Visit gotomeeting.com and click the Try It Free button.  Go to where, Leo?  Go to meeting.com.  Look at that.  Look at, see, there's the guy.  He's having a meeting.  And you can see his face, and you can see the screen.  Now you can get up to six people in here.  That looks like you, Nick.  And they've got six people in here.  And then if you've got a webcam, it is the most beautiful crystal clear high def video.  They've really done a great job.  And it's a web app?  Yeah.  Java.  Takes about 30 seconds.  Mac or PC, completely cross platform.  If you're starting a meeting, your client doesn't have to have it pre-installed.  They just click a link, and they're in the meeting about 30 seconds later, including the video.  For product reviews, sales presentations, training, status meetings, it's just really great.  If it's like Google, hang on.  It's steroids, plus the screen sharing and everything.  Try it free.  Go to meeting.com.  Not slash.  Click the Try It Free button.  See that orange button, the Try It Free button, and use the offer code TWIT.  Online meetings made easy and now visual with HD faces.  Folks at Citrix, go to meeting.com.  Offer code TWIT.  Ed Iacobucci just poked me on Facebook, by the way.  I didn't raise it.  You know who that is?  He's a guy who started Citrix.  He was on IBM's OS2 team and was in the trade, the player trade.  He went over and worked on NT.  And then you remember Microsoft sent people over to work on OS2.  And basically, he wrote the kernel for NT and used that knowledge then to create Citrix.

Which, well, I won't name to put $25 brand in.  And on the recent funding they got it would have netted $3.5 million, but I couldn't do  it because...

End time: 1124.91

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just the...  But, you know, TechCrunch really is a blog about startups, and for him to have money  in startups, it just seems to me a little bit odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no.  We don't have to go anywhere.  Well, we should move on to Ashton Kutcher.  Bam.  Because that's a perfect example of this.  Would he invest in a movie studio?  So Mr. Ashton Kutcher, have you guys heard of him?  He was on Three and a Half Men.  He's now...  He's taking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 1163.44
End time: 1184.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very close.  So he's invested in a ton of startups, and he was invited to be the guest editor for  Details Magazine for a special section about technology companies.  And in doing so, he wrote about his favorite technology companies and didn't disclose that  he was an investor.  He didn't say, my favorite investments.  He said, my favorite tech companies.  Yeah.

Start time: 1185.38
End time: 1192.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I guess the only thing I'd say about that is he's already rich and is not a journalist,  and this was probably just stupidity.

Transcript:  FTC says they're not going to investigate.

Start time: 1194.42
End time: 1224.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the FTC first said that it's something that they would investigate.  The FTC there.  FTC.  FTC.  So there's two things that he could have had problems with.  One is the FTC, because there's strict rules about advertisements versus journalism and  also disclosure.  Right.  And then the FTC, because these are multi-billion dollar companies he's invested in, if any  of them are to go public or if any of them are being traded on the secondary market,  it's against the law.  Right.  And this is an area called a quiet period.  Yeah.  So if he was aware of that, then he could be in jail.  Is he going to jail?

Start time: 1224.28
End time: 1233.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I gotta say, though.  No, he's fine.  This is not, look, he's on the cover of details, movie star guy.  He's an idiot.  It's a puff.  I'm sure the articles have puffed these.  No, but it's like the insanity defense for celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.

Start time: 1235.28
End time: 1248.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, but also, the reason I bring it up in relation to Arrington is because there are  a lot of these situations now where people have millions of followers on Twitter and they're  tweeting about things they've invested in or they're a spokesperson for or whatever and  not disclosing that, and I think it's blurring a lot of these minds.

Start time: 1248.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can tell you're judging by the way you've dressed today.  Reiterate the description.  Details magazine is obviously a magazine that deals in details of various sorts.  Fashion.  It's fashion.

Start time: 1275.85
End time: 1281.39

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it seems a little shady to not do that.  I agree.

Start time: 1315.28
End time: 1329.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They didn't investigate, so they obviously felt that he was a...  It's incestuous is what it is.  Yeah.  And I guess that's Mike's point is that everybody's doing it.  The real key is that it be disclosed so you can make your judgments based on that.  And I think that that's not completely untrue.

Start time: 1329.38
End time: 1346.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think the other thing is that eventually someone is going to get investigated.  And this I know from people I've spoken to at the FCC that this is a very blurry line right now.  And somebody is going to do something that is going to get enough coverage and it'll end up being...  You think it'll be like a financial news type investment?

They could have easily gone straight to the 4, but they didn't because they knew they  were still going to sell X number phones.  And by the way, they're going to do exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that they may offer a 4GS, but I think they're going to offer the 5 also.  This is not anything I know.  This is just ...  Because they have to ... the way Apple works is they iterate very slowly when they own  a market because they don't have to ...

Blackberry is stumbling right now.  Stumbling is one way to put it.  Yeah, a charitable way to put it.  Falling down the stairs would be another one.

Transcript:  crashing in on them.  And a fire.  What's really happening is ...  And a windstorm.  Right.  It's on Mars.  I'm just kidding.  Sorry, Nick.  No, but I think it's really important because what's happening is that Apple is now in the  place with the iPad that they were with the iPhone four years ago when it launched.  And they will iterate slowly because they don't have to worry about getting ... There's  literally nobody else with no competition.

Start time: 2050.38
End time: 2054.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, like an iPad 3 could have come out this year if some competition had shown up  but it did not, so why bother?

Start time: 2055.36
End time: 2070.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so maybe the iPad 3 will have a retina display and maybe the iPad 4 will have an  X chip in there and so on.  But I think that if there were a competitor in that place that we would see that happen  much more quickly.  And we've seen it happen.  Apple's product cycle has completely changed.

Start time: 2071.22
End time: 2082.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't sell a new phone when they normally do.  And then they sell 20 million of the old phone in the most recent quarter.  Why bother iterating this thing once a year, stretch it out to 18 months.

Start time: 2082.30
End time: 2100.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think in many ways that's the secret of their success, right, is that they can  milk this.  That they're responsive to the actual market.  I think that one of the negatives on Android, the thing that scares real people is so much  iteration so fast, so much new hardware.  And they say, well, God, I don't know what to choose.  That's chaotic.  Apple is not chaotic.

Start time: 2107.34
End time: 2125.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's inherent in the way in the Android model because Android is free and open source  so anybody can make an Android handset.  No one can really control that.  I mean, Google, I guess, could exert some control since you need the Google apps.  I guess at some point Google could say to manufacturers, no, stop.  But I can't see that happening.  It's really not the way that's built.

Start time: 2126.24
End time: 2140.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we also have to keep in mind that the average person buys a phone because they  walk into a Sprint store.  Every few years.  Every couple of years.  And they just buy whatever's new.  They're not paying attention to whether a new version of this phone might come out in  three months or six months.

Start time: 2140.98
End time: 2147.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2147.86
End time: 2156.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think for the average person, they're not paying close enough attention to this.  They buy whatever the best phone is that day.  We care a lot, but they're just going to buy whatever is the best phone for the price for  them.

Transcript:  Can you actually buy it?  There's a lot of things going on there.  Can't you walk in the store and say, I want a Windows Phone?  You can, but then they try to talk you out of it.  Yeah, I think the carriers are actually not pushing it.  I think that's actually the biggest thing hurting it right now.

Start time: 2174.06
End time: 2177.96

Start time: 2178.06
End time: 2181.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2182.22

Transcript:  And you ask the guy at the counter, I need a new phone, and he says, here.

Start time: 2185.34
End time: 2196.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With the exception of AT&T, none of the other carriers in the US have more than a phone,  a single Windows Phone.  So you might have an iPhone, you will have one Windows Phone, and then you'll have seven  Android phones.  So that's the choice.

Start time: 2196.66
End time: 2213.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the real truth is nobody got fired for selling iPhone.  So if you're at Verizon or AT&T, nine times out of ten, that's the phone the guy's going  to push across the counter, right?  He's not going to say...  I mean, I'm tempted to say, oh, well, you might want to look at an Android, but he's  not because that's too risky.

Start time: 2213.40
End time: 2225.24

Well, push the iPhone across the table, and then what happens is you say, well, I don't  want to spend $200, and they're like, well, then you can try the Android phone.  It's $50.  Right.  Then they have to stay on.  And not get into the conversation.

There's going to be a shakeout.  This week was the shakeout.  Things are getting...  It's probably going to be a little more shaking.  We're going to see a little more shaking out.  But I think that if Microsoft is smart and aggressive, and they're definitely going to  be aggressive, whether or not they're smart about it is always up for debate.  But this is a big opportunity for them to really push Windows phone now.  The Nokia thing is a huge win for them.  I don't even think they need necessarily to buy Nokia to get the kind of default of integration  they want.  This is their moment.  We might look back a couple of years ago, a couple of years from now, and say, well,  this is when they turned it around.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So Ryan and I were talking about this yesterday.  Right now, everyone's fallen into the trap of letting Apple define the tablet market  as being the iPad and something that competes with the iPad.  And just like Nick was saying, you have to actually look at the tablet market as, okay,  there's the iPad, but then I'm going to have my tablet device have some other spin on it  that is not necessarily competing directly with the iPad, but maybe it's a single purpose  device like a Kindle.  Or maybe it's like, I mean, if you think about the Color as a tablet, it's a hugely successful  device.  I don't know how well it sold.  I mean, I know it sold really well.  I don't know if it sold as many as the iPad, but I know it sold a lot.

Start time: 2511.38
End time: 2545.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think you look at the Asus Transformer, which is about not just being a tablet, but  being something that has really easy to dock into a keyboard.  That's a point of differentiation.  I think Windows 8 has an opportunity with the fact that it's going to have a touch-based  interface.  And I think if they do it right and make it so that you can kind of live in the tablet  experience, the fact that you'll be able to have access to all the Windows applications  and the backwards compatibility, that might be a point of differentiation.  But ultimately, it's not for us to figure that stuff out.  It's for the people who are trying to get people to buy something.  If you can't figure it out, you shouldn't be in the business.

Transcript:  I think that there's a massive opportunity in creating tablets that are used in the workplace.  The iPad does not do that very well.  Corporate-friendly tablets.  Vertical applications.  Medical education.  What the iPad does really well is entertainment.  But I think that what Amazon could do with their device is really simplify that so it's  content.  It's not just gaming and things like that, but it's Amazon videos, Amazon music, Amazon  books, Amazon magazines, and make a device that costs nothing.  I keep wondering why Amazon is still charging for the Kindle.

Transcript:  The other thing with the Amazon tablet is when they purchased TouchCo, the company out  in New York for the Touch interface.  TouchCo uses these resistant technologies where you can actually, it can detect a hand  so you can use a pen.  Or it can detect your finger.  So you can use both.

Start time: 2635.28
End time: 2659.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can use both.  And that is what vertical markets want.  Exactly.  That's what a doctor wants.  Especially in a medical field.  I mean, Apple's really going after the patients.  So you give credence to the idea that HP isn't killing the hardware or isn't killing the  software.  They're killing the hardware and that they may license WebOS.  But they just killed it.  And you may have been the smartest guy ever because you may have actually bought a $99  tablet with some future.  I doubt it.  No, that doesn't sound right.  I'm pretty smart.

Transcript:  So I have a question for you, Peter.  One of the things that I started to see, and I don't know if you guys discussed this last week,  but an example is the Amazon Web interface for the iPad for Kindle.  What is it called again?  Cloud Reader.  So the more of those that exist, the more you don't necessarily need to buy an iPad  because these apps exist in the cloud.  Anything that can do HTML5.  So how can Apple usurp this from happening?  Can they?  I'm not sure they can really stop it.

Start time: 2762.96
End time: 2777.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They in a way got screwed by their own initial rhetoric for the iPhone,  which is we're not going to make apps, you just use web apps.  And now they wish that people wouldn't make web apps  because apps are where they make all their money, especially in-app purchases.  I think the trick is they have to keep improving the hardware

Start time: 2778.60
End time: 2785.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and having things that apps can do that web-based apps can't do  because there are some hooks into the hardware in some way.

Start time: 2785.60
End time: 2796.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think the more of these things that exist,  the more of these HTML5 web apps that exist,  the less there is the reason to go and purchase the iPad  as these devices get better and there's more competition out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's really cool is you don't have to download the book first.  You just click it and it downloads that page.  But you can't.  And then it will cache the page and eventually cache the whole book.  And on the iPad it has up to 50 megabytes. That's the negative, by the way.  Apple has constrained any app to have no more than 50 megabytes of data.  Or offline storage.  Yeah.  For books it's fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess 50 megs is quite a few books. That's 50 books.  Let's use crazy fonts.  Let's all use crazy fonts.  I bet Veratunde's book will have crazy fonts.  What are you reading?  Is he going to get in there?  Yeah, you know, Java, Beginner's Guide.

But first I want to talk about Squarespace.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  I want you to go to squarespace.com.  We had so much fun the other day.

Transcript:  No, I follow you, Nick. I'm not logged in.  So what were you saying?  So this tweet.  I definitely, in the 96%, RT, atbrook, great headline.  Hashtags, like, let's go.  So more and more, this seems like gibberish to me.  Oh, completely.  As I use Google+.

Start time: 3324.60

Start time: 3329.68
End time: 3334.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because what you do is you write what you want to write,  and then your 17 characters are over.  And then you cut everything out.  And then you start cutting.

Start time: 3341.88
End time: 3345.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And not just because they take away from the characters you need to write.  Exactly. It's just weird.

Start time: 3346.78
End time: 3370.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think of hashtags as a... especially as implemented on Twitter,  and as I presume... oh, I'm not following you. I'm sorry.  They're like C++ templates for the real world.  As I presume that Google+, would implement it, is as a pre-done search.  Correct.  So when you click on a hashtag, you do a search for that content.  And I think that that... as far as I'm concerned, that works.  And it's really useful.  It binds conversation.

Start time: 3370.60
End time: 3385.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it should not count against your character count.  Oh, is that what we're saying? I'm sorry.  No, that's what I'm saying.  I'm saying on Twitter, a hashtag shouldn't count against your character count.  It's already so low.  It's got to be pithier.  Now, I know you're thinking, how could I abuse this?  But I'm just saying, you know, as a matter of policy...

Start time: 3385.88
End time: 3391.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 3409.72
End time: 3440.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so. I stopped using it and never went back.  I quit and I came back.  But you quit Facebook.  You don't use Google+.  Why is that different?  Well, because with Google+, I have a lot more control over what's shared.  I know that it's default public, so I'm really careful about what I put on there.  And also...  I'm not sure that that's the big difference.  Google+, is not default public.  No, when I'm posting stuff, I default to public, so I know that.  But also with Facebook, I don't like Facebook Connect.  I don't like the idea of...  But every site uses it.  Does GDGT use Facebook?  Can I make a segue?  Sure, we use it.

End time: 3475.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They said government offices should not have Facebook pages.  I agree.  They should strip like buttons.  I agree.  Because of the data collection policies of Facebook and the profile building that goes on when users like things.  I don't like Germany anyway.

Start time: 3481.44
End time: 3487.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The virtue of the button being there, same thing with, I presume, Facebook Connect and everything else,  is that that's a tracking cookie.  Because it shows your friends.

Transcript:  You're the last one.  South Korea has a class action suit against Apple.  27,000 plaintiffs.  This is based on that whole thing about Apple storing that information.  Ironically, Microsoft did the same thing about a month ago.  Published the information on the web and nobody noticed.

Start time: 3535.11
End time: 3535.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't notice.

Start time: 3536.26
End time: 3544.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These type of things always resolve themselves in the same way, right?  The company that's doing it becomes aware that they're doing it and then they stop.  It's the same thing every time.

Start time: 3544.64
End time: 3580.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or gets caught. That's the question.  Is it they became aware or they got caught?  I'm going to stick with my original statement.  I think in Microsoft's case, you're right.  They just became aware.  I think so.  Apple, I'm not so convinced. Google, I'm not so convinced.  I think they wanted that information.  They did. We know they wanted that information.  They said it helped.  It would help them with a new traffic application that they were doing.  There you go.  So we are hearing, speaking of Apple, that some of the rumors we've heard are untrue and some are true.  We had Kara Swisher here last week who said, no, I stand by it.  October, not September 7th for the next iPhone.  Is that what you're hearing?

Start time: 3580.98
End time: 3585.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3610.71
End time: 3614.37

End time: 3629.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do hear that the next iPad, which will not be out this year,  contrary to false rumors earlier this year.  Also not for small people?  Not for small people.  We'll have a retina display, 2048 by 1536.  That makes sense.  Well, the other thing that I have heard,

Start time: 3629.60
End time: 3635.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I don't know when this is going to happen,  but this little button right here is going to go away.  You know what?

Start time: 3635.92
End time: 3643.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was thinking the iPhone has too many buttons.  That would be a good choice.  One fewer button.  What's it going to be replaced with?

Start time: 3643.60
End time: 3651.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no point.  This is just all irrelevant.  It's eventually just going to be a screen.  They're going to make the screen larger in the next few years.  And that's why Samsung is suing them,

Start time: 3651.62
End time: 3670.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because it looks exactly like a Galaxy.  Like a jazzer.  Squish gesture.  I actually do believe that.  I believe that that's why during this lawsuit,  Samsung very clearly said,  okay, but we want to see the next iPhone,  because I do believe that in fact it will look just like the Galaxy S.  And I think Samsung thought that would be, yeah, a big screen.

Start time: 3776.60
End time: 3783.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 3808.06
End time: 3816.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even that's not enough, because Arcos has been selling Android-based tablets for much  less than Apple for a couple of years, and is not doing...  I don't think it's doing anything.

Start time: 3816.40
End time: 3823.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're doing okay, but their strategy is just to be a low-end provider.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't want to buy the tablet that hasn't CBS.  Arcos has been like that forever.

Start time: 3824.60
End time: 3830.23

Start time: 3858.12

End time: 3908.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a long time, especially when you're invested in an OS.  I wrote this story once, a couple months ago, about...  I used to work in advertising.  There was this big ad guy that said to me that selling deodorant is not about once you've  got the client, like once you already have someone buying it.  Once you buy deodorant, you stick with it for the rest of your life.  I think the same thing applies to these OSs, these mobile OSs.  Once you get into this...  You think they're sticking?

Start time: 3908.70
End time: 3915.18

Market show were able to grab like four or five percent.  I think SanDisk at one point had maybe like nine percent or something like that.  And that was by positioning themselves as basically like low-cost alternatives.  There's a risk that the foreseeable future of the tablet market, at least as Apple defines  it, right?

Start time: 3952.84
End time: 3956.48

They're beholden to the cable companies, to these MSO operators who  have the distribution and pay them a lot of money to carry their programming.  That's right.  These guys are feared that all this web consumption is eating into their set-top box consumption  and seeing as they're heavily subsidizing the creation of this content.  They want first and semi-exclusive dibs.

Not Comcast, but cable in every region.  In the deal, it said you may not put more than 10 minutes of your show on the internet.  Period.  When I did ... Look at what happens to CNN streams live, but you have to have a deal  with a cable company, otherwise you can't see it.  To get the streamer.

The business side, which they have to sustain to create this stuff, is getting really defensive  about trying to make angry the people who write big checks, which is not a great business.

It's going to take a few years.  But we see this.  We're impatient because we see where things should be.  Eventually they do get there.  You can't fight it.  But I think one of the things that the networks are teaching people is that seven-day window  or with the case of Netflix and a lot of movie studios, keeping to that 30-day window for  movies is that a lot of people don't really care about watching something in the first  week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, the producers of Breaking Bad made a lot of money on me because I'm buying  every season.  Yes.  They're making 30-year bucks a season.  That's how I consume it as well.  So I think there are revenue models.  I have to say one of the reasons this exists is because I kept saying to Tech TV, why are  you building a brick and mortar business when the future is online?  And they said because we have to.  It's a cable business.  It's a brick and mortar business.  We created this without cable deals for that very reason.  And they chose.  Maybe that's the thing is that ultimately if you're a creator, if you're a producer,  we've got to create the channel so that they can make money by selling direct instead of  selling it to a network, sell it direct to your customers.  The guy who makes Breaking Bad next time should say maybe I shouldn't do it through a network.  Maybe I should do it direct to customers.  And that's possible for a few.  Or to YouTube.  Netflix is producing content for that very reason.

Transcript:  And the other problem is that fiction is hit-driven.  And so there's a lot of shows that get made and money lost.  For every good show, there's five bad shows.  And you need deep pockets to subsidize that lottery.  And you need capitalization.

Transcript:  Yeah, but if it's priced right...  I mean, I buy stuff on iTunes all the time.  I do, too.  I mean, I buy whole seasons of stuff.  It's worth it not to see the ads.  And it's quick.  But imagine a marketing world where every showrunner has to pitch their own show.  Do you buy them when they're new, and you have to wait, or do you buy them after the fact?  I buy them after the fact.  Because there's a big difference.  If I can Netflix them, I'll wait.  Right.

Transcript:  But isn't it better to have...  In other words, you can go buy a season of The Wire.  Yeah.  But if you do a season-long show and you're waiting week to week, you might as well just  be watching it on TV.  I mean, I keep thinking...  Because you're going to DVR it anyway, and then you can skip to the ads.

Start time: 4985.72
End time: 4994.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think part of the problem is, like, how do you promote and market a show?  Exactly.  Because the networks are not just a filter.  They're also a marketing machine.  They're also a marketing machine for this stuff.

Start time: 4994.60
End time: 5011.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And how do you do that in a world...  Like, look at the number of shows that exist today and fling all of them into a market-yourself  mode.  Every showrunner and producer has to develop a direct relationship with the consumer.  You have to re-aggregate that stuff, just like iTunes did for music.  You don't have every artist.  Some artists do it well.

And he said, look, if it turns out that cell phones cause cancer, and it certainly is possible since you never know...  It's a relatively new technology.  It would mean that the radiations have an effect on human cells that has never been observed before.  Because microwave radiation heats things up.  It doesn't cause the electrons to detach.  The disruption.  Which we have with ionizing radiation, which is what causes cancer.  So we settled it then.  It's done.  We're not talking about it anymore.

He made a comment, or he made a statement about something I thought was really kind of interesting.  You talk about how people use words the wrong way.  Like ironic is a classic example.  Isn't it ironic?  His basic explanation of this was that words mean what most people think they mean.  And if most people are using the word ironic wrong...  Then that's what it means.  Then that's what it means.  In other words, we think of it as coincidental, essentially.  But his point was simply that if that is how we use it, then that's what it is.

Transcript:  No, you're in the jury.  You're supposed to shut up and take notes.  But you're also part of a jury case.  Oh, it was a great case.  It was one of the cases that to catch a predator, you know, where they had those guys.  Oh, yeah.  It was here.  It happened here in Petaluma.  They had a they had this come up.  I am.  OK, after the jury's over, the only thing I can't do in California state law is negotiate with you for a book deal for three months.  I was actually going to bring that up.  I know.  And I'm sorry I can't.  But talk to me in a couple of 90 days.  The book's called Lots of Laughs.  Narration rights.  No, it's actually quite interesting.  You know, and in fact, it's relevant because the case was about this company called Perverted Justice, which is originally a vigilante group that decoyed adults pretending to be teenage girls online, getting the adults to get in a sexual chat and then outing them by saying, you know, I'm going to be a good guy.  And then outing them by publishing the chat on their website and then worse, publishing the guy's name, the names of his co-workers, family, friends and said on the website, go give this guy a hard time.  Are you serious?  So then NBC comes along and says, you know, this would be really a good TV show.  Wow.  And they can't watch it on Hulu.  They hire them for $100,000 an episode to decoy people to these houses.  They get the local police come in and arrest.  So what happens is the guy gets decoyed, comes to the house, thinks it's a 13-year-old.  It turns out it's Chris Hansen, reporter for Dateline NBC.  Not the guy you want to see.  Yeah, that must give you kind of a weird feeling when Chris comes out.  Wasn't he just busted for cheating on his wife?

Start time: 5424.64
End time: 5493.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that ironic?  Today it is ironic.  But in the old days it wouldn't have been ironic?  Would it have been sarcastic?  Technically not ironic, but we're going to go with ironic.  I'm going to have to read my OED.  Wait, so what ends up happening with the case?  The case gets thrown out by the judge.  As the jury, we watch the entire prosecution case.  They interview the decoy, a 40-year-old woman who pretends to be a 13.  There's no sexual chat in this until halfway, half an hour into the chat, she says,  can I get your phone number?  And they have another woman, another 47-year-old woman,  who calls up in a baby doll voice and she says,  hi, you going to come see me in my hot tub?  And this poor guy is a 21-year-old sailor on leave, says, yeah.  And now the chat gets sexual.  So the prosecution makes the whole case.  Yikes.  The judge dismisses it, says that's entrapment, throws it out.  Throws it out.  But I can't remember why I brought it up.  Have some more Macallan.  We're talking about abbreviations.  The other part of this is that Tom Anderson features in this case  because they put up the fake MySpace page they picked for the 13-year-old  and there's Tom's picture and the prosecuting attorney says, well, who's that?  And they say, well, that's Tom. Everybody's his friend on MySpace.

Transcript:  This was 2006 when people were still very afraid that predators were coming into our houses on the internet all the time.  So about that book deal.  Yeah. I could talk to you 90 days.  Two months.  It was actually, the attorney said, are we going to hear about this on Twitter?  I said, no, you know you won't, baby.  No.  No.  Not immediately.  And then he announced his new Twitter series.  To catch a baritone day.  Whoa.  We put decoys.  Why?  We put decoys in chat rooms all over the country, hoping baritone day Thurston would stop by.

You know, Verizon.net isn't responsible.  But as soon as you start doing that.  You are indeed doing that.  And then when you admit that you have control.  That's bad.  You not only weaken your position.  You're no longer.  But every other platform.  There's no DMCA safe harbor for you.  Right.  So then other companies that carry user content.  See, it's inconsistent.  And it actually, I think more than Yelp, it hurts other businesses as well because it  establishes a precedent which says if you have any kind of user content.  Yelp did it.  You are responsible for what people say on your platform.  And nobody wants to be in that position.  Last story.  That was a really reasonable argument.  That was so good.  And that's why I'm going to change the chair.  Claws or something.  You guys are just dead.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yay.  I think they're just so teched out.  Have you been here since 6am?
