End time: 191.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We started shooting over the summer.  But of course, you know, television, everything moves so slow.  So it's like we had the idea over a year ago, started pitching it.  And man, the hardest thing about everything is keeping your stupid mouth shut about everything.  I couldn't do it.  It's something, you know, I'm so excited about it.  And so it was great to be able to finally announce it on NSFW this last week.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're running it as a special.  So it's like, you know, I'm just I'm just glad that the things actually on TV.  I mean, you know how this business projects that fizzle and don't become what you want.  Like this is this is a show I love.  I'm happy with how it turned out.  It was a lot of fun to shoot.  We've got to blow up cars and shoot machine guns and you're going to break into houses and stuff.  The cars. That's exciting.

Transcript:  Well, good. Can't wait.  Thank you. Thank you for being here, Brian.  And we've got a new beyond here.  I want to welcome Jessica Lesson.  We talked to Jess.  Actually, Jessica was on the phone with us before.  Yeah, you were in that.  But I'm so glad you're here in the studio with us.  Jessica is editor in chief of the information, which is a very new tech news site.  You created behind a paywall should mention.  But I subscribed immediately.  Really valuable, Jessica, for many years at the Wall Street Journal, where we quoted you all the time.  Actually, we still quote you.  You got a great scoop this week.  Susan Wojcicki moving from ads to YouTube.

Start time: 275.40
End time: 283.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. She's taken over the helm from Salar.  And it's an interesting move because Susan is the one who Google was built in her garage.  I mean, she's the first.

Start time: 284.00
End time: 295.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Her mom's her mom leased the garage to the boys.  And then Larry married her sister, Sergey Sergey married her sister.  And then now Susan, she has even working at Google since that time.

Start time: 295.38
End time: 300.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She has. She's was running all of ad products.  So AdSense, AdWords, Commerce, etc.

Start time: 301.16
End time: 302.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's not much more important at Google.

Start time: 303.00
End time: 313.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very important. It kind of is a well oiled machine at this point, though.  So I think this is a new challenge and hopefully bringing that kind of operational experience to YouTube, which has some revenue problems.

Start time: 313.58
End time: 316.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They are getting less and less money for per ad, right?

Start time: 317.42
End time: 331.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Revenue is growing. Usage is growing.  But they can't get the ad prices up.  And if they don't get they can't charge more and make individual ads more valuable.  It's going to be tough to get to the next level and to get to more professional content like TV shows, sports, all that kind of stuff.

Start time: 331.44
End time: 350.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Part of the battle over YouTube is what should YouTube be?  I mean, it really was a place for viral videos for a long time.  And I can see YouTube kind of trying to it feels like fit a square peg into a round hole saying, no, no, this is where the networks are going to put their content.  And it doesn't really those two are not compatible.

Start time: 350.46
End time: 390.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They haven't been. And I think the reason it's so complicated is we don't know where this whole market is going.  So, you know, there's not just you.  And so I think everyone kind of wants a piece of it.  They want to be able to grab more and more content.  But, you know, YouTube is still in that base of viral clips, promotional things, shows now, you know, their channels initiative where.  But wasn't that kind of a flop, though?  You know, it depends who you ask.  I think that there are definitely a lot of channels who said they could not build big businesses just off of it.  So they are continuing to invest in it.  But there are a lot of questions, but you can't ignore them because they've you know, they've got the traffic.  They have the assets in that regard.

Start time: 391.36
End time: 439.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, it's been go ahead, Brian.  Oh, I was going to say what's been fascinating to me is to see an almost Wikipedia type of aspect to the whole YouTube phenomenon.  You're right. It used to be YouTube is where you saw cats on surfboards and people getting kicked in the nuts.  Still still do.  Well, sure, sure. That's still there.  But what's amazing is to think about how many instructional things you go to find YouTube on like like YouTube is is a library is where we go to learn how to perform CPR to change a carburetor to learn a magic trick.  I mean, it's like this this instructional think about all of Khan Academy is based on what's great about YouTube and the ability for you to tune in and learn, you know, how insulin inhibits, you know, blood sugar or whatever.  In a tight little five minute lecture on there, I would like to think that that's what YouTube's legacy is really going to be.  But I don't know.

Start time: 440.10
End time: 466.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm looking popular on YouTube worldwide.  Pet squirrel hides his nut in the fur of a Bernie's dog.  Can music improve athletic performance?  Jay Leno's Heartfelt Goodbye.  That's NBC.  That's official and honest Facebook movie.  See, now I want to watch that.  Then I got to watch an ad, which I don't want to watch.  So I close it.  And there you go.  That's Google.  That's YouTube right there.  In a nutshell, I should have watched Squirrel.

Start time: 467.76
End time: 498.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The the YouTube ad thing, that whole that whole ability to skip ads and for them to now change ads to try to engage you in those first four seconds to get you just long enough to hang around and maybe watch the rest, because I don't know exactly how those rules work behind the scene.  But essentially, they only get paid if they watch the whole thing.  However, they're getting paid for a targeted viewer who's obviously engaged enough to sit and on purpose choose to watch an ad, which you would think would be much more valuable than some, you know, just throwing it at the wall during the Super Bowl and hoping something sticks.  And they have.

Start time: 499.04
End time: 526.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they've been innovating with a lot of formats.  So now we see the sort of small banner that pops up in the bottom of videos everywhere.  And YouTube was the first to try that.  But the bigger question is just, you know, can you get the kind of content like sports that have significantly higher CPM's, you know, full episodes of television shows?  They're doing some of it.  I mean, I saw I watched the first episode of Girls this season on HBO or promotional thing I saw through you on YouTube.

Start time: 526.78
End time: 533.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's so it will be over HBO's dead body that they put the whole season.  It's promotional. It's teasing.

Start time: 534.04
End time: 541.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's marketing.  But you wouldn't have seen that a few years ago.  So I think it's it's definitely a place to watch.

Start time: 541.14
End time: 558.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But well, I think we all watch YouTube a lot.  I just think it's hard to.  I think it's kind of hard to monetize because you just don't know what the environment's going to be.  You don't know if you're going to be on a squirrel video or a Leno goodbye video on there's clips.

Start time: 559.63
End time: 595.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube's really good for clips, for short clips.  And there's that question.  And sometimes I go to YouTube to watch a movie trailer and there's an ad before it.  And I'm like, wait a second, I'm watching an ad.  See an ad for an ad.  I see that.  That's a little bit strange.  My kids use it for music.  It's like the place you go if you want to listen to a song.  The songs we and they're not even watching the video even if there is video because what YouTube has done really well is it's easy to upload things.  It's easy to find them.  And it's easy to jump to a particular moment in a clip to which a lot of multimedia stuff on the web is really hard to like like podcasts.  You kind of can't discover podcasts.  But YouTube videos are really easy to discover.

Start time: 596.28
End time: 602.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can actually put a key in the link that goes right to a certain number of seconds.  How many people know that?  But that's it's in the share button.  Yeah.

Start time: 603.00
End time: 626.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I did to Brian's point, I changed the I got a replacement for my car stereo and it came with the typical like impossible to decipher instruction manual about how to install it myself.  And I searched on YouTube and there was a dude out in the snow in Minnesota putting it in his car and freezing while he was doing it.  And I followed the YouTube video.  I got my laptop, put it in the car and that's how I learned how to do it.

Start time: 626.36
End time: 644.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think the paper that's Google's problem because I bet you the search you did was a Google search, not a YouTube search.  Right.  But if you found a list of instructions and it's some blog and what's embedded on the blog, but the YouTube video he's getting free bandwidth for his video.  And I guess they could show an ad there.  But that's kind of the problem, isn't it?  I don't have to target to.

Start time: 646.12
End time: 652.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in some in some ways it isn't.  I mean, if that part, if there's a manufacturer for the part you're looking at, that could be a very highly valuable ad.

Start time: 653.12
End time: 656.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And does YouTube sell those ads that way?  Can they say they can get pretty granular?

Start time: 657.00
End time: 674.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they can get into the type of content type of audience.  I mean, that's the Google sort of engineering brains.  Right.  So they're good at that.  And that's what Susan Mojica is very good at.  That's what she's been doing and doing that at scale and then getting all the partners to agree to that, to show that it's actually moving the needle for them.

Start time: 674.38
End time: 718.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's that's the biggest problem is a lot of the advertisers, they want to buy the certain personality.  They're like, we want to buy ads just on Jenna Marvill show or whatever.  Yeah. And Google does not want that because that that leaves their entire long tail on monetize.  They're like, well, you say you want Ray William Johnson or whatever.  But what you really mean is you have males 18 to 24 make this kind of stuff.  And then we, you know, we'll do that.  And it'll include this buy over here.  And that's what advertisers are not responding to.  Now, meanwhile, it does seem like a noble goal for them to try to get to happen because you just wanted to hit that targeted audience.  But but it seems like the people holding the purse strings are not a big fan of this idea that they can't buy individual personalities or shows.

Start time: 718.48
End time: 737.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, J.C. Calhoun and our chairman says is I'm talking from the advertisers perspective.  And I am.  I mean, because there seems to be a disconnect between what we as users want from YouTube and what advertisers want from YouTube.  And it doesn't seem like the users are particularly interested in making a platform that Google can monetize.  And that's the challenge.

Start time: 738.70
End time: 773.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube, the community of YouTube users is very easy to piss off.  And Google's done it many times before, and they don't want to do it again.  And I think to another point that was brought up, I mean, even though we it's unbelievable to us, given how mature the Web is,  but video buyers are still largely TV buyers within agencies and they're still thinking of buying along those along personalities and along shows and with the same kind of metrics as TV.  And that's the challenge for YouTube and everyone else for Facebook, for Hulu to prove.  No, guys, think about it our way, not your way.  Isn't that the weird part?

Start time: 774.30
End time: 799.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like inherently, you would think that online advertising for whether it's Hulu or YouTube or whatever, you're able to do things that you could never do with traditional television ads.  That's the value.  One, make sure it actually gets seen.  You can know specifically who saw it and in what condition and whether they skip stuff ahead.  You would think that all that would make online ads a premium that you would pay more than traditional advertising.  But instead, we see the opposite.  We see these bargain basement prices.

Start time: 800.36
End time: 807.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meanwhile, here's a video on YouTube.  NBC aired this video.  All visitors to Sochi Olympics immediately hacked.

End time: 839.94

Start time: 840.82
End time: 846.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So first of all, he's in this whole thing was shot in Moscow, not so just so you know, not just hacking.

Start time: 847.12

Transcript:  The State Department warns that travelers should have no expectation of privacy, even in their hotel rooms.

Start time: 854.26
End time: 866.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We know that because the guy in charge of Sochi said, no, they are hacking hotel rooms.  We have cameras and we see them turn on showered morning and leave on all day, which really kind of made me nervous.  But that's another story.

Start time: 867.30
End time: 889.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exposed as soon as you try and communicate with anything.  One of the first things visitors to Russia will do is log on hackers here.  Log on to wait a minute.  Log on to what?  OK, go ahead.  We decided to find out how dangerous that can be.  Carl, welcome to Moscow.  Thank you.  With the help of Kyle Wilhoyt, a top American computer security expert.

Start time: 890.10
End time: 911.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they had three computers, each of which they pulled out of the box without updates.  They put them online and then they went to websites, the same exact websites you could go to from right here.  Brand new computers has nothing to do with Moscow.  We know this because these fresh machines, the guy from Trend Micro blogged the details.  Nice job opening the Apple box.  Ever open one of those before, Richard?

Start time: 912.00
End time: 915.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not like they purposely designed those boxes to be a joy to open.

Start time: 918.08
End time: 922.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tore it open.  He's got meat hooks for hands.  It was a FedEx box.

Start time: 925.39
End time: 930.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So from the producers of To Catch a Predator, it's to open an Apple box.  The only real detail, my name.

Start time: 932.00
End time: 945.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you're putting my profile on these computers.  That's exactly right.  With our new computers now loaded with potentially attractive data, we headed for a restaurant where we used a new smartphone to browse for information.  So-called smartphones.

Start time: 946.89
End time: 968.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So apparently what he did is he goes, they don't show this, they did it out.  He goes into the Android phone, turns off, checks the box that says allow third party downloads.  And of course you immediately get the warning.  That's a very dangerous thing to do.  Are you sure you want to do it?  OK.  And then intentionally goes and downloads malware knowingly.  Wow.  OK.  But watch what happens next.  We were hacked.  We were hacked.  Yeah, I did.  Right.

Start time: 970.65
End time: 973.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually downloading a piece of malware.  Because you asked it to.

Start time: 974.16
End time: 975.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before we even finished our coffee.

Start time: 977.08
End time: 978.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Coffee was also hacked.

Start time: 979.00
End time: 979.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More on that later.

Start time: 980.10
End time: 982.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how did how did this blow up in their faces?

Start time: 983.72
End time: 1020.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How did it become the guy from Trend Micro set this up blogged about it.  It's a nice one to be clear what actually happens.  Yeah.  And he said later, you know, it's everything we did is exactly what you should not do.  And it didn't matter that they were a coffee shop in Moscow.  If you do it sitting right here at this table, it's the same websites.  They went to malicious websites and ran programs when the websites asked them to all the things you're not supposed to do.  But they edited out what they make you play it.  They make it look like there was no interaction at all.  They edit out the part where he downloads and says yes and runs the program.

Start time: 1027.30
End time: 1033.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so when he made this blog post explaining all this, this was him trying to clear the air so that he didn't feel dinged on this.

Start time: 1034.14
End time: 1096.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  I kind of feel like he realized that in editing, it kind of looked a little different than it actually was.  The blog post is behind the scenes, behind the NBC honeypots.  It's on the Trend Micro blog.  And he says, first, these attacks required some kind of user interaction, whether to execute the applications or open a Word document.  All the attacks shown required user interaction, which was edited out.  Second, these attacks could happen anywhere.  Third, the infections incurred on newly unboxed hardware had basic security precautions such as updating the operating system been taken.  None of these would have happened.  In fact, I think they installed Java on the Macintosh because it said all three computers had Flash and Java installed.  That means they actively installed malware vectors on the Mac.  It's a completely typical bogus story from NBC and no one's called them on it except for this blog post.

Start time: 1096.20
End time: 1104.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there were some other blog posts that maybe provoked that one, too.  So I think the security researchers are on it.  It was bogus.  Yeah.

Start time: 1105.10
End time: 1107.66

Start time: 1108.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to wonder what the thought process is.  NBC's got the Olympics.  There are so many controversies about the Olympics anyway that there's no end to what they can cover controversial about it if they want to.  And instead they do this weird simplified story about computer hacking in Russia.

Start time: 1124.66
End time: 1150.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I were John C. Dvorak and this were the No Agenda Show, I would say there was an agenda in Russia to make the Russians look horrible.  The Sochi problems Twitter account, the pictures, many of which it turns out have been faked or misinterpreted about problems in the hotels and so forth.  It almost feels like there's a concerted campaign.  Am I? Is it just me that feels that?  I think it's people jealous that they're not at the Olympics.

Start time: 1151.20
End time: 1158.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  But, you know, we see this kind of thing.  Whenever there's a mold that we feel like stuff should fit in and there's any kind of evidence that seems to to exactly fit in what we expect.  You know, we all have preconceived notions that everything's corrupt.  We've heard that is going to be the most corrupt Olympics ever.  And, you know, worried about terrorism threats and Putin's put on a dog and pony show to cover up X, Y, Z.  Like, we hear all that.  And then as a result, when we get, you know, a photo, whether it's doctored or not, you know, it's hard to not instantly want to jump on it and pass it around.  So I don't know that it's a concerted campaign.  I think that that there's just preconceived notions that we're hearing that when we see something that that matches it, we don't short circuits are our critical thinking skills.  And instead, we just immediately forwarded because, to be honest, like this, you know, like this this news story exactly fits what I imagine Russia is.  Russia is nothing but but drunk people pirating at all times and hacking at all times.

But then, like, all of a sudden, you feel bad.  Yeah.  And then, once, like, apparently you've got to remember,  there's a real developer who really wasn't trying to break your mind with amazing art.  He just wanted to make a dumb game with a Flappin' Bird.  And his name is...  Now the whole world's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got two.  My best is five.  My best is five, yeah.  So, nobody here knows anything about this game except, and this is kind of interesting,  all of a sudden, and somebody did the plot of this.  What was the link for that, Joe?  I want to see if I can find that.  Somebody started plotting reviews in the app store.  All of a sudden, they started to come in hot about December, and the presumption is that  Mr. Flappy Bird, Dong Nguyen, was buying reviews to jumpstart this, and in fact, more than  that, because he has several games, and they all started getting more reviews at the same  time.  They all started to spike up.  Let's see.  This is Zach Will's blog.  He did a kind of like a scrape of all the reviews.  We've all read the Verge's story that Dong is making $50,000 a day on the ads, but here's  the spike.  This is what's very interesting.  Nothing.  No reviews.  Sometime in late December, early January, he says, I'm guessing Dong Nguyen probably  used some sort of service to download Rate Flappy Bird on the app store to generate buzz.  It worked.  Flappy Bird's starting getting 20 reviews a day.  Then on January 9th, 90 reviews.  On the 12th, it doubled.  At 17th, it doubled again.  Suddenly, it starts to take off, and I presume at this point, it goes viral, and it's real  reviews.  But if you read the reviews, and he does put some of them on here, you can see that there's  a certain amount of similarity, the early reviews.  They all have this kind of morbid, I'm going to kill myself.  This game is killing me.  I want to kill this guy.  The apocalypse, the death of me, my life is over.  Don't do it.  Don't you do it.  My life is expiring, running out of control.  I'm going to kill myself.  These are all the first reviews coming in.  They all sound fake.  It's really interesting to watch this.  So it does take off.  It does go viral, and I know it went viral.  It went viral around here.  One person downloaded, and all of a sudden, everybody's playing it.  I don't understand why.  I was talking to one of our interns here, Eli, who goes to a local high school.  How long did it take before everybody was playing it, Eli?  Three days.  Every student playing it.  I don't know why.  There's something compelling about it.  Then yesterday, go ahead.  Well, I was going to say, first of all, that's a-  Mr. Hacker, you know why.

Start time: 1739.10
End time: 1746.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's a testament to, this is what Robert Cialdini calls a fixed action  pattern where it's like we can't help but use as a shortcut.

Start time: 1747.10
End time: 1753.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You're not making this up because the abbreviation fixed action pattern is FAP.  You're not making this-  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 1754.46
End time: 1824.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's why when I do my talk about social engineering, I make sure they're abbreviated as FAP.  Okay, all right.  But yes, no, that is what it's called.  It's a mental shortcut.  For example, one of the classic ones was Harvard did a study to see if you could cut in front of lines.  And so they found a bunch of people waiting for a Xerox machine.  They had somebody go and ask different variations of the question, can I cut in line to do my stuff faster?  And they figured out that the magic word was because.  As long as you use the word because, it's like they shortcut their brain.  They're like, well, she's got some reason, so fine, go.  And even if it was a nonsense way to phrase it, like, hey, can I jump in front of line because I need to make some copies and I'm in a rush?  Like, that's not an excuse.  That's not a reason.  They're like, oh, you said the word because.  Go ahead.  Wow.  And so I think that's the reason why I think that social proof is the reason that that Yelp, of course, is so popular.  And to be honest, it's the reason that our joke experiment, the Diamond Club book, was such a success is because so many people bought it all at once.  They all left fake reviews saying it was the best thing since Fifty Shades of Grey.  And of course, it was a hilarious fake erotic fiction book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know how to sell this stuff works.  Well, we all sneer and turn our nose up at the idea of buying reviews.  But but I mean, how far off is it from me releasing a project and saying, let's all buy it at the same time and everybody like, comment and subscribe at the same time and gaming the system?  You know, like, I guess the only benefit to when we do it with NSFW is that we're transparent about it and we make it clear that this is a game that we're playing, whereas it feels it does feel smarmy and underhanded if it's a pay for service.

Start time: 1857.00
End time: 1888.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I've been really trying to crack down on that.  And I, you know, I don't know some secret system of how they do it.  But I mean, it bots that download apps and I mean, they're pretty much, you know, or policing those as they should.  Right. And so I am sure that they have checks looking for spikes in reviews and suspicious reviews and are also monitor that closely.  So so if they did go ahead and do that, which seems, I guess, very plausible, they would have had a lot of systems to circumvent.  And I bet I bet a lot of things get caught.  And maybe this one didn't.

I cannot take this anymore.  And then he says it's not related to legal issues.  I just cannot keep it anymore.  Then he says, I also I don't sell Flappy Bird.  Don't ask.  And I still make games.  And that's the last we've heard of him.  And so huge response on Twitter, by the way, if you search his Twitter handle is don't get Tory.  If you search for don't get Tory and FU, unbelievable vitriol on this guy.

End time: 1960.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, do you think do you think it is the case that that he just couldn't handle it?  It's such an intentionally agonizingly difficult game.  Like that's the one redeeming quality about it is that it's genuinely hard and it's hard for everyone.  And it is frustrating, but weirdly addictive.  Do you think he just hated the personal hate that he was getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the firehose of the Internet being turned on somebody who didn't really expect it.  I think he was hoping he would make some money from his game and, you know, success, success until you're all the way up the top.  But then he got the criticism that, oh, it was like this other game and that he was just a hack who took stuff off a shelf and all that.  And he became the focus of something.  And I think this guy was not interested.  He was very happy playing at the at the edges of this culture and make a little money on the side on a little game with some ads.  I think something suspicious.

Transcript:  There is an interesting angle here about what happens to all of this stuff that we use, all these apps and all when they go off the app store.  And, you know, we have so many retro games on emulators and things from the past.  And in this app store era where we've got all this DRM stuff on our phones and all that, Flappy Bird gets pulled.  I mean, if you delete it, you can't get it back.  And in 10 years, somebody is going to write about what Flappy Bird meant and it's going to be gone.  And, you know, it does make you wonder.  This stuff all seems a lot less permanent than software used to seem back in the day because, you know, you pull it off the store and it's gone.  You can't have a backup somewhere that you reload.

Start time: 2153.00
End time: 2169.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the other thing is there's so much money in it that there's, I mean, all of these clones.  Flybirds, Flappy Bee, there's Flappy Penguin.  I saw on Android Farty Bird. It's exactly the same game, but you fart to get a crush on it.  Sure.  Flappy Penguin.

Transcript:  I'll tell you this much. And actually, this is this is a legit speaking from the heart moment.  I'm kind of ticked that this is the dominating story on apps because there's a little game that came out this week that I love.  Oh, good. Threes by Ashurbo.  The guy who did Puzzle Juice just released a new one and it's I love it.  Is it iPhone or iPad?

Start time: 2205.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like basically you got you got ones and twos that you got to move position to make into a three.  And then after that, you're looking to take two identical numbers and mash them together to get bigger numbers.  But it's very Zen and it uses what I like about it is there are games that only use symbols and logic.  And so you're able to do things like listen to an audiobook and that part of your brain is not competing with the part of your brain that's that's moving your hands like that.  The moment I'm happiest is when I'm like at the gym working out on the elliptical or whatever.  And I'm playing a game that I'm manipulating symbols while listening to an audiobook that requires the language parts of my brain to be engaged.

Start time: 2279.70
End time: 2297.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is also you could tell like especially since he did Puzzle Juice, you can really see the way he's developed a game.  Like, for example, here this tutorial, you're going to be playing the game right now where it is.  So it's you're just moving stuff around until it hits you go to you hit a wall and then the line up and then you can mash them together.  Now you've made a three.  I've learned.

What I like about it is that it reminds me of Drop 7, which was a game that I played for easily seven years like or I guess six years since it came out.  And it's just one of those things where you just become obsessed with it.  And it's something I could do that that doesn't you know, like I say, it doesn't require the language part of the everybody in our audience is now downloading threes.

Transcript:  It keeps a record of all the games you've played sorted by highest score.  So you can look back easily every time you finish a game.  You can see where your current game ranked versus your very best games that you played, which is also really smart.

Where very quickly you start to realize you're in trouble and you shift the way you play from being, you know, all about getting the points and instead you're all about clearing out space so you can stay alive.

Transcript:  There is a thing like I don't care how many hate tweets that you're getting.  Fifty thousand dollars a day.  It's utterly remarkable.  Like you shut the hell up and you deal with it.  And unless you're unless you are hiding something, you know what I mean?  Like unless you're worried that all this attention is going to cause a problem for you.

Start time: 2566.14
End time: 2605.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that is quite possible.  But I want to leave a little bit of space open for the fact that this is a young software developer who was taken aback by the attention and is really sensitive and maybe couldn't deal with it emotionally.  I've known some software developers who shut down their their company and walked away because they couldn't deal with the customers or they had something else going on in their lives.  And this exacerbated it at the point where they felt it was wrecking their lives and they walked away.  And that could be the case here.  It's also possible that something is happening that we don't know about.  But his tweets seem pretty distressed to me.  So I mean, there's a cultural difference there, a language difference.

Start time: 2605.12
End time: 2618.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we may be filtering it through our own predisposition to making as much money as you possibly can.  If he was making fifty thousand dollars a day for a month, he's got a million and a half in the bank.  He may never have to work again.  He might have just said, you know, this is fine.

Start time: 2619.20
End time: 2628.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, well, and plus also when you're that young and you have a hit, you have a tendency to believe like, oh, well, then I could just make hits whenever I feel like.  And I can see making that kind of rash decision.

Transcript:  Scoop by Flappy Birds.  Our show today brought to you by Carmonite online backup.  I get this every week on the radio show because radio show.  Normal people listen to guy calls up says, yeah, my screen doesn't work anymore.  Three of my keys on my HP laptop don't work anymore.  But all my photos are on that hard drive.  What do I do?  Is he said, is it time to get carbon?  Is it time to get carbon?  Dude, he said, well, I do have an external hard drive.  And I press the button and it backs up every night.  But I get up in the morning and it says zero percent.  Is that a bad sign?  I said, yes, you don't have a backup and your computer is dying.  Please have a backup strategy.  And if you do remember one thing when you back up, you got to do.  I think you got to do three to one backup, three copies, not one.  Putting moving your file to a drive named backup does not a backup make.  You have to have at least two.  I say three copies.  You're going to have two different forms of media, one that can be external hard drive, but one's got to be off site.  Yep.  If you if it's sitting next to your computer, you know, we have flash flood warnings.  Did you get did your alarm go off on the phone?  Mine didn't.  It was it was like a you know, those old style radio alerts.

Transcript:  So a good backup strategy would be let's just now do a little thinking.  Automatic.  You have to remember it continuous.  So you change your file.  It's backed up off site, you know, to the cloud maybe.  And that's what Carbonite does.  And it does it very affordably.  Less than five bucks a month for everything on your computer.  And it doesn't matter how much you have.  They don't meter the storage.  Fifty nine dollars ninety nine cents a year for everything on a Mac or a PC.  They have if you go to carbonite.com, they've got plans for small businesses, external drives, always one low flat yearly rate.  Plus, you can access those backup files anytime.  Just log on to your carbonite account or use the free apps.  It is a great solution for backup.  And, you know, probably there are people, you know, people who watch the show are certainly smart enough to have good backup solutions.  But they're probably people who you know who don't.  Your mom, your dad, your sister, your brother, the teacher, the pastor.  Help them show them carbonite carbonite.com.  Do tell them to use the offer code twit because they'll get two free bonus months when they buy two months, two weeks to try it.  No credit card needed.  Just the word twit to bonus months when you decide to buy carbonite dot com.  So such an Adela.  You know, there was a lot of drama around this Microsoft CEO search.  Alan Mullally came up, former Microsoft folks, couple of guys in Microsoft beside an Adela, Tony Bates, the Skype CEO was brought in during the acquisition.  Stephen Elop brought in when the Nokia acquisition closed.  But I think everybody looked at such an Adela and thought this is the guy been in Microsoft 22 years.  The obvious choice, not the inspiring choice.  And a tough choice, though.

Start time: 2883.16
End time: 2917.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think what it came down to is the fact that this is a tough job running Microsoft right now.  Almost really more than one job.  And so I think the most interesting thing about the announcement was the return of Bill Gates as a technical advisor, spending a third of his time now back in Microsoft.  And we don't know what that will be.  And I'm sure for a while they will downplay it.  But, you know, he changed his position on the board so that he could officially, you know, step in, spend a third of his time.  And I think that's a recognition that Microsoft is somewhat ungovernable.

Start time: 2918.01
End time: 2957.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your old newspaper, the Journal said that over and over again.  They said nobody wants this job because, A, it's too tough and B, nobody wants to work for a board run by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.  Yeah. Yeah.  Nadella also got a seat.  So all three CEOs on the board.  John Thompson takes the chair position, which makes a lot of sense.  Former IBM executive.  He led this search.  The rest of the board really are kind of nonentities.  They almost feel like rubber stamp board members, frankly.  So it's really the thought was, and the Journal said this over and over again, nobody wants this job because they don't want to have these guys breathing down their necks.

Start time: 2958.18
End time: 2970.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's also, I mean, we don't really know.  So, I mean, we don't we know that Alan Mulally sort of took himself out in some ways, according to himself.  I mean, it's very hard to get a handle on how many actual candidates they were.

End time: 3010.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My money was on him all along, but they did have this perception that there's no vision.  This is just going to be kind of a vanilla choice.  And I think moving Bill Gates into the visionary role probably is a response to that.  It also solves one problem, because if Bill's not the chairman of the board, maybe he's not so overpowering.  Maybe he's there.  That was my question.

Start time: 3011.02
End time: 3026.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this is this getting Bill Gates more involved to get him more involved or is it getting him to not be the chairman so that if Nadella needs to make some tough decisions about going in a different direction from Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, is he going to be able to do that or is it going to be there three over his shoulder three days?

Start time: 3027.51
End time: 3080.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't matter what chair he's sitting in the boardroom.  He's still in the boardroom.  And now he's at the company more often.  And I think that, you know, if you read the sort of anonymous quotes being bandied around from insiders, it's, you know, all about what is that relationship going to be like?  Is he going to have an office?  So I think that what's interesting now is to see what the strategy is going forward if they decide to sell off some stuff, which has been talked about.  If the sort of Ballmer, Nokia mobility push is going to be the sort of driving vision in the same way, what that deal is going to look like.  And I it'll be interesting.  I mean, I think that everyone in tech wants to see some sort of decisive action sort of moving in different ways, not just the same old same old.  But, you know, the company's making money.  It's doing fairly well.  Same old same old might be sort of what we see, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and we had this conversation on Windows Weekly, of course, on Wednesday with Paul Throtten, Mary Jo Foley.  And one of the points they brought up is Bill hasn't really been involved in Microsoft in quite some time.  He spent all his energy on saving the world.  And what is Bill going to say?  You know, I don't think the ribbon on the toolbar is quite right.  You want to move that a little left or is he going to say, you know, maybe tablets aren't the same.  I mean, it's going to be much higher level advice.  Seems like he's getting hands on with the code or making my suspicion is what Gates is going to be doing is he's there to back up such a such as faced against, you know, really weird to have a board with all three CEOs of a company on the board.  Such is going to he is an inaugural address such as said it's software.  He said software again and again and again.  He said, you know, Microsoft's new slogan or new tagline is devices and services were devices and services company.  But he said again and again, but it's the software that runs on the devices and services that really matters.  So what I think Bill's job is to go.  Yeah, yeah, such is right.  It's he's there such a good go to the board and have a guy in his corner.

Start time: 3176.04
End time: 3182.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So and so it is an unusual position.  And I think it could work quite well.  You know, I was sort of chuckling.  Microsoft sort of did the dog and pony show of PR for this.  So on the web, you know, there's who is such an Adele in the video of him walking down the hall with the interviews, you know, so it's a huge company and it's a huge role.  But I did chuckle sort of branding campaign around it.  But I'm really watching to see if there's any deals done.

Start time: 3213.00
End time: 3262.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it is such an Adele thinks that there that Microsoft is never really going to have a market share presence for Windows Phone and for tablets that are running Windows.  Does he pull the plug?  Does he have the ability to say, guys, we need to we need to focus on the cloud.  We're doing great in the cloud.  We've still got the base Windows business.  That's a great business.  They can talk about Xbox.  That's where it comes from, by the way, is Azure and Enterprise, which are doing which are doing great.  I'm not sure anybody at Microsoft really wants to turn Microsoft into IBM.  But but that's my question is, is does he have the latitude to say, guys, you know, this phone stuff and the tablet stuff still, you know, it's going to be iOS and Android.  It's not going to be us.  So let's focus on being the back end services for all of those apps and not worry about this.  Or is there just too much pride invested in that?  I think it's hard.

Start time: 3263.50
End time: 3320.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard to get out of the mobile phone business right now.  I mean, it is hard to just give that up.  And I mean, they've tried and tried and are trying again.  And there's not a ton of movement.  But I think it's hard to give that up.  And, you know, Azure, they are not the back end for the mobile phone business.  They're the back end for the legacy PC business.  So, you know, I think that it's hard to see them giving that up.  But, you know, Xbox, what do you do with that?  And does that belong somewhere else?  What do you do with some of these hardware projects like Surface and other stuff?  But I think I don't see how Microsoft can be relevant without pushing forward and mobile.  But I think, you know, that was the bomber strategy.  And it's too early to say.  But I think the Xbox is one to watch.  And, you know, this has been floated out there.  People wondering if you could get rid of that and focus things a bit and what to do with the Excel business.  The stock market is just indifferent to the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they like growth, right?  And Microsoft is just throwing its profit.  It's the same thing that's going on with Apple stock right now.  It's like, oh, these are really boring companies because they're not growing as fast as they used to.  They're ridiculously profitable.  So it's a great business for them to be in.  But if you're an investor, you want to you want growth.  It's just a different kind of company.

Start time: 3345.74
End time: 3368.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I guess that's the problem is, is one of the things that makes the stock market an efficient market is that it factors in excitement about a company as an actual commodity.  And once that once that factors in, then then, yeah, it makes sense that everything would be flat because you're not actually buying it just with the intention of sitting there and collecting dividends.  Oftentimes you're buying it with the expectation that the stock itself will grow over time.

Transcript:  I think you have to buy some other big stuff.  So I also think we're going to start I think we see some really, really big deals in the tech space.  Interesting because you've got a ton of cash and you've got valuations pretty high, which is good if you're an acquiring company and you can agree on the valuation.  You know, Google's on a rampage we've written a bit about.  But I mean, you could buy eBay.  That's what I would do if I were Microsoft.  I'd buy eBay.  I mean, I don't think you can.  But or at least the PayPal part of it maybe.  But those are the kind of moves.  And I know it's easy to say sitting back without, you know, being in the thick of things.  But we're going to see a lot of I think we're at this level of sort of stagnant growth on a lot of things and Apple and elsewhere.  And what's going to move the needle?  I think that's going to be getting different skill sets and different products into these organizations and leveraging them.

Transcript:  I do think that Microsoft, and not just for our benefit because it would be fun to talk about,  but I think everything Microsoft needs to focus and needs to change some of its business.  It is trying to be so many different things.  And I think sometimes at the disservice to its products,  I think Windows Phone is a better product than maybe it has been treated as by them.  I think right down to the name being just we got everything Windows everywhere.  Maybe it was a liability for that product.

Start time: 3542.02
End time: 3560.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that one of Microsoft's greatest sins of all time is insisting on putting their stupid name on everything?  From a branding perspective, you want a name to mean something.  And Microsoft can't mean high-end enterprise solution and also a kick-ass video game console.  Yet they insist on putting that on there.  Really, Cannon?

Start time: 3597.00
End time: 3654.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's one thing that's true that Microsoft doesn't want to go the IBM route  and become the enterprise solutions services company.  Devices is equal to services in Microsoft's new way of looking at things.  That's why they do Surface, which is the first ever computer made by Microsoft.  They do tablets.  And they do Xbox. Those are the devices.  And they bought Nokia.  And phones.  I mean, that's a third of their device portfolio.  By the way, I didn't realize this, but Apple in the last couple of weeks did repurchase $14 billion in shares.  They did spend some of that cash because of their poor stock showing after showing an incredible record profit.  Okay. It's all confusing to me.  Tim Cook spoke to the Wall Street Journal and boy, I tell you, Apple's really good at getting the press because he said, among other things,  we have some very exciting new categories and the world goes crazy.

Transcript:  As we know this week, I mean, the number of journalists who's wasted time chasing rumors on secret.  I was actually going to put a few fake ones out there to ruin the competition.  I'm glad you're not in my address book.  I didn't. I didn't.  But it's well, first of all, we know Apple's been working on a living room device and television device, all that.  Now, I do think the watch is getting close.  And I mean, I think this is what the drumbeat seems to be mounting.

Transcript:  But Jessica's so what if you both of you between the two of you heard about the I watch we're seeing now stories come out about all the hires Apple has made in health, in fitness, in fashion over the last year.  It really feels like maybe that's what Tim's talking about.  It feels like it's coming to an end.  A this year.  I think so.

Start time: 3739.39
End time: 3779.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So actually, the reporter has been way ahead on the watch is Mark Gurman of night.  Very good.  We should give him credit for that.  And so what he and others, the New York Times has also been very good on this or saying is to expect those devices here, expect it to be very fitness heavy and not just how many steps did I take, but different oxygen readings and blood, you know, and I think trying to really move the needle on some of that stuff.  Now it's not clear how much of that would be in version one verse sort of a future roadmap.  But I think it's very safe to expect something this year with a very heavy health and fitness focus.  Yeah, look at that list.

Including miniature sensors, Paul Deneve, former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, little fashion in there.  Of course, Angela Arens, who was from Burberry, CEO of Burberry, who came in to run Apple retail.  That was a very interesting move.  A step down, it looked like for her.  She'd been a senior.  Yeah, it's a different.

Start time: 3861.24

Start time: 3928.00
End time: 3970.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think the thing to remember is that Apple stayed on the sidelines of the space until it has something it thinks can be mass market.  Right.  And I'm, you know, happy to use all this stuff, but I don't think that the vast, you know, this is not a mass market.  No one's going to be tracking stuff like that.  So I think it's interesting because this the device is obviously going to have to do a lot more than this kind of stuff.  And I also really wonder if we're yet at the point when when this is sort of the direction of the selling points to go sort of mass market.  And, you know, the iPhone when it first came out wasn't mass market.  But I think, you know, the reason we've seen all these other devices from Samsung and Pebble and Nike and Jawbone and not from Apple is because I think they've been waiting to do something that feels very different.

Start time: 3971.28
End time: 4009.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something 50 million people will buy and not one million.  They can't do another 50.  Yeah, well, that's exactly right.  Although Apple always is about hardware and software working together.  And I think about these sensors and you're absolutely right.  The quantified self movement is only, you know, this tiny little fraction.  But if you can take an app and if you can take that that co-process that they've got on the on the new iPhone and iPad models and you can you can take all this data and then the software does something interesting with it, whether it's some way to tell you it's time to wake up in the morning, whether it is something about your diet or about your exercise.  If they can crack that, it could be really interesting.  And that would be something that a regular person might want.

Start time: 4009.18
End time: 4055.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, well, and that is exactly the kind of thing that I could see Apple having the ambition to do because they're in a great position.  They're sitting on a mountain of cash.  If I'm Apple, I'm not thinking in terms of what's a gizmo.  We think people know that they want.  I'm thinking in terms of how can we transform the social reality of everyone around us?  How do we create a movement of this?  How do we take this nascent, you know, as you said, self-quantification and turn it into something that everybody does, that everybody knows?  Like there's a plan that'll get you more hours of sleep or take care of you for X, Y or Z.  This ability to, you know, essentially hack your own operating system by virtue of being able to monitor everything all the time, I think is something they can sell.  And I think it's smart for them to be to be quiet.

Start time: 4070.88
End time: 4081.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nancy Dougherty, one of the people they hired, is a hardware engineer at a company called Proteus Digital Health.  I think Apple had an investment with them as well.  Smart patches and ingestible Bluetooth connected smart pills.

Start time: 4081.52
End time: 4094.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, what I've read about the smart pills is those aren't necessarily medical.  Those are actually ID things where you you take your smart pill at the beginning of the day and then you don't need a key card.  I'm not kidding.  It like unlocks your devices and stuff.

Start time: 4095.04
End time: 4141.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Proteus does a bit.  So Proteus is more tracking if you've taken your meds and then also how your body reacts to them.  So there's a lot.  But one of the things I think is important to think about in what it's a great point of, you know,  Apple wanting to create a movement or a product and a system and ecosystem that really is mass.  But we have to remember that it's not really Apple's core competency around this data stuff.  I mean, when you start to match, you know, and build services on top of how I'm sleeping and recommending things based on that,  I mean, you're really into the sort of data science stuff that frankly Google is just a lot better at.  And so I think that, you know, Apple is going to need and has been trying to get the expertise to do that sort of predictive work off huge data sets.

Start time: 4141.54
End time: 4144.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And would they be smart to do partnerships instead of trying to do it themselves?

Start time: 4145.14
End time: 4153.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's hard, though, because if you're going to be the system, if you're going to be the platform and you want all the apps to sink into your data and all that, you really have to control that.

Start time: 4153.46
End time: 4160.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so rumor was they're going to do a passbook style health book on iOS eight that would be, in fact, a repository for all this.

Start time: 4160.94
End time: 4164.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how useful it is will be based on what they can do with the partnerships.

Start time: 4164.18
End time: 4218.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be honest, usefulness has nothing to do with it, I suspect, because think about it, the way we all perceive our health, it's almost like a religious thing.  There are people who are anti science because they don't want genetically modified foods.  And there are other people who think that yoga gives them superpowers or whatever.  It's like, you know, we, we, we, we, those are true statements, but OK, yes, and that's fine.  That's fine. But what Apple should do is position themselves like here's the device that unlocks you and gives you all the numbers to work with.  And they should be accurate sensors and they should be able to figure out X, Y, Z.  But then you get all of the who's gurus from your from your crackpot doctor, Ozz's to your doctor, Weir's to your Sanjay Gupta's to, you know, everybody sets their own plan within this framework.  Then Apple benefits from having created this ecosystem.  And it's all the people. It's all the partners that people are subscribing to follow their plans.  But Apple, they have to get that middle bit right.

Start time: 4218.32
End time: 4272.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I just keep coming back to Google now tells you when to leave, you know, based on traffic and your your your normal driving patterns.  Right. You have to have some level of that kind of analysis off the streams of digital health data before you start talking to the doctor,  Phil's and the sleep experts and all of that kind of stuff.  And so you absolutely you need systems that know how to learn from the data.  It's machine learning. It's all this stuff that is kind of the rage right now.  And, you know, Apple has never really done that successfully.  And they've made some tiny acquisitions to try to bring more of that expertise into the company.  But that's going to be a huge focus, I think, to make their platform because you remember, Google is doing the exact same thing.  I mean, Google, even after getting rid of the Motorola mobile unit, they've got their own watch projects.  They obviously have Google Glass.

Start time: 4272.52
End time: 4277.00

Transcript:  So, I mean, it is an arms race and Apple can have the sexiest device in the world.  But if they don't get that piece right, they're going to lose.

Start time: 4285.14
End time: 4298.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can almost promise you they will have the sexiest device and they won't get that piece right.  Are you saying so I want to be clear that they need to do this in house.  They do need to develop this data understanding Google or is it that they go to Runkeeper and they go to all these?

Start time: 4299.96
End time: 4348.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's both. So before you can even get to working with Runkeeper, you have to be able to take this data and learn from it and figure out what to pass to Runkeeper.  So I think it's both. I think that you Apple systems need to know in the same way that Google now tells you went to leave because of traffic.  I mean, there is some level of how to handle this data, how to analyze this data and how to package it up.  I do think developers will build a lot of the end apps on top of that.  But developers are going to go to the platforms that are the easiest to work with and give them the most actionable data.  And if you're pulling it off devices, there's a lot of software that Apple has to build.  And I think if they do go that health apps route to some of this, they'll look to do themselves much in the same way they do on phones.  Right. They have some apps like Maps and they have others.

Start time: 4349.94
End time: 4362.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But can you think of in any case where Apple has done this well, something like this?  Well, any case, I mean, I look at mobile me, I look at Maps, I look at all of this.

Start time: 4362.74
End time: 4382.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This kind of middleware better. I think Maps, they did a nice job.  I think it's just they are so far behind Google in terms of the years of experience and learning from the data and in the capabilities.  I think they also underestimated how hard a problem that was.  But if they've learned from that, I was going to answer your question, Leo.

Start time: 4383.00

Start time: 4392.64
End time: 4407.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the problem with Siri is it doesn't talk to anything really yet, too.  So Siri is a great example of where they had a great interface and a very nice sort of version one.  It does less serious.  It doesn't talk to anything. It does.  They thought the app they bought did more.

Start time: 4408.29

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could make reservations.

Start time: 4409.97
End time: 4434.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but again, we're talking about perceptions.  And in that regard, I think I think that Siri like first of all, the way they've crafted the personality, I think is very smart.  I think that they the snarky answers and the and the oh, have you tried asking Siri this stuff like it's definitely underutilized and it's not where it needs to be.  They need to be down the road being able to buy subscriptions to various personal assistance from Jarvis on on down.  I could give you some examples.

Start time: 4434.74
End time: 4449.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Passbook is another example where lots of promise.  Yep. Very little delivery.  Yeah. And I'm not I'm not knocking Apple.  I just think that this is a tough thing for to do in general.  And Apple is unlike Google's data driven from day one.  Apple's a hardware company.

Start time: 4449.46
End time: 4483.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also think and it goes deep into the cultures.  I mean, Apple Apple waits to release things and till they're sort of ready at these stages instead of iterating constantly.  That actually holds you back in this kind of service model and software and services.  And I think, you know, maps is probably not a bad analogy, actually.  A lot of acquisitions ahead of time.  A lot of work went into the data.  You know, the product had some problems, but frankly, it wasn't as horrible.  I think as people said, and now they're slowly, slowly improving it.  So if they've learned from that, I think that they have a shot in this other space.  But I do think Google will eat their lunch on it.

Start time: 4483.58
End time: 4530.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And don't forget, too, that this is a hardware product that is going to rely.  Apple's not a hardware company.  It's a hardware and software together making products company.  OK, yes, and this is a piece of hardware that is going to require software integration to succeed or fail.  And I think Apple is much better at that than they are little software add-ons to existing.  The iPhone is not going to succeed or fail based on a passbook or maps.  It's an ecosystem.  Right, but this imaginary soon to come watch like whatever, that software's got to work or that product is going to be worthless.  And I think Apple's actually very good at that.  They understand that.  And that may be why we haven't seen it yet is because this is hard and they have to do it right.  They can't kind of do it halfway and hope that it's OK because this whole product will fail if they don't do the software right.

I think a lot of people buy one, but then better deliver or you're going to really have a problem.  And the one advantage now I'll step back and say the one advantage Apple has is nobody trusts Google or not.  Well, I don't know.  Do people trust Google?  No, a lot of people don't.

And as we as they as Google wants to gather more information like critical stuff like health information, they might get more nervous indeed.  Whereas Apple people trust Apple.  Yes or no?  Yeah, no, I think they do.  I think they do more than Google.

Start time: 4588.28
End time: 4631.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it also depends how ultimately you use this.  I mean, I think you're completely right.  Like, can Apple build some basic software on top of it that integrates with APIs to tell you what to eat or to go to sleep or to go to the doctor?  Yes.  But what about when our health data changes our thermostat based on how we feel?  You know, and that bigger picture where it's really it's integrating to so many different services.  That's where I, you know, running ahead.  But I think that that's where that competency and data and integrations could come back to bite Apple.  But I think, you know, for the beginning, you can start very basic.  I do wonder, though, I guess it depends on the price point.  But can you really, really get mass market with something that tells you how well you slept?

And I mean, what I've learned in the last year is that the ability to glance at your wrist and see if that text that just came in is worth responding to or not doing some very specific, simple triage, not doing phone things on it, but just doing some glances.  Well, that has value.

Transcript:  Like this is why you don't have to worry about Apple.  Apple can throw whatever horse crap it wants to with medical whatever and sensors that taste your sweat and tell you if you have this much or that much or whatever.  It doesn't matter because as long as it works and doesn't overstep and has good battery life, people will discover the joys of not pulling your phone out every single time a message comes in.  It's got to look good.  That thing.  I have a smart contact lenses.

End time: 4736.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like everyone, it's easy to find the examples.  Oh, I was in a meeting and someone texted me and it was urgent and I could solve the problem.  You know, I just I don't know how much and you know, I've my Pebbles still sort of in a drawer.  So I should really.

Start time: 4737.58
End time: 4774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so crazy because like I use the wearing.  I don't see a pebble.  Is that a pebble?  Oh, there you go.  Right there.  Wow.  There's a pebble.  And in fact, like little things like like nowadays, I'll come I'll be on the other side of the house because I always leave my phone on silent now, which I don't have to have annoying loud, you know, exploding sound effects whenever someone calls now because I could be on the other side of the house and just look at me like, oh, someone's calling me right now.  And I'll go run into the other room and then realize I'm not going to get to the phone in time.  And so I'll just hit answer when I'm still around the corner.  And I know I bought myself like five, ten more seconds before I get there to pick up the phone.  But you can't talk to the pebble.

I probably saved just in the first few months, I've saved hours, literal hours of this crap.  If you love hold on, it's there.  There it is.  If you love that moment, then don't get a pebble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will put mine on.  Yeah, we're going to, it's two for two against.  We'll try it.  But I do think if Apple made something that was gorgeous, I'd be much more likely to wear it than this, which frankly doesn't look, even the steel, we just showed the steel, doesn't look much better than that Casio.

Start time: 4841.00
End time: 4859.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  I think we should look more like that Casio.  My point is that there are those table stakes that we often ignore when we're talking about these exciting health things.  There will probably be some very nice integration with your iPhone's notifications and remote control and other things like that.  That may be also reasons.  I don't see how it would.

Once again, gridlock is coming.  There's a storm up north.  We got rain here.  We got flash flood alerts.  This is a terrible time to try to do business.  But go to meeting solves that.  Go to meeting means you can meet.  You can collaborate online no matter what the weather is like outside.  In fact, frankly, I wish the weather bad all the time.  I could stay home.  We could do go to meeting.  I know teams that keep go to meeting running all the time.  You could see, share screens.  So you see what people are working on.  And by the way, you could pass the screen around.  So everybody in the meeting could show their screen.  Great for coding together, that kind of thing.  If you turn on the video cameras, and everything these days have video cameras,  you can see each other in crystal clear, high def video.  So when you can't make it to the office, you can still meet.  You can be productive.  Go to meeting is awesome.  You can even host a meeting, present from an iPad.

It sounds like it's not always accurate because they're apparently doing  last minute negotiations to bring things back.  So it will look like it's timing off and then it won't.  That's interesting.

This is what you get in Europe.  You'll get a little box.  The waiter comes to you.  He swipes your card.  You enter your pin number.  You pay that way.  You know what you paid.  You may or may not have to sign.  But the pin is sufficient.  The idea is, now, I don't know why we never adopted this.  Some people said that Americans think it's too complicated.  Mastercard.

Then they said, well, actually, it's probably more like 100 million credit cards, including  pin numbers.  And Target, ATM cards and all that, breached.  I think that was probably the last straw.  I imagine these credit card companies had to issue millions of new cards to people.

Start time: 5279.00
End time: 5291.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And finally just said, so now you stick this thing into the slot.  It reads the little chip that's on the card.  There's a microchip in the card.  Yeah.  And then you put in your pin and that's what unlocks it.  And knowing the credit card number won't get you anywhere.  Right.

Start time: 5292.04
End time: 5309.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have to match.  Now, of course, you could make a card with a chip in it.  You could duplicate it.  But it's a lot harder, more expensive.  The chip has to be, you know, it's probably encrypted.  I think it's a little bit more tricksy.  Although, never count a hacker out and I wouldn't be surprised if they figured this out.

They come with a little thing and you...  It's a different thing culturally, but I think the benefit is that if somebody tries to steal  your credit card number, you don't have to change your number and change all your auto  pay on all your accounts and things like that.

Transcript:  Well, and you know what?  Actually, you bring up a good point.  If going chip and pin is a minor inconvenience every single time I use it, but it saves me  from the major inconvenience of them shutting off my credit card because they see something  they don't understand, then I might be on board with that.  But I don't know, just structurally.  Again, I understand why they want it.  I'm just surprised you guys want it.  That's what's weird to me.  Well, as I want no credit cards.

Start time: 5434.00
End time: 5443.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5444.00
End time: 5495.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But traveling, traveling outside the U.S. right now is really scary because you can't  buy gas.  You can't buy gas because you have a swipe card.  They won't take it.  Some places only do chip and pin and other places they can do American style transactions.  But the people in the stores aren't trained on how to do it.  I had to show them the slot at one place in London where they're like, oh, that's what  the slot is for.  It's like, yeah, you slide the card.  Oh, we've had that slot for years.  We never knew what it was for.  There was a small family of birds nesting in it.  And so for international travelers, this will be great because our cards will be equipped  to use that system and they won't look at us like we're crazy people.  But you're right.  You're right.  I can't tell you how many times I've left my wallet at home but had my smartphone in  my pocket and realized I should be able to pay for something with this and I can't do  it.

I'm going to say we won't accept it.  We won't trade it.  We don't want it.  We don't like it.  I understand why the government's like that.

Transcript:  Yes, if you have a centralized government, having a second currency system that's out of your control is not desirable.  On the other hand, it is probably very prevalent.  I'm sure Barter and other sort of systems occur in, you know, the more repressive the government, the more likely you've got that, right?  And using other currencies.  Yeah.  They can't track that.  So here's the Mt.  Gox statement.  You parsed this, Jessica.  OK.  In our efforts to resolve the issue being encountered by various Bitcoin withdrawals, it was determined.  That's always a sign, by the way.  It was passive voice.  It was determined.  It was determined.  That the increase in the flow of withdrawal requests has hindered our efforts on a technical level to understand the issue thoroughly.  The system needs to be in a static state.  So a temporary pause in withdrawal requests.

Transcript:  That's so much nonsense because, look, I mean, that's that's the Forex exchanges are all based on the ability to have a dynamic marketplace where people speculate and some win and some lose.  And some form of equilibrium is created as a result.  And it's like, I don't know, like, who cares if the government's disapprove?  I would.  The more the government's disapprove of Bitcoin, the more legitimate I think the platform sounds to me.

Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing about this, though, is it.  So we did a story a while ago about what a Bitcoin bank run would look like just from the sense of how much liquidity is there in the system.  And you have all these different marketplaces for buying and selling.  But a lot of those businesses are making money by themselves trading Bitcoin, which means they may not have cash or Bitcoin or anything to pay out.  And so this, which I actually just heard about, raises a lot of alarm bells in my head about whether Mount Gox is in liquidity issues.  And that that is a big concern.  And we have to remember, you know, this isn't the first time.  I mean, Bitcoin's been around for a long time and there have been issues like this in the past.  So separate from what happens in terms of regulation or whether it gets adopted as a payment mechanism, the sort of stability of the current system is, I think, in question now because of this.  Perception is very problematic.  Perception in something like this is very important.

Ran the Bitcoin Foundation, I believe.  Of course, happened with real money.  That's normal.  But the problem is at this point, perception is very important in terms of the value of Bitcoin.  You see, it's dropping in value.  So I don't know.  I've always wondered if Bitcoin is just a pyramid scheme to benefit Satoshi Nakamoto and the others who created Bitcoin, who presumably have mass amounts.

But with like US currency or a euro or any any government currency, we sort of have this expectation that that hallucination will continue for a long period of time unless there's a zombie apocalypse or something like that.  Bitcoin, I still am in that state of I'm not sure whether the fever will break and this hallucination will end.  And that's the scary thing for me about it.  But it's like I mean, that's fine.

Shopify had an app.  It took about 20 minutes to install it.  And now, you know, the moment it goes, whatever the current exchange rate is, I get real money.  Like, I don't think it's as dramatic a decision as you guys are making it out to be.  I think it's a bunch of little guys like me saying like, yeah, sure, that's a type of money.  Sure, go.

And as far as like, like, well, I just think that the people who got in early want to get rich.  Hells yes.  That's why that's why they design that.  Why they built this platform.  That's the reason you build a platform that you hope the whole world will like is so that you can get rich making it.  And the best way to do that is to make a really good platform that a lot of people like.  And in this case, you know, current like real money, I'm using air quotes here, is inherently inflationary.  The Fed just prints dollars or whatever.  That's not a great system that I would build from the from the beginning.  And actually, that's a lot.

This is a direct copy with one exception.  The idea of secret is you share stuff.  It's on your it's like Twitter, but anonymous and you share stuff.  But the difference and the reason I think it's so successful is unlike whisper,  which was totally anonymous, you can tell if the people were sharing are in your address book  or friends of people in your address.

So everyone calls Evernote and all their Evernote sources and says.  And so Phil Libman, the CEO of Evernote, tweeted, there's no truth to this.  But I mean, the Wall Street Journal covered it like people.  I mean, this this is what distracted a bunch of tech reporters, which for tiny  plugs for why the information is awesome.  Squirrel.

If you are sending stuff out as your business, does he work at the post office?  Is that why you patted his leg after I said that?  I'm so sorry, sir.  But it's true.  I love the post office.  But if you want to mail out bills or flyers or promotional material, if you say you know, you work at Etsy, you make this beautiful hand macromade golf club cover and you sell it.  You don't want to take it to the post office and give it to them.  You want to be able to ship it without getting up from your desk.  That's what stamps dot com does.  It turns you into a fulfillment house, professional.  Postage rates change.  They just changed again.  You don't have to worry.  Unlike, say, in a postage meter, you don't have to pay to get the postage rates update.  You don't have to bring it into the post office.  It just happens automatically.  It's software.  So you'll lose all those time consuming trips to the post office.  You can buy and print official U.S. postage.  You can print stamps.  I do.  But you can also print right on the envelope with your logo, the return address.  It'll pull the address of the person you're mailing to from your address book or from  QuickBooks or from the Etsy site or PayPal or Amazon or eBay and on and on and on.  If it's international, it fills out the forms for all the international mailing.  The post office actually comes to you and picks it up.  There's this thing called the mail carrier.  It's incredible.  They come.  They have a leather bag.  They put your thing in and they carry it off.  In fact, there's even a button on stamps dot com where if you missed the pickup, says  come back and they'll come back.  So, I mean, it's just you're going to love it.  I'm being a little silly, but really I do use it and love it.  We it's just fabulous for our little business.  You know what I found out?  You use it for your your store, right?

And if you're a content producer, I love what they're doing at Patreon because somebody  can pledge, let's say, a dollar an episode.  So it's four bucks a month.  Like once you get on their credit card at four dollars a month, they have to make an  active decision to unsubscribe from your show, which means like somebody to acquire a Patreon  on Patreon dot com is much, much more valuable than getting a big payout from a Kickstarter  campaign early on because that money runs out.

Start time: 6773.12
End time: 6819.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's per month.  See, this is the only this is the only thing that's frustrating is it gives a false sense  of success sometimes.  For example, like, let's say let's say that that was a thousand dollars per episode and  it would say they're making a thousand dollars per episode.  And then everybody who's a fan of the show thinks like, well, I don't need to help.  They're making a thousand dollars per episode.  You can the the the pledges per episode can be inconsistent with the max pledges that  people give.  So, for example, people can pledge ten dollars per episode and then set a max of ten dollars  per month.  So so your first episode, you get a thousand dollars.  Next episode, you get eight hundred.  Next episode, you get four hundred.  Next episode and so on.  So but they're but they're aware of that problem and they're figuring out a way to make it  a little more transparent.  But I think I think it's a great it's a great way for independents to to get their stuff  out.

Transcript:  I think it's absolutely.  And I think that, of course, we're obviously free ad supported media, which is a model  I like.  Jessica's a paywall, which is another model that works for the right kind of content.  We couldn't do that.  Nobody pay for us.  I'd like the idea of crowdsourcing it.  There are lots of ways to do it.  There are lots of ways to do it.  And that's the point is there there needs to be for an ecosystem to be growing.  We've got to solve that because we've we've moved from the days of mainstream content  into this democratic form of content, which is so great.

Transcript:  Do you remember Michael Robertson of MP3.com predicted the era of the middle class rockstar?  And I think how much he was so right about that.  So it's also it's also middle class patrons and middle class media moguls and middle class.  I mean, it's it's amazing these these micro networks and the ability to reach an audience  of just a couple of thousand people is enough to you know, my friends over who do the Rage  Select podcast, you know, don't you know, I have a fraction of your numbers or even  of my numbers, but they're super passionate and they're able to, you know, stay afloat  doing because of direct contributions through Patreon.  It also affects.

Transcript:  I mean, so we're a subscription business, not just to have revenue and sustain us, but  we think we write better content.  So we don't cover the day to day tech news.  We focus on in depth stories that sort of drive the conversation that aren't being  reported in the daily news cycle.  But, you know, I think different kinds of content when you have certain business models,  they encourage and create a type of content on top of that model.  And so one of the things that's exciting about we're sort of seeing the subscription  blossom a bit in the media business is because I think it's going to change the more types  of content that we see will have greater diversity and we'll have more depth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's always been the concern that investigative journalism, for instance, which is very expensive,  would die without these big patrons.  But it's clear that we're starting to see now a way that this can work.  And I love Michael Robinson, Robertson's middle class rock star and middle class patron, too,  because, of course, it was only the Mediches that could, you know, have enough money,  enough surplus to have Michelangelo paint.  But now anybody can, you know, a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there.  And I think that's a more natural system.  And I think more sustainable.

Like because of the on the one hand, you know, yes, it's a problem that everything's so  fractious nowadays, we all live our own little social bubbles.  But the but the benefit of that is that you can you can find yourself connecting with  content that's almost made specifically for you, which is an experience that only the  very rich were able to do just 20, 30 years ago.  We need that.

Transcript:  And people just they attach to some of this stuff.  I mean, podcasts are a good example.  Websites are a good example where they feel so attached to it.  And it used to be there was nothing you could do other than to send them maybe you buy a  T-shirt if they do a T-shirt sale.  But there's really nothing you could do to say I appreciate you other than, you know,  just go to their site.  And that's the nice thing about something like Patreon is you can say I like this so much  that, yeah, I will throw in five dollars every time you do this, you know, this podcast or  five dollars a month.  And, you know, that you just couldn't do that before.  It's not the mandatory micro payment like to read this article.  You must put in ten cents.  It's more like if you really love this stuff, support it, support it.  And, you know, it's easy, which is it's a great idea.

We have we're working on some stuff on it because I don't actually think that user growth is the right met only metric to look at Twitter's user engagements.  There's a lot and there's also different kinds of businesses that can go into.  But the results spook the market a little bit.  But, you know, the P multiples still 50 years.  I mean, it's huge.  So investors are still, you know, the stock is very, very.  It's not. I'm sorry.  Not 50. It's way, way above 50.  More than 50.  Oh, considerably.  The stock is at 50, but it's north of 100.  So investors still have very high expectations for Twitter.

Transcript:  Wow.  The speaking of Twitter, the dying Chinese moon rover, Jade Rabbit.  This is straight out of Wally tweeted.  It's goodbye.  The rover is going through the two week lunar night.  Very cold.  It's built to survive it, but normally it would fold up its little rover solar panels and hibernate.  And it wasn't able to due to a technical malfunction.  So there's some concern that after the lunar night ends that Jade Rabbit will be no more.  And apparently it's Chinese minders who are tweeting for it.  Now, they say tweet.  I couldn't find the tweets.  They're awfully long.  But then I realized it is in Chinese.  It's possible because it's such a compact language that this is 140 characters.  It looks like it.  Although I should have gone to bed this morning, my masters discovered something abnormal with my mechanical control system.  My masters are staying up all night.  That's he should talk like how working for a solution.  I heard their eyes are looking more like my red rabbit eyes.  Nevertheless, I'm aware I might not survive this lunar night.  That's kind of beautiful.  Only the Chinese could do this, I think.  If this journey must come to an early end, I am not afraid.  Whether or not the repairs are successful, I believe even my malfunctions will provide my masters with valuable information and experience.  I don't know.  It's hard not to cry when you read this.  The sun has already set here.  The temperature is falling very quickly.  I've said a lot today, yet I still feel it's not enough.  I'll tell everyone a secret.  You know, you should use secret.  Actually, I'm not feeling especially sad.  Just like any other hero, I've only encountered a little problem while on my own adventure.
