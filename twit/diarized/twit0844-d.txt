Yeah.  It's funny, of all the big, big stories to cover, it seems like Windows 11 is one  of the smallest, but we'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Also some brand new Surfassi with us also from Microsoft herself, Christina Warren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no, things are looking up though.  I have to say, this is the first time I felt hopeful in quite some time about the  virus.  It seems to be that we're turning to turn the table across the country, which  is really good.  Also with us, great to see Dan Morin.  He's our Apple guy, six colors.com.  Great to have you, Dan.  Pleasure to be here.  Apple had a little Apple owned last week.  Right.  So you have to sit back.  Take a week off.  Take a week off.  Yeah.  Cause yeah, that's actually my first question.  Don't they have some laptops to announce?  When are they going to do that?  Anytime soon?

Start time: 268.60
End time: 292.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, yeah, I mean, I think the guess is sometime.  I mean, October seems a pretty solid bet.  Probably not next week since the, I know the pixel event is coming up on a Tuesday,  which is Apple's traditional day.  So probably that last Tuesday, it seems like, which is also right before their  quarterly earnings call.  So that seems like a pretty good point.  That's a good bet.  The 26th.  Yeah.  I would say the 26th.  Yeah.  That's my bet.

Start time: 292.76
End time: 326.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're going to be doing the pixel six.  We'll do a live stream, Jason Hall and I on the 19th.  That's a week from Tuesday.  Apple usually sends out invits a week ahead of time.  So I'm thinking we'll that day also get an invite for a 26th event.  That makes sense.  Thank you, Dan, for clarifying all that.  Happy to help.  So Christina and I were talking about our exciting new framework laptop, but you're  going to want, you're going to want a 16 inch MacBook pro with the M1X or whatever.  You're going to want that.  Obviously.  This is the problem.  Obviously.  This is a terrible time of year for tech lovers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything.  Everything.  Just got an iPhone 13.  Now I got to get a pixel six.  Well, wait a minute.  What about the court, the duo two from Microsoft?  What about, yeah.  Gosh.  All right.  We'll change the subject.  Let's talk about the internet instead of, uh, instead of hardware, because of course  this was Facebook's terrible, no good, very bad week in so many ways.  Started last Sunday with the 60 minutes interview.  The Facebook whistleblower finally came forward and name is Frances Hogan.  She worked for a couple of years at Facebook.  Uh, what was her, what was her title?  She, she was working on data scientist.  She's a data scientist and I think she was working on election fraud.

Start time: 375.48
End time: 379.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was like on the, on, on the information integrity team or something like that.  Yeah.

Start time: 379.49
End time: 508.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But, uh, and I don't think she went there to blow the whistle or anything.  I think she legitimately wanted to help Facebook do a better job, but when she  saw what was going on, she started amassing documents, uh, documents from other  departments, things she had access to, but wasn't working on.  And released them eventually to the wall street journal, which has spent two  weeks doing its Facebook files bit by bit, revealing things.  And I guess the top line was Instagram makes young women feel terrible.  Facebook knows about a COVID-19 fraud, but can't do anything about it.  Uh, and in her division, Facebook, the day after the election stopped protecting  people from misinformation, which possibly had something to do with the January  6th insurrection.  Uh, so, so that was Sunday night.  The next day, Facebook in completely coincidentally demonstrates to the world  why it desperately needs Facebook by going offline for five hours.  Some people might've had the opposite conclusion.  Uh, oh, I don't really need that so much, but, but Facebook, Instagram,  and WhatsApp go down the world.  Tremble's three and a half billion users go, what happened?  Uh, it turns out that was a error, uh, in, by, uh, an engineer in one of their  backbone facilities, Facebook published a post, which I think is accurate.  You never know with Facebook.  It's not fully detailed, but it's the way they work.  They have a lot of network operation centers, all of which are interconnected  via a backbone, so you'll request an image from one and it can ask for it by  its private backbone from the other.  Those backbones are commonly taken down and updated.  Uh, in this case, one was being taken down.  They ran a program that was supposed to test backbone capacity  before they put it back up.  The program had a bug and in the process, they turned off all of the  backbones, then all of the routers.  And then, and imagine this at Microsoft, they turned off all of the security  stuff so they couldn't even get into the network centers to fix the problem.  The card readers stopped working.

Start time: 510.00
End time: 518.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like dispatch, like special ops teams kind of like to the data centers  from what I read to say, like to get in and actually wire cutters with bull cutters.

Start time: 519.74
End time: 609.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, at that point, if you, if you, if you've, if you've broken everything  to the point that you can't get inside the buildings, I mean, we've had, we've  had internal stuff go down before we're like our internal, you know, like  SharePoint or, or, or teams or email went down and, and that sucks.  Like, don't get me wrong.  Like that's awful.  But I can't, I mean, when, when it's as bad as like the building doors don't  unlock, oh my God, I can't imagine the amount of, of, um, terror and, uh, just,  you know, like triage that, that had to go into place to a get things back online.  And then it takes hours once you do, you know, change the configuration thing for  everything to rep, you know, repopulate through, you know, DNS and, and to get  the BGP routes, you know, reset again, as, as well as standing up stuff that got,  you know, shut down that isn't used to being down.  I mean, and then I'm sure, you know, testing everything to make sure  everything's working the right way.  I'm not a fan of Facebook, but I, I had nothing but empathy for the engineers  that had to work on like getting that back up because the pressure must have  just been terrible because not just, because as you said, three and a half  billion people, you know, it's, it's your internal systems would be bad enough,  but then all of your external systems, all of your customers, nothing is  happening. You're hearing, I'm sure nothing but phone calls from people  screaming, when is this going to be done?  Like there, there's a term we use in the industry called a hug ops, you know,  kind of like, you know, giving like empathy for the, for the people who have  to build stuff back up again.

Start time: 610.22
End time: 613.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is there an emoji for that?  I want a hug ops emoji.  I like that.

Start time: 613.52
End time: 622.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There should be an emoji for that.  But, but I mean, like I said, I don't think Facebook is the greatest company,  but I had nothing but empathy for, for that scenario because that's just  nightmarish. I can't even imagine.

Start time: 623.22
End time: 645.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't look like it was human error.  It looks like it was, as always in these cases, a cascade of unexpected  consequences that brought everything down.  And by the way, cloud flare, which had a great blog post, trying to understand  this before Facebook revealed what really happened, pointed out that this  affects everybody because suddenly all these requests to Facebook are getting  rejected. And so people keep refreshing and they keep hitting refresh,

Start time: 645.22
End time: 646.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which just makes it worse.  Right.

Start time: 646.72
End time: 680.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every, the whole internet gets suddenly sluggish.  We are so interdependent.  I have to admit, and this is just paranoid Leo.  I imagine Mark Zuckerberg and his mountain lair saying, we'll show those  people and pull the, pull the plug for one minute, make it five hours.  And the, but that it didn't reflect well on Facebook.  I don't think they would have done that.  So the weird thing is it went back down for another two hours on Friday.  You would think that, oh, well, we got this all.  We're never going to let that happen again.  We tested everything, right?

Start time: 680.70
End time: 684.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We, we checked it all out, right?  Got you guys.  You guys tested that, right?

Start time: 684.10
End time: 685.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You checked it in one week.

Start time: 685.56
End time: 714.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twice.  Right.  I mean, I have to imagine that I don't know what happened with that one, but I  have to imagine when you're saying stuff back up and you're in such a hurry and  you have so much pressure to get it back up, that if maybe something wasn't, you  know, propagated the right way and something was misconfigured, but it came  back online, who knows, you know, but at least that one, I think it just seemed  like it was normal outage.  It wasn't like, okay, internally, everything is down and externally.  I mean, cause to me that's the nightmare scenario of everything being down  everywhere.

Start time: 714.44
End time: 748.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't intentional, but it did underscore how important Facebook is to  the world economy, especially in countries like Brazil, where everybody uses WhatsApp  and not just for talking to each other, but for business.  So many, many mom and pop businesses lost thousands of dollars due to the outage.  It really shows how interconnected and how important how, how into the wiring  Facebook is, which just to me means another reason we got to really scrutinize them.

Start time: 752.34
End time: 795.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just saying all the stuff that we've heard recently with Apple and  antitrust as well, but Facebook has also been under scrutiny for that.  And I think it is a good example of the fact that there are so many services and  so many things that depend so heavily on it.  I was thinking back to, I was on vacation in Mexico a few years ago, and if you were  in your room and you wanted to contact the front desk, they didn't have phones.  You WhatsApped the front desk to ask for a big service.  Yeah, that was just the way it was.  Right.  And it's like, it's so prevalent in so people are so dependent on it that you  have that moment of being like, well, is this a monopoly?  Like, is this something where they control so much of this?  But because it's so global, rather than being focused in the U S you don't see as  much scrutiny on it, at least from like the U S government.

Start time: 796.34
End time: 807.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, no, you're exactly right.  Like I've even dealt with big brands in other countries where their customer  service is almost exclusively through WhatsApp.  And, and it's, you know, it's just like, that's just the way that you contact people.

Start time: 808.54
End time: 862.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so the whistleblower testified in front of the Senate, the commerce  committee on Tuesday, and basically said, it's time for Facebook to declare moral  bankruptcy, which I thought was an interesting concept.  We'd know about email bankruptcy where you just go, you throw up your hands and  say, you know, I'm never going to get to your email.  I'm throwing them all out and starting over.  She, her opinion was Facebook should say, yeah, we didn't mean to create this  monster, but it's a mess and we don't know how to fix it.  Help us.  I'm not sure I agree.  And I very curious what you all think.  I'll start, I'll start with you, Dan.  I don't know if I think Congress is the place to go for help because I don't think  they, I mean, any, anybody who thinks Finsta is a Facebook service clearly should not  be in a position to regulate Facebook.  That was of course,

Start time: 864.10
End time: 887.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's hard to say because the question is when you get to that size and Apple is  also in a position that's dealing with this right now, there really aren't a lot  of other things to turn to besides government regulation.  Right.  I mean, the market is so self-sustaining at that point because it's so big and it  keeps getting bigger that I think that it's really tough to be like, well, the  competition will take them down.  I mean, how could you start a competition at this point to take on Facebook?  Nor could users.

Start time: 887.88
End time: 892.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are so large.  We've seen dump Facebook movements, but they've not in any way.  It doesn't catch on.

Start time: 892.84
End time: 928.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, I think that's, that's the question is, and I agree that the, the  Congress is not always the most technologically savvy, but I think in terms  of sort of trying to figure out like, what are the tools we can deploy?  They may be the only, yeah, they may be the only recourse at this point because  I don't know the problem.  It kind of goes even larger than this in some ways, because as long as Facebook  has that obligation to its shareholders to try and maximize value, they're going  to try to make as much money as possible.  And sometimes that's going to mean cutting those moral corners.  And I don't think there's an incentive for them not to do that, despite  what Zuckerberg says.

Start time: 928.76
End time: 990.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Christina, very famously in 98, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft.  Yep.  And while, you know, it went on for a decade and eventually there was a consent  decree, I think it's safe to say that that was successful in the sense that it  got Microsoft to kind of sit back a little bit, not be so aggressive in the  market, not pursue its monopoly.  You know, Mike, one of the things Microsoft does is kind of a Facebook's  taking a page from that playbook is if there's a competitor, invite them in,  find out how they work, then either buy them or steal their technology and  duplicate it.  Microsoft used to do that, engulf and devour, but they stopped.  Embrace, extend, extinguish.  Yes, that's the word.  That's the phrase.  So, but I think it's fair to say that that DOJ investigation succeeded in  stopping.  And here's the interesting point.  It forced Microsoft to reassess, do the right thing, pivot and actually become  a stronger company under Sacha Nadella with web services.

Start time: 992.24
End time: 992.33
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 992.64
End time: 1002.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's a good point.  I think the interesting thing there, I mean, obviously there were different  scenarios.  I think that I've talked to people who, I mean, obviously this was decades before  I worked at the company.  Right.

Start time: 1002.90
End time: 1006.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, and so I don't know what was happening then.  You don't speak for the company in any respect.

Start time: 1007.05
End time: 1076.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't.  I don't speak for the company in any respect, but, but, and this was decades  before I worked there.  But, you know, what the, the circumstances with that, I think, people that I've  talked to who either were there then, and, and, and some of them are still  Microsoft, some of them aren't, you know, what they've said is that it did maybe  change like the nature and how things were focused on the company and the  culture.  Yeah.  But, but it took a long time.  There was a dark period after that investigation where the company did  suffer for a long time.  So I think you can look on the net of it, that even though the, the DOJ  investigation was ultimately unsuccessful, like they, they, you know,  Microsoft won an appeal.  Um, they weren't broken up.  There were some consent things and some changes that were made, but ultimately  the government didn't win.  Um, there were still by going through that process, I think it's, it'd be, uh,  it's impossible to say that there wasn't substantive impact on the company.  Uh, but what's interesting is that although that, I think you could look at it  and say, well, see, this had a good impact.  It also did during that period of time.  If you look at like when, you know, the, um, the appeals and all those things  were happening was the exact same time that Google and Facebook were really  starting to rise.

Start time: 1077.60
End time: 1082.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can make the case that if Microsoft hadn't been slapped down, Google and  Facebook might not exist.

Start time: 1083.23
End time: 1149.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And, and so, you know, I'm not opposed to government intervention and I'm not  opposed to there being regulations.  I think that that's important.  I do, I'm with you.  I'm a little bit leery sometimes.  I think on just deferring to them because I don't think they understand the  technology well enough.  And, and I do feel like sometimes some of these things that are interconnected to  the point where, I mean, this is actually, I think something that some of these  companies, Facebook in particular have learned from the Microsoft, uh, you know,  uh, lawsuit stuff is that the way that they've built their services together,  it would be very difficult to break them apart in a traditional way.  So I'm, I'm in favor of more oversight and regulation, um, if it's done the  right way, but I'm also kind of leery about what impact it can actually have.  I mean, if your goal is really just to slow down the business and make them have  to reassess, then say that.  Um, it, but if you're saying that your goal is to actually, you know, make some  sort of substantive change on, on a policy level, I guess I'm a little bit more  cynical and skeptical that that's actually going to be achieved through  the legislation.

Start time: 1149.92
End time: 1156.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think, Daniel, can we learn anything from what the DOJ did with  Microsoft?  Is that any template for what could happen with Facebook?  Would it work?

Start time: 1157.84
End time: 1260.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a very obvious, as you all pointed out, complicated problem.  Yes.  One that we've predicted and seen even in dystopian movies like Blade Runner  and Robocop, where we always see the runaway corporation that becomes so vital  and crucial to the infrastructure and systems that it's almost impossible to  displace it without taking down the entire system.  And that's where these services are headed.  I'm not sure we're there right now.  You know, Facebook went down and as you pointed out, there were some ramifications  from it, but it's not like we headed towards nuclear war.  It was just very inconvenient.  As far as you know, Daniel, as far as you know.  As far as we know.  Right.  But you, you know, you're also right where traditionally government intervention  would be the solution here.  But as demonstrated this week, the government is quite at this point incapable  of understanding the technology and it's, it's easy to make fun of them for that.  However, if you don't do this stuff full time, it is very difficult to understand  all those, those details.  I'm not really sure we, where we go from here.  I'm actually pretty down on this stuff because I don't see any obvious  solutions to fixing this, you know, Dan pointed out correctly that there's no  incentive here, you know, capitalism is an amoral system.  So I always kind of chuckle when people say, you know, these companies are  doing the wrong thing, it's like, there is no wrong or right.  The only wrong or right is internally is do they make money for their shareholders?  That's, that's literally all that matters.  So it's a little weird to give moral lessons to Facebook who clearly don't care.  And there it's not in their charter to care.

Start time: 1260.36
End time: 1284.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but in this respect, we are maybe making them care because it could  impact their business, right?  So there is a little bit of a stick that government and the, and the  department of justice can wield saying, well, what we can, we can hurt you  financially.  And so if you're thinking long-term financial success, you might say, you  know, maybe we should be a little bit better at what we do.

Transcript:  It's just historically where we come down to like fines for government, from  the government, these companies make so much money now that they just pay it off.  Look at the new funds.  Google pays $168 million.

I mean, there's the whole thing about when the, you know, when Facebook went  down for five hours and Mark Zuckerberg lost $7 billion, everyone's like, boohoo,  he's got 120 billion.

Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg's response to the testimony was very typical Facebook,  which is a lot of hand waving misdirection.  And ultimately Facebook says, yeah, regulate the internet, get rid of that  section 230, we don't like that, which had nothing to do with this at all.  He writes on Facebook, which I would, as you can see, I'm not logged in because  I don't have a Facebook account, but I can kind of read what he's, you want  to see more of Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook?  No, no, thank you.  Uh, no, he wrote many of the claims don't make sense.  Now, Mark is a smart guy, went to Harvard, maybe he didn't graduate.  Okay.  But he went to Harvard.  He's a smart guy.  If we wanted to ignore research, he says, why would we create an industry leading  research program to understand these important issues in the first place?  Well, maybe you created it and then didn't like the answer.  I ever think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we didn't care about fighting harmful content, why would we employ so many more  people dedicated to this than any other company in our space?  Why?  I ask you, if we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an  industry leading standard?  This I questioned for transparency and reporting on what we're doing.  What we know is Facebook is actively defeating the attempts from outside  investigators, like at NYU, from seeing this material, they didn't want to  release this material to the public.  They were forced to buy this whistleblower and even then only released a little bit  of the research, not all of it.  Yeah.  That's the question, Mark.  If you didn't care about understanding these issues, why would you create an  industry leading research group and then bury the results if you, if you, and this  is what I think Facebook ought to do.  Now, I don't know if you can make them do this, maybe shame them into doing this.  They need to not only release the results of their research, but they have to open  themselves to outside researchers and then we all need to hear the results.  And then we as a society can decide if it does in fact turn out, Facebook kind of  says, well, in 12 out of 13 points, young women feel better on Instagram.  It's just that one 13th.  And by the way, Francis Hogan said, do not buy this because only 10% of people who  smoke die of cancer.  It's still a problem.  Okay.  Facebook is really acting like big tobacco here.

If they, again, Daniel reiterated, like, if it doesn't make money, that's the only  thing that actually makes a difference to them.  So I think, I think they have shown they have no shame and that is not a good way  to leverage them.

Transcript:  I also think that they've convinced themselves that they are acting morally  and ethically in the right way and that they have good intentions.  I don't have as many friends who work at Facebook anymore as I used to, but I've  known many people who've worked there.  Yes.  Yeah.  Very good people.  That's the thing.  Many of them, I mean, especially 2016.  And that was when the public shift really started to happen.  It was, it was around 2016 and around a lot of the misinformation stuff, when the  stuff about Cambridge Analytica came out, you know, Myanmar, the election integrity  stuff, and internally, a lot of the people that I knew who worked there had a really  hard time with the public perception changing because many of them, and they're  very moral people, they're very upstanding people who were like, no, but  we're, we're trying to do good things.  You know, we have good intentions and they had a really hard time with, I think,  dealing with like the, the disconnect between the public perception or the  growing public perception and, and what their internal view of themselves were.  And, and so even now, I still feel like most people who work there, especially  the executives, A, I don't think they can be shamed, but B, I think that they,  they've convinced themselves that no, we're, we're doing the right things.  And, and the way that we're going about these things is, is for the good of everyone.  Yes, of course it makes us money, but, but we're, we're on the straight and narrow.  So trying to convince them, you know, I mean, if genocide hasn't been enough to  convince them to say, Hey, maybe we need to take a serious look at how our  platform's being used.  I'm not sure if the health of teenage girls is going to move the needle.

Transcript:  I think that's a, that's a really good point with the institutions in terms of  institutional memory and how things operate, we have to think of even some of  the worst dictatorships in the world.  They weren't, they didn't think they were doing evil.  Like, you have to understand that, like those people doing those things,  thought they were doing the right thing.  So shaming people at Facebook is really not going to change anything because they  have to believe that what they are doing is the right thing and appropriate thing.  I think the most that's going to come out of this, we'll probably see like  government commercials and ads talking about your kids and don't let them on  Facebook for too long.  I think it's going to be like the anti-smoking campaign.  And I don't think it's until the system gets fundamentally changed and turning  governance of how corporations are run.  I don't think any of this is actually going to affect Facebook in the long term.  We haven't seen it in their stocks.  We haven't seen it in the user base.  They're kind of impervious and most governments are, you know, too shy to  actually do anything.  And the most worrisome thing I saw in that 60 minutes interview was about how  the best moderation happens in the United States, but the rest of the world,  especially in emerging and developing countries.  They can't.  And they don't have like almost any moderation.  Like it's absolutely just, just horrendous that stuff that gets posted there.  And it's just like, that's the world we're building.  And that's very, very frightening.  Yep.

Transcript:  If they're going to lose out anywhere, I think there's a very long-term thing  where their, their user base tends to be older on average, I think.  And that's part of the reason they acquired things like Instagram and  WhatsApp, right, to expand beyond just the core Facebook, because we've seen,  you know, most kids today, teens, et cetera, they're not spending time on  Facebook, they spend time on TikTok or something more like that, right?  So their, their user base will age out eventually.  But they're also so huge at this point that they're going to just keep going for  a really long time, regardless of whether or not that's where the place where  people are going or not, because it takes a long time to run out of the billions  of dollars they have.

Transcript:  The other thing I would add, and I'm, I'm sincere when I say this, well, while I  acknowledge the issues is that it isn't, I don't think it's fair to blame technology,  big tech, social media for our own flaws.  And it, this doesn't come out of Facebook.  Facebook is a mirror of the world.  It may be as an amplifier.  I think you make a case that it amplifies, but really the problem, the  polarization, the issues with climate denial, all of the problems we have in  this world are created by people, not by big tech.

Start time: 1746.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's true, but I think that the important distinction here, and this is  what I think, you know, Francis Hogan was kind of talking about and what's  important is that when they change their algorithms to juice things for engagement  and for a reaction and when they determine what content they're going to  show you and what content they're going to amplify and, you know, it all started  when they got rid of the reverse, you know, kind of timeline and, and they  started to show things algorithmically.  And when they make the decisions about what types of content they're going to  bubble up and show and what they're going to really try to get people to  engage the most with, because they know they'll spend more time on the site.  Then I do think it changes things a little bit.  And you're right, these are human problems, but we haven't had this  situation before and that's why there aren't, you know, direct parallels that  we can make with things that have happened in the past.  Obviously mass media has existed, you know, for at this point, hundreds of years.  And people, by the way, said the same thing.

Start time: 1807.79
End time: 1840.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  But the difference is we haven't had to this point, you haven't had TV where  there it's been algorithmically determined and it's changing with online TV now,  but where, where, you know, the content that you see has been chosen based on  what will keep you watching and what will make you engage the most and that, and  when psychologically they know the things that make you angry are things that will  or polarize you are things that will keep you engaged the longest.  That I think is the difference.  You know, you've had people who would program content and would put, you know,  that's the whole story of a talk radio and get people to have a reaction.  But when the content that you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that went along with the government deregulation in terms of ownership of,  of, of, of airwaves and, and, and loosening restrictions in terms of what sort of  content could be on the radio and whatnot.  Uh, so that went a lot into it, but I think that the interesting thing is if  this were also, if it was organically being displayed to people, I would have  an easier time with that argument than this is just a human problem, but it's  not organically decided it's all algorithmically determined in a way for  people to be the most incensed and engaged and spend the most amount of time  on the site.

And that's what algorithms do unless you tune the algorithm to do something else.  But why would you, you're a business.  We're going to tune the algorithm to increase engagement, to make more money.  Period.  And you see what happens on YouTube.  You see what happens on Facebook.  It radicalizes people.  So I, I agree with you on that.

Who determines that?  How do you enforce that kind of thing?  Who determines what good is?  But these systems are built, you know, you're right.  They are mirrors of our own actions, but those algorithms do happen to, you know,  the human brain is funhouse mirrors.

Uh, and with that, with the result, I want to actually talk about algorithms  because there is, there's an example of algorithms that nobody's paying any  attention to that could be worse, actually worse.  We've got a great pain.  I want to take a break right now.  Cause we were half an hour in, I want to introduce again, a fabulous panel,  Daniel Rubino for windows central.  Yes.  We'll get to windows 11.  That's, that's why Daniel's here.  Dan Morin on the max side from six colors.com.  Yes.  We'll talk about the iPhone 13.  That's why Dan's here.  And of course, Christina Warren, senior cloud advocate about micro for Microsoft.  Yes.  We will talk about animal crossing and sneakers.  That's why Christina is here.  That's why a really great panel.  Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.  You know, there are all sorts of challenges to being a small business.  I have become intimately acquainted with all of them.  One of them is where's the stamps?  Who has the stamps?  We got, we got a mail package.  How are we going to do that?  Stamps.com solved that for us more than a decade ago.  And I don't know if you have a small business, I don't know why  you would do anything else.  Look, I love the post office, but the last thing I want to do is go down.  We used to send people down to the post office to wait in line.  That is just expensive and senseless when you could do everything you want to do  at the post office from your computer, your printer, you don't need a postage  meter, you just need stamps.com.  You'll even save money.  You'll send packages and letters for less with discounted rates.  And by the way, it, this is really good news.  It's not just the U S postal service.  Now stamps.com does UPS as well.  So since 1998 stamps.com has been an indispensable tool for more than a  million businesses, they bring the services of the U S postal service and  now UPS right to you and your computer.  If you are an Etsy seller, an Amazon or eBay seller, if you send out brochures  or bills, anything you do stamps.com can make it easier.  If it fills in the address from your software automatically, it fills in the  return address from your address book.  It even prints your company logo.  It'll even do it right on the envelope.  You don't need stamps at all.  You don't need a postage meter.  You can mail any letter, any package, anywhere you want to send a man, the  discounts, I got to tell you, you save money on postage from the U S postal service.  Stamps.com has been a partner of twit for 10 years now.  If you haven't tried them yet, I don't know what you're waiting for.  I've been telling you about this for a decade.  Cut the confusion out of shipping.  Stamps.com has a new rate advisor tool, which is great because you can use it  with both UPS and USPS to figure out what's the best way to ship, what the  timelines are, and I just love it.  You'll save time.  You'll save money with stamps.com.  And you know what?  We've got a deal for you.  There's completely risk-free.  If you go to stamps.com, there's a microphone at the top of the page.  Click that type in twit.  You'll get a special offer.  It includes a four week trial.  You get free postage.  You get a USB scale, which is real.  Oh, it's nice.  You don't have to click a page.  You just type into it right next to the microphone.  Now.  That's great.  You'll get that USB scale, which makes it so that it's always, you always know how  much just go to stamps.com type in twit at the type of the homepage and try our offer.  It is a great deal, including $55 in postage coupons that you can use over  the next few months, saving you even more.  I just think it's a fantastic deal.  So no long-term commitments, no contracts, stamps.com.  Use the promo code twit, T W I T never go to the post office again, unless you want  to say hi, because you know what?  I love our postal carrier.  I like God stopping and saying hi, but I don't have to wait in line anymore to do that.  I just say hi and open my postage box and go home.  Stamps.com.  You're going to love it.  We thank stamps.com for long time supporting.  Twit.  I've mixed feelings about this because, um, as it turns out, I know a good many people  who are doing very well on Tik Tok, including my son, Hank, who's about ready to get to  a million subscribers.  He's doing he's yeah.  Oh my God.  I know.  Oh my God.  I know.  I can't, I can't knock it.  He's also really big on Instagram, so I shouldn't knock either.  But when you talk about algorithmic and I know this from, from talking to my son,  nobody does it better than Tik Tok.

I mean, he knows he's become a master of the algorithm.  I tell him, you know, careful because if you, if you make in your living on Tik  Tok, they could pull the plug at any time.  There's a great article on the Atlantic this week by Evelyn Dulek, 1 billion Tik  Tok users understand what Congress doesn't.  The video sharing app avoids scrutiny because politicians don't take it seriously.  And yet talk about algorithm.  It's benign at this point, but at any point, Tik Tok could, I don't know what.  I mean, is it, is, isn't everything we just said about Facebook and  YouTube double for Tik Tok?  Christina, do you use it?  Quick.  Yeah, I do.

Um, but, but I was actually, I think is what's interesting about Tik  Tok versus the other social networks is that it's one of the few, obviously  there are some people who have personalities and who people can follow  the multiple places, but it's fundamentally not connected to who you  know, in real life, it's, you know what I mean?  Like, like your social graph is, is, is about interest.

So Tik Tok, you have two tabs, the for you page, which is their pure  algorithmic, and then I thought following, which would be non algorithmic.  I have yet to see Henry's videos and following, even though I'm following him.  And I think it's very, it's just as algorithmic as a for you page.  They still show you what they think you're going to want to see.  And for some reason, they think I want to see a lot of bikini clad young women.  I don't know why that is.  It's certainly nothing I did.  Uh, but that, but he does food videos and I bet you, if you, if you were  interested in a lot of food stuff, you'd see his, I mean, must be because he's got  this video has 43 minutes, 41 million views, right?

And so that is the problem with the algorithm, uh, in the sense of what  you're looking for, it does become sort of your online personality, but then you  can just delete the account and start over.

Transcript:  Well, the only thing tick tock is optimizing for at this point, it  seems to be his entertainment.  They just, they have the perfect feedback loop.  They know exactly how long it took before you swiped up to the next video.  Exactly.  And they just go, Oh, you spent 23 seconds there.  We'll give you more like that.  Four seconds there, less like that.  And it completely can be automatic.  I doubt there's human intervention, although they get, they occasionally  will get hit, they apparently, if you were fat, they weren't showing  your videos for a while.  Um, I think there's human intervention because Henry just started taking  a sponsor for the first time.  And I noticed anywhere where he shows a product placement, it's a spice  and he shows it briefly like a second.  The one 10th number of views.  So I think that they are somehow algorithmically saying, no, no, no,  that don't, we don't, we want to make our money, not his money.  And so they, they don't promote that as much, but you, you can see  immediately the effect of the algorithm very directly.  They're doing it benignly though, like nobody's complaining.  I'm not seeing, I imagine, I guess if you followed Donald Trump, you'd  see a lot of Trump videos.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there an argument that it's just like, I just wondered if it was by, I mean,  how much of this is by chance?  I mean, I don't think entirely obviously, but there does seem to be almost a more  of a virtuous cycle there in terms of like, if positive content is the stuff  that bubbles to the top and far as TikTok goes, then maybe that helps reinforce  that as opposed to something like Facebook, which seems to thrive on the  negative content and it could have just as easily gone the other way.  But for some reason, that's a good point.

What did your boss say?  Yeah, it was like, it was an odd autumn.  And he said, they didn't, he said we didn't go to them.  They came to us.  Uh, which I thought was it.  We never knew the details of this, but we knew that Microsoft was  in the running to buy Tik TOK.  They came to us.  We thought it was weird, but then we thought, well, you know, social  graph, billions of users.  In fact, Tik TOK this past week, uh, beat YouTube in the amount of time  people spend watching videos on Tik TOK.  So really good, one billion users to really good engagement.  So I understand such a said, well, I guess maybe, but then all of a  sudden, no, no, it's going to be Oracle and Walmart.

Everybody else learned whatever details that happened on the Microsoft side  from, from that code interview.  But the whole thing always seems sketched.  And then it was like, as soon as, you know, um, they made like the Oracle  Walmart thing, but then nothing happened.  Then, you know, Trump lost the election and there's like, Oh, well,  guess that's not happening.  It's over and it's over.  You know, the, the executives, like guy had left Disney to go to Tik TOK.  Then he had to leave because he was like, Hey, I wasn't even part of these  conversations, you know, he was like, I don't even know what's going on.  I'm supposed to be the CEO of the U S version of the company.  No one tells me anything.  So I have to quit clearly, you know, like the whole thing was just bizarre.  It was like, okay, well we're, we're going to like come up with this weird.  And even like the Oracle Walmart thing was like, well, we might have data  sovereignty, but we might not the algorithm and those things might still be owned by  child.  The whole thing was just so insane.  Like to think about that, that that was a year ago and that that was like an  actual reality thing, the thing that actually happened was that a government  tried to force private businesses to buy.

Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  Actually, the only thing I think the Chinese government should be censoring  TikTok because the only Chinese TikToks I see are of horrific manufacturing  facilities in China.  The one I most recently saw is a sock factory where all the, all the people on  the assembly line, their hands resting on their face, face, resting their hands  while they put socks on sock molds.  It looks horrible.  That's what they should be censoring.  They're not, apparently.

Transcript:  We know they censor Hong Kong content.  Uh, not the worst thing happening in China, but I had a chance.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  This is the quote Sachin Adela told Kara Swisher, the failed TikTok talks, which  is hard to say the TikTok talks were the strangest, there was the strangest thing  I ever worked on, which is probably saying a lot.  I imagine Mr.  Adela's worked on some other strange things.  Um, he says I was intrigued.  It's a great property.  Everybody's seen the growth and what have you.  The rest is history.  Um, there was a period of time when I felt the U S government had some  particular set of requirements and then they just disappeared.  Boom.  It's over.  Bye bye.  Anyway, I don't want to knock TikTok because like I said, my son probably is  going to make his living as a TikTok.  So I shouldn't, I shouldn't, uh, shouldn't knock it, but, and, and to be  honest, there's an example of algorithm, I guess done right, right?  I mean, it's the TikTok is so engaging.  If you watch it for more than a few, okay.  Admit it, Christina, you've seen this video.  If you watch it for too long, a guy comes on and says, stop.  You've seen it, right?  So have a drink, go get something to eat.  Stop.  You, you've been way too long on TikTok, which I think is hysterical.  I see that every night.

And actually it was really problematic in a lot of ways.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was actually really problematic in a lot of ways and it, uh, attracted a,  um, an improper element.  Oh yeah.  Think of that.  Oh yeah.  There, there was, there was a whole, oh yeah.  So I was aware of it because, you know, I worked at Mashable and we covered  those sorts of things, but I wasn't on it.  It was shocking to me when it rebranded and then it became so big.  Um, and you know, and they executed to their credit, they executed hardcore.  Right?  Cause a lot of it isn't fundamentally that different than Vine except the execution.  And, and I also, I think the moment in time was different and the algorithm  that for you is just so good.  You know, that for you page is just incredibly powerful and it is kind of scary.  You know, I don't know what the solution is, but it does show you like, okay,  you take what Facebook and, and, and Twitter and Instagram and some of these  earlier services started doing, you know, 15 years ago and now this is, you know,  taking those learnings, but, but better and more modern and using better  technology behind it and with, with the audience that, uh, largely has never  grown up without this stuff.  And so it's, um, right now, as Daniel was kind of saying, like, the stuff seems  to be good, but it could have just as easily gone bad and it could just as  easily go bad, right?  Like if, if, if bite dance decided to make changes to the algorithm and wasn't  about like, you know, joy, joy, joy, joy, exactly.  Uh, if they're showing, okay, well, you know what people are bored being happy,  you know, or whatnot.  And I'm sure that there are some people who's tick tocks because that's the  interesting thing about tick tock.  Everyone's tick tock is different.  It's based on your interest in what you like.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who the stuff they see and engage with is not  pleasant stuff and it is more outrage based.  And if that became more of the norm, I mean, gosh, that's, uh, or more propaganda  based or more anything.

Like if governments or if propaganda forces or other things really wanted to use these  and I'm not even talking about the US per se, that's what I'm saying.  They could mess with us.  I'm not even thinking the US per se, but like, look at what happened in Myanmar.  Right?  Like what happened there was the government figured out that we can use the power of  Facebook and this information and we can spread this and we can create this outrage.  And you've seen similar things happen in India, which then becomes ironic of the  Indian government are being such

They don't want the responsibility, which I understand.  Like, you know, uh, AT&T is not like you could sue the phone company back when,  when AT&T was the only phone system, you couldn't sue them for, you know, um, the  way people use the phones.

Start time: 3087.18
End time: 3098.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

If it's a media company, if it's a Fox news or an OANN or an MSNBC, you, the  first amendment says you can't do anything about it because they're expressing a  point of view that's, that's protected by the first amendment.  If they're a social platform that says, no, no, we're not going to put the finger  our thumbs on the scale.  We just want to connect you with your family members and your loved ones and  your high school sweetheart.  Then that's fine.  That's harmless.  There's no terrible things happen.

Start time: 3139.74
End time: 3158.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And they kind of skate because of that whole point that you're saying.  Right.  Because they don't like, so even on the, even on the first amendment side, there  are limits to what you can do under the first amendment speech, you know, is not  entirely free, but because we don't regulate them as that and then the whole  section, now we're verging back into section 230.

Transcript:  That's always been their remote, right?  Is that's always been the essential question.  Are they a platform or are they a publisher?  That's always been like the essential question.  And they're a little bit of both.  Yes.  And they are, and they are what they, they are what they are when it's convenient.  I think that where it becomes, I think where even their common carrier stuff,  WhatsApp, I think is an easy common carrier arguments to make, although that  would open up the regulation.  I think WhatsApp is very easy to make that.  I think Facebook and Instagram are different because it does determine, they  have a role in their algorithms and in their policies and their procedures on  what you see and how you see it and what is uplifted and what is not.  And we also let you pay to amplify things, right?  Like you can do, you know, promoted posts, which is a huge part of how people see  content and that's a huge part of their business.  And so that to me then takes the common carrier element out of it for those  platforms, because they are a publisher in those senses, you know?

But now with these apps and services, as soon as countries and governments  figure out how they can weaponize this stuff, it becomes very dangerous how  they can sort of manipulate the algorithm to show content, whether to  their own people in their country or other people.

Transcript:  So you're never going to see regulation because governments, he says, that's  the thing to really fear.  As you say, Daniel, that's the thing to really fear.  Once governments get savvy enough to say, oh, we can use this.  That's what happened in Hitler's Germany.  Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister said the new medium, this new medium  of radio, this is really useful.  We can really use this.  And they did to great effect.  Now you've scared me.  Now I'm really worried.  It is frightening.  We haven't seen anything yet.  In other words.  Yep.  All right, let's take a break.  Windows 11 is here.  Something a little lighter.  We're all going to, we're all going to jump through it.  We're going to jump through a painting and do a little tap dancing.  When we come back, Daniel Rubino actually wanted to jump through the window.  He's ready to jump through his surface into the, into the sand trap that is  windows 11, we're doing that in a second.  Uh, when we continue, um, but first a word from our sponsor, I showed  it a, uh, brought to you by checkout.com.  Uh, tech should not stifle innovation, right?  We can agree on that.  True.  Unfortunately tech sometimes does, but especially when it comes to, this  is the pain point in e-commerce payment systems.  Oi, traditional payment systems, heavily layered, disconnected businesses.  Look at them as a cost center.  They know it could be done better, but how well checkout.com modern businesses  need flexible payment systems that can help them adapt to change, to grow and  scale fast.  Uh, I, you know, I just found out, I, I think checkout is one of those things  that you're using without knowing it.  Right.  They have a tech that approaches payments with a radical new lens.  Checkout.com partnered with Oxford economics.  They conducted an end to end analysis of the payments value chain for merchants.  What you w like one of the big pain points, false declines.  It happens to me all the time.  I don't know why I'll, I'll try to buy something and say, nope, it costs  us UK, French and German markets.  20.3 billion.  Dollars, 12.7 billion went to competitors, but, but a horrible  $7.6 billion entirely written off, lost forever.  The study found that merchants aren't currently optimizing the consumers.  I like how they put this significant willingness to pay.  I am willing to pay.  I'm here.  Take my money for speed, for convenience and security online.  Take my money.  And they get declined.  Come on.  The majority of merchants survey do not feel their payments data is informing  their business strategy or their innovation.  And by the way, when you talk to customers, more than half said they  won't return to a site because the site doesn't offer their preferred payment method.  Most merchants spend more than 10% of their payments budgets, fixing disputes.  Fraud outages.  CEOs in this survey said, you know, Oh, we liked, we think the quality of data is great.  Nope.  They overestimate the quality of data returned by payment providers.  CEOs underestimate the extent to which disconnected payments are hindering growth.  And when merchants focus on the per transaction costs of their payments,  they're missing a very important point, back end costs.  That's why I want you to check out checkout.com.  It's a leading cloud-based global payment solution provider.  Checkout's payment platform is purpose-built with performance,  scalability and speed in mind.  It's great for merchants looking to seamlessly integrate better  payment solutions globally.  Here's what you get with checkout.com improved acceptance.

Wasn't even like windows seven.  There were, you know, no parties celebrating the arrival of windows 11.  It kind of just, I mean, and there was no hummingbird I might add either.  Um, Daniel, it was windows 11, a big deal this week.

Yeah.  Yeah.  And Android got on and on that as well.  And people were just so used to probably sick of operating system updates that  this is not really a big deal in that sense.  Now we're, you know, windows 95 was big because the computers were still pretty  new, but that was right at the point where they were starting to get big.  And that's right.  Also, you know, windows 95, its core feature was about the internet, right?  And that's where, and there was so much potential around that.  Is it going to lie to get on the internet easier?  Cause it was pretty difficult, weird at that point to get on the internet.  Uh, so it doesn't quite have that impact after all.  It's like you were saying about phones, right?

Start time: 3735.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That as well as the modern processors, uh, you know, yeah, execution exploits,  you know, the idea here, I would say windows has a couple problems in terms of image,  right?  One of them is stability.  Uh, another one is security and the other one's complexity.  So this update addresses all that stuff when it comes to security.  Yeah.  Now it requires TPM.  It requires modern processors, uh, stuff on the motherboard that helps prevent  injection between when the operating system is actually booting up and that's  your boring and it's, and those are angers people, but it's super important  when we're getting to different types of malware and, you know, hijacking  people's computers, uh, it's, it's very important for them to address that.  After all, I've seen a lot of Google Chrome commercials for Chromebook where  they're like, you don't need a virus scanner because it's still, yeah, it's  still fun to go after Microsoft for security.  Right.  Uh, same thing when it comes to stability, right?  Blue screen of death is hilarious because it's, it's a cultural mean at  this point, which is insane.  But when you look at the numbers between the, um, you know, going by what  Microsoft says, right?  That, uh, 99% of the computers with the modern hardware running Windows  11 have a crash free experience.  And that's the way it should be, but they can't do that.

Start time: 3824.52
End time: 3836.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, and I would say also that's kind of the other story this week, which was,  it was kind of boring because not because there weren't celebrations, because I  didn't have to write a bunch of stories talking about this is broken, this is  crash, this isn't working for people.  Sure.  There's the AMD story.  Oh, you know, a three to 5% maybe reduction in performance on very specific  applications and maybe in gaming.  And that's going to be fixed in a couple of weeks, but that's, that's not  the same as people's, you know, computers being wiped or losing data,  things being locked out or crashing.  Like it's actually been a boring week in terms of major bugs with Windows 11,  which I think speaks to all this work that they put into making Windows  a little bit more modern.

Start time: 3916.30
End time: 3927.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually a little surprising because the beta releases were somewhat buggy.  I think Paul Therot was saying, I'm worried that this Windows 11 release  is premature, but-

Start time: 3946.24
End time: 3968.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is very, you know, first of all, AMD users are still a minority of users  in general, so it's a certain percentage of them and the effect  appears to be a three, maybe three to five percent, less than three to five  percent reduction in performance in specific applications slash some games.  And why?  That's it.

Start time: 3969.54
End time: 3990.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has to do with the L3 memory.  It has to do with memory and the architecture of AMD's chips.  It's going to be addressed in a couple of weeks, apparently.  So, but it's not a security vulnerability.  Most people aren't going to notice it.  It's just, I think, a more retidying up kind of bug.  It's surprising they missed it during the beta testing period.  So I'm sure people will go back and look at what happened.

I stream it on Twitch and thanks to the big Twitch breach, I'm streaming to a lot  more people than ever before.  Yes.  We'll talk about that a little bit.  Okay.  So Christina, did you put Windows 11 on your brand new framework or did you put  Windows 10 on?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.

Transcript:  And obviously I haven't worked on the product or anything, but I was just as a  disclosure, I was involved with the developer launch event that happened back in  June and I have great respect for the Windows team, but I don't work on Windows.  But yeah, no, I've been running it, I guess, for, yeah, almost six months at this point.  And I love it.  Like I love the UI changes.  You know, it was interesting going through like the dev process and seeing how things  were being added back and how, you know, more features were being refined.  Obviously this is still, I think, just kind of like a, you know, a work in progress,  kind of like Windows 10 didn't come, like there were...  All software is.

Start time: 4075.52

Transcript:  That's the new thing.  Yeah.  No software ships done.  And it started with gaming.  It started with actually Mary Jo Foley said, no, it started with Google, with  Gmail, which was in beta for a decade.  Software isn't done anymore.  It ships and then there are many, many patches over a period of time as it gets  better and better.  But 11 seems fairly stable.  I think it's beautiful.  I have to say.  I love the look.  I like it.  I don't mind the centered menu.  They need to do a little work and I'm sure will on the start menu.  The recent thing is a little, or whatever they call it, recommend is a little big,  but there's little things like that.  And I'm sure Stardoc will allow you to tweak it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's so good.  But also installing WSL is super easy.  Now you just type in WSL dash dash install and it enables everything for you.  So even getting that enabled now is super easy.  It's easy to get the Windows package manager installed, which is basically like  the Windows version of Homebrew essentially.

Start time: 4157.02
End time: 4195.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You still can.  You still, but there is a package manager.  And what's cool about it is it's actually tied to the Windows Store, but also non  Windows Store apps can be packaged that way too.  But you can install, I mean, it's in a lot of ways, just a CLI for the, for the  Windows Store, but also for other things that want to package that way.  Chocolatey still has some advantages for certain types of NuGet and maybe dev  things, but I can do a lot of stuff with the Windows package manager now and I  love it.  You know, power toys, which is an add-on you can get and it's open sourced ads,  even more, you know, kind of good stuff for, for people who are more like dev  centric kind of nerdy users, like your users.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And everybody, I think most of the audience on this show, there's a lot of  really good stuff with this and the Windows subsystem for Linux, which Jim  Salter mentioned, one of the big things, and this will be coming to, to Windows  10 as well, but it's, it's already in the, the stuff that's in Windows 11 is the  early support for graphical apps within WSL.  So if you wanted to run Firefox installed from Ubuntu or another distro, you  could, or if there was another GUI app that for whatever reason you wanted to  run, you could do that.  That's actually huge.  And it works really well.

Start time: 4231.20
End time: 4236.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  There, there are some limitations and there's some things that aren't quite  there yet, that's obviously the teams are working hard on that, but there's a  lot of opportunity there.  One of the interesting things in that case is when it comes to CUDA workflows.  So, so CUDA is, is NVIDIA's, you know, proprietary kind of technology that most  data scientists and a lot of other, you know, big workloads use.  And a lot of people really like to use CUDA stuff, but they would want to be able  to use that kind of on the Linux side to use their GPU power and you can, and you  can have the pass through and, and, and do a lot of CUDA stuff within WSL, which  is really powerful for, for a lot of engineers.  So that support again is still becoming enhanced and NVIDIA has added driver  support and stuff like that.  But it's the opportunities there.  I think I love WSL.  It's one of my favorite features, you know, the last few years that it's been  available and I use it all the time and the newest versions and the, the gooey  stuff, I think for people who like, okay, you have games and maybe you have some  apps where you'd like the interface security, whatever the case may be, you'd  like the windows operating system better.  But if you're doing dev work, you would really like to be in a Linux environment.  The way that it's coming together now makes it much more seamless.  And I think really good.

Transcript:  Before the show, we were talking about how much Christina and I love our  frameworks, the right to repair laptop.  Um, I want to talk about the package manager.  That's kind of interesting.  When get, uh, for years, Linux installs have always had something called a package  manager for Ubuntu, it's apt or apt get, uh, for arch it's a Pacman, which makes  it very easy to update the operating system, but also install new apps.  And if you install new apps through the package manager, which most Linux users  do keep those apps up to date, it's just a really nice way of doing things.  Um, windows has never had a first party package manager.  We mentioned chocolatey and new get, but.  Though, you know, they were very limited.  They were more like nine night, uh, than real package managers.  I think it's interesting.  Microsoft does when get work outside of WSL.  Can you use it as, so it's just a general, it's a command line  only though right now, or is there a.

Start time: 4376.28
End time: 4382.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is command line only.  Yeah.  No, I mean, because the, the, the GUI equivalent would be the Microsoft store.  Um, uh, but there's stuff in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but a Microsoft store has  been revamped is getting a lot better, but B and this is important.  You can install stuff that's not in the Microsoft store.  So people can still add and package things specifically within, you know,  when get and other ways and it'll download it, you know, through their  direct binaries and update them through that process.  It's very similar.  I would say, you know, uh, Pac-Man app is, is, um, uh, probably not the best analogy.  Probably, um, homebrew is the best on the Mac.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, uh, which is also on, on, on Linux now too.  Um, and the reason I say that that's because the main painters themselves,  like Arsh is a little bit different, but like with, with, you know, Debbie and Ubuntu  and Red Hat stuff, typically the stuff is added and is, you know, you have  package maintainers who are adding them to the catalog and making sure things  are updated and whatnot.  Whereas with homebrew, you know, somebody adds a config file and it's getting it  directly from the source itself and, and then installing it.  Um, and that's what, how, how wind get works and is it building every time?

Start time: 4451.04

Transcript:  Does it install binaries or is it

Start time: 4453.34
End time: 4471.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's getting binaries, right?  So if I do wind get install, whatever, then it's going to go to wherever  it needs to install it.  Maybe it's getting it from the windows store.  Maybe it's getting it from a direct download location.  Maybe it's getting it from GitHub.  Um, and then it's installing, um, uh, you know, and doing the update process.  Um, if you're, if you're doing an upgrade or, or whatever,

Start time: 4479.15
End time: 4589.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it was right.  I mean, it couldn't get any worse, but I interviewed the, um, the head of the  new store, uh, Georgio Sartor, Sartor, Sartor.  Yeah.  George is great.  Yeah.  And he's a, yeah, he's very, so he wasn't part of the store.  He came from a different engineering background, but he, like a lot of people  had ideas of what the store should be.  And so he wrote a white paper saying, this is how I think the store should be  designed and how it should be run and what the focus should be.  And you started apparently circulating it internally at Microsoft.  A lot of other people agreed with him and somehow he eventually got,  Microsoft was like, all right, go for it.  You know, basically it couldn't get any worse, right?  Because the store up to that point did have a lot of problems, mostly a lot of  it related to phone, of course.  And then the bigger concept here, we're going to make phone apps that can run on  desktop once phone went away, that source falls apart.  So he completely redid the store and his philosophy was get the economics out of  this. The store should focus on two things, customers and developers.  And that's all that matters.  And we've got to bring those two people, those two groups together.  And so he started from that concept and then he went and hired a team to make  this happen. And he basically went around the world.  There's people from China, there's South Africa, there's India, there's United  States and Europe.  And he hired a lot of people who weren't traditional store devs, but they were  very good devs basically.  And brought them together and they redid the store entirely.  And during this process, they did things like get rid of a lot of monetization  stuff, especially around apps and taking a large percentage cut.  They cut their cut significantly, right?

Start time: 4589.60
End time: 4595.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's 12 percent for games.  And did they say one percent for non games?  They said it's very low now.

Start time: 4595.44
End time: 4606.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's really not the focus of the store anymore.  The store is about you click it in a way to connect customers to developers.  It's a package manager.

Start time: 4607.14
End time: 4615.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're so creative.  And Christina said was right.  It's more of a package manager than a revenue storefront.  And at this point, at this point, it's shifted that way.

Start time: 4615.10
End time: 4700.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really interesting because like you don't even need to wrap your app.  And was it MSIX, which is right, the traditional store wrapper.  So you can just list a Win32 classic app in there.  And it uses the so Winsip when you go and download Winsip from the Microsoft store,  uses Winsip's installer.  It looks like it's 1995 again.  And so devs can just do that.  Just basically that's the Epic store is now in the Microsoft store.  And all it is is a Win32 setup installer.  Now, if devs wants, they can take that and then put it into MSIX and then get the store  features and then further down the line, they can go with WinUI and use a project  reunion to basically modernize the app if they want to.  And the idea is you take them down this path and someone can even do a UWP app if they  really wanted to or do a WebView PWA type style.  Right.  So Microsoft is giving developers a ton of options, almost no friction to the store.  And that's really changed things.  If you open the store right now for Windows 11, it's kind of crazy.  I mean, there's Disney Plus, Paramount Plus.  There's, of course, Spotify.  There's iTunes.  There's just all these main, there's TikTok is in there.  There's like all these mainstream apps that are now listed and it's had more momentum.  Photoshop.  Yeah, Photoshop is in there.  Adobe is in there.

Start time: 4700.46
End time: 4728.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even more than that, Microsoft has said we're going to add Android apps to the store  and we're going to let anybody else like Epic, for instance, put their own store in the store.  It's already there.  Yeah.  Which is bizarre.  Yeah, it's there.  Apple would never do that.  That's really so it's a complete contextual change for what the store means to Windows.  And it sounds like for a very positive, they're going to have to convince people.

Start time: 4728.60
End time: 4789.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've had a lot of, they've had more wins this summer and then even the last couple  weeks and just this week, Disney Plus joined in.  Not only did Disney Plus joined in, they did this really clever idea that is very  consumer friendly.  When you search for movies and TV, say Cruella, you find it in the store.  It gives you the opportunity to buy the movie if you want or rent the movie and you pay  through Microsoft if you want to do that.  But there will also be a Disney Plus button listed there.  And if you click that button, if you don't have the app installed, it'll install it for  you if you want to.  If you already have it installed and you click it, it just goes into your Disney Plus  account, goes to Cruella and says, you can stream this for free.  And so that's going to be very important because right now we're so overloaded with  streaming features and services that we don't know where to watch the content.  Like, why should I pay Microsoft to rent it when I can get it free through Disney Plus?  So that's what they're doing.  So we may eventually see Amazon Prime there, maybe Voodoo, maybe Apple.

Start time: 4790.06
End time: 4813.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's super consumer friendly because that's exactly what a consumer does.  I want to watch Cruella, but they don't search the store.  Now they've got to search the web and figure out how do I get it?  Blah, blah, blah.  Whereas if you just search in the store, there's the movie.  Oh, it's Disney Plus.  You press the button Disney Plus installs and it runs.  I think that's really smart of Microsoft to do that.

Start time: 4813.58
End time: 4898.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're just doing a lot of these really clever ideas.  They even have now their pop-up store, they call it.  So when a developer has an app, they take the embed code for that app to list it.  They can put it into a web page, you know, download it at Microsoft.  You'll go to like Voodoo or something like that and they'll have their app.  But now when you click that button, instead of it like launching into a web page,  which then allows you to launch into the store, then allows you to go download,  it literally pops up a little mini store with the app title, the description,  and install button.  You just hit install right there.  It doesn't even take you out of the experience of whatever you're doing at that moment.  It just installs directly.  So they're doing a lot of improvements here.  You know, the way the app's download has been improved.  Windows update has been overhauled too.  The way it downloads, now it doesn't need to download the entire update.  It only downloads the difference between what's on your computer already and what is in the update.  So if it's redundant, it doesn't download that.  On top of it, it installs in the background, much like a smartphone does with a parallel install,  so that when it reboots the computer, you're basically just swapping out one partition  for the other and then you're just back into it.  So you're not going to have like 10 minutes of updates going on.  So there's a lot of architectural changes here, getting Android apps to run.  But I'm still skeptical of how useful they're going to be.  That was supposed to come with Windows 11, but it is delayed.

Transcript:  The idea of running Android apps, Linux apps, PWA's, Win32, UWP.  Like you could just run it all side by side and it's going to be a seamless experience.  Like what operating system does that today?  I think it's a very significant change, both in philosophy  and the architecture of what Windows 11 is.  I think a lot of people sort of just, they focus on just, oh, the taskbar looks new.  And it's like, it's a lot more going on here.

Start time: 4927.42
End time: 4983.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a lot of more sophisticated users are very aware of how containers have changed how we use  computers, where the operating system really is just a holder for whatever you want to do.  And it sounds like Microsoft, Microsoft is very aware of this.  They, you know, with Hyper-V and so forth, they've been very aware of virtualization.  They're very aware of Docker and other container technologies.  It's, it actually makes sense for Microsoft to say, hey, we don't,  we're kind of platform agnostic.  We are, we're just the, the floor that you put stuff on top of.  And that's actually a smart move for Microsoft.  I think that's very interesting.  Dan, do you imagine Apple?  I don't, I don't, it's interesting because Apple's Mac.  No.  No, the answer is no.  Apple's Mac store is much more like that.  It's much more like a package manager.  On the other hand, the app store on iOS is all about revenue.  That's in fact, Apple's future in terms of revenue.

Start time: 4984.80
End time: 5016.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where I mean, they make so much money.  And I mean, I don't know enough about the Microsoft end of things to know,  was that perhaps not performing as a revenue source?  Guarantee you it was not.  There's an advantage to them.  Shalhoub's.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  And whereas for Apple, there's so much revenue that comes in via, especially the iOS app store  that trying to shift stuff in that direction, I don't think really behooves them in any way.  But, you know, that is the subject of contention in many different places right now.  Oh, yes.  So we'll have to see how that kind of shakes out.

Start time: 5016.60
End time: 5040.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you know what Apple's attitude towards Homebrew is?  I mean, that's a third party command line app that lets you install many, many command line.  And actually, to be fair, GUI apps, almost I think all serious Mac users use some form of  package manager, if not Homebrew, maybe Mac ports or Fink or something like that.  Do you think Apple, they certainly don't stop it.  Do you think they?

Start time: 5040.82
End time: 5059.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think they have anything against it.  And especially because the Mac as a platform is so different in terms of and they've they  tried to make this case in the whole epic trial, right?  That the Mac is a different platform from iOS.  iOS obviously locked down.  The Mac has always been at least on under Mac OS 10 based on the BSD underpinnings.

Start time: 5059.08
End time: 5069.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's face it, Craig Federighi threw the Mac under the bus during the trial saying,  well, you wouldn't want to protect their revenue.  You wouldn't want the iPhone to be as insecure as our Mac, would you?

Start time: 5070.42
End time: 5084.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. That did everybody a lot of favors there.  Oh, boy.  I mean, I don't think they have anything against things like Homebrew, honestly.  I mean, and I think probably most of the people who actually work on Mac OS  internally, I'm sure rely on it for a lot of stuff.

Start time: 5084.88
End time: 5125.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Apple's in an interesting position because developers do love Macintosh and they love it  because it's a Unix underneath and you can do things like brew.  But at the same time, Apple's moving kind of in the opposite direction of more and more tightly  controlling the OS, perhaps for security reasons.  I think there's a good argument that it's more secure and gatekeeper is becoming more important.  And that is kind of an opposite direction from what developers want.  How do they? It's interesting Microsoft moved towards developers.  WSL is for developers. That's what it's for.  Hoping to keep these developers from Linux, you know, keeping them using...  Or from Mac, right? Or Mac.

Start time: 5127.56
End time: 5154.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Like honestly, I think it's a reflection and kind of an understanding that this is how  people develop now and you need to have some sort of Unix or Unix-like system underpinnings  if you're interacting with the cloud or remote servers or whatever the case may be.  And so that's why WSL makes sense and that's why many of us have been Mac OS users for so long.  Absolutely.  You know, it was Unix, right? Like that was the fundamental thing.

Start time: 5155.26
End time: 5198.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a huge benefit too, right? Coming off classic Mac OS, which, you know, let's be frank,  was not a super reliable, stable operating system in many, many ways.  So the Mac OS 10 reinvention, the fact that it was based on BSD underneath really  gave it a lot of credence and it gave a lot of flexibility and a lot of familiarity for people  who are coming in from that end of the developer spectrum because all the tools that you need are  there and all the tools that you're used to are there. And I mean, you can run a web server  by spinning it up, right? That was a big deal back in that day. And I think it still does them  favors right now to have those underpinnings there and for them to be open, even if they are still  building in more stuff like the system integrity protection and stuff like that, because you can't  ignore the security aspects as well.

Start time: 5199.02
End time: 5210.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a balancing act. And as somebody who likes the geeky side of the Apple equation,  the Unix side and so forth, I hope they don't go too far in the other direction. But so far,  they've, I think, done a good job.

Transcript:  You and me both. You and me both. And I don't know how actively Apple works with the home root team.  I do know that when the M1 came out, that they did work with them to make sure.

Start time: 5220.76

Start time: 5223.92
End time: 5254.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But they knew and they recognized like Docker was another one of those things where  like, OK, and Docker took some time because that was a little more difficult having to get the  different hypervisor, you know, hyper kit or whatever, you know, working because they  changed how some of the virtualization stuff worked with M1. But yeah, you know, the home  root team did have, I know, like direct contact to make sure that worked. And there were some  compatibility issues at first, but it was actually remarkably quick how fast that turned out. So,  you know, which is good.

Start time: 5275.66
End time: 5359.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the challenge isn't even the way that it is now. It's usable,  but it's still emulated. Like they don't have the graphical drivers.  They may never.  Well, that's the problem. I mean, this was the thing that, at least historically,  you did have people who would find ways to reverse engineer and kind of bring like in the pre-X86,  the pre-Intel Mac days, you had people who would find ways to have Mac-specific, PowerPC-specific  Linux distros and stuff like that. But a lot of most people, I think, at least that I always hung  out with, and obviously the Linux ecosystem was different than, too, is like, well, why do I need  to bother with that? I can use Fink or Mac ports, which is what you used back then,  and I can install my tooling and I have an actual Unix kernel, so screw it. I've got everything I  need. Whereas now, the challenge with this custom architecture is that we had this great 15-year  period where you could do so much on the Mac platform because it used the Intel architecture.  And so you had common drivers that you could use. If you wanted to boot Windows, you could.  If you wanted to boot Linux, you could. If you wanted to boot weird, more esoteric OS's,  you could because the driver models were going to be more available. And now we've gone to this  place where if you want it to be bare metal anyway, you're going to have to reverse engineer it  unless Apple decides to open up the driver model, which let's be honest, they're not going to do.

Transcript:  Actually, I want to talk about the surfaces a little bit. There is a fascinating anecdote.  Michael Dell just put out his memoir, Play Nice, But Win, and he talks about  Steve Jobs. And he says, Steve Jobs, when he came back to Apple, remember he brought the  next operating system to Apple and the first iterations of Mac OS X. He wanted Dell to license  OS X and ship it, according to Michael Dell, on Dell's fast selling, low priced Intel based  PCs. Now, I guess Michael Dell said no, because it didn't happen. He says he and Jobs are good  friends. There's actually some very positive stuff about Steve Jobs. Here we are on the 10th

Start time: 5426.42
End time: 5553.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  anniversary of his passing. Yeah, well, what he said was that Apple wanted them to pay licensing  fee for every Dell machine they sold and not every machine. Because it could run Rhapsody.  It could run Rhapsody, so you really ought to pay us for everything. And so Michael Dell was like,  thank you, but no thank you. He also said that... Classic Steve Jobs.  Yes, isn't it? Classic Steve Jobs. Also, he would  refuse to guarantee, at least this is what the memoir excerpt that I read said, he wouldn't have  agreed to a guarantee of how long support would actually exist. So you could have entered into  the scenario where, which this would have been classic Apple, where yeah, you can run OS X.  The timeline seems a little off for it to be OS X, but Mac OS, you can run it on your Dell.  But two years later, support ends. Oh, if you want to continue using those Mac apps you know  and love, you're going to have to spend up and buy a new iBook or whatever. There wasn't any  support length, which incidentally, that was a decision that HP under Carly Fiorina did not  make when they made the stupid co-branding thing with the iPod to get... The HP iPod, yeah.  Which really all that was, was that was a coup on Steve Jobs part because that got iTunes pre-installed  on every single HP and compact desktop. So that was what that was about. He didn't care anything  about the 100 or 200,000 iPods they would sell through HP channels, who cares? They were selling  more of them than they could make. But even in that scenario, it was about getting iTunes  pre-installed on those machines. That's brilliant. But even in that case, they only stopped, they only  did one model. I think it was the Gen 3 or the Gen 4. Oh, it was crappy too. No, it wasn't crappy.  It was an iPod. It just had an HP logo on the back. Well, that's what was crappy about it.  It was the Gen 4 iPod. And when they came out the iPod photo and the iPod video,  oh, that HP partnership went away. Oh, but thanks for pre-installing iTunes on all those  hundreds of millions of computers you sold. Thanks so much. So this is from the memoir,

Transcript:  Dell's memoir. He said, look at this, Steve Jobs said. We've got this Dell desktop. It's  running Mac OS. Why don't you license the Mac OS? Michael Dell says, I thought it was a great idea.  I'll pay you a license fee for every PC we sell with Mac OS. Jobs said, no, no, no, that could  undermine our own Mac sales. Remember at this time, Apple, Steve cut it off, but Apple was  selling compatible, allowing compatibles. Because Dell computers were less costly. Instead, Dell says,  Jobs suggested, oh, here's what you do. Every Dell you sell, you put Mac OS and Windows on and  you let the consumer decide, oh, and by the way, you'll have to pay us for every Dell you sell.  But to be fair, at least it did come with Mac OS on it.

They needed the money.  I mean, that's the quintessential Steve Jobs story. And it was brilliant. If he had been  able to get them to agree with it, but Michael Dell was smarter than Carly Fiorina. So he did not.

Transcript:  Dell writes, the royalty he was talking about would amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.  And the math just didn't work because most of our customers, especially larger business customers,  didn't really want the Mac operating system. Steve's proposal would have been interesting  if it was just us saying, okay, we'll pay you every time we use Mac OS, but to pay him for every time  we didn't use it. Well, nice try, Steve. I think I will be reading this when it comes out. Michael  Dell is an interesting guy. And he's much more frank than you would expect from a typical CEO.  Memoir. Let's take a little break. I do want to talk about the surface hardware. We got to talk  about the Twitch hack. As I said, this was a very busy week. And Apple's appealing the epic decision.  Well, I'll ask you, Dan, about what you think is going to happen there. So lots more to talk about  with our great panel from SixColors.com. Dan Morin, always a pleasure to have you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's just this time of day. Take a break. You can adjust your blinds while I tell everybody  about ESET, which is our favorite antivirus. You know me, I'm not a fan of antiviruses,  but I have to tell you, we have systems in our office that I'm very worried about.  Ransomware is a big problem these days, right? And the last thing I want to do is come into work and  find out the whole network is down because we got hit by ransomware and they want a million  dollars in Bitcoin. Every time I see a guy, Russell, I say, Russell, are we safe? He says,  we're safe. We're running ESET. I said, really? Our editors, it turns out because, you know,  once you get a stable system, they're running on beautiful Dell precision workstations running  Windows 8.1. Whoops. And we don't want to, we don't want to upgrade them to Windows 10 or  Windows 11 because it's just, it's working. So we put ESET on there. Why ESET? Because ESET's  so lightweight, it doesn't slow them down. Look at when you're editing video, you don't have,  you can't dedicate CPU cycles to anything but the job at hand. ESET's notorious for being super  lightweight. They're the global leaders in cyber security research and innovations. They've been  our security provider at Twitter for years. And one of the reasons we choose them is because  I'm scared to death of ransomware. Look, this is October, it's Cybersecurity Awareness Month.  This would be a good time to talk a little bit about how ransomware is affecting everybody.  It's not only proliferating, it's become, I think, so much more sophisticated because there's so much  money to be made. So the bad guys are creating brand new strains all the time to get around  detection. If they can hit you, it's big bucks. These kinds of evolving threats require a dynamic  approach to detection. It has to be faster, it has to be more precise than conventional  endpoint protection. And most importantly, it has to adapt. It has to be able to find ransomware  it's never seen before. That's why ESET uses Dynamic Threat Defense, EDTD. It's a cloud-based,  this is so brilliant, cloud-based sandboxing technology. When you get an attachment in your  email, when our editors are getting attachments, files coming in, before they can even see them,  ESET is uploading them to a cloud-based sandbox and testing them before they pass them along.  And EDTD handles a wide range of file types, including documents, scripts, installers,  executable files. It identifies and isolates anything that looks at all suspicious, then runs  it in a safe, this is so brilliant, safe sandbox environment so they can do code analysis, they can  inspect the sample, they use machine learning, they use in-memory analysis, they use AI, they can adapt.  So EDTD analyzes all the behaviors and can allow or block a file almost instantly, in minutes.  This speed does not slow you down because it's all happening in the cloud, doesn't put extra  demands on your system resources, and it's something endpoint detection alone just can't accomplish.  You do not want to be, I do not want to be, patient zero in a cyber attack.  But how do you defend against a threat no one's ever seen? ESET Dynamic Threat Defense, that's  how. World-class ransomware protection. It's part of ESET's Protect Complete, the bundle does include  endpoint security, we've got a lot of laptops out there in the field because many of our people are  still working from home. Full disk encryption, I love that. The laptop gets lost, everything's protected.  And advanced security for Microsoft 365, which closes those gaps in the native protection too.  Right now you can get 20% off ESET Protect Complete, you can try it before you buy.  ESET, I've talked about them for years. Get your free ESET business trial and an interactive demo.

This is  to replace the surface book, the surface studio laptop with, and no, I, I used a studio for a  long time and they're not going to update that ever, but it has that kind of tilting  screen on a laptop instead of the weird hinge. It also has a base. You can see it in this picture  from windows central, which is for the fan because it's supposed to be very high end.  Paul was a little disappointed. He said, it's not as high end. It's not as fast as one would  hope. Do you, do you agree Daniel or you seem to like it?

If your thing is that you just want to game on it, it's an okay  gaming machine, but you'd be really dumb to buy this as a gaming laptop when there's so much better  other options out there. The reason you buy this is because you want to use those other postures  to stage mode where you get that kind of cool triangle effect. It's really nice for being on  a conference call, watching a movie, taking notes. Cause you can pull that screen all the way down.

Start time: 6425.26

It's kind of like the surface studio where you would use a  pen and draw on it. Somebody was saying though, it's not rock solid in that mode that it's a

Start time: 6438.36
End time: 6486.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  little bouncy. I had no issues with it, but there's obviously a little bit of a, you know,  it does have hinging going on there. But yeah, if you don't plan to use it for those things,  this isn't a good purchase. But I think for people who rely on the pen, do a lot of video  editing, stuff like that, it's totally fine. It's not there. The thing with surface, there's always  going to be something more powerful. There's always going to be something more affordable.  There's always going to be something with more ports. It's always going to be the case,  but you should be buying this for what it can do with those different postures in the pen.  And the whole package, you know, there's Acer makes the Concept D7, was it a Concept D easel,  which is, it has the same pull it forward design. Very nice display.

Start time: 6486.62
End time: 6488.92

Start time: 6489.06
End time: 6608.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, HP does. They do the delete folio. So this design has been done before, but  if we go with the Acer, you're going to get a much more powerful processor and it's going to be  cheaper too. But it's, the audio is terrible. You don't get a haptic pen. You only get a 16 by 9  display. It's plastic. You know, those aren't deal killers for a lot of people, but for some people,  they are right. There's a lot of benefit to what Microsoft has done in this design,  including a haptic trackpad for the first time. So, you know, this is for specific demographics.  120 Hertz display too. I think some people really want that. Yeah.  Yep. So there's a lot of firsts here. The audio is very good on it. It's got a very nice front  facing camera, which is still a problem for even, you know, HP now is starting to get on board with  five megapixel cameras and high end. Apple used to be the worst. I'm hoping Apple puts a decent  camera on the new laptops. Right. So this is like a complete package. It's very fast though. Like  I think people get a little too fixated on benchmarks and it really depends what you're  doing. If you're doing productivity work with this, it's fast enough. You can get this at 32  gigs of RAM, two terabyte SSD in there. You can get the 3050 Ti graphics or the A2000, which is for  ISV and engineering with, you know, CAD software. It's very fast. Like there's no moment you're  going to feel like this is slow, but it also depends, like I said, what you want to do with it. So  had they put in a six or eight core processor, it would have been faster. It would have also driven  up the price. It would have shortened the battery life. It would have made the device hotter. It  would have made the fans louder. So you have to figure out how all this stuff balances out. And  I feel like it did a nice job here in terms of balancing, but, you know, I put a lot of benchmarks  on there. It's a fast machine. Are there faster machines? Of course there are. So it really depends

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  probably next week. The company I've interviewed, so this is the company that makes the technology  behind this is called Sensil. They're actually kind of a startup out of, I believe San Francisco,  actually San Diego, maybe they're out in California. So their technology is what's actually  doing the haptics. Microsoft designed the trackpad itself, but they worked with Sensil here.  And this is actually, it's more power efficient than Apple's trackpad because haptics do require  power, right? That's how they operate. It also has a slider in settings so you can control the  haptics. How much kick do you want it? Or you can even turn it off if you just don't want it at all.  And it's, you know, they're not the first, Sensil also did the trackpad, the haptic trackpad on the  titanium X1 by Lenovo, but you're going to hear a lot more of Sensil's trackpads being in computers  coming out through 2022 and a lot more designs. But yeah, haptic trackpads are a big deal. They  solve a lot of problems, including breaking, more consistent clicking, and basically they can be a  thinner design, which then allows for larger batteries or thinner laptops. Battery life

If you just want a really nice  laptop and you don't need the pen, you don't need like the stage mode or whatever, then  there are better options out there. The audio on this, the 120-hertz display, the front-facing camera,  the power, the battery life. Have we sold you, Christina? Yeah, I mean, I'm, like I said,

Like I said, I'm really hoping that because I have a Surface Book as my  work-issued laptop now. And so I'm hoping that I also have a MacBook Pro, but that's very old. So  I'm hoping that I will be able to get one. And briefly, because Daniel also reviewed the

Transcript:  and it was difficult to find one. Surface Pros are one of those things that are polarizing.  You either love them or you go, why would anyone get a convertible with a bouncy keyboard? I mean,  for me, it's not for me, but I know people who just say, God, I love my Surface and I'll get  every one of them. You say in your review, Daniel, this kind of is the pinnacle of the Surface. It  should be, but they finally kind of licked a lot of the problems with the Surface. Yeah, right. I

Start time: 6833.50
End time: 6959.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mean, the latest Surface is always the best Surface, right? But this one is different because  they redesigned it to match the Surface Pro X, which was one of the first major modern designs  they've done with the Surface Pro series. But what makes this one good is the fact that they  just gave people what they've been asking for. So now you've got two Thunderbolt 4 ports. I connected  it up to an eGPU. In fact, I have it on my desk here. So I was running my Surface Pro 8 with an  RTX 3080 on my desktop, and then I used the other port going to a Thunderbolt 4 dock and connected  all my stuff there. And I was using that as my desktop setup as well, and it worked flawlessly.  And that's the power of having Intel and Thunderbolt. And when people go, why don't they  use AMD? It's like, well, that's why, as Christina pointed out. AMD and Thunderbolt don't mix in  laptops. And that's going to be a problem for premium multi books and AMD, but that's a separate  topic. But yeah, I mean, 120Hz display on that one, haptic pen, you've still got the  industry leading, still the best front facing 5 megapixel camera. That is the best mobile web  camera period on any device right now. You have a 10 megapixel rear camera, which is nice, you know.  They updated the audio, so now it's two watt speakers, and it's very good audio. Like,  Apple does very good audio in its iPads. This is like, it's getting there. Plus it has Dolby Atmos  and Dolby Vision for the display. It's just the entire package that kind of came together.  The 11th gen processor is good, and the new design is nice too. And then there's just small things.  Yeah, it's black. There's a black option, right? Black laptops are notorious for picking up  fingerprints and just looking really gross after about five minutes of using them, which is why I'm  a huge fan. They figured out a way so that this thing basically hides fingerprints. It's just all  these little small details they put into it that I think they're going to keep this design probably  for another couple of years. And I think that'd be fine actually.

Start time: 7070.26
End time: 7195.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what is the result. This year, obviously extremely weird in terms of things rolling out. So it's no  surprise that stuff's not perfectly in sync. I think in a perfect world, it's not like they  release an iPhone in September and then like six months later, they're usually like, oh, more iPhones  that are also new, right? I mean, yes, you have the SE that comes out every couple of years or so,  but it's not like it's read every year at the same time. I think in an ideal world, all the iPad  lineup stuff would come out roughly around the same time. I don't know that there's a huge  advantage for them targeting the spring, which they often seem to do with some of these, as opposed  to targeting the fall. The fall leads in the holiday season. It's traditionally Apple's biggest  quarter. You'd think they'd want all their sort of ducks in a row at that point, but it's also  very full. There's a ton of other products that get released in the fall as we're talking about  right now. So I can understand sort of wanting to do a midstream, but it does continually put these  sort of products in weird situations where, for example, the mini is now much better than the Air.  It's cheaper. And so if you don't care about screen size, then there's a lot of advantage to pick up  the mini. For a while last year when they revved the Air, it was better than the iPad Pro, which  was far more expensive. And the Air hits a weird price point, too, where it's like for a 64 gigabyte  model, you're paying kind of a premium. And if you want to go up to a higher storage tier,  you're basically like 50 bucks shy of an iPad Pro. And the question is, well, shouldn't you just  spend the extra 50 bucks and get one that's got more power to it? So I think they need to sort of  figure out what is our lineup? Where does the Air fit in our lineup? Because everything else  feels very clearly demarcated. You've got that ninth generation iPad that starts at 330, which  is like if you need the bargain basement but very capable iPad, great. If you want something that's  high end, the top of the lineup, the iPad Pro suits you really well. And if you're looking for  something small, then it's got to be the mini. But the Air is kind of all over the place. So  I like to see them do a rev on it. And I'm sure that'll come around next spring. But they got to  sort of figure out what is this product and who is it for? You're not in the Apple will do three  events this fall then camp. I think it unlikely. I mean, we're all expecting a second one. I am  not really expecting anything beyond that. I think that anything past that gets sort of in

I think I've told this story before, but on my  birthday last year, I was able to get three PS5s in one day. I had them shipped directly to other  people. I wasn't taking any profit on anything. I was just one of those things. I was told some  I'm going to get you a PS5. I found one for my friend Kelly and I got one for somebody else.

Transcript:  oh, well now I feel challenged. So that's the real reason. It's a challenge. Yeah. Oh, 100%.  So Apple, it's funny when Apple, when the court ruled on the Apple Epic trial,  Apple was saying we won and Epic was saying we lost. And I thought, well, wait a minute,  not so fast because Apple, aren't you going to have to now open your app store? Apple must have  known that ain't going to happen. They have now filed an appeal. If they, they're asking  for a stay on the injunction that says developers can add those buttons to non-Apple payment sites  in their apps. If Apple wins, according to CNBC, and this will be decided by a judge next month,  the change in policies may not take effect until appeals have finished in years. They may not have  to make a change in years. So Apple really did win that Apple Epic lawsuit. Yeah. I mean,

And they have more  money than anybody in the world. So do you think there's a shot that they'll get the injunction?  I think there's a possibility they'll get at least a stay on it as far as the appeal goes.

Start time: 7496.56
End time: 7505.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Cause they'll say, look, we're appealing this at your honor. So can we just not, cause we  don't want to do it until we hear the appeal. And the judge says, well, that's fair. And then that's

You're so good, Daniel Rubino,  Dan Moran, and of course Christina, I can get it for you wholesale Warren.  It's great to have all three of you on the show. Our show today brought to you by ITProTV. This is  October Cybersecurity Month. And man, is cybersecurity important when you're talking  about IT? It's all we talk about it seems like on our shows. It's one of the most vital aspects.  If you're looking to get into IT or if you're already doing IT and you want to get into  cybersecurity, now's the time. The world needs, there are millions of jobs literally waiting for  you with qualified individuals who have the certs in cybersecurity and there's no better place to  get the skills you need, the search you need than ITProTV. Start your IT career today with ITProTV.  You can learn IT, get certified in any of the jobs that you do in IT, desktop support, networking,  cybersecurity. One of the things I love about ITProTV is their stuff is up to date. This stuff  changes all the time. New versions of the software, new certs, the test questions change.  Microsoft just dropped the MCSE certification. There's a whole new set of Microsoft certs.  And of course ITProTV keeps up because they've got, this is kind of overreach, but they've got  seven studios running all day Monday through Friday. So they're constantly updating new  material.

It's a spooky month  for ITProTV this month in October. Jam-packed with events focused on cybersecurity.  They had an event, which I think is now online, but they've got more to come. You didn't miss it.  They've got a webinar at the end of the month, a Halloween themed webinar titled,  I guess everybody being costumes. I don't know, CyberSec Incident Response for Small Businesses.  It's subtitled Avoiding the Nightmare on Main Street. You can find out more about that at  ITPro.tv slash webinars. There's going to be a panel discussion this week, 5pm Eastern on the  14th. Dirty, if you're interested in a career, you should absolutely watch this. Dirty Little Secrets  of a Cybersecurity Career. It'll feature three cybersecurity experts. Don Pezet is moderating,  one of the founders of ITProTV, the host of their TechNado podcast. He's great. That's on the YouTube  channel. There's more information there on the ITProTV YouTube channel. And then on the 23rd and  24th, there's a free weekend at ITProTV. A chance to try a bunch of different courses, free as a  special, just for the theme, the following courses will be part of the ITProTV free membership.  Your CompTIA Security Plus Cert. ITProTV is an official partner of CompTIA. So they're the  official video partner. So they have great CompTIA stuff. The CEH Cert, which is one I've always  wanted, the Certified Ethical Hacker Cert.

They're fun, they're engaging,  and they're passionate about IT. And that passion makes it great content. Courses are 20 to 30 minutes  long in each section, so you can easily watch it during lunch break. They know, you know, you got a  job, they job, and you're trying to get a better job. This is something you can consume in your  part-time. The edutainers are all on staff, which is great because that means you can get assistance  from them during the day. I just think it's a great solution. The IT world definitely needs more  cybersecurity professionals than ever before. Get your cybersecurity certs with ITProTV.  Now here's how you do it. You go to ITPro.tv slash twit. There is an offer code,  30% off any consumer subscription, and it's 30% off as long as you stay active, forever if you stay  active. That's twit30, the offer code.

ITProTV, build or expand your IT career  and enjoy the journey. Great friends of the network. We've been with them since they started,  and of course, now they're just going great guns. So on Monday, somebody put a 125 gigabyte  torrent link on 4chan for everything Twitch.tv had. Twitch.tv's source code, projects they hadn't  launched. They talked about like Vapor, but hadn't launched. Passwords, streamer keys. Of course,  as soon as I learned about this on Monday, I immediately changed my password, turned on  two factor. They will force you to change your streamer key if you're a streamer. But the thing  that actually is really interesting is they also released how much money the top streamers make.  Well, it's actually how much everybody makes, but the lists have come out of the top streamers.  Number one, critical role, which I'm gratified to know is a D&D stream. It's not League of Legends  or something. It's tabletop. Apparently, they put a lot of effort into it. I haven't seen it,  costumes and sets and so forth. They made between, and this is just for Twitch, not anything else  that they did, not sponsorships or product placement or anything. They made between July 2019  and August 2021, more than $9 million. Nice work if you can get it. It's my opinion.  Some people like Vice is saying, this is terrible. This is for streamers. Oh no, this is awful.  My opinion, this is actually good for streamers and it's really good for Twitch because there  are going to be a lot of people say, you can make $10 million on Twitch. Count me in.  Do you think the people are pissed off that streamers make so much money?  I mean, that's dumb.  Well, people are always pissed off that anybody makes money.

But it turns out you need talent.  You need to be likable. You need to be able to entertain people. And guess what? Most people  can't do that. So I have no problem whatsoever with people making money out there for what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Actually, speaking of chess,  I was very gratified to see that Hikaru and a couple of big chess masters made hundreds of  thousands of dollars a year. Grandmasters are notoriously threadbare a lot. They've never made  any money. Tournament fees used to be a thousand bucks. It's a good job now to be a grandmaster  thanks to streaming on Twitch and other services. You can make some good money.

Transcript:  You can, but as Daniel points out, it's a job. You know this better than anybody, but the most  disarming thing and the people who are usually very successful are the ones who hide how hard  of a job it is. So you are kind of taken in by the fact that anybody could do this. But there's  planning, there's scheduling, there's scripting, there's editing, there's making sure that in this  case this D&D one sounds like they have costumes and lighting. Oh yeah, they put a lot. So it's 9.2  million dollars over two years. That's amazing. I'm not taking anything away from that, but if  you were to look at what their hard costs are in terms of talent and in terms of other things,  that starts to eat into that, right? To say nothing at the time. Well Twitch takes, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have massive opportunities. I'm not taking anything away from it. I'm just trying to point  out this is a job. This isn't like people are just sitting back and doing nothing. Some of the biggest  YouTube channels are basically run like small television networks in terms of the amount of  money and time and stuff that goes into it. And when you think about that, even the most low-end  cable, let's say a news program, like cable news program, you're talking about something where you  have a budget in the at least low level millions, right? So just to spend on equipment and other  stuff, obviously the budget on a YouTube thing can be less than that. But people, as they get  bigger, they need office space. They need accountants. They need editors. Again, they need  lighting. They have to take time for scripting. Managers. Yeah, this is a real gig. And I think  the hard thing too is that this is why we've heard so much about creator burnout over the last few  years is that to keep it going, you have to continue creating content. You can't take a break.  At least in traditional forms of media, you have either the typical television season or you have  breaks. Hiatus. Yeah, you have guest hosts that can come in and do stuff. You have support staff.  In these cases, the person is the brand and they can't take the break. So they're putting all this  into it. So I think on the one hand, it's wonderful that people are making all this money. On the  other hand, I feel like what doesn't always get the attention when people see these big figures  and they think, oh, I can get rich this way. It'll be easy. Is A, how much effort's involved and B,  how difficult it is to keep up on that grind. Because if you don't keep doing it, there's no  guarantee that if you take a few weeks or a few months off that the audience will be there when

Transcript:  you get back. Yeah. I can't imagine most people are surprised. I mean, we know Marques Brownlee  makes millions. Most people should not be surprised that there's money in this. And I don't think most  people- There's an audience. Yeah. I don't think most people would grudge it. Nobody ever said,  oh, Johnny Carson earns way too much money. Jimmy Fallon's way- No. No. We understand this.

Start time: 8243.34
End time: 8300.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I mean, in fact, actually, that's a great point. Like when you look at how much money  Jimmy Fallon makes a year and if you look at how much work he puts into it versus some of the bigger  streamers and bigger YouTubers, it's not even a comparison. And actually, when you look at audience  size, they're more similar than you might think. But one has institutional investment and backing  and massive, massive advertisers. And one is just coming up. But I mean, this is a real business.  This is a real opportunity. If anything, I think we should be happy that people are figuring these  ways out. But to Daniel's point, everyone thinks that they can do this. You can't. A lot of luck  is involved, but also it's just not something every single person can do. And even if you have  a skill, like if you're a grand master, that may or may not translate well online. And you may or  may not want to take the time away from your gameplay and your other things to deal with all  the stuff that goes into a stream. So, you know, I- I know a lot of people were doing it. And I know

I mean, or I mean, we heard a lot about this in the in the app gold rush as well, where  everyone's like, oh, I make an app, I'll get rich. It's like, no, it's hard, right? But anything,  books, movies, TV shows, the money has always been there. But a very small percentage of people can  actually pull off the work needed to do that. Substack, you know, is the new thing. Yeah,

Start time: 8364.56
End time: 8498.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  serious issue. Yeah. But let's also face it. Social media, as we talked about at the beginning of the  show, is designed to express outrage. So the people who are outraged are getting a disproportionate  voice. The vast majority of people are going, speaking of outrage, there's a lot of outrage  among Twitch streamers and other gamers, esports players about the new Coke campaign. Have you seen  the ad? I'm going to play it for you. I hope they, Coke doesn't mind me playing their multi  million dollar ad for free. For free. For free, Coke. I'm just pointing that out. Apparently,  it's going to lead up to some big announcement, but watch this. This is actually kind of an  interesting ad. It's about esports. So they're all playing what is not World of Warcraft,  except it looks exactly like World of Warcraft. It's some sort of battle royale. You got your,  you got your young lady playing a bunch of other guys. She's got an orc that's just really dominant,  you know, killing people right and left. The crowd's loving it. Then wait a minute,  he gets knocked out. Oh no, he's down. Is she down? Is she out? She reaches over to her little mini  fridge right next to her gaming station, takes out a Coca-Cola, drinks it. And look what happens to  the orc. He wakes up. It gets diabetes. Yeah, right. He knows. He knows that she's drinking Coke. Yes.  Apparently, he somehow knows she's drinking Coke and changes his tune. He says, wait a minute.  Why are we, why are we fighting this war? He, why are we so angry? And he goes over,  he throws his axe into the ground, says the hell with that, goes over, helps his opponent up.  War's over, man. War's over. The gamers are, wait, wait, what the heck, what, what's going on?  It's a new world. Peace has broken out. They're taking off their helmets.  Gamers all over the world are throwing down their mice.  All because of Coca-Cola.  It's world news. This is the long one, by the way. You won't see this on the Super Bowl, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're kindled in our hands, hands of the cop. Yeah. During a very, just a protest for peace.  The motto of this is we are one Coke away from one another. And so,  yeah, now admittedly it's, it's sugar water designed to cause diabetes, but  that aside, I mean, it's a nice message. Gamers are pretty upset that there've been memes. I

Start time: 8536.40
End time: 8567.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think they're getting the benefit of it. Oh yeah. I mean, they've, I mean, it's a bad ad,  but if they're getting the memes from it, then honestly Coke is getting all their money's worth.  The Pepsi ad was tone deaf and terrible and they had to remove it. That Kendall Jenner ad was so  awful. I agree. That was genuinely bad. Like, this is funny. Like this, I'm like, okay, this is  ridiculous and saccharine, but if people are going to meme it, then I kind of like it. I think the  Coke. And here's the other thing you should take away from this. E-sports is now big enough

End time: 8614.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's exactly what it is. I'm actually kind of sad they didn't tie that into the messaging.  Like they should have played some of the tones of that just for like the few people,  you know, in the target audience who would get that. Cause it, and that would at least be more  tongue in cheek. Like we're aware of the ridiculousness here, but like if they played  a couple of the, you know, like, like piano tunes, if you know, I'd like to buy the world of Coke.

Transcript:  exec or the ad person who came up with that was probably closer to like being like a Gen Z age  wise. I bet they had to fight to get that on the air. I'm sure they did. And, and, but I'm just  saying like, like for that to be as detailed as it is and whatnot, I was like, okay, you had somebody  who was younger, who, you know, helped, um, uh, craft that message. I would love to know the story  behind the campaign in that regard. No, I mean, like, like I said, the Pepsi ad is a legitimately  bad ad and funny for that reason. This, if people meme it, what they are doing unbeknownst to  themselves, getting so mad about the advertisement is they are literally just giving Coke the eyeballs  and the, and repeating the message over and over again, which is all Coca-Cola wants. Coca-Cola  is the number one, you know, soft drink in the world by a massive margin because everybody knows  Coca-Cola. Like that's, that's the joke. You can show anybody the logo in any language and people  are like, oh yes, I know exactly what that is. So speaking of getting ratioed, the most famous

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are not, most of these are new. Most of these are new in box. So usually, usually like  for some of their bags and other stuff, it might be used, but for clothing and for shoes, I think  that the rule is typically that it has to be. And actually what happens with stock X, which is great  because I think these came from stock X is that they first go to a place where people, um, inspect  them just to make sure that they're not counterfeit and, and then, um, and, and everything's  legit and then they send them to you. So this is actually a beautiful sneaker. Are you going to wear  it? It's really great. Oh yeah, I've worn them. Absolutely. No, no shoes are for wearing. Oh,  good.

Great to have all three  of you. Thank you all for watching. Twit is a show that we record. This is, I think, I think,  I don't know. You tell me if I'm wrong, but I think the longest running, continuously running  tech podcast in the world. We started April 20, 2005. So we are in our 16th plus year of operation.  It's pretty, I think that's pretty good. I think we've, we've kept up our standards,  maybe even got a little better over time. Certainly the quality's gotten better. We do  the show every Sunday evening about, it's, well, it's 2 30 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern, 21 30 UTC. If  you want to watch us do it live, you can hear the conversations before and after. For instance,  we talked a lot about the framework laptop before the show. Tune in a little bit early.  The live streams are at twit.tv slash live. There's live audio and video. People who watch  live or listen live often like to chat live with us at our IRC. That's IRC dot twit dot tv. If you're  a member of club twit, which is our, you know, our paid tier seven bucks a month to support us,  we really, that's the real reason to do it. We appreciate it, but you also get access to our  discord and that is a fabulous place to hang out and chat all the time. You get a free,  ad free versions of all of our show, not free seven bucks a month, but they're ad free versions of  all our shows, ad free and tracker free. And you get access to the twit plus feed really hot on the  twit plus feed right now. Steve Gibson did an ask me anything on a Friday and people are eating it  up. It's very, very popular. You can, you, even if you missed it on Friday, you can join the club now  and download it. That's a twit dot tv slash club twit. Thanks in advance. On demand versions of  the show available there, but also available on our website, twit dot tv. They're also, there's a  YouTube channel dedicated to every show has its own YouTube channel. And you can go there and watch  the videos. Best thing to do probably be subscribe and your favorite podcast player. If you subscribe,  you'll get it automatically the minute it's done of a Sunday evening, get it before everybody else  does just in time for your Monday morning commute. And if your podcast player supports reviews,  would you do us a favor? There's one downside to being the longest running tech podcasts in the  world. People forget about us or never heard about us and we don't make it on the charts  because we're not brand new. So leave us a five star review, kind of spread the word, help the,  help, help the world know about this week in tech. Thank you everybody for being here.  We'll see you next time. Another twit is in the can.  You're the twit.
