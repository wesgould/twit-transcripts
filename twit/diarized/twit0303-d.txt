Start time: 163.24
End time: 174.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I love the show. Sarah's role at TWiT is to keep me  informed on what the trends are.  So I figure she really should be doing a show  about, you know,  internet trends.

Start time: 175.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, she's perfect and we have lots of audience participation and so it's been  really fun just doing some episodes with her and lots to look forward to.

Transcript:  It's my new favorite show actually on TWiT. If you have not seen it, The Social Hour,  you do the show on Mondays  and it's available for download almost immediately at twi.tv.  I think we still have it on night though, right?  twi.tv, is it slash n-a-t-n, Jamerby?  I'm not sure.  Is it? It's S-H?  Yeah, twi.tv  slash T-S-H. Thank you.  Also with us today, Mr. Om Malik,  who's got money in his pocket.  Not in my pocket. I don't even have a pocket.  Om is the guy behind Giga Om, which is a great site and also has his own new newsletter,  which is, how many weeks old is this Om says?  It's about eight weeks old.  Okay, good. And it's a paid subscription?

Transcript:  No, it's a, I write it when I have something important to say.  I don't write it if just to fill up space.  So it's free and you sign up.  And sometimes I write four times a week, sometimes I write twice a week,  and sometimes I don't.  It's only when I have something to say, that's when I go for it.

Start time: 257.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't it, I'm sure it does feel like as a blogger, you've just got to post every day.  And even if you have nothing important to say.

Start time: 271.48
End time: 284.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, like we have a great team, so they post interesting things every day.  I try and refrain myself from doing, you know, just adding more noise to people's life.

Transcript:  Right, right. I like it.

Start time: 287.02

Transcript:  But why don't you charge for it Om?  You could probably charge a hundred bucks a month for this.

Start time: 290.86
End time: 312.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you know, this is, I would have written this as a blog post  and I would have given it away as free.  So there's no difference in that.  It just goes out as an email.  And then later in the day, like about 12 hours later, it goes up as a blog post.  So I don't think you can charge for something you've been giving away for free for so long.

Transcript:  It's interesting. I guess newsletters are kind of back.  For a while, it seemed like nobody was doing it.  Now everybody is. Everybody I know wants to write a newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's international.  That's good to have you. Now from France, we've got Patrick BÃ©ja.  Hey, it's nice to be back.  Not Patrick on Twitter.  That's me.  And he hosts a bunch of podcasts.

Start time: 342.38
End time: 351.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should really do what Om is doing, but actually when I have something to say, just go on Twitter.  So it's not that smart. I should start a newsletter too.  You're giving it away.

Start time: 352.04
End time: 363.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although Twitter is only 140 characters, I find that actually a great relief  because posting a long blog post, it takes me a long time.

Start time: 363.02
End time: 368.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Usually what I have to say is not that complicated.  140 characters is way enough.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We actually, I'm glad Patrick's here because one of our top stories is the EG8.  The G8 Summit is coming to France next week.  All the leaders of the major developed nations, the US, Canada, France, England, Germany and so forth, the G8 Summit.  The week before President Sarkozy, who's not known for being a champion of the free internet,  threw a little party for internet big wigs, including Mark Zuckerberg,  Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Eric Schmidt of Google, to create a white paper,  a position paper to present to the G8 leaders on how the internet should be regulated.  The fear was, I know Cory Doctorow wrote, I'm not going to go because this is just an attempt to get us to kind of rubber stamp something that I can't possibly agree with.  Sarkozy is so notorious for his kind of pro-business, anti-free internet stance.  What did the EGA end up being like, Patrick?

Start time: 440.18
End time: 532.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's difficult to explain because a lot of people were expecting it to be something that it wasn't meant to be.  I think, okay, what you have to remember is we in the tech world know what we should be doing and what works and what doesn't work,  even from a technical standpoint, let's set aside the ethical and moral implications of regulating the internet.  But you have to remember that the governments do not know what the hell even that internet thing is.  So I was one of the very few voices, I think, that thought this EG8 was actually a good idea because it was the governments recognizing that maybe they didn't have all the answers and trying to include everyone in the conversation.  And of course, at first, they're going to ask the people that they know and the people that they would go to anyway who have no clue either,  you know, the music lobby and the movie lobby and intellectual property rights holders.  But it's a willingness to open the conversation.  And I think we have to be part of that conversation.  And just look at how much voice, you know, Jeff got and JP Barlow got and a few others and compare that to things like ACTA and the Protect IP Act,  which are complete horrors negotiated in secret.  So it's starting the conversation, I think.

Start time: 532.90
End time: 582.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right.  You know, I was one of the people invited thanks to Louis Glamour and couldn't go because of family emergency.  But I was really glad to see Jeff Jarvis of our This Week in Google show go.  And he wrote a blog post before he left saying, I'm going to try to get Sarkozy and others to essentially sign a Hippocratic oath for the Internet,  that first and foremost, government would do no harm.  Jeff and I and many others, I know John Perry Barlow, believe that government should just keep its mitts off of the Internet,  that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of rights holders.  And, you know, I felt like, yeah, even if there's going to be some attempt to kind of whitewash what we say,  if we don't come to the table, then we've kind of lost our right to complain.

Start time: 583.82
End time: 627.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was there. There's definitely part of that.  And it's it's I mean, there's a lot of people who think there is there's bad intentions to begin with, like, OK,  we will say that they were included and we'll do what we want anyway.  But that they could have done even without the EG8.  And remember, this is related to the G8, which is if you want to talk to governments, there's no bigger venue.  And also, I have to say, as much as I appreciate the intent behind the Hippocratic oath,  I think there's a little bit of a disconnect between what we know.  And, you know, you can't tell the government first, do no harm to the Internet.  They won't even understand what that is about.

Start time: 627.84
End time: 654.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's actually what Sarkozy's reaction was.  Well, what do you mean? Of course, I'm not going to do any harm to the Internet  because they don't understand that the kinds of restrictions like the three strikes law they're talking about,  they don't understand that that's perceived by many as harmful.  They say, no, no, we're just protecting rights holders.  You wouldn't want an Internet where it was piracy was rampant and widespread.  That's not good. Do no harm means preventing that.

Start time: 655.32
End time: 672.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And Sarkozy was a little bit, you know, aghast.  He ended up regaining his composure.  I thought it was quite politic.  Yeah, no, he answered quite well in the end.  But at first he was like, do you know what you mean? Of course.  Right, right, right.

Start time: 674.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, Omar, do you have a thought about this?  Have you been, did you follow the EG8 summit?

Start time: 680.34
End time: 775.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was also invited. I refused to go for one basic reason, which is that, you know, I don't,  given a man has to prove his intent by his actions and not by empty words.  So when a politician invites me for something, I'm already on guard because  And the French president has had a pretty bad track record of being, you know, not, I'm not,  I think, you know, you made a comment earlier saying that anti-business and anti-Internet.  I think those are two, I think you can be pro-business and pro-Internet at the same time.  And all you need is to think differently about what Internet represents.  So from that perspective, I thought this was a bit of a sham.  And frankly, this is a group of people, a group of countries, which are trying to define the Internet  when the Internet is going to be defined by 2.5 billion people who are not really represented in the GA.  Right. So it's actually arrogant and, you know, annoying to see French people trying to define  what the future of the Internet looks like.  If I need to know that, I think the dialogue has to be with people from, you know,  the representatives of China, representatives of India, people from Brazil, Russia.  That's a good point.  And from people of the African continent.

Start time: 775.36
End time: 777.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you have to start somewhere, Om. I mean, the...

Start time: 777.64
End time: 798.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's incredibly disingenuous. You're talking in theory, in theoretical.  Yes, ideally, that should be the case.  But you know that's never going to be that way, at least not in the short term.  The people who are going to decide how things are handled are, you know, the US first,  and then France and the other countries in the G8.

Start time: 800.14
End time: 840.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I disagree with you entirely on that, because if you look at how China and Brazil and India and Russia  are evolving as Internet economies, they're not taking their cue from the US.  They're doing their... That's an entirely different kind of an Internet forming.  They have a whole different, you know, DNA when it comes to the Internet.  I think what we are talking about is two different Internets.  Because the Internet, as we've known so far, has been very Western, you know, influenced.  But I think now it's beginning to change.  And I think that is why... Sorry. Sorry, Amber. Go ahead.

Start time: 840.70
End time: 880.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's OK. I just... You know, one thing that just comes to mind when we're talking about this  I wonder how a group of people who come together at a conference like this,  which is, you know, kind of an international conference,  can really talk about the fate of the Internet when I view it as something that is really country specific.  And when I say that, I think of Canada, for instance, where there are people in this country  who are fighting and have been fighting a long time with the government to make sure that  the major telcos don't restrict bandwidth and have plans that are based on bandwidth.  And we're really fighting towards eliminating those type of plans.  And so even though a group of people, I think, internationally,  who get together and talk about the future of the Internet,  I think that's a great thing.  I really see this as something where, you know, country by country, it's treated so differently.

Start time: 881.06
End time: 903.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I understand what you're saying, though, Om,  is that it's like a recasting of the white man's burden,  that these eight nations should decide something for the whole world is kind of foolish.  But... And I agree it wasn't ideal, but that's why I wanted to go.  At least you kind of have to, at some point, you have to start the conversation.  Would you prefer to see some other conference?

Start time: 905.14
End time: 953.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a conference. I think the government actually has to keep its, you know...  Keep its mitts off.  Yeah, exactly. And before they do that, they actually need to educate themselves and not have conferences.  They need to know... And I absolutely, you know, I see it locally here in the U.S.  We have, you know, lawmakers who have, you know, some of them have not even used email  and they're trying to regulate the law.  So, you know, it just is you have to be...  This is not a conversation which happens at a conference, which is basically in my...  It was more to showcase, you know, a certain person as like a future leader.  Sarkozy.  Yeah.

Start time: 955.10
End time: 1003.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there is some of this, definitely.  And absolutely, I don't want to be naive and say that he wasn't, you know,  trying to make something political out of it.  But what you were saying is some people who don't have email are writing laws about the Internet.  That's exactly the issue.  And I think this is their way of saying, OK, what we've been trying until now is not working.  So let's talk and let's have a conversation.  And I also think that we're talking about two different things.  When you're saying we should include all the, you know, China and Brazil and these other countries  that are indeed huge and that will matter a lot, this is not exactly what we're talking about here.  We're talking more about what Amber was mentioning, which is net neutrality and restricting bandwidth  and how to protect IP and very immediate issues that are threatening to break the Internet  from our rich countries' perspectives.  Yeah.

Start time: 1003.32
End time: 1059.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, let's not forget that ACTA, which is probably the single most destructive treaty  with regards to the Internet, is really a product of U.S. intellectual property rights companies,  of the movie companies, the record industry, who influenced the World Intellectual Property Organization,  the United Nations WIPO, to create this.  It was being sent from country to country without discussion in secret.  And had it not been uncovered by Michael Geist in Toronto, or actually, I guess he's up in Waterloo.  Ottawa.  Ottawa.  Had it not been uncovered by Michael Geist, we may never have known that this was going on.  That's coming from us.  So it seems not inappropriate for the G8, you know, for people like us to come and say, hey, stop it.  And the thing is...

Start time: 1060.82
End time: 1098.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Patrick.  The thing is, to us, these things seem monstrous and asinine as they relate to the Internet  and the way it functions.  But these people who are deciding all of this don't even see it, don't understand.  It's like, you know, trying to explain what sight is to a blind person.  It's very difficult to make them understand what that is and why it is bad.  So that's why we need to go there and explain to them and shout at them, partly, you know,  in the way that Jeff did and tell them, stop, you're being insane in this.  They don't see it that way.  Om, what would you have preferred to see?

Start time: 1100.32
End time: 1229.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would have preferred to have a long discourse on this and long conversation,  which is not posturing in public, at least, or in one-on-one conversations with people  who actually can make a difference.  And not just a few people, but a more wider group.  See, what is IP in one country is not IP in another country.  What is bandwidth, free bandwidth, like unlimited bandwidth in one country is not necessarily  the economics in another country.  So the web and the Internet is changing itself.  And I think the bigger picture, when you look at all this, I think the big picture,  which we frame things in an aspect of just certain specific issues, whereas one has to look at  this big Internet as a bigger change.  It's like, what does it really mean?  So the conversation should have been if they wanted to talk about it, what is the reality of Internet economy?  How does it impact job creation?  How does it impact our education system?  How does it impact our retail businesses?  So those are the areas where government has a more tangible role to play.  They need to kind of come up with thought processes around what do taxes look like in the Internet-enabled economy?  Like, we are not, this is not 1995, this is 2010, 2011, and our economy is now driven by the network,  not the other way around.  Previously, the network was driven by the overall economy.  Now, it's an entirely different way of thinking about it.  So just to talk about certain intellectual property issues, those are talking about certain specific problems.  There is a much bigger, wider change which is going on.  And that's where government and lawmakers have a role to play.  And I think that's one thing I didn't hear from this conference.  So that's one thing I would love to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just going to say, just speaking as a Canadian, I think on the positive side, I really applaud this actually happening  because I think it opens up dialogue.  And that's something we always fight for on the Internet as we want to be heard.  And I know in Canada, for example, there is no way Stephen Harper, who is our Prime Minister,  would ever invite a group of people who are technical to a meeting with him and his government.  It would never happen in an open forum or an open environment.  So in some ways, I think France is ahead of the game with that.

End time: 1305.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you also have to, sorry, I'm interrupting everyone.  The delay is not kind to me.  The way I saw that event is a little bit of a networking event, and it's to get people to know each other.  And maybe at this point, the people who are writing the laws are asking the IP holders what they should do.  But maybe in six months or in a year, they'll ask Jeff Jarvis or JP Barlow, you know, they'll get to know them.  And OK, maybe I'm having my rose-colored glasses on.  No, but how could they even have known that these issues were issues?  They live in a different world.

Start time: 1305.84
End time: 1322.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the question.  And I think that what I'm saying is they didn't care.  They weren't even interested in that.  This was a dog and pony show.  And I have to say, I have a feeling that no matter what you say to Nicholas Sarkozy about this, you're not going to change his mind, Patrick.

Start time: 1323.36
End time: 1328.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not his mind, but it's not like he is the one, you know, writing the laws.

Start time: 1329.06
End time: 1356.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because President Obama did not even want the Internet on the agenda at G8.  And this was something that Sarkozy kind of bulldozed through.  I think Obama quite reasonably thought this is probably not maybe I don't know, maybe he even agrees with Ohm that this is not an appropriate conversation for that particular group.  Certainly, he did not want to get in the business of regulating the Internet.  That's such a thorny subject.  And there are bigger issues.

Start time: 1357.56
End time: 1375.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, bigger issues, maybe.  But first of all, if we don't talk about it, we get Akta.  Second of all, with that event, if nothing else, we got Jeff in front of many cameras around the world.  Yeah, he'll never be invited back, I can guarantee you.  Maybe, I don't know.  But at least the press is now interested in.

Start time: 1376.62
End time: 1421.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff really did exactly what I was hoping he would do.  He did a great job.  And I kind of took the easy way out.  I did have a family emergency, but it made it convenient for me to kind of avoid the conversation entirely.  I really was looking forward to going.  But I was shaken by people like Corey and Ohm's criticism of the event.  And I just don't know.  I mean, I feel on the one hand, it's good to have these conversations.  Look at all the conversation that's gone on because of this.  I don't think you're going to educate the world leaders at a forum like this, but at least the conversation is going on.  I guess what you're saying Ohm is that it's a false premise that this could even be discussed at this kind of event.

Transcript:  Leo, you've been around long enough, just like me.  When we had the last time technology was hip and cool, all the politicians were all talking about internet and new laws and new ways of thinking about it.  And the minute economy took a little nosedive and everybody just vanished into thin air.  And I kind of, you know, maybe I'm a little cynical and skeptical, but I don't see this needs a lot more thoughtful engagement than just a quick media show.  I agree. I agree.

Start time: 1463.74
End time: 1475.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree on that too.  But I guess my question is to both of you, what's the harm?  You know, worst case scenario, things don't change and we keep on the road to Akta.  Best case scenario, we get a little bit more publicity.

Transcript:  And by the way, I agree 100% with you that the internet is good for business.  The real issue is that the kind of existing stakeholders want an end to competition,  want an end to a free internet because they got it and they want to hold on to it.  And I include Google and Facebook and Apple and all the current stakeholders in this.  But really the future and this is, I guess, the argument is that a free and open internet is good for the future.  It's good for businesses of the future.  You don't get another Google unless you have a free and open internet.  And that's how we make sure that we continue to progress and continue to innovate.  But I would I think that that's an important argument.  I think that the problem was that the people who were at this event were for the most part,  current stakeholders who had an interest in the status quo and that really need to who needed to be represented was my kids and our kids kids.  The future who have an even bigger stake in the free and open internet.  Sarkozy talked about a civilized internet, which kind of curiously is exactly the phrase that the Chinese government uses.  I don't think you can civilize the internet.  I think that's a that's a mistake in even understanding what the internet is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clearly, that's my point.  That just says everything about the whole event.  You know, civilized internet.  I mean, that's presumptuous to say that internet is not civilized.  You know, there is parts of Paris where you can go and they are not very civilized either.  That's true.  Right.  I think come on.  It's like that just I think, you know, this is where there are a lot of people in France.  I think I have a lot of admiration for people who have been championing broadband and wireless internet neutrality in France.  And yet, you know, Sarkozy and Orange are so close and Orange is not being the friend of the internet, so to speak.  Right. Unless there was a company called Free, they would have not even offered to, you know,  fiber and high speed internet access and web services to their customers.  And they could have just kept on going, charging more money.  So if you're talking about a civilized internet, let's just define what is internet according to you.  I think, you know, I don't want to go into like a political discussion here, but this was a lot of, you know, for me personally,  to other people, it may seem like a great thing.  To me, it was nothing more than just a way to get cheap media points.

There's a couple of options as far as providers, not a whole lot of conversation.  However, we do have champions out there.

Transcript:  I was reading GigaOM today, the great article about the Chattanooga internet,  the gigabit that the Chattanooga Power Company was providing, it was basically a civil internet.  Not a civilized internet.  And what a success that's been for Chattanooga.  And more and more, I really think that this is the future of the internet,  is to have municipalities provide the kind of infrastructure,  and then have a lot of competing ISPs on top of it.  And I think when I mention this, a lot of people think I'm nuts that there's no way that that's going to happen.  But it's working in Chattanooga.  That's a great article, and people should read that if they want to see what the potential is for an amazing success story.  GigaBit, and good for business.  Really good for business.  We're going to take a break.  Ohm Malik is here from GigaOM, and his new newsletter, Ohm Says.  More signal, less noise.  Amber MacArthur, my old buddy from the Social Hour and CP24,  and of course, the great Command-N.TV, and Patrick Bajaj, not Patrick on Twitter,  who for some reason I don't fully understand, is a whole bunch of English language podcasts.  Are you nuts?  And makes a regular appearance on TNT.  But you got the Movelicious, the Fillius Club.  One day I'm going to be on that show.  I hope so, yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah, that was an interesting time.  I think there was more attention paid to that, the scandal, the IMF chairman scandal,  than there was to the EG8 summit, or even the GA.  You know, I misspoke because the G8 is over.  I didn't even...  There was hardly any...  The EG8 got more ink than the G8.  There was hardly anything.  That was my impression too.  Yeah.  Oddly enough.  Mark Zuckerberg apparently presented to the GA, presented the results of the EG8 to the G8.  I didn't see how that went.  Mark likes to kill his own meat.  We're going to talk about that in just a second.

Transcript:  Can I just conclude on that EG8 thing?  Yes.  Just to get us all in agreement, at least to try.  I guess the thing that we should try to get is to put the internet issues and the technology  issues on the...  To have them become electoral issues.  And maybe that event makes enough noise that maybe people outside of the tech community  are going to start paying attention and respond in case they get that, you know, issues put  forth to them.

Transcript:  Well, I think you make a good point.  I think that's the real problem is that while we geeks know about these issues and care  about them, nobody else does.  And the mass of voters have no idea that there's an issue about...  That there's a threat to a free and open internet.  They have no idea.

Transcript:  It's really hard to get them to care, though.  I know I've been involved in sort of net neutrality campaigns in Canada for a long time, and it's  really hard to get the mainstream population to care.  They can't even understand it.  They can't understand it.  Even net neutrality does a disservice to the whole reason, you know, people who care about  net neutrality.  The term is just awful and it's hard to explain to the general media and the mainstream population  as well.  So I fear that they just don't care.

Start time: 1944.76

So, I mean, when you try to get them to care about the internet, I don't know where you're  left.  They don't care about war in the Middle East, let alone the internet.  We just had a federal election and again, you know, one of the all time, close to an  all time low as far as voter turnout.  And you try to get push the internet in there.  And I mean, it's a whole world of apathy.  Right.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break, come back with more with our esteemed panel, our international  panel for our Memorial Day show.  But before we go any further, I'd like to talk a little bit about one of our esteemed  sponsors, the great folks at Citrix who do go to meeting.  Go to meeting is an online meeting system that just you probably tried these before.  It is the best.  It allows you to meet easily with colleagues, clients, even if you're traveling or moving  around, especially because they've got that great iPad app.  Now you can go to meetings with your iPad.  I love that.  I want you to try it right now.  Mac or PC.  If you visit, go to meeting.com, click the try it free button and use the offer code twit  T W I T. You get 30 days free.  It allows you to set up a meeting on the fly or while you're on the phone with somebody  saying I want to show you this.  Here's a link or ahead of time.  It's got a great invitation system.  It includes built in free telephony voiceover, voiceover, internet or telephone.  So that the conference bridge and everything is automatically set up.  In fact, these days we use go to meeting even when we just want to do a teleconference because  you never know.  It makes it so easy to set it up and we've already paid for it.  It's built in.  It's absolutely free.  Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button and use twit as the offer code to give it  a try.  128 bit SSL so it's secure.

Go to meeting.com, use the offer code, twit.  We'll go from a heavy subject to a light subject, but it'll get us into the Facebook.  And there's quite a bit to say about Facebook.  I think this is just weird.  According to fortune.cnn.com, Mark Zuckerberg now no longer eats anything he doesn't kill.  Ohm, you're probably a vegetarian, so this would be easy for you.

Transcript:  But don't you feel disconnected from the?  I don't.  Mark Zuckerberg.  This is so weird.  He says the only meat I'm eating is from animals I've killed myself.  I'm eating a lot healthier foods and I've learned a lot about sustainable farming.  You have to say that.  I kind of admire them.  The moral point of view that, well, I'm not going to eat it unless I unless I look it  in the eyes.  Before I he says on his Facebook page, he says I just killed a pig and a goat.  He says he it's just very strange.  Every year he fixates on a personal challenge.  For instance, I didn't know this in 2009.  He wore a necktie every day.

Transcript:  It's so strange.  What I wonder about this whole story is how does Mark Zuckerberg have time to go out and  meet?  I mean, when there are people out there, especially with young people and there's all these privacy  issues and there are issues with Facebook in general, as far as people, you know, I  don't know if it's jeopardizing kids futures, but I know a lot of young people who are writing  things on there who shouldn't be writing them.  They don't understand the settings.  The navigation is terrible.  All I kept thinking when he actually has time to go out and kill a goat and a pig,  shouldn't he be focusing on privacy?  Really?  Very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It's also it's so fun to have a tech billionaire be eccentric.  Maybe he can be some sort of Howard Hughes or something.  That's very true.

Start time: 2246.80
End time: 2264.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, though.  I think I kind of liked it.  And pardon the pun before Zuckerberg came out of his shell.  And the reason I say that is because seriously, you know, the social network, the movie before  that movie came out, you never heard anything about his personal life.  And now he's sharing pictures on Facebook talking about what he eats, his hobbies, his  pastimes.  I don't know.  Well, that's a good point.

Start time: 2265.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's just getting weirder and weirder.  And now he said something to a couple of days ago that actually got got my dander up.  He said privacy anxiety.  He said, you'll get over it.  No big deal.  So what are you so worried about?  He says every time we this was he was speaking at the EG8, by the way, he says, we'll roll  it out.  And pretty often there'll be this backlash and people will say, OK, we don't like this  new thing.  I it's I think a real anxiety.  People were really afraid of more people being able to be involved in the social network.  This guy completely doesn't understand what we're upset about.  People thought that, you know, it was just too much, right?  They wanted to share stuff on the site, but they didn't want it to be so much in people's  face.  You know, now it's just part of the site that I think most people in the way would be like,  what's going on?  How can there be a Facebook without this?  He says it's just anxiety.  You'll get over it.  What are you so worried about?  That's very self-serving.  Here's a guy who's got a problem, if you ask me.

Start time: 2344.24
End time: 2373.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree with you.  I mean, tell them to friend you.  I have family members who are teens who, you know, some of the things that they're sharing  openly on Facebook, they don't understand how to control any of the settings.  They're sharing their phone number, their home address.  And I'm sure it's a parental issue as far as monitoring what their kids are doing.  But the parents and the teachers don't understand the privacy settings either within Facebook.  So it's an issue where I think Facebook hasn't taken enough responsibility.  And when he says things like that, just kind of in stride, I mean, it just downplays what  I think is a really serious issue about the future of kids and using these sites.

Start time: 2373.84
End time: 2406.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really comes from maybe you know better, Om, because you know this guy, but it really  comes from, to me, a complete misunderstanding of how people feel about privacy.  He's essentially saying, no, you really want, he said this before, people's lives are better  when we're connected.  All of this stuff about privacy, you should let go of that.  It just happens.  It's very self-serving because his business, the more we allow him to share, the more money  he makes.  But I think he genuinely believes that privacy is a dumb thing, except, I don't know, maybe  when it comes to himself.

Start time: 2407.94
End time: 2485.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the, there's one issue, and I'm not trying to defend Mark here, but I do feel  that the next generation of users think very differently about privacy and how they use  the internet, whereas some of us who are a little older, or even not as old as me, for  instance, who don't, who are uncomfortable with the lack of privacy, so to speak, on  many of these social networks.  And I think that is, we can't ignore that fact.  I think that is a legitimate issue out there.  And as far as, the way I look at privacy is that you kind of have to make choices on what  you say and what you don't say in public.  And I think that all of that is going to come from education and education that comes with  using the internet, not some, our school's teaching or our parents telling us what to  do as kids.  So I think that there is a, the culture itself is lagging the technology in that sense.

Start time: 2485.64
End time: 2525.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dana Boyd has said that.  She studies young people and says that the young people treat privacy differently, that  we believe that privacy is a default, so we're upset when it fails us, and that young people  understand that you have to, you actually have to say, I want it to be private, otherwise  it's not.  But she also says that privacy is maybe not the right phrase for this.  She says we want control over the flow of information, understanding where what we say  goes and controlling who gets to see it.  I guess that's how I understand privacy.

Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say that term digital reputation management is being tossed around  everywhere.  And maybe that's a better phrase to use.  And as much as I agree with Am in terms of people, younger generation, caring less about  privacy, the issue is they're still coming into a workforce where the people who are  hiring them care about them sharing things online and they're getting scholarships, where  they're getting these scholarships or winning these scholarships from schools that are looking  at all their online profiles.  And it's going to be a while before that really young generation who doesn't care as much  about privacy gets into positions where it's going to equal things out.

But I see how people, this upsets people.  And I feel like that Facebook is a little disingenuous to you, use your word, Patrick,  about what they're up to.  They act as if, well, you'll want this when in fact, really, who wants this is Facebook.

Start time: 2594.68
End time: 2650.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's true, of course.  And I think you all made good points in the fact that we absolutely need to know more  about what our privacy settings are.  I think people like maybe us just assume that anything we put out there on Facebook, be  it private or public, should be considered okay in case it ever leaks.  So we're sort of careful.  I think I took a line from your book there, Leo.  But just to be fair to poor Mark, who we're ganging up on today, I think one thing he  was mentioning where he has a case is the fact that whenever he puts up a new feature,  and that's true of everything on the Internet, whenever anything changes, people are going  to be pissed off.  And everyone was threatening to quit Facebook.  I'm looking at you, Leo.  Yeah, I quit.  And yeah, you did, but you came back and all these issues are not exactly.  But no, I'm not happy about it.

But a lot of people were unhappy were expressing their anger very, very vocally.  And in the end, that anger sort of fell back and no one is incredibly upset about some  of the features that Zuckerberg has.

Transcript:  Yeah, not things like not things like the feed.  He was mentioning in his speech when the feed just arrived, I think it was 2006 or seven  very early in the life of Facebook.  People were in uproar.  You know, it's that thing of of changing a feature or piece of the interface.

Start time: 2699.46
End time: 2746.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. I know what you're saying.  And I agree with that in the sense that but I think he's conflating two different kinds  of anger. There is when anything changes.  If I change, you know, the the backdrop behind me, people are going to get be upset.  Oh, you change is ruin it.  You jump the shark. That's one kind of upset.  And I understand that people don't like change and they get upset.  But then they get used to it.  But he's conflating that with I think the very real and legitimate concerns people have  about Facebook's changing privacy policy and how hard it is to figure out what the hell  is going on there. You know, you know, from one moment to the next, you don't know what  is going to happen to stuff you post there.  And you're right, Patrick. The right assumption is just assume it's going to go public.  But that's not the problem they're making.

Start time: 2747.40
End time: 2791.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. But I think he's doing that.  Absolutely. And it's absolutely because that's what Facebook wants.  Convenient. Yeah, no, completely.  But I also think that we are doing that a little bit, too, in saying that users are  still completely upset about every one of those new features that they were upset about  when they were introduced, things like, you know, tagging the tagging someone else on  the photo. People realized, OK, it's no big deal.  If I if I don't like it, then I delete it or, you know, these kinds of little things.  The general privacy setting is an understand ability of the privacy settings is a huge  problem. I agree. But not everything is to that level of, you know, Defcon five.

Transcript:  But it's not it's not just privacy on Facebook.  I would argue just from someone who runs a business, I make a living by doing social  media and consulting clients.  And the reality is they change so many other things on Facebook on a weekly basis, like  if you want to have a contest on on Facebook every week, they change the rules and  regulations. I just get this feeling.  I don't know, Mark. I don't know who he works with at that top level, that these are a  bunch of young people are just like, we'll change it this week.  See what happens. I feel like there's a lack of respect.  Yeah, it's the culture and it's an arrogance.  And it feels like it's a lack of respect for users out there who depend on the service  to connect with friends and family to do business.  And they just are, you know, switching things up kind of, you know, haphazardly.

Start time: 2828.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's the people at Facebook who are like that, I think, but they have  a culture of trying a lot of new things.  And, you know, what I've seen is that, you know, Facebook as a company, you know,  pushes to the very extreme, to the very edge and sees how far it can push its  customer base. And then when there is a pushback, so they pull back a little bit.  Yeah. And then they do it again.  And so they've, you know, they've, you know, they won, you know, that movie any  given Sunday. Football is a game of inches.  I think Facebook is Facebook has adopted that philosophy when it comes to privacy  and changes. I would say one thing about Facebook, at least they don't put do no  evil in their corporate.  They start with the assumption that they are going to do something.

You know, I don't want to be don't want to sound too  skeptical and too cynical about everything.  But that's how, you know, life normally works out.  It's just companies make money and they'll do anything in order to further their own  interests. And so that's OK.  You know, we need to be just aware of that basic reality.

Transcript:  Although I think you can look at how the companies make money to understand better  what their agenda is.  I mean, Facebook makes money.  Both Facebook and Google make money through ads.  But Facebook makes money by using the information you give it to allow advertisers  to target those ads and sometimes very personal information.

Oh, no, I'm sorry, president of Intel's McAfee division.  I forgot Intel bought McAfee and Lisa Hook, CEO of Newstar.  I don't know. I mean, I don't know.  I don't have any experience with these committees.

What would Stephen Harper do?  Stephen Harper, honestly, I don't want to say he's one of the most evil leaders  in the G8, but if you look up what Stephen Harper is open about sharing  and how he does business, he has kind of locked down information in this company  and in this country in a way that we've never experienced before.  And, you know, he's you know, we've been kicked off the Security Council.  So need I say more?  So he will not be involving anyone  from an open technology platform in an advisory role.

Transcript:  Leo, that's it's supposedly the first time Twitter's  bowed to legal pressure to identify anonymous users.  Now, I have to say, I have some experience with this.  We had I don't know how much I want to say about this.  There was a tweet that was problematic and we got a subpoena  and we were able to track down the person who did the tweet.  But it took court orders, several court orders to do it.  It was a threatening tweet and we wanted to make sure  that it wasn't a real threat, not to myself, but to somebody else.  And we had local police and then had to subpoena.  It was a number of processes we had to go through.  It's not an easy thing to do.  But and Twitter doesn't give you that information.  All they give you is an IP address.  Then you have to go to the Internet service provider.  And from them you get the person's name.  But we were able to do that.  Ryan Giggs, who is a soccer player for Manchester United,  was named as the plaintiff in a gag order,  preventing reporting of an alleged affair with a reality TV model.  He's trying he's trying to get the names of Twitter users  accused of revealing details against the injunction.

I'm sorry, the case before,  apparently they informed the guy and he declined to contest the subpoena,  which is why they ended up interesting releasing his information.

It was very embarrassing.  And he said my Twitter account was hacked.  And, you know, I think the good news is people learn very quickly  about the difference between a DM and a reply.

Start time: 3352.72
End time: 3389.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what happened.  I think he didn't understand the difference between a DM and a reply.  The woman deleted her account immediately.  However, bloggers located her and identified her Twitter handle  and found a second account.  She's believed to be a journalism student in Washington State.  And apparently in the original account she had tweeted,  I wonder what my boyfriend at Rep Weiner is up to right now.  Of course, that's why she got a picture of his crotch or somebody's crotch.  We don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah, well, I have to say, though, he I mean, his response and the fact  that was humorous, if he just said nothing and closed down his Twitter account,  I mean, this would have been a very different situation.  So I think he kind of alleviated some of the drama by just responding,  being kind of funny and using a quirky hashtag.  He kind of in some ways, even though obviously he doesn't totally understand  how to use Twitter, if he did publicly do this, he understands that, you know,  it's important to reply quickly and to use some humor as well.  And kind of pull things off.

We'll talk about that in just a second before we do, though,  I'd like to mention our friends at Ford, sponsors of our photo show,  the Mostly Photo Show, visit the website, Mostly Photo Adventures.  We'd love to have you participate.  We have the way this works is we have a little contest going on on Mostly Photo  where people submit photos to our Flickr group, which is Mostly Photo.

And it's just a game of lawsuits.  And the problem is, we have a very broken patent system in this country.  Right. But does it mean that they're all ludicrous or are some of them actually valid?

Start time: 3818.04
End time: 3852.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but there is like this one might actually end up in some kind of  out of court settlement between the two companies.  I mean, it seems there is enough on both sides to to kind of have to deal with it  in a more effective way.  I think just like you had the the lawsuits between Nokia and Qualcomm,  and those resulted in settlements.  So there may be some stuff which might happen on this one.  But otherwise, I just see like a lot of the the other ones that are not,  you know, I can't even tell.  I actually stopped trying to figure out.

Start time: 3854.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3871.60
End time: 3909.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's promise that Apple has a building full of lawyers.  They got to do something.  Your friend, Jacob Nielsen, Amber, the Nielsen Norman Group,  just did a comprehensive study of.  Apps on the iPad, they gave 16 study participants  access to the NPR app Flipboard, the Daily  and the Amazon app, among others, to see  if they could figure out how to use it.  They had two months with these apps.  And according to the Nielsen group,  people have no clue how to use iPad apps.

Start time: 3910.78
End time: 3938.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this kind of drives me crazy.  I do. You're right. I do love Jacob Nielsen.  I followed him forever in his usability studies.  But can you really call 16 people a comprehensive study group?  I mean, when I read that, I just had somehow had doubts  because I look at my own experience with my son, who just turned two years old.  And he can figure it out.  He knows how he plays Angry Birds.  He's on like level 14.  I mean, he's two.  He's two. And he knows how to use a people.  He uses about six or seven apps right now.  He's not toilet trained.

Start time: 3938.80
End time: 3941.66

Transcript:  He can't use the toilet, but he can use an iPad.

Start time: 3941.76
End time: 3969.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I'm wondering, who are these people who they found?  Because I understand that, you know, apps, obviously, there are different apps.  Some are easier. Some are more difficult.  But the reality is people choose apps based on their own preferences  and hobbies and things that they like.  And so to just give people a bunch of random apps and say, OK, start using this  and not know enough about the background of these people and their interests  and their technological skill set.  I just think that, you know, 16 people in a study like this,  it's a great headline, but is it really a well, all right.

Start time: 3969.34
End time: 3997.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me this is some of the things they suggest.  I have to agree with them in one respect.  Every iPad app has a different UI. Yeah, that's true.  I mean, it's because there's no standard at all.  There's no menu bar.  So all of them, you end up and I think this is why little kids are good at it.  Trial and error. You end up just doing things.  Swipe, push, poke.  And when something happens, a kid loves it.  They go, oh, and and and that's why little kids are better than adults.  Adults are saying there's got to be some sense to this.

Start time: 3998.46
End time: 4092.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Leo, the the the the thing with iPad  and kids is exactly what I was talking about.  Young people and privacy and Facebook is that they have  a whole different way of thinking about things.  Touch is a very natural interface and they can figure it out very easily,  especially when it comes to games or educational software,  which prompts them to do things.  They would have done these things in real life.  I think those are the applications which are being successful.  I think there is a reason why Angry Birds is so successful.  There is a proper touch physics behind it.  You know, it just didn't happen.  So they taught this one through that.  How can anybody use it without having a learning curve?  And I think when you look at something like NPR app, that is a brilliant app.  And anybody can use it.  I say the same thing about the Amazon app is the same thing.  I would not say the same thing about the other two you mentioned, right?  The daily and and Flipboard, there are work in progress just yet.  And so I think, and first of all, to say that 16 people  are a comprehensive study, I don't think so.  When you think of an iPad, you have to stop thinking of it  from a predictable user experience that you are used to on a computer.  And I think that's where, you know, all these apps are created and apps  are reviewed with a PC mindset.  I think that's exactly what is going on right now.

Transcript:  There's also a study that says  French consulting firm Miratech.  So this one's from France, Patrick  just published a research report saying that people reading news on an iPad  are skimming and can't remember what they read.  I'm sorry, I can't remember what you just said.  Readers are more likely to skim over articles on an iPad than in a newspaper.  20 percent of users have better retention when they read something on paper  versus an iPad.  There's no difference in the amount of time it takes a person  to read an article on the iPad versus a newspaper.  So they're not they're not reading it faster.  They're just remembering less.  And on average, eyes linger longer on paper.  Implying more focused reading.  People's gaze, they did eye tracking on this people's gaze patterns  when they look at a page are identical on an iPad versus a print newspaper.  There's just something about it.  People just aren't remembering it.

Start time: 4151.86
End time: 4199.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I have to say, even without going to eye tracking,  I don't know if you guys are guilty of that, too, but I've been using on the iPad  RSS reader application, and I found that recently in the last few months,  when I come across a story, if I don't get everything I need to know  from the headline and I jump into the story and it's more than three  you know, paragraphs long, I sometimes don't even want to read it.  Headlines go, you know, I'll iPad users are easily bored.  There you go.  I'll just get my information from, you know, the either  Twitter or podcasts or but if you need to condense it so much for to grab my attention.  Do you guys see that at all or do you still read long articles?

End time: 4219.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm bored. Let's move on.  Yeah. No, in fact, I think that's why readability and instapaper are so great  because, in fact, most of the time when you're doing  content consumption on something like an iPad, you are skimming.  But the ability to say, save that so that I can read that later.  I think it's very valuable.

Transcript:  But you never go back to that, Leo, because I mean, the experience always.  Yeah, I never go back to it because there's a sense of urgency online.  You know, we want we want information that's new, that's fresh.  And so the idea of going back to news, I mean, that's how I hate to say this,  but that's how I feel when I get the newspaper on the doorstep in the morning,  even though we still get the newspaper is like, you know, 80 percent of it.  I kind of already know it's anxiety provoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. I do have to say that she is using new media in in such an impressive way.  You know, when I first.  Well, you saw that Chrome ad, right?  And I watched the Chrome Lady Gaga Chrome ad, and I thought, oh, well,  those so superficial, her tweets, you know, claws up little monsters,  stuff like that.  And then somebody said, no, read her tweets.  And she actually engages with her audience.  She at replies people.  She's totally in there.  Amazing. She I mean, Amber, I'm sure, you know, she's next book.  She's going to be a case study.

Start time: 4372.14
End time: 4392.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, she's phenomenal.  And, you know, she's she sent a tweet a while ago that was  kind of inappropriate.  And she actually apologized for it right away.  And she's so connected to all of her fans.  I totally agree with that.  I mean, I think that she's done a great job of using a bunch of different channels  in the social media world.  I just find it's one of those things.  It's like Gaga saturation for me.  It's too much. Right.

Start time: 4393.56
End time: 4395.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4397.62
End time: 4408.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I kind of think it is.  And whoever, if it's not her, they're doing a great job of being authentic.  Exactly. So it feels like her.  But, you know, then again, you know, as far as authenticity,  I feel like she ripped off Madonna.  So that's a whole other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch out. So there is on my on my personal blog,  omis.me, there is a video of this person who talks about Gaga ripping off Madonna,  Madonna ripping off somebody else, etc, etc.  The music, as they say, the idea of original music is just going away.  I think what Lady Gaga has done is establish that the media is a game of attention.  It doesn't matter what platform you use, what channel you use, what methods you use,  the more attention you get, the more you know, the bigger star you are,  the bigger star you are, the more you can monetize it.  I think she embodies that attention economics better than anybody else.  Her and Justin Bieber are two perfect examples of people who use the Internet  to their own advantage and very effective.  That's why I like, you know, is will I remember her music, you know, six months from now?  Probably not.  And I also and I also listen to Lady Gaga just to annoy one of my colleagues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I did.  I bought the 99 cent just because I just because it was it was cheap.  But apparently.  Gaga gets the same royalty, whether you buy it from iTunes or Amazon.  So essentially, Amazon's making up the difference.  Billboard magazine estimated that it was about seven dollars, 40 cents per purchase.  There were four hundred forty thousand copies of Born This Way  sold on Amazon during that 99 cent promo on Monday and Thursday.  Four hundred forty thousand.  Wow. Which means it cost Amazon about twenty one million dollars  for this promotion. Was it worth it?

Start time: 4539.40
End time: 4556.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it comes down to the cost of acquisition of a new user, right?  It means that they paid seven and whatever dollars to get a new user.  Maybe they won't stick around, but still worth it.  It seems like not too much of a, you know, not too high of a price to get a new user.

Start time: 4556.28
End time: 4576.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, because those people now are buying music on Amazon.  Some of them set up Amazon accounts they didn't have before.  They know how to do it.  They've they've they can now come back and buy another album.  And they're using the cloud service, right?  Because as soon as you buy even one 99 cent album, you've got 20 gig storage.  The upside for Amazon is great.

Transcript:  OK, get ready for this because we don't know yet.  But it's it's presumed by all and sundry that Apple is now going to announce  iCloud now that Amazon and Google have kind of stepped forward  with their music services.  Everybody agrees. In fact, you know, there's a lot of evidence  that they've already made.  Unlike Amazon and Google, Apple is making deals with record companies.  And here's what they're going to get  because they've made a deal.  You know, right now, with Google Music, you could put 20,000 songs up there,  which is amazing, but you have to upload each and every one.  So it took me several days to get my 6000 song collection up there.  Now it's up there. It's on my phone.  I mean, I can stream it to my phone, my my tablet, whatever. I like that.  What you really want to do, though, is just kind of run some program that says,  oh, yeah, you got that, that and that.  We'll just put a copy up there.  And apparently this is what, according to rumors,  this is what Apple is going to do.  With iCloud, they will scan your iTunes library.  And then put a high quality copy of that same song on your iCloud  without uploading, and that's why they're licensing it from the music companies.  They'll even replace any low bit track  copies with a high quality version fully licensed.  Now, unlike Google and Amazon, they'll probably charge you.

Start time: 4709.21
End time: 4714.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we don't know, you know, Google is probably going to charge you.  Maybe this is the free beta now. Right.

Start time: 4715.12
End time: 4736.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was estimated that if Google had done a deal that Google  apparently talked to the music companies about this and everybody,  the music company said no to Google.  They were doing things like saying, well, you got to charge  thirty dollars a year for this.  But ultimately they felt like Google was just a platform for piracy  and they didn't want to have anything to do with it.  Ridiculous. But it's probably, you know, that's the thing.

Start time: 4736.76
End time: 4768.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that thing that that Apple is probably going to do,  which is scan your library and getting making everything available to you,  is presumably what Amazon and Google wanted to do also, but couldn't.  So they had to do that weird work around where you have a locker in the in the sky,  in the clouds.  But Apple, ironically, is now the music labels best friends  because Google and Amazon wouldn't play ball.  It's it's quite an incredible turn of events and very lucky for Apple.

Start time: 4771.50
End time: 4796.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm excited about this.  I think, you know, I'll definitely use it.  I think it's a good thing.  Just to be able to have access like that to all my music in the cloud,  I'm constantly running around and I'm not near, you know, my computer  and my iTunes library and then they're different on every computer.  I mean, it's kind of a mess, to be honest with you right now.  So the idea I could just have it in one place and be able to access it anywhere  online is a huge advantage and  hopefully it happens soon.

I think that they're really they're doing so many interesting things.  I think this Gaga promotion was huge.  Do you know that they launched a Mac download store this week?  It was I don't think it got a lot of attention.  If you go to Amazon dot com, good luck finding it.  But you can but they launched a store  that will allow you to download apps for.  Macintosh, just like Apple's own app store.

Transcript:  Well, how is it to store, though, it's not a piece of software that you  install install on your Mac, doesn't automatically download and install  the software, it's just a page with lots of Mac software.  Yeah, for download.  Right. But really, that's such a big deal.  I guess you get the rights to it and then you can reinstall it.  The software you bought has a lot of the advantages of Apple store without

I mean, no, this is  regarding what you were saying earlier, Amazon is going to be apparently it's  very likely that within six to 12 months we're going to see Amazon emerge as  the one competitor no one expected to Apple in that whole mobile world.

Start time: 4928.18
End time: 5027.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I think there is I think we have to just take a little step back on this.  You know, this is a business or slash.  This is an effort which is going to be put in services like download dot com,  which is owned by CBS on the defensive.  Number one. Number two,  the.  Amazon's business is to sell things,  whether they are physical things or digital things, whether it's video games,  music, software, if apps are what people want to buy,  they're essentially selling those and what they are going to do when it comes  to tablets, they are thinking about tablets or Kindle or whatever it is  as a way to sell more digital goods.  That's they're not selling hardware.  They're selling digital goods.  So they're coming at it from the exact opposite end of the spectrum versus Apple.  I think they have both these companies have very clear strategy.  And I think Amazon is taking the right approach.  They're being very methodical.  And you know what they have is what Google  still doesn't have is access to people's purchasing this information.  They have one click and you can start buying whatever you need to buy on Amazon.  That is an incredibly powerful asset they have.  And they're leveraging across different  verticals, whether it is the Android store or the Mac store.  You know, why shouldn't they be doing like a Windows store or Amazon, you know,  Windows store? I'm sure they will.  Yeah, I mean, it's like I mean,  people want to pay for software and they can make it easy to buy.  Why not?

Transcript:  And exactly corresponding to what Om is saying is saying, look at the MP3  service that they offer from Amazon to Google.  You can't even buy anything on Google's.  Yeah, that's a major flaw.  This is this is why, you know, Amazon could afford to antagonize the music labels.  I'm talking about that music service specifically, but they could afford  to antagonize them because they already had the deals to enable the selling of music.  Google could not afford to antagonize them.  And they did it anyway because they're Google.

We're talking about audible dot com, the audio bookstore.  This I tell you, the integrate, you know, the new Amazon Kindle.  I was really surprised.  I thought this was a very interesting use of integration.  When I, you know, it's your account, so you open it up and it has all your books.  It also had all the Amazon, the audible books I'd ever purchased  and it would automatically be downloaded to the Kindle.  That's I don't know if that's on other Kindle's or if it's just the new Kindle,  but it's certainly where Amazon's going forward.  And I love it because, you know, now I've got my audio and my Kindle books all  available on the same device audible dot com slash twit to.  Here's how you get involved with audible.  If you've never listened to books before, we understand.  Maybe that's a little scary.  Maybe you maybe you want to try before you buy.  Well, go to audible dot com slash twit to you get two books.  Two books free, you sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  Your first month is free.  The books are free and they're yours to keep forever.  Cancel at any time.  I just you know, every time I actually it's bad because every time I go to the audible  page, I go, oh, here's another interesting book.  Oh, the Believing Brain from Ghost to God's Ballad,  How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforcements.  See, I can't wait to read this.  It's like going to a great bookstore.  And the neat thing is about audible is that, you know, you can listen to these in  your car at the gym as you're cleaning the house.  There's so many places that you can listen to audible books that you really  couldn't get be reading anyway.  This is the one this is next on my audible listen list.  I love David McCullough.  I love his voice.  I love his writing is one of the great historians.  And I think you'd like this, Patrick.  It's called The Greater Journey Americans in Paris.  It's about American artists, writers,  doctors, politicians, architects who set off for Paris between the years of 1830  and 1900.  And I mean, so many great American cultural icons like Ralph Waldo Emerson,  Mark Twain, Oliver Wender Holmes, Nathaniel Hawthorne,  Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in Paris as they created.  So this has got my two favorite things, Paris and David McCullough.  Listen a little bit to The Greater Journey Americans in Paris.  David McCullough's you'll recognize his.  Oh, wait a minute. Oh, he doesn't read it.  Edward Herman reads it, but he was also great.  Another great actor.  I'm not getting any audio from it.  That's my fault. I'm doing something wrong.  That is, by the way, one of the nice features on the audible site,  audible.com slash twit to as you can listen to any book, preview it and see how  you like the reader and so forth. So there's one book.  I see that another one of my all time  favorites has been named as the best audio book of the year, one and audio  award, Keith Richards, Fantastic Life. So good.

Didn't Lady Gaga do a Gagaville that's like a part of Farmville?  Four hundred million dollars in profit on eight hundred fifty million dollars in  revenue. They're valued at 10 billion right now.  But they'll probably go off even more than that.  Wow.  Do you think we're in a bubble, Om?

Start time: 5792.80
End time: 5926.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I don't think you know, to call it a bubble is.  Not right now, you know, give it another 12 to 18 month and when you see more  insanity, then we would be in in a bubble right now.  I think what we are is is an over-heated investment environment and its investments  in a certain kind of tech company.  What you're seeing is you're hearing about these companies and these funding so much  more often than you used to in the past.  And it gets amplified on Facebook and Twitter so quickly.  So you start to believe that there is an actual bubble.  There is a bubble at the lower end of the  spectrum where new companies are getting funding.  You know, if you look at LinkedIn, it's a pretty solid company.  It's been around for almost 10 years.  I mean, just because it's the first new exciting technology IPO in a long, long  time, so people are overpaying for it right now.  And it's you know, you find its own medium.  It's pent up demand.  It is.  And I think bubble is when you start to see companies with absolutely no  fundamentals start to go public and, you know, everybody around you starts  to talk about them.  That's when you know things are incredibly crazy.  Right now, market is extremely, extremely over-heated.  People are very excited.  There's a lot of excitement going on in the Valley.  That is still doesn't reconcile with the overall economy.  The overall economy is still pretty slow.  Things are not going that well.  But you also have to remember there is  because there is no other opportunity to invest in a lot more people are  interested in investing in technology now.  So everybody is putting their attention on technology.  That's why JP Morgan has like a fund for Twitter and social stuff.  And, you know, Goldman Sachs is investing in companies like Facebook.  It's most most of that is because there aren't that many growth opportunities  elsewhere. The overall economy, to put it mildly, still sucks.

Transcript:  I just wonder what's going to happen to all these mobile companies, though,  especially some of the mobile companies that have, you know, they've gotten a  couple of million dollars and they have sort of a one hit wonders, you know,  like one game that has done really well.  And then there's this pressure to come out with something else.  But then there's obviously someone right on their heels.  It just seems in the mobile space,  particularly, like I said, with a lot of the, you know, some of the smaller  companies that you can get money just by having a decent idea on the mobile front  in a game that you project will have some revenue.  And you see this all over the place right now.

Transcript:  But you know, who's shown that you can do  well with one hit is Rovio with Angry Birds.  I mean, that's really a one game company.  They've just sliced it and diced it so  many great ways that 200 million downloads of Angry Birds.

Transcript:  I think the thing Amber brought up a very good point.  I think even Angry Birds is, you know, has to prove that it's like Zynga.  It can take one hit game and create a franchise of multiple games and multiple  revenue opportunities. So I think this is, you know, we can't like  the thing is, if we could look into the future and predict it, we'll all be billionaires.  Right. So we can't.  So right now what we have is anecdotal information and we're trying to project.  What's going to happen?  I just think it's going to be a little bit more frothy over next 12 months.

Transcript:  And there's very little loyalty, I find.  You know, if all of a sudden a game developer has come out with one mobile game  and it's really cool, it's not as though I'm following what that developer is  producing next time around.  So there's just not that loyalty there.  Like there maybe were with some of the websites and, you know, 10 years ago,  a decade ago, where people were buying from sites and really latched on to the  whole experience on the site.  People don't really know who's behind what games coming out.  So I think that that's also a tougher sell long term.
