Start time: 169.41
End time: 202.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  I had been covering remote work for a long time just here and there.  And then suddenly with the pandemic, there was just such a need for more information.  So I felt really lucky to have been following the trends prior to that, to know what are  remote first companies do?  How do they do it?  How do they do it well?  What have they learned in the last 15 years they've been doing it?  So it's been really great to be able to share some of that with people who genuinely need  it right now and continue to need it.  Well, as it turned out, yeah.

Transcript:  I thought when we were preparing this show that WWDC be the big story.  Well then, Sheryl Sandberg decided to quit.  That has to be the big story.  Let me start with you, Jill, because Sheryl became almost a feminist icon some years ago  when she published Lean In.  She survived the death of her husband and a lot of adversity and became really more  and more important at Meta.  I don't think she had the role when she first started.  She had the name Chief Operating Officer, but I think she really became more and more  important as Mark Zuckerberg's partner over the years.

Start time: 331.44
End time: 360.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was always known as the grown-up in the room.  She was the one who brought a little bit of an air of professionalism, held things together.  It's hard to judge anybody for stepping down when they've been in a position for a long  time in a company that's taken a lot of heat and rightfully so.  It sounds like there may be some issues related to burnout for her.  I don't fault her for stepping down.

Start time: 360.78
End time: 389.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely not.  Although Meta had just been kind of reorganized with the annunciation of Nick Clegg to do  global affairs, it looked like a triumvirate for a while.  They had Mark Zuckerberg handling the software and the technologies and then Sheryl Sandberg  running the business and then Nick Clegg fending off the government attacks.  Alex, what does this do to the structure?  She won't be leaving until this fall.  Does this change how Meta runs?

Start time: 391.73
End time: 419.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so.  I think it's indicative of the change in the company's focus.  Sheryl Sandberg is synonymous with the company's advertising business because she was really  brought on to build that.  Now as the company moves more towards the metaverse, which I think is one of the squishiest  concepts in all of the history of technology, I think she makes less sense as the obvious  number two.  Honestly, just speaking as a human, who wants to be one of two and then suddenly told you  she's going to be one of three?  Well, that's true.  It feels like a demotion by dilution.

Start time: 420.28
End time: 437.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I would think she would want the shield, didn't it, Clegg?  The biggest headwind for Meta these days is government inquiries.  Let Nick handle.  That's what I felt like Mark was saying.  We don't have to do this, Sheryl.  Let's just let Nick handle that.  He's like Mikey.  He'll do anything.  Just let him do it.

Start time: 439.20
End time: 460.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I was her and I had had this one particular job that I had run for so long and then the  built the financial side of it, at least, said, hey, we're going to pivot and do something  else entirely different.  I would be like, cool, have fun.  I've already made my money.  I'm going to go sit on a boat.  And personally, you would never hear it from me again.  I would be too busy enjoying the sun and an endless supply of margaritas or whatever.

Start time: 461.16
End time: 493.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She in an interview after she announced her resignation, she said, this shouldn't be taken  as a sign that Meta is moving away from the advertising business, which is probably right  since it's 98% of their revenue.  Javier Olivan will succeed her.  He is head of product engineering and he'll take over ad sales as well.  But I wonder, Dan, if this isn't really, as Alex says, kind of a sign of the times for  Meta, that they are moving to the metaverse.

Start time: 496.02
End time: 505.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hard for me to know.  I should make a disclosure before I say anything.  And that is that the Facebook journalism project funded one of our projects.

Start time: 506.94
End time: 510.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As it did Jeff Jarvis's as well.  They've been very good actually doing that.

Start time: 510.88
End time: 526.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, I saying that there's a sort of this triumvirate that was forming, it's  hard to be part of a triumvirate where one person controls everything.

Start time: 526.64
End time: 527.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all the shares.

Start time: 529.24
End time: 552.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the best description of the structure of Facebook is that it's an empire with an  emperor and it isn't her and it isn't this, no, it isn't Clegg, it's Zuckerberg.  It's so, and it's hard to suggest to me anyway that much is going to change.

Start time: 553.36
End time: 585.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says she wants to focus on her philanthropic efforts.  And she intimated that for a woman with a high profile, this is an important time to  become an activist, probably referring to Roe v.  Wade and other women's issues.  But there's also been some, you know, nattering about maybe political ambitions.  Dianne Feinstein's 88.  She's up for a reelection in two years.  Our senator from California.  I could see you think, Jill, that's part of the equation?

Start time: 586.48
End time: 614.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's not something that I follow very closely.  I think, you know, the larger issue that I see here is that we put so much pressure and  spotlight on people who are executives.  What are you going to do next? What are you going to do next?  What are you going to do next?  It's I don't know.  I don't follow any of her political ambitions, so I don't know.  But, you know, I don't know.  I'd be just as happy to see people, you know, fade out and do what they want to do.

Start time: 615.92
End time: 659.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing I'd throw in there, Jill, is that I mean, if you keep going to Davos and you  keep sitting on stage, you put yourself into the conversation to a degree.  Now, that doesn't mean that she has to do anything next.  I mean, again, I would be on a boat.  But, you know, Dianne Feinstein was my senator when I lived in California for a while.  And it's probably time for a fresh face.  And we have seen, I think, business people, generally speaking, presume that they can  translate their experience into the political sphere.  Don't forget Howard Schultz, Starbucks man himself, tried to run for president, I  believe it was before Biden ran.  Didn't get very far either, did he?  No. Turns out money and business acumen do not always translate into electoral  politics. And so to me, I doubt that just because I don't think it would go that well.

Start time: 659.86
End time: 716.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of, Jill, I agree burnout is probably a big part of it.  She's estimated her net worth is one point six billion dollars.  She doesn't probably have to do anything.  She's got kids. She remarried.  Or is about to remarry, actually, next month.  That might be the other reason. I mean, she's got a new family.  She might want to spend time with them.  And you know what? God bless her.  That's not an issue really for us to worry about.  More interest is what it means to Metta.  Mark's spending 10 billion dollars a year.  He's got 18000 engineers working on whatever this next thing is.  Metaverse is clearly that's Mark's focus.  And by the way, people have said that Javier's her successor is not going to be the same  powerhouse that Sandberg was.  So maybe this is kind of is it is it kind of the beginning of the deceleration for  Facebook, the social network?  You know, it's funny about this.

Start time: 717.56
End time: 748.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you think about the end of the Google era with the founders, they kind of stepped away.  So did Eric Schmidt, who was their adult in the room back to Jill's earlier point about  what Cheryl's done for Facebook, Metta, we're seeing the opposite.  We're almost going to doubling down from Zuck, if you will, because if the replacement for  Cheryl is going to have less power internally and as you know, Dan pointed out, it's certainly  soft power because it's not based on voting control of the company.  He seems to concentrate more power back in the hands of the monarch or the emperor, depending  on which which phrase you prefer.  He doesn't have the power anyway, regardless.

Start time: 750.87
End time: 767.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's making a big bet.  He's making a big bet.  I mean, if all your money comes from advertising and that will probably continue for some time  still to focus so much of your energies and the 18000 engineers and all that money on  the metaverse is a big is a big bet.  It's a big gamble.

Transcript:  Eighteen thousand engineers doing what is my question.

Start time: 770.52

Transcript:  Good question. Maybe I got that number wrong.  I think that's what that's what I remember.  I might have that wrong.

Start time: 774.90
End time: 785.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We I mean, Joe, Dan, do you guys play games?  Are you interested in the metaverse?  Because to me, like, I'm a I'm a gamer and a person who has a PC that can run the stuff.  And I keep waiting to care interest.

Start time: 785.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, you know what?  Many, many years ago, I was I worked for Game Developer Magazine.  I was the managing editor of Game Developer Magazine.  And this is the early 2000s.  And there was so much talk even then about, you know, what's what's going to happen with  mobile games, because that was still like pre iPhone days.  What are mobile games going to do?  How they're going to, you know, some customizing to you based on your location.  And there was this whole immersive technology idea, which I guess we're now sort of calling the metaverse.  And like it comes up in conversation, but it's a matter of what what do people actually want?  What do people want to engage with?  And I think you'll always get a slim number of people who are willing to go all in and try it out  and be on Second Life and have their classroom there and whatever else.  But like, will it catch on with everybody?  My answer is no, I don't I don't think it's going to be a big explosion.

Start time: 842.98
End time: 875.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a it's a hard thing when you're you know, a tech company.  We always talk about the innovators dilemma.  Apple's in the same boat where 52 percent of their revenue now comes from one product.  It's always a challenge to say, well, you know, this engine isn't going to go forever.  What's the next lily pad we're going to leap to?  And I don't I think it makes sense for Facebook to be looking for another lily pad.  But I agree with both of you.  I don't feel like the metaverse is going to be the next big thing.  That's what you think.  You think that if you read a lot of science fiction,

Start time: 876.20
End time: 900.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've done a good job of sort of using acquisitions  to spread out what their business does a little bit.  Right. Like if you look at WhatsApp and Instagram and Facebook,  those are sort of the three big pillars. Right.  But they own a whole lot more than that.  And I think that may have been strategically in a business sense,  their best move to date is sort of diversify through through acquisitions.

Start time: 900.86
End time: 932.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do they monetize WhatsApp?  They haven't. I mean, they're not putting ads.  I haven't used WhatsApp in a long time. They don't put ads in it. Right.  I don't know if they can even monetize that.  That's really more of a service than a than a profit center.  Instagram, I do use and is worse and worse all the time.  Isn't it? It's terrible.  I see photographers now saying, where do we go? What do we use?  This is not a good place to show off your photography.  It's now it's looking like Facebook.  It's so algorithmic that you don't know what you're going to see.  I have what I see. I don't even know who these people are.

Start time: 934.02
End time: 974.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe some of these issues are.  This is, you know, my fond wish that never has come true yet,  that we're going to go back to a truly decentralized  creator economy, not not a Web three, by the way.  As it's developing.  But we're blogging the way it was, makes a comeback,  where a number of things happen to give people their own platforms  where they don't live or die at the whim of a couple of very large companies.  So if if I had a wish, it would be that  all of these moves in the end become irrelevant.

Transcript:  Yeah. Look at the popularity of our email newsletters.

Start time: 986.36
End time: 998.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's true.  There is this kind of new writer as a term thing.  Maybe that maybe that's some of it.  Podcasting is is consolidating.  It's going to be a few big companies.

Start time: 998.18
End time: 1012.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's it. It's noteworthy on newsletters that  a venture funded company is trying to basically create a monopoly there.  So on a platform basis.  So be careful. We get what we wish for.

Start time: 1015.78
End time: 1028.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can we go back to Leo's point about Instagram becoming Facebook?  Because there seems to be a parallel here between what we observe  in the world of fintech and what we see in the world of social networks.  And in fintech, all companies end up looking like one another.  Like Square started off with a little credit card reader.  Now it does a zillion million things that are very similar to what SoFi does,  which are all fintech kind of becomes the same thing over time.  I wonder if there's like a crapification end point for all social networks  when they essentially become so over optimized for near term  ad incomes that the user experience must be essentially whacked with a stick repeatedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read an article recently about how I got myself off of Instagram the same way.  So I don't use the Instagram app.  I still look at it, but I use it on a mobile web browser.  And it is so paired down.  It looks nothing like TikTok when you use it that way.  You don't get as many videos pushed in your face  and you only see content from people you follow.  It's adding a little bit of friction can help.

Start time: 1120.22
End time: 1147.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's brilliant. I'm going to have to start doing that.  I don't want Instagram is the only Facebook property,  meta property that I have an account with.  And it's just so that because they set it up, you can't show Instagram pictures.  And I like to show people's images and stuff without an account.  Actually, the same thing with Facebook, but I don't care.  When I pulled up Sheryl Sandberg's message,  there's a one third of the screen is, well, you're not a member.  Join, log in. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you mentioned that you don't use WhatsApp and  Leo, as you know, I've kind of lived in a couple of different places around the world.  And it's really hard to impress upon people in the United States  how much WhatsApp is used outside of the U.S.  So it's not just for person to person communication, but it's also businesses.  So, you know, my friends in Colombia, when they order takeout food,  they WhatsApp the restaurant and send a direct payment.  And that's how their food comes.  Like WhatsApp really fills in a lot of gaps  in in mobile offerings outside of the U.S.  in ways that people don't seem to understand.  And the other kicker to this is that a lot of phone companies outside of the U.S.  will offer WhatsApp messages or Facebook messenger messages for free.  So it doesn't deplete people's data usage.  And that's really how they've gotten their claws in.

India said, no, we have a good experience with colonialism.  It's not a good experience.  We have a history.  Not this time. Not this time.  Not again. Yeah, we're having this is kind of a different kind of twit.  It's a little more.  I think it's a twit kind of fireside chat after hours  sitting around talking with smart people.

Transcript:  We're taking a little break. Come back.  Lots more on this week in tech.  Hey, our show today brought to you by something  I've been telling my kids for years. Wealthfront.  I know it's so much fun to buy NFTs  and fantasize about how much money you're going to make off your Dogecoin investments.  But honestly, playing the stock market, buying individual stocks,  buying cryptocurrency, that's fun, but it's a little risky.  I would say it should be enjoyed in moderation.  Something like casino gambling or questionable street food.  When it comes to building your wealth for the future,  day trading stocks is not the secret to success.  Wealthfront, in fact, has a ton of data to show that time in the market  almost always beats timing the market.  Wealthfront is going to build based on questions  they ask you, things like your risk tolerance, your goals, your planning.  What are you planning for retirement?  College fund, you know, buying that first house.  So you're going to tell them what your plans are, your time frame is,  and then they will build a globally diversified portfolio.  Three important words, globally diversified portfolio  that will automatically optimize over time to hit the goals you set  and the risk level you choose.  You also get things that only Wealthfront could do.  They invented something called tax loss harvesting.  They actually invented the software.  It basically lets you, when the stock market is down,  reap tax benefits so that when the stock goes up,  you have something to offset your gains.  It's actually a brilliant way to balance your investment.  That's that's what Wealthfront's all about.  You can personalize your portfolio.  They have a selection of funds, again, portfolio handpicked  by Wealthfront's financial experts.  Categories include social responsibility, clean energy.  Yes, you can do cryptocurrency, but by by creating that basket of funds,  it's a much less risky investment.  They've got cannabis. They've got all kinds of stuff.  So because I know people like to have, you know, a little bit of say,  in what the investments are.  When we started talking about Wealthfront some years ago,  they were just getting started.  They are now 27 billion in assets.  Half a million people use it.  And in good news, Investopedia just named Wealthfront  the best robo advisor for 2022.  And we're just halfway through the year to start building your wealth  and get your first $5,000 managed free for life.  Go to Wealthfront.com slash twit  W E A L T H wealth front  F R O N T dot com slash twit to start building your wealth.  Get started today. Wealthfront dot com slash twit.  And now back to our panel.  Back again with our panel, I guess, if we're talking about Metta's  ambitions in the metaverse, we can't leave out Apple's  supposed metaverse ambitions tomorrow.  WWDC, the Worldwide Developers Conference.  Apple seems to have already gone, I think, to.  You know, Apple, I have I'm convinced maybe you can.  Maybe you can. Dan, give me some insight into this.  We used to be the Wall Street Journal, but there are various  journals, journalists or gossip, whatever that Apple can go.  Sub Rosa go to and say,  hey, don't say I said this, but we're not going to announce anything on Monday.  And then you'll see this kind of bubbling up.  Sometimes it'll say, well, I've heard from my sources, but more often  it's just I have a feeling.  And that's what I'm starting to see from Mark Gurman,  Ming-Chi Kuo and others.  Some of the rumor mills, Renee Richey on Macbreak Weekly kind of echoed this.  Don't get your hopes up tomorrow for hardware.  We're thinking maybe tomorrow Apple would announce or at least talk about its first.  We know that what we've heard that they plan to release this year  headset. Dan, is that is that how Apple works?  They kind of do this little subtle.

Let's get disappointed now.  Is that what you're saying?  What a disappointment.  I'm only being half facetious because I am excited about what Apple's going to build  in the headset department, because, like I said, waiting for this technology  to grab me and Apple has a history of making me buy new stuff.

So that and we have this vision of googly eyes in the front so that they so that you  because you're wearing this headset, you know, let me I don't know.  I'll have to simulate it with this.  I'm wearing the headset.  No one can see what I'm thinking or looking.  But if you put googly eyes in the front, so if there's a camera.  So these are all rumors.  For some reason, more than two screens, you only need one per eye.  Don't know what the other screens would be, but maybe that would make sense.  Then there's two in the back and one in the front.  These are all rumors.  Here's the thing. It is a developers conference.  If you want developers to line up, you get one chance a year  to pitch them on what the thing that they should be working on.  If you've got something called reality, OS, which that's the trademark,  you better tell them about it tomorrow. Right.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're both right.  I think Dan's right. You can make ripples.  But I do think like getting the actual developers together  into like one room, quote, quote, is relatively infrequent.  And it's why big companies that have platforms, you know, host developer  focused events. I mean, I've been going to these since I was like 22.  Are you going to?  No, I have been assigned to do the stock market reaction post,  which is usually me just talking about like the stock market down.

End time: 1796.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Mac Pro, the both Mac Pros, they've announced seven months ahead of time.  The first iPhone they announced in January didn't ship till June.  So here's the I think the rule of thumb.  If it's something they're selling and it's the new version, they don't want to  Osborne it. They don't want to kill the sales of the thing they're selling right now.  But when it's a new technology, they do want to get developers in line.  And so this would I think they could announce.

Start time: 1799.37
End time: 1846.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they have to have enough, right?  They have to have enough of an assurance of what they're telling  developers is going to allow the developers to then start  thinking and working and prototyping, whatever.  Right. Like it needs to be far enough along.  That's that's my only my only thought about it with hardware is, you know,  that's the real difference.  You know, I'm somebody who covers software.  And the issue with software is you can write a review of it.  You can write a review of somebody's software and then they can come back  to you two days later and say, well, we fixed it and we changed it.  Update your review, please.  And that doesn't happen with hardware hardware.  The most you'll get is maybe a firmware update a few months later addressing some  issue. But like hardware really has to be locked down  before you can start selling it to people at any level.  And software, you have a lot more flexibility.

Transcript:  So if you had a bingo card for tomorrow, you would.  Would you maybe say we've got a reality OS?  We want you to start because Apple does have VR technologies for the iPad  and the iPhone, and they have a format called USDZ.  And so they could say, hey, here's a new toolkit.  They do have trademarked the reality OS.  They could say we're going to ship a beta of reality OS so you can start playing  with it next week.  I mean, it is it's it's less meaningful without hardware, of course.  But yeah.

Start time: 1881.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And do you really want to ruin that surprise of here's the new hardware?  Here's the thing that we want you to get excited about and buy, buy, buy.  I mean, I think WWDC for me is always so much about the OS update.  And we know years we've seen this this trend of like Mac OS is going to be more in  sync with iPad OS and iOS or whatever it's called at this point, like kind of  getting that convergence together.  Like, I think that's been the long journey.  And I'm expecting to see a whole lot more of that.

Start time: 1914.54
End time: 1959.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That raises a really interesting question, too, about the Mac OS and the iOS  merging, which way it's going to go in the control sense.  And I've been saying for a long time, hoping I'm wrong, that I think Apple is  planning to lock down the Mac OS.  The way it has locked down the portable device OS.  And I continue to hope I'm wrong.  But, you know, a control free company with something that's open is kind of a  contradiction. And if the more they make one like the other, let's see which  subsumes the other.  And I know where my bet is.

Transcript:  Mark Gurman in Bloomberg on the second three days ago said Apple will announce  significant changes to the iPads software this week, making it more actually Dan  like Mac OS, a redesigned multitasking interface, windows that can actually  overlap other windows, which is something historically the Mac OS never I mean,  iPad OS never want to do.  That's what Mac OS does.  So it may actually be good.  We'll see.  Well, that's you. I'm always afraid of what they're locked down.

Start time: 1993.56
End time: 2016.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what that what you've described there is a user interface issue rather than a  question of whether they can do that.  And if they still don't let you load a Mac OS piece of software, then then in  fact, it's still the iOS just changed.

This actually isn't incompatible with your notion that Apple might be locking down Mac OS  because if they make iPad OS more like Mac OS and iPad is really locked down,  why not make Mac OS more locked down?  I think the argument against that is that people like you and me who want the Mac to be  an open operating system will be very, will move to Linux or something.

I mean, you're right though.  I mean, there's a lot of things that are just unpredictable.  They change.  Why did they change it?  There doesn't seem to be a reason.  My other big pet peeve with Microsoft is they changed the name of something.  So just as all the journalists have written the help articles about how to  find this feature, how to use it, they changed the name and now you don't know  what you're looking for anymore when you go to find help for it.

I don't think Apple does that quite as much as Microsoft does.  On Windows 11, I still can't move the task bar over to the left where I want  the task bar to be.  I found a setting.  No, sorry.

It is possible they'll announce a new Macbook Air.  I think some of the problem is a supply chain.  When I ordered the Dell in April, they said, well, we think you'll get it in June.  Then they made it.  It was manufactured.  They said, but because of the lockdown in Shanghai, we're not going to give you a  tracking number until it gets to the United States.  They literally had no idea what was going to happen to it.  And I'm sure Apple as much as they've been somewhat impervious to the supply chain  issues, I mean, I just took a look at ordering a custom built Mac studio and  that's 10 to 12 weeks off.

In fact, a lot of our small businesses around town have started to use Podium.  If you own a small business, the last few years have been, believe me, I know, tough,  really tough.  Supply chain issues.  You can't get the stuff and then all of a sudden the demand is up.  And if you could get it, you could sell it, but you can't get it.  And on top of everything else you're trying to manage, the businesses that are thriving  right now are the ones who are a little more forward thinking.  And that means using text messaging using Podium.  Podium helps your small businesses to be more open.  Podium helps your small business stay ahead of the curve with modern messaging tools that  your customers actually want.  It makes it easier for them to connect with your business.  And a lot of people these days, for instance, don't like to call.  Do you? I mean, are you one of those?  I don't want to call.  But what the pandemic taught us is, hey, we can text businesses.  They can text us back, say your order is on the way.  If you want to get a bid.  I did this the other day. It was incredible.  A window broke at our house.  I texted instead of calling because I want to call 20 different window repair people,  glaziers, they call themselves.  So I text them. And you know who got the job?  The first one to text it back, probably using Podium.  Right. 100,000 businesses from health care providers to plumbers are texting with  customers through Podium.  Customers love the convenience.  Businesses love the results.  Podium is giving businesses the tools.  They need to compete with the convenience offered by Amazon.  How do you compete as a small business with Amazon?

Back we are with our esteemed panel,  as we take a look at the week's news, you might notice there's a slight difference  in the way this show looks and sounds.  That's because we had a calamity at the at the factory.  I think the entire supply chain collapsed.  Alex, maybe we can bring you in.  You can solve our supply chain walls.  We had a power outage overnight  and not everything came back as it should have.  You know, of all the people in the world, I'm least qualified to help with your IT setup.  No one is. I got all the engineers going, I don't know.  We rebooted everything.  Everything lights are coming on, but nothing's happening.  So I'm doing this from home.  We're using a Zoom. Thank you.  Thank God Zoom has guns.  When I first started Twitter, we use Skype with four people.  And I would spend hours after the show fixing audio.  And this is, I think, actually pretty good.  And everybody's used to zooming now. Right.  Jill's written a book about it, actually.  What is it called?

And it is truly a guide where you can pick it up and flip to the chapter that you need.  So if you're like, I'm having a bad day and I need to shake up my work from home routine,  like, what can I do differently in my environment?  What can I do differently with how I communicate and collaborate with people?  Or I'm a manager and I need to figure out  what are some tricks to get my team to be cohesive again?  Pick it up, flip to what you want.  I have these really fun little tabs that are birds.  If you can see those. That's cool. Yeah.  Yeah. Little little page tag.

Transcript:  Yeah. So back to Zoom, I wrote about Zoom.  You know, it was really like this darling of the tech industry  and a lot of remote companies before anybody else had really heard of it  and picked it up. And I came to PC Mag and I was like, you guys,  we really need a review of Zoom.  It's going to be a big thing.  This was probably 2017, 2018.  And I had I knew a little bit about the company  and the real point of differentiation was from the very beginning, they said,  let's not think too much about features and bells and whistles.  Let's focus on getting the back end technology good so it's stable,  because at that point in time, there were so many video conferencing solutions.  And the problem with all of them was they were so glitchy.  And so I think if you compare it then at that point in time, 2015, 2016,  to everything else that was available, it was just so much more stable.  And I think that's what really sold it.  When people realized we needed to have meetings online a lot more.  We can't have something that's just going to crap out all the time.

Start time: 3024.42
End time: 3041.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That really answers a question.  I don't know if we ever got an answer to why.  During the pandemic, Zoom took off and FaceTime and Duo  and Skype and all and Microsoft Teams.  Why did they couldn't they capitalize?  Do you think it was just simply quality?

Start time: 3041.86
End time: 3073.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a lot of it really was the quality.  And also that out of the gate, they had a very generous free offering for a long time.  So it's no longer this way.  But when when the pandemic hit, 40 minute Zoom calls,  because people don't pay for it.  And so they go, although isn't that brilliant?  If you have a multi-person call, 40 minutes is the limit.  Like, that's great.  But at the time, you could have a one on one call that could be as long as you wanted.  So no restrictions on that.  And a lot of people relied on that and used it because it was just more stable.

Start time: 3081.80
End time: 3140.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the company is not without its controversy.  You know, there was a big problem with Zoom bombing, which, you know,  I have to say, I think I got it wrong in the beginning.  When I heard about that, I said, well, people really need to be educated  and turned on on the correct features to prevent people from getting in.  And that was the wrong take.  The company really needs to make sure that it's taking pro active measures  for people to have the protections that they need to keep their meetings  secure from the beginning.  And for me, that was a good sort of thought process to go through,  to think about what is the company's responsibility to you as a consumer?  And then some other things they got wrong to where they they announced  that they were going to charge people for one thing.  And not another.  And what was going to be encrypted and what wasn't.  So they've been through the wringer a bit.  And that's good.  You know, the more people use the tool, the more emphasis and light  you shine onto their user agreements and their policies and the procedures.  And the more it really pushes the company to get it right.

Start time: 3141.56
End time: 3190.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We I mean, there was a lot of  discussion on our networks, especially in the security shows  about their lack of end to end encryption.  You know, they said it's an encrypted, but it wasn't.  They were very aggressive about hiring contractors and staff,  but they hired good people.  They acquired Keybase, which is a really good encryption firm  and some very good engineers there.  So obviously they were smart.  They took the money that they their windfall profits from the pandemic.  And they put them in, I think, in the right places.  And at this point, you know, we use Skype for most of Twitter's life.  We switched to Zoom about a year ago.  And at this point, there is nothing that comes even close.  In fact, thank goodness we did, because we can we actually have a show today  which we might not if we hadn't had Zoom.

But it it did force the big companies to pay attention instead of saying,  well, that's just one more feature you can use or not use.  They they did upgrade it a lot.  I like Zoom partly because it's not  Microsoft or Google or Facebook or Apple.  I want to keep supporting stuff that's not one of the big ones.

Start time: 3259.62

Transcript:  I am starting to feel some Zoom fatigue.  So that is a real that is definitely a real thing for being forced to look.  See, it's funny when I'm in a studio, it's not quite the same.  But when you're on a call, you kind of be forced to look at people  and stuff like that. And it's an interesting shift.  Actually, there is a meeting is in the news Google Meet, because Google is  unbelievably, although by now we should expect this.  Once again, changing their messaging strategy.  They have a product which I have used, which is much like FaceTime or Zoom or Skype.  It's called Duo.  I use it with my daughter, who has an Android phone, works great,  has a lot of interesting features that others don't have.  They've announced that they're going to merge Duo and Meet  so that everybody will be confused and nobody will be happy.  I guess in theory, it could be an improvement to meet  because of the core technology of Duo, which is very, very, very good for video.

And Sundar Pichai as not, I don't think, been a very good CEO.  We've talked about this on the show before.  I'm sure he's technically good.  But the leadership, there's, I think, a leadership void  at at Alphabet, I guess I should call it Alphabet.  And and the problem is they get away with it because they make.  And this is going to be the same problem with Facebook.  So much money. You're nodding, Alex on advertising, right?

Start time: 3412.80
End time: 3472.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, at the same same problem comes up, though.  We talked about the crapification of social networks earlier  and how Instagram is being essentially been being forced to take on more  and more of the revenue growth at Facebook.  Google search is a mess. Yeah.  Google search is a hot mess.  It's getting more like Instagram.  Well, it's like when I search for a term,  most of the time I want the Wikipedia page.  And now on mobile, I have to scroll through like blocks  of suggested alternative searches like like screw you, Google.  I literally knew what I typed. Thanks.  And then there's ads and then there's so much more.  Like sponsor content is just miserable.  And they're just ringing that rag because nothing else they've ever done  makes money. And I'm just going to go back to what Jill said about Microsoft.  At least they have more than one business line.  You know, Apple has iPhone and Facebook has human misery.  Google has not results.  At least Microsoft sells more than one thing.  Now, company has problems, to be clear, but at least they can do more than one thing.  Yeah, remember, you know what you're saying about Google?

Start time: 3472.52
End time: 3510.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think another issue that a lot of us as journalists and writers  know from the back end is that Google changes how it surfaces information  all the time. And it, you know, I think so many online publications  have just come to rely on Google so much for feeding their traffic.  And it is impossible to know how these changes come about,  when they take place, when they're being rolled out, how do you make your content  optimize? It's it's really hard.  And it doesn't seem like a good long term solution for people to get information.  It's just seems like it's getting worse.

Start time: 3510.32
End time: 3520.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we got to solve that because I mean, doesn't isn't that the whole thing?  I mean, if the Internet didn't have Google,  I don't know if we'd have an Internet.

Transcript:  Yeah, it goes back to what Dan said about platforms.  Well, Bing is Bing is fine. It's not amazing.  It has the same problems that Google does.  But Dan was talking earlier about getting off platforms,  controlling your own media and going back to the era of blogging.  That brings the source of information back to an individual versus Google's  magical algorithm. And it would, you know, if that did ever happen,  you know, I don't want to dream about something that might be get crushed.  But like at least you would remove some of the dominance from Google's prominence  and information centrality, which is a really boring way of saying that.  Sorry, I could show that simpler.

One thing that is coming back Twitter seems to be so way back when  I think this must have been 2009 or 10, Twitter took had a feature that was great  called Tracker. It was kind of like a Google alert where you could say,  I want to see any tweets about a certain subject.  It was hugely valuable.  And I remember very well something they called Bear Hug Camp.  I think your brother was involved in this, Dan, actually,  where we were trying to get Twitter to bring back Tracker.  They never did, except they just, I don't know if it's a rumor or announcement  they're going to bring back, basically, search indexing search terms alerts Tracker.  So maybe Twitter is the hope for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It was way in the dim dark ages of blogs and podcasts.  So speaking of, I said we were going to talk about the courts.  I'll see if I can make my way through this without completely confusing myself.  app name,  Florida and Texas both passed social media laws that attempt to force large social media  companies.  Well, basically not to censor Donald Trump.  Let's face it, that's really what it was.  But they couldn't say that.  So not to censor conservative, they couldn't say that.  So not to censor.  Of course, it's a pretty clear violation of the First Amendment, which says government  shall make no law abridging speech.  That speech, if you say, I don't want that on my Twitter feed or I don't want that on  Facebook, that's speech.  So weirdly, the Texas law, of course, there was an immediate attempt for request for injective  relief by social networks who said, wait a minute, wait a minute, you can't make that  law yet.  Let's sue.  So they sued and they said, they asked the judge, OK, look, stop the law.  The judge said yes.  Then the state of Texas appeals to the Fifth Circuit, which says, no, that's a good law.  And they said, OK, we're waiting.  That's currently the state.  It's legal in Texas.  No, wait a minute.  No, no, no.  Because then they appealed again in the Supreme Court.  And by the way, I thought this would not happen because Justice Alito is the guy who manages  the shadow docket for the Fifth Circuit.  So I thought Alito would just say, no.  But no, in fact, weirdly, the Supreme Court actually voted on this.  They didn't put out a decision.  There was a dissent from some of the justices.  So it's now blocked.  The Florida bill, also blocked by a lower court, by the Eleventh Circuit, that has not  yet been appealed to the Supreme Court.  So as it stands, neither one of these weird laws are in effect, although court cases  will continue in both cases.  Did I get that right?  Close enough.

Transcript:  You did.  And the Supreme Court semi-decision, you can't call it a census, is going to come back in  an appeal again about the actual law as opposed to the injunction.  What fascinated me was that the vote there was five to four.  Yes.

Start time: 3795.20
End time: 3826.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm assuming, because again, it was really about whether an injunction was timely or  whether this thing should stand for now, that I'm assuming that most of the ones who dissented  will actually vote that it's unconstitutional when it gets back with that being the issue,  because Kagan was one of the ones who said, now let it ride for now.  And that's baffled me.

End time: 3921.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very strange.  I think perhaps, I don't know, you can't read their minds, but it seems likely to me that  this will be fairly resoundingly found unconstitutional when it gets back.  We have a Supreme Court now that's becoming more and more visibly a tool of the Republican  Party.  And that is somewhat alarming because the Republican Party is clearly not that interested  in free speech per se.  It's interested in free speech for people it agrees with and who agree and are part  of an agenda.  But there are several justices who would vote to overturn one of the most important cases  ever, the Brandenburg case, that requires malice when talking about a public figure  as a standard for libel.  And that's really dangerous.  But this is, things are changing faster than we all seem to be paying enough attention  to.

Somebody pointed out that if this, I think Mike Masnick on Tech Turp pointed out, if  this Texas law had stood, for instance, Twitch might not have been able to pull down the  Buffalo Shooters livestream.  And if it did, it would risk lawsuit because that's what the law establishes as the right  suit.

And and and and Tesla gets the benefit of enormous tax breaks  for its customers, et cetera, et cetera.  Having said that, I'm still I'm having to separate the admiration  I have for for the vision at some level and and the fortitude  to push through trouble and to make things actually happen with a great team.

I would do work for two weeks and then I would fly to the office for two weeks  to be annoyed by people who talk to me at the cockpit.  And like, I'm just perplexed by this idea that you want to go for lunch today, Alex.  I mean, you joke, but yes.  And just walking like the time spent commuting and the executive function  of my brain that I had to waste just getting around San Francisco.  Love the city, by the way.  To me, this is just insane.  It's handy that people are saying you're less productive.  I do understand that certain jobs will have a higher office component,  sales teams, people who build stuff. Sure.

I've been mentioning it, but I got this for the cruise  because, you know, they have these formal nights.  But who wants to wear a tuxedo?  So I went to Indochino and I got an amazing set.  My whole wardrobe for the cruise is from Indochino.  Look at this. Isn't that beautiful?  Oh, my God. And you know what?  I didn't even. This is the first time I've worn it, but I knew it would fit.  You know why? Indochino.  You send them their measurements and it's like getting a tailor.  It is a tailor.  They make it to your measurements.  No XL, XXL, small, medium.  This is this is to match my exact dimensions.  I love Indochino.  If you've got a wedding coming up, it's the month of weddings.

You will feel confident.  You'll enjoy the big day and you won't fuss over your clothes.  The nice thing about Indochino and, you know, this because it fits so well.  The nice thing about it is it's comfortable.  So I don't know if when you get dressed up, sometimes you go,  and I feel just a little weird, a little uncomfortable.  Not with Indochino, because it's like it fits you like a glove.  It's beautiful. And you know what?  You get it to match your total needs and desires.  You could choose every detail on the suit.  They make shirts, dinner jackets.  The prices are remarkable, much more affordable than you would expect  for custom tailored pieces.  Look, you can even, you know, you could choose the buttons.  You could look at this. You could choose fun linings.  I thought I'd choose the purple polka dots.  I love this is a for those of you listening.  I look like James Bond in my purple velvet suit with satin lapels.  Best part is Indochino suits start from just four hundred twenty nine dollars,  shirts from just seventy nine dollars.  These are tailored custom fitted.  They also have casual wear.  Get a wardrobe personalized to your style and taste without spending a fortune.  And they're always adding new pieces, new options.  So you can it's fun to shop it in the chin.  And, you know, once they have your your measurements,  man, you know, everything you order is going to fit perfectly.  The things we ordered, everything fits just right.  If you've got a big day coming up, getting the perfect look.  No big deal with Indochino.  I and Dio CHI and no dot com.  I look sharp, don't I?

I'm here because the studio fell apart basically overnight.  And so but you know what?  In a way, this is kind of I like this.  This is more like us just sitting around talking.  This is how it started way back in the day.  And I'm really glad you're here, Jill Duffy.  We're going to talk about the 40th anniversary of PC  magazine in just a little bit. That's amazing.  Dan Gilmore, who's, of course, the dean of journalism.  So he's going to be our conscience today for.  And and of course, I've known Dan for years since the San Jose Mercury News.  Alex Wilhelm, also dear friend from Tech Crunch,  the New York State passes.  I thought this I was stunned to see this headline.  First ever right to repair law.  I thought there were dozens of states working on right to repair laws.  I remember talking about how Apple was going to one state government  somewhere in the Midwest saying, oh, you can't let people repair their stuff.  I thought for sure we'd have a right to repair law.  There's the right to repair dot org, Kyle Weins.  And I fix this is website that to push this.  And yet this is the first actual right to repair law.  I guess what the upshot is, if you do it in New York, they're big enough  that probably every company would have to respond.  Right. New York says all manufacturers who sell digital electronic products  in the state of New York will have to make tools  and manuals, instructions available  parts to for people, consumers and independent shops that want to repair their stuff.  The measure won't take effect for another year.  So once the governor Hawkel signs it, it'll be a year.  But I fix it said it's one giant leap for repair kind.

You have the right to repair your data.  I don't know. And Colorado.  I'm reading the Verges article.  The Colorado passed a bill ensuring and this is wild  the right to repair powered wheelchairs.

They made it mobile and wireless, which negated the law there.  Listen, industry.  And I remember this is led by Apple.  Apple is the primary company  that runs around spending lots of money on lobbying  and other things to prevent this this kind of law from passing.  Everyone else is in on it.

He didn't need to repair it, but he wanted we wanted to test it.  Got the 76 pounds, the two big pelican cases.  They arrived.  The clock starts ticking the minute they arrive.  You have seven days to return it or you have to pay thousands of dollars  for the equipment.  The battery didn't come.  The battery didn't come.  It was shipped separately because I guess because it's lithium ion.  Two hours before the seven day deadline.  They arrived.  Mike is calling Apple and it turns out Apple doesn't do this.  A company called Spot is doing it for Apple.  He calls Spot. They say, no, no extension.  You didn't get the battery.  Not our problem. Send it back.  So we now have a battery  and no way to repair it.  And then on top of all of that, I mean, Apple's you know, it's  it's malicious compliance.  They're they're adhering to the letter of the law without actually giving you  something you can use.  And on top of that, the cost ends up being about the same as bringing it  to an Apple store.

It's the province of Ontario has passed a right to disconnect  a right to disconnect law.  As of June 2nd, employers in Ontario with 25 or more employees  have to have a written policy on disconnecting outside business hours.  That means no work related communications, no emails, no telephone calls,  no video calls, no sending or reviewing of messages,  no performance of work when you're off duty.

Transcript:  Yeah. You know, what's interesting about this is  I think there's been a really strange shift generationally  as younger people have come into the workforce.  This is before the pandemic.  There was a piece of research done that asked people about how much  they wanted to be connected to their jobs when they were on vacation  nights, weekends, whatever their time off was.  And younger people said, I feel like I want to be connected  so that I don't come back to panic and chaos and unexpected things.  I'm used to being connected to people.  I'm used to know what's going on.  And now I think there's a caveat there, which is to say younger people  who are inexperienced and may have been led into believing  you are so important to your company or so valuable, the company will love you back.  You know, there might be a little bit of disillusionment there  about what it means to be connected.  But they sort of had a very different understanding  of why they wanted to still be connected in their time off.  And it didn't mean they wanted to be working.  It just they they didn't want to have any surprises come up  while they were away and have this, like, you know, very strange fear of missing out.  Whereas older workers sort of said, I don't want to be looking at email on the weekend.  I don't want to be getting text messages when I'm on vacation.  I want to be able to disconnect.  So I think, you know, on the one hand, it is good for people  to feel like they have some agency and some choice  in how much they want to be connected with their employer.  But there is the problem that not everybody knows what that really means.  And they don't have the experience to understand why it could be problematic.

At the time, it was awful.  I had to go through a grieving process.  It was really painful because I felt like I this was so important to me  and I was really pouring my all and I wanted to be important to this publication that I worked on.

I mean, when you put that in the context of the United States,  this is getting more and more of a problematic notion in all kinds of ways,  not least of which that we don't have health care for people.  We don't have health care. Exactly.  And you want entrepreneurship to explode and do really well.  Let people have health care that they can rely on and not fear bankruptcy.  But we don't do that.

Transcript:  We have a I have a first person example of that.  Renee Richie, who worked for Imore and a lot of other publications,  decided he wanted to start a YouTube channel and really focus on, you know,  building his YouTube presence and brand as his own personal stuff.  And he could do it because he's Canadian.  And he said, if I if I were, you know, lost my health,  if I were in the United States, lost my health care, I couldn't do this.  But I can do it because I have a nationalized health care in Canada.  And I'm not risking my my life and limb launching on my own.  And he's done very well, which is which is great.  We should I should make this a regular segment.  And more board apioclubs, NFTs stolen in the middle of the night on Discord.  From PC Magazine comes this story.  Unbelievable.  CoinDesk reports a hacker took control of the Discord account of Yuga Labs,  the creators of the board apioclub of his of the community manager,  Boris Wagner, that compromised account, then used to share phishing links.  It came from Boris.  It's got to be real to the official Discord channels for BAYC and other side,  which Yuga Labs describes on its website as a gamified,  interoperable metaverse currently under development.  This whole thing is so scammy all around.  Coinbase said the hacker stole 145 ETH,  as well as the BAYC's NFTs.  The price of the ETH was a mere 1792 at the time of writing.  But 618 thousand dollars.  Wait a minute. Oh, the price of ETH was 1792.  So the total was 260 thousand dollars in ETH,  three hundred fifty eight thousand dollars worth of NFTs.  Unbelievable.  On April 25th, the company's Instagram account was compromised.  To steal two point eight million worth of NFTs.  The funny thing is.  This is probably good publicity for NFTs,  because at least they say they're worth something.  Who's going to buy these stolen NFTs?  Is there still a market? I don't know.  Just crazy.

Transcript:  This this market is just an example of mass hypnosis.  And I just it blind.  It just blows my mind that this conversation can even be taking place.  But then again, we live in a we live in a in a world now where people  people are buying into this stuff and cryptocurrencies and other things,  partly because they have nothing left that they trust.  They're watching governments.  That's what's happening. Yes.  They're they're watching governments inflate their money and  and take away value there.  They're watching all kinds of things go on where they say,  this is my only chance to put away something  that I'm going to be able to have in the future.  That's not true. But that's what they think.  And, you know, people who are desperate are the easiest marks of the conmen.  And we're in a time of just endless cons.  And I'm really afraid of what could happen.  And the worst of it is that it's bad enough for the people  who are getting suckered.  And I do feel sorry for them, but I have a little less sympathy than they may want.  The problem I'm seeing is that in a lot of the stuff has been  entwined with the real economy  in various kinds of financial instruments and such  that when this all fully collapses, I think it may.  It could bring down a whole lot of stuff by extension that we don't want to bring down.  I'm very worried about how we're just letting  these things go run wild without any serious law enforcement that I'm aware of.

Transcript:  action against the NFTs space.  I think it is.  It was it's Nate Chastain who  was buying NFTs before they were public,  promoting them on the OpenSea marketplace.  You know, and when you get promoted, you know, hey, this is going to be a good one.  They tend to sell. And then he would flip them.  So he was getting to choose which are featured and then he would flip them  for two to five times what he paid.  And this is one of the things a lot of people think, well, this is all anonymous.  He thought, well, I'm using anonymous wallets and anonymous accounts.  But apparently it's not fully anonymous to the government.  So OpenSea did figure it out and fire him.  So he's working, by the way, case you want to invest in a new NFT project, Oval.  Let's just use your chance to get in early.  Because, as you know, on these things, it's always good to be the first to buy, not the last to buy.  Let's see.  Now we're getting down to the seeds and stems, the dregs of the stories.  You guys, we sent you a hundred stories and I apologize, more than a hundred and thirty stories.  Let me see if there's anything else  I really want to talk about before we take a quick break, because I do want to kind of celebrate  40 years of PC magazine, which is really great.  No, I think we'll just take a break. How about that?  I don't see anything urgent.  If you see anything, Dan or Alex or Jill, that you want to talk about,  put a pin in and we'll get back to that in just a moment.  This episode of This Week in Tech brought to you by Nureva.  Nureva is so great if you're going back to work, but not everybody is.  And you've got your conference rooms.  Some employees will be there in the conference room.  Some employees will be at home.  And you don't want to disadvantage the people who aren't there.  You want them to be able to hear what's going on in that meeting.  And that's why you need Nureva.  Sure, you could go get a big AV company.  They'd install cameras, lots of microphones, lots of wires, technicians coming in, installers coming in.  And by the way, those special rooms, they need to be constantly calibrated.  That means more technicians coming in.  And wait till you see the bell.  Why do that when you could get great sound from Nureva?  This is the more modern way of doing it.  Nureva has patented the microphone mist technology.  So one sound bar, if it's a really big room, you could put two sound bars in.  Very simple.  That's a speaker.  And their microphone mist technology is built in, which literally puts, well, I guess it's figuratively,  because they're not really putting thousands of microphones in the room, but it's like they are.  Everybody in the room can be heard clearly, no matter where they're positioned,  no matter where they're facing, allows people in the room to move comfortably.  The social distance is great for classrooms where people need to separate by six feet or more.  It's so much simpler than a traditional system.  You can install it yourself, just like a sound bar.  And thanks to continuous auto calibration, your rooms are instantly and always ready  with optimized audio.  Nobody has to come in and calibrate it.  In fact, Nureva will also give you a simplified console, the Nureva console,  so your IT team can sit down the hall or across the country and coordinate, control, power,  manage, and adjust all the rooms wirelessly over the internet.  It's a fantastic technology.  One or two integrated microphones and speaker bars fill a room with thousands of virtual microphones,  so there are no dead zones.  Everyone can be heard.  Meeting participants, class participants just talk naturally, move naturally in the space,  and your remote participants can hear.  They can participate.  They don't feel left out.  So everybody's working together as a team.  This is exactly how conference rooms should be designed.  30-minute DIY job, big savings on time and cost compared to those traditional systems.  I think you've got to try it.  Ask yourself, do you want to go with a costly, complicated traditional system  or make the leap to something very modern, simple, economical?  Nureva.  It's N-U-R-E-V-A.  Do yourself a favor.  Check this out.  Nureva.com.  N-U-R-E-V-A.  Nureva.com.  It is a revolution for conference rooms.  We had a great week.  Thank you, Nureva, by the way.

Transcript:  TWIT.tv. Tell your friends.  PC Magazine.  I never worked for PC Magazine.  I read it religiously.  It was the king of the computer magazines back in the day.  I remember the people who worked there and the editors there were gods.  I remember going to Comdex and Bill McCrone was like royalty coming in.  They used to have the big parties.  There was a lot of money.  I can't believe it's 40 years.  PC Magazine.  Yeah, so 19.

Start time: 6416.84
End time: 6559.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wrote an article about it.  19. Oh, I didn't write an article about it.  Oh, okay.  There's a big celebration suite of content for the 40th anniversary.  So PC Magazine, as it was called then, launched in 1982.  In that first issue was an interview with Bill Gates.  So the current editor in chief.  Just starting, right?  I mean, he wasn't-  Really early.  Really early out.  The current editor in chief went back and had an interview with him today, 40 years later,  to see how he's thinking about things now and how the history of computing has shaped the world  and what he's up to, what kind of gear he's using.  So that's a really fun article to read.  And there's some other great content.  For example, a look back at 20 PCs that shaped the last 40 years of computing.  That's a fun one.  Lots of fun little graphics in there.  And I know a lot of people are going to say, oh, the Amigo is missing and this is missing.  It does have a little frame on it.  This is like PCs that were covered by PC Magazine.  But still a really fun read.  And there's a great piece of video too,  where a couple of the editors went back into a storage room and pulled out some of those  old issues from the 80s.  And some of them were five and 700 pages long.  And they said, why was this?  Why were these issues so big?  And it had to do with advertising.  And not just that the advertising was making money for the magazine,  but this is how people found out about where you could buy computing equipment and add-ons  for your personal computer because there was no internet.  There was no online marketplace at that time.  So you had to get the shipping rate for a magazine for something to be officially called a magazine.  You had to have a ratio of editorial to advertising.  So the more ads that you sold, the more editorial you have to mix in,  in order to get that magazine shipping rate.  And so this is why a lot of people don't know this about the history of print magazine.  But this is why so many magazines back in the day were so fat,  was you needed to get that ratio of advertising to editorial.  Right.

Transcript:  And yet I think it's super computer shopper, which had some editorial.  PC's, if Davis, the owners of PC magazine spun that off, probably once PC magazine got  thicker and thicker, they said, we need an even bigger format.  It was a tabloid format magazine that was also inches thick, but it did not have a lot of  editorial.  Maybe they didn't mail it or maybe they mailed it on a different rate because it was just  basically it.

Start time: 6584.99

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, you could have a lot of advertising.  I think it was like upwards of 60, 70% of the advertising.  Like it's a pretty high ratio.  They did have, but those laws still hold today too, for print, for anybody who works in print.  I came up in print.  So I definitely know those days of looking at pages and actually like laying out the  magazine on a table and actually having a word count limit to what you could write.

And now it goes by the name PC mag.com.  And today, you know, every now and again, I get an email from readers saying you don't do as much  high level nerdy stuff as you used to do.  You don't talk about this really in-depth personal computing.  And the truth of the matter is we still do.  There is still a good amount of stories about building your own rigs or whatever.  But we cover a lot more now because technology has changed and it really is for more people now.  And the way that we use technology, the way that it's integrated into our lives affects everyone.  So we try to approach it in a way that we can give advice, buying advice for products  and how to advise for using those products to be applicable to everybody so that anybody  could read those articles and really understand what they need to understand.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I think that that's true.  I mean, remember stereo magazines in the 50s?  I mean, Dan, you remember it.  Yeah, I remember it.  Not the 50s, but I think in the early days it was it was about, you know,  you play the 1812 overture because the cannons would really test the RMS capacity of your  amplifier and your and your big, you know, Altech Lansing speakers.  And then after a while it became more about content and less about the speeds and fees.  And I think the same thing happened with the computer industry.  I'll a little story I don't think I've ever told before.  When we first started doing twit 17 years ago, we at first we weren't going to do ads,  but finally we decided, all right, we're going to have to do an ad supported network because  that's the only way we can go forward.  But nobody had set ad prices for podcasts at all.  So I called PC Magazine and said, what do you charge for a full page ad?  And I figured, well, we're not as we're not PC Magazine, but also your ad isn't competing with  a bunch of other ads.  You have to kind of listen to hear it.  So I found out what their price.  I cut about 40 bucks off CPM.  And that was that was how we established the price for podcast advertising.  And you know what?  It kind of held.  Wow.  It was as rule as a seat of the pants as it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things about PC Magazine and the things in that genre, and it's true today of  a lot of still a lot of sites and remaining magazines.  When we talk about editorial content versus advertising in a really interesting way,  the advertising was content that I wanted to look at.  This is how I got a sense of what was actually going on.  I'm into computer based music.  And I still subscribe to a couple of magazines that for me, the advertising is at least as  important as the editorial because I have a much better sense of what's really happening  in that industry and an idea of things I might want to look at more closely.  So I think it's hilarious that there's this I know that the rule is for very good reasons  and for postal reasons that you want to have a robust national discussion.  And that's what the postage rates are about.  But I just think that one of the things I miss is leafing through and not turning pages past  the advertising.  The way I do with the New York Times magazine on Sunday where really I'm not interested in  the advertising.  I'm interested in the only in the articles where it was both in the case of this.

Start time: 6875.94
End time: 6906.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I completely agree with you that there was a certain merit in advertising in that case  because it was something you wanted to know about.  And it was a new industry and it was exciting.  And you wanted to know about these new companies and what they were offering.  And every single ad was just as important probably as the articles.  I think that's a really good point.  Maybe that's exactly what advertising should be in a way.  Instead of trying to figure out what people want, we'll do affinity-based content and  advertise.  That's how we sell our ads.

And Bill McCrone and Lance Yulanov and Jim Latterback and their ethical standards  you know, at Ziff Davis television and everything they did were so high and that's the standard we  want to keep.  I remember Jim going around the studio and putting black tape over all the brand names  product in the studio.  So it wouldn't become an ad for that product or this product or that product.

Transcript:  Jeff Hickman I remember we were going to do a segment on the screen savers about how to  hack the Xbox and Microsoft is a massive advertiser at the time on ZDTV.  And I think reasonably we might have been a little over concerned, but we said, you know,  we just want to let you know we're going to do this and Microsoft is not going to like it.  And to their credit, they told people and the ad people said, no, no, do it.  You know, it's important.  It's journalism and we'll deal with the blowback.  There was a lot of blowback.  I think Microsoft maybe in fact that I can remember that that happened with some  magazines to where Microsoft said, oh, that's it.  No more ads.  But you know, when you're PC magazine, nobody's going to say, no, we're not going to buy ads  there anymore.  You mentioned a computer music, Dan, a key figure.  In the development of computer music passed away this week.  Dave Smith, who was the inventor of MIDI.  He was at a company called Sequential Circuits created a number of sequencers and programmers  to be used with the Moog and ARP synthesizers back in the day.  He helped design the Prophet, which was a very popular synthesizer.  You've heard it on Thriller and Madonna's Like a Virgin.  Vangelis used it in his Chariots of Fire.  He also developed MIDI, which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  It allowed you to synchronize your instrument.  In fact, to this day, I think even if you're connecting via USB,  you're using the MIDI protocol when you connect.

Transcript:  You're going to love it so much.  You're going to have a great time.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  We normally, if the studio is working,  we'll do Twitter on a Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m. Pacific,  5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.  Today, for the first time, it's, I think, must be 15 years.  We did not have a live audience because I didn't want to stream and challenge my bandwidth.  So normally you can watch live at live.twit.tv or listen live and chat at irc.twit.tv.  I know the chat room is going crazy right now because they don't know what's happening.  Wow.  You can also join our club and chat with us in the Discord.  The club, Twit, is actually three different benefits.  In one, ad-free versions of all the shows.  It includes access to our Discord, which is a wonderful community.  Lots of events in there, shows that we don't put out on the podcast,  feeds and so forth.  And you also get the Twit Plus feed, which will include stuff that never made it to podcasts  for a variety of reasons.  All of that is seven bucks a month.  Nothing.  Go to twit.tv slash clubtwit and sign up today.  Thank you in advance.  After the fact, all the shows are available commercials intact at the website, twit.tv.  There's a YouTube channel for all of our shows.  And there's also, of course, and it's the easiest thing to do,  you can get a podcast player and subscribe and that way you'll get it automatically the  minute it's available.  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  Have a great week.  We'll see you next time.  Hopefully in our studio.  Another twit is in the can.  Bye bye.
