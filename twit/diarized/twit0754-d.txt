If you're watching the video, apparently some Mexican wrestler who is a 49ers fan  has snuck into the studio.  Apparently, there is a Handeg game later in the day.  So I am dressed in the accoutrement of the Handeg fanatic.  It's time for the show where we talk about the latest tech news.  Joining me, Mr. Patrick Naughton, host of this week at Computer Hardware.  My long time...  Look how good he looks.  Are you using some sort of...  Is it like a filter?  Keeping your hair cut?

Start time: 316.86
End time: 324.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not go to CES.  I was here.  I was here.  I got to see all of the most interesting things through the internet, but that was it.

Start time: 324.46
End time: 339.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my sense of it.  Patrick, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's kind of like the difference  between going to a football game in person, which you do for the atmosphere,  but it's very difficult to tell what's going on in the field  and watching it on TV where you see all the details.  Honestly, CES is best covered from afar.

Start time: 341.66
End time: 346.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do miss the momentum of CES.  Maybe.  There's something fun about it.

Start time: 347.02
End time: 359.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like there's something fun about sitting in the stands  and trying to make out what those 22 men are doing down there on the field.  Is there a football amongst them?  I don't know.  Patrick, do you go every year now?

Start time: 360.86
End time: 424.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was my 22nd or 23rd.  But it depends.  It depends on what you're doing.  Right?  I actually have, you know, it depends on, you know, if you're...  Okay.  One, there was a lot less.  It seemed to be a lot less coverage where teams,  either huge media teams, ascended to do 123 stories in the first two or three days.  But it's still...  It's becoming less important to hard tech, more important to general news.  But it's interesting, right?  Because it's still in so many ways like homecoming,  because so many people, you know, in the various injuries that show up are there,  or people, you know, whether they are writers or make video or whatever else they do.  I saw two or three things that I wouldn't have seen if I hadn't been at CES.  In terms of television, there was like nothing new.  In terms of audio, like there was actually the least number of audio vendors I've ever seen,  which I think means audio has finally given up completely on CES.  It wasn't too bad last year.  This year it was nothing.  The Delta keynote still fascinates me.

Start time: 425.38
End time: 441.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Delta Airlines, the first time a major air carrier had presented at CES.  I didn't see the keynote, but I did see they had exoskeletons where you could lift luggage,  and they had a sign board that was different depending on who was looking at it.  What did they do at the keynote that baffled you?

Start time: 443.57
End time: 481.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I just...  If I don't have to be at press days, I don't go anymore because sitting in two hours...  I've sat in two hours to go see something and found out they actually didn't reveal a new product.  And if I don't have to do that, I don't.  Actually, the thing that saw me that blew me away was MojoVision's prototype.  I actually got the hands-on demo with the contact lens with the embedded display.  Did they put it in your eye?  No, they are not to that point yet.  But they actually literally had...  So you could view the demo.  It was basically like a contact lens on a stick.  And that allows you to see the interface.

Start time: 482.64
End time: 486.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would you want a contact lens on a stick?  This does not sound...

Start time: 487.10
End time: 493.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a display embedded in the contact lens.  Okay.  And the idea is...  And it's interesting.

Start time: 493.30
End time: 496.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you mean like a Roku built into the contact lens?

Start time: 498.06
End time: 525.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's something more basic information.  Imagine you're sitting there.  They had an interface demo where you could actually interact with the interface  where you would look up to the edge of your vision,  and that would activate a very simple, very subtle drop-down menu  where you could sort of pause audio or check the weather  or get a discrete piece of information.  Look at the size of that contact lens.

Start time: 525.56
End time: 526.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got to cover your whole eyeball.

Start time: 527.66
End time: 587.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's in the early days.  Yeah, it is.  It's early days.  What's fascinating about this is part of what they're motivated about  is this embedded display on this is incredibly tiny,  doesn't disrupt your vision.  They did an amazing demo where you were seeing it doing edge detection,  and it gave you the equivalent of a form of night vision  that could be dropped onto an eyeball.  And there are people inside of the company that are motivated  because of relationships they have in their personal lives.  And it was fascinating because they were showing sort of medical uses for it  that will help them, and they've got a partnership with the FDA  to help move this through testing.  And it was really fascinating because looking up in the corner  and pulling this very simple menu down, they're not trying to...  So the gesture is where your eyeball is?  Their goal.  The demo I had was using an HTC Vive, right?  As they kind of work out the interface.  That's fair.  Which is actually really well done.

Start time: 587.46
End time: 595.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're wearing a visor, but it would look the same as that.  But the difference of the Vive is there's a camera looking at your eyeball.  There wouldn't be with a contact lens.

Start time: 597.36
End time: 613.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Essentially, what my understanding is there is a display that faces your eyeball  and a camera that faces out.  And what they will do is they will be able to track...  Or basically, they're saying they will be able to track  which direction your pupil is looking.  That makes sense.  And that is you will interact with this.

Start time: 614.18
End time: 617.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, is the camera on the contact lens or are you wearing some unusual headgear?

Start time: 619.46
End time: 632.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole idea, their goal when this ships,  and it's a few years out at this point,  is to actually have all of this including the battery power.  This incredibly tiny lithium polymer batteries will all be in the contact lens  that goes over your eyeball.

Start time: 633.12
End time: 649.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me, this is exactly what augmented reality should be.  But it does sound like it's a little bit of science fiction  because the battery's in that thing.  I mean, there's a camera in that thing.  It sounds like we're not quite there yet.  That's exactly the kind of thing that was described in that book,

Start time: 649.62
End time: 652.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Demon, several years ago.  Yeah, it's like Daniel Suarez's Demon.

Start time: 653.84
End time: 680.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Daniel Suarez.  Yeah.  In that case, you were able to always,  and maybe I can't remember if Demon had spectacles or a contact,  but you could look at anybody.  It was contact lenses.  It was contacts.  And get exactly what that image shows,  which is a little pop-up over the person with their reputation,  information about them.  So is that kind of what they were showing is an overlay  on the real world that has information.  I love that.  That to me, I would buy that in a heartbeat.

Start time: 682.90
End time: 725.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, their goal is for this to be something for you to opt into  to get the information so that they're not constantly...  I always think of that line in Ready Player One,  where he's like, we've discovered we can cover 87% of the human vision  without causing seizures, right?  They don't want to do that.  They want this to be out of the way and not disrupting your vision  until you go to look for information.  And it's like, OK, who is that person?  All right, I look up into the right, a menu drops down,  I get my information, I look straight forward, the menu recedes.  But it was...  I hate to use the word graceful for whatever face,  but the UI was astonishingly graceful for...  I used it and I wasn't like, oh, God, what were they thinking?

Start time: 726.34
End time: 866.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This actually brings up one of the stories we wanted to talk about today,  Cashmere Hill's piece in today's New York Times  about a startup that is collecting face recognition information  from everywhere.  It's called Clearview.  They're scraping images from Facebook, from Instagram,  and they're not completely forthcoming about what they're doing  and how they're doing it, but her headline is...  Well, it's a Peter Thiel company, so...  Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it.  Law enforcement is using their massive database.  The problem is, you're not opting into it.  If you've got images up on the internet,  you're probably in the Clearview database.  They claim to have scraped from Facebook, YouTube, Venmo,  where you put your profile picture on it.  Millions of other websites, a database of 3 billion images.  Federal and law enforcement says,  we don't really know how it works or who's behind it,  but we sure love it.  We sure like to use it.  Imagine adding that capability to those contact lenses.  You'd know as you walk down the street,  oh, that guy's a convicted felon,  oh, that guy's got an outstanding warrant,  oh, that guy is just a scary looking.  I mean, I don't normally like stories that are designed to be  scary, but this does scare me a little bit.  So it's Peter Thiel.  I didn't realize that.  Yeah, he's backing it.  He did Palantir, which was another company working in the shadows,  also widely used by law enforcement,  gathering information for a variety of sources,  not face recognition, but database information,  and then selling it to law enforcement.  In fact, if you think, if you have read your Tolkien,  you know what a Palantir is.  Isn't it one of those things the wizards used to see  like a crystal ball anywhere in the world,  all the Palantirs are connected?  It's a little creepy.  I guess, hey.

Transcript:  Not yet.  Is it good?

Start time: 874.40
End time: 894.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's good because the idea of this is  this is Clive Owen plays detective,  and as he's walking, he gets information on everyone he sees  as he's walking.  Exactly.  Well, yeah.  And then there's somebody who actually has anonymity.  That's the most dangerous person of all.

Start time: 896.88
End time: 906.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a land where everybody's face is in the database,  who are the suspects?  People who aren't.  And that's precisely the problem.

Start time: 907.20

End time: 926.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a future where technology has rendered privacy obsolete,  a detective investigates a serial assassin  who has been deleted from all visual records.  I'm guessing that's Amanda Seyfried.  Maybe not.  I recognize her face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, a lot of Neil Stephenson's latest sci-fi book,  The Fall Hat, all the teenagers are wearing devices  that project images over their face for anonymity.  I can imagine a work on that.

Start time: 947.58
End time: 954.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 961.70
End time: 984.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a category of technology.  These contact lenses that have both great benefits and great risks.  You were talking about Elon Musk's Starlink.  And we both, or no, it wasn't you, it was Chris Marquardt, our photo guy.  We both agree that we want global gigabit internet,  no matter where you go anywhere in the world,  from these low-Earth orbit satellites.

Start time: 984.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you've got 40,000 of these things orbiting around,  reflecting the sun everywhere,  you're not going to be able to see the sky anymore.  Right.

Start time: 995.76
End time: 999.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So on the one hand, it's a great idea.  Can you imagine?

Start time: 1003.28
End time: 1008.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone will be able to track you, like, everywhere.  It's just so profoundly creepy to me.

Start time: 1010.14
End time: 1066.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is actually something that's coming with autonomous vehicles, too.  When we do start to deploy autonomous vehicles in significant numbers,  it's not going to be vehicles that we sell to consumers.  It's going to be robotaxi services, autonomous mobility services.  So every one of these things is going to have sensors in there  that's going to monitor who's getting in the vehicle,  what their state is when they're in the vehicle.  Somebody gets sick or has a heart attack or something.  If they leave anything behind, whoever's operating these fleets  is going to want to know who's in there so that they can do billing and everything.  And if you're in these things, already today, if you carry a phone,  you're being tracked anyway.  But it's going to just keep accelerating as we move into these new kinds of services  where the systems depend on knowing who you are and where you're going.

Start time: 1067.78
End time: 1072.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Amazon Go store.  You don't have to pay for anything.  The cameras know.

Start time: 1073.08
End time: 1099.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's already that anonymity is almost impossible to keep.  If you travel across borders, if you're going to end up using a credit card,  if you're using a cell phone, anonymity is almost like,  this is going to be one day where anonymity itself will be illegal,  that you will have to make sure that you're tracked wherever you are.  And it's like the gateway drug.  We're all already way overly addicted to our phones.  The ability to unplug is really difficult.

Start time: 1099.66
End time: 1121.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Georgia, besides being senior editor at iMore, you are a psychotherapist.  Is there, I don't know why I'm telling you that.  I think you know that.  For those who don't.  But is there, I would imagine there's also a deep psychological risk to this.  People want to be known, but maybe that's a little bit too much.

Start time: 1122.94
End time: 1169.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of funny because the latest trend that I've seen in my work is people saying that  young teens saying, I'm actually on my phone too much.  I don't want to use it as much.  I'm trying to unplug.  And this is the largest growth population, which was the strongest for addiction.  That's actually being the first people that are saying, you know what?  This is too much.  I don't want to use it.  And it's the first week that I had three people say, I try not to use my phone anymore.  Which was really pretty powerful because of how addictive its nature is.  And they're not attached to social media.  They're trying not to use Instagram.  One is because of its psychological effects.  And the other is because Facebook is now looked at as creepy by the newest generation.  Not as something that's cool.  It's something that your grandmother does.

Start time: 1169.28
End time: 1170.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That encourages me.

Start time: 1170.76
End time: 1171.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Start time: 1172.69
End time: 1205.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grandma.  Yes, there is.  That encourages me because of course, part of the debate that's going on is,  should government be regulating these giant companies, especially Facebook,  to protect us from ourselves?  It's encouraging.  I think that's a terrible solution.  But if it's the only solution, then it's the only solution.  But it's encouraging that maybe we don't need that if people are self-correcting.  If they're going to be saying, you know what?  I could tell this is bad for me.  I'm going to use it less.  That would be a very encouraging thing to me.

Start time: 1206.44
End time: 1235.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still think that they probably will need to have regulations.  They have too much power.  They have too much power.  There's no way that a company with that much power will not be able to be evil with it.  It corrupts.  Once you taste power and how much money they can make and how much they can control  what people do and say, which if you have information to everyone,  like really, there's more information about me on my phone.  I'd rather if I had to choose between my husband being subpoenaed or my phone,  I'll take my husband.

Start time: 1249.78
End time: 1253.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 1253.38

Transcript:  What's for dinner?  That's really...  So, okay, we have a theme on this show, which is double-edged sword.  Because like Starlink, like face recognition, you could see positives  and negatives.  And we're going to take a break.  When we come back, I think we got to talk about the United States Attorney General,  William Barr, and the latest battle with Apple over a terrorist's iPhone.  And what it all means.  And I think that you said something interesting, Georgia, when you said,  maybe what will happen is we'll get to a world where it's illegal not to be in the database.  I think we may get to a world where it's illegal to use encryption.  That's the only way.  You can't force people to unlock phones, but you can say it would be illegal to have a crypto device.  And I wonder if that's where we're headed.  We're going to talk about that in just a second.  Imor.com, Georgia Dow, great to have you.  Haven't seen you in ages.  Still doing the 3D VR thing?

Start time: 1603.74
End time: 1737.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I did notice that because the front, when I started, the front wheels kept going up.  And I thought.  So, this is a complicated story.  It's been getting the headlines this week.  You may remember in, what was it last year?  In San Bernard, in Pensacola, Florida, a Saudi military officer was training at the Pensacola  Naval Air Station, killed three service members, wounded eight, and then was shot himself.  After shooting one of his iPhones.  Clearly he understood that that iPhone might contain some imported information.  The FBI apparently, and this is one thing that's really frosted Apple,  did go to Apple right away and Apple helped giving them access to his iCloud account,  to a lot of information about the person.  They helped as much as they could, but they're one thing that Apple cannot do.  And that's why this is a little different than the San Bernardino case from a few years back.  In fact, this is the lawfare blog, Nicholas Weaver writing,  Pensacola isn't San Bernardino because in San Bernardino was an older iPhone, they could have  given the information to the FBI, or they could have done something to modify it.  This time, Apple has no access to that information.  They've been very careful to make sure that the device is encrypted in a way that even  Apple can't see it.  In the San Bernardino case, the FBI eventually dropped their request because they figured out,  oh, there's an Israeli company that sells software that will crack this.  And they were able to get into it.  They may be able to do the same with the Pensacola case.  Apparently, Grey Key and Celebrated, the two big companies that do this.  Grey Key does have something that will get into even an iPhone 11.  Nobody talks about it because they know that if they talked about it,  Apple would fix it as soon as they could.  What do you think, let me ask you, Patrick, what do you think  Attorney General Barr really wants?

Start time: 1739.14
End time: 1766.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he wants them to magically unlock everything and give them all the information  immediately.  Same thing that the Attorney General's or the FBI should say.  Wanted in previous cases, law enforcement wants, for the most part, full access immediately.  They want to magic.  This is the same thing, my former, your current Senator.  Dianne Feinstein, yeah.

Transcript:  Yes.  I did not feel the large enough rat, so I sold my house.  Congratulations.  We are exploring and searching for a new location.  But the thing, I mean, fine science, I love security.  I love it.  It's been so good for business in the state.  If you just put a little key that only, this is a security argument from forever.  There's one side that's like everything should have a back door because we need to have access  to everything and the other side's like if there's a back door, eventually everyone will  have access to it.  I'm a big First Amendment person.  The problem is if all speech is protected, barring the stuff that's been settled about  yelling fire in a crowded movie house, then the Illinois Nazis get to march up and march,  which is why the ACLU fought for their right to be villainous scumbags in public,  which I think is great.  I love it when you identify the Nazis and you can go hunt them down and exterminate them.  That's personal opinion.  We're not advocating, incidentally.

Start time: 1861.78
End time: 1865.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1865.74
End time: 1887.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If war analysis is telling you it's okay to punch a Nazi in the face, it's probably okay.  I digress, but the challenge here is people who are responsible for security and safety  want access and there are people who also believe.  This is an argument that goes back a long time.  People who would give up a little liberty for safety deserve neither.

Start time: 1889.30
End time: 1941.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is though that same double-edged sword.  We do want protection from terrorism.  We do want law enforcement to be able to do their job, but the real question is can you give law  enforcement or anybody access to this data without giving bad guys access to this data?  Here's what further complicates it from my point of view.  AG Barr must indeed know, according to Forbes, the FBI already knows how to unlock an iPhone 11 Pro Max.  They already know using technology from Grey, what is it, Grey cell, Grey Key.  If Grey Key can unlock an iPhone 11 Pro Max, then it means the FBI can unlock the shooter's phone.  Now I'm starting to think that that's really not AG Barr's agenda.

Start time: 1942.48
End time: 1987.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's about making companies like Apple look bad, to make them appear to be on the wrong side  of this issue and then hopefully get Congress to act and to introduce some kind of legislation  to do what you talked about, which is to make encryption illegal or to force them to put back  doors into it. Which on this one, I humbly have to disagree with Steve Gibson. I don't think that you  can safely do it. I don't think that there is a safe way to create that kind of escrow system for  this key and not have it abused by somebody. Georgia? Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. There's

Start time: 1988.06
End time: 2015.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  only one reason for them to go public and that's to put pressure on Apple to try to create as much  bad press for them so that the court of public opinion is against them and wants this and then  they will push it through Congress as quickly as possible. And they really, they just want to make  sure that Apple is going to get as much bad press. So every time this happens, they push them even  though you know that they probably even have it opened already. Who knows, right? Here's what

Start time: 2016.28
End time: 2055.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nicholas Weaver writes in the Lawfare blog. The FBI's request for Apple's help is puzzling.  If the government takes Apple to court as it did in the San Bernardino case,  the judiciary can't compel Apple to provide any meaningful assistance because there is no more  meaningful assistance Apple can provide. San Bernardino was about Apple not wanting to assist  the FBI. This is about Apple being incapable of assisting the FBI. So even if the case winds up  in court, real help from Apple is not going to come out of a judicial battle. The meaningful  fight, this is exactly what you said Georgia, the meaningful fight is in the court of public opinion.

Start time: 2056.62
End time: 2090.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if he was, you can tell that if they were going to go through this and be really honest  about it, they would have stated that you know what, Apple's helped us as much as we could. We  wish that they would create a back door so that we could not have to go through this or it would  be faster. But they don't state any of those things. They try to put Apple in as dark of a light as  possible in hopes that people get really angry. And we can say that we do have a hair trigger  society right now that the zeitgeist of the moment goes through all social media with people being  exceptionally angry. And it's fast. That's what they're hoping for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick, go ahead.  The problem, the real problem is that as bad as terrorism is, and I'd say it's a bad thing,  no doubt about it. In the grand scheme of all the issues we have, it's not actually that big of an  issue. It doesn't affect that many people compared to so many other things. If you look at how many  people in this country are going without proper health care or not being able to afford  food and shelter, terrorism is not really that big a deal.

Start time: 2135.94
End time: 2210.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to go one step farther than you because I think really,  no, I don't want to be a conspiracy theory guy, but I feel like  Attorney General Barr is emboldened by the current situation in the United States.  He feels like he has an opportunity, perhaps a brief window of opportunity,  to do what I think some, not all by far, not all, but some in law enforcement want,  which is to create a surveillance state. What some in law enforcement would like to do  is have a perfect view, a panopticon, a perfect view of everything that happens in the country.  I don't think it's solely to protect us from terrorism. They'll often use things like terrorism  or child abuse or child pornography because those things really get people outraged and upset.  I don't think it has really much to do with that. I think it has a lot more to do with just  controlling the populace and really knowing what's going on so you can suppress dissent,  so you can do all the kinds of things true authoritarian regimes do.  I honestly think that that's what's going on. I think Barr is, in some ways, represents the  worst of law enforcement, the people who want total information.

Start time: 2211.46
End time: 2233.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm probably the last person to defend Barr, but I think he may genuinely just want the magic  button on any given crime or any given situation and that he's not intentionally planning to create  a surveillance state. I mean, if that's a side effect, as long as his side is in control,  he'll be really happy about it. And there's a lot of people who-

Start time: 2234.60
End time: 2239.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think he wants a Chinese-style surveillance apparatus in the United States?

Start time: 2241.02
End time: 2243.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He may not, but there are others in this administration who do.

Start time: 2244.36
End time: 2271.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. No, and I'll be honest with you, there's others in every administration who just  want perfect clarity on all the issues at all times. I mean, it's unfortunately not something  that is restricted to the Republican side of the fence. There are lots of Democrats who are fairly-  Dianne Feinstein. You brought her up, yeah.  Yeah. Either way, it's creepy and unnecessary and fundamentally un-American and kind of evil.

Start time: 2271.28
End time: 2289.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the point. It's unconstitutional, it's anti-American. But you can see why people will  say, but we'd be safer. And I think that's some of the argument in China. But we preserve order  this way. Wouldn't you rather have an orderly country? I don't think anyone really thinks to

Start time: 2289.26
End time: 2300.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  themselves that they're going to use this for ill. They think that if I had full knowledge,  you can see the same thing with parenting. If I knew everything that my child was doing,  at every moment I could stop bad things from happening.  I would be really depressed.

Start time: 2301.08
End time: 2309.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right? No, that's a really good point though. Actually, that's a great analogy. As a mom,  you would like to know exactly where your kid is at all times, everything they're doing,

Start time: 2309.36
End time: 2339.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but that's not good for the kid.  And you honestly believe that that would be helpful and you could stop things and you could  protect them. But in the end, what you're doing is you're disempowering them and not allowing them  to be able to think for themselves and to be able to make their own choices, even if they're the  wrong choice to learn from those decisions. So I don't think that a lot of times, I don't think  that it's out of malice. I think that we're all a little bit narcissistic and you believe that if  I used it, I would use it for good. Like, you know, Galadriel with the ring, like I would totally  take the ring. Like I would be a good dark queen.

Start time: 2339.82

Start time: 2345.90
End time: 2365.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A hundred percent. But the thing is, is that power corrupts. And once you know everything,  it becomes really dangerous. And that's why we need to make sure that the constitution is protected  because you will out of good think that you can use something that later becomes really bad and  you cannot put the genie back inside of the bottle.

Start time: 2365.40
End time: 2401.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should point out that I'm not making up this total information awareness.  This was the acronym in 2003. Shortly after 9-11, our law enforcement in this country  actively sought this kind of information. And the whole point was total information awareness  of transnational threats requires keeping track of individuals and understanding how they fit  into models, knowing everything that's going on. And yes, we'll use the ring of power wisely.  Mm hmm. That's a great analogy. And it's bad for the kid, right? You know, you know,  everything, even though you can keep them safer that way.

Start time: 2401.94
End time: 2431.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A hundred percent. Even if a current administration did use it wisely there,  you know, as we've said, you know, in the past, you know, about tech companies, about companies  like Apple, you know, even if they're doing the right thing with privacy today, there's no  guarantee that, you know, five years from now that, you know, that you're going to have people in  power that, you know, once you have that ability, that they will use it wisely. You know,  you can't create that. You can't create that environment in the first place because otherwise

Transcript:  someone will eventually abuse it. They do. But we're so short sighted. Like we really only  think about our here and now. Like if people really understood the cost that you would pay  play later that, you know, even though your government may be a really honorable government,  maybe these same rules could be used for ill by another government that may not be as honorable  or have as much integrity. And we often sell ourselves off. Like we sell for short-term  gain. We sell off our future. Like no one would be smoking if, you know, you, they say that you lose  seven seconds of your life. If we all froze for seven seconds, every time you took a puck puff  of the cigarette, no one would be smoking. But since you pay that off later, we think,

And, you know, I could totally understand how the citizens of  China or Singapore or Dubai say, well, we like having an orderly, we don't like graffiti and  homelessness and crime. We like having an orderly society. And if we have to give up a little  privacy to get that, it doesn't seem like too high a price to pay. But then we end up in a black

Start time: 2510.12
End time: 2575.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know. Again, this is that technology has brought into relief so many issues  like this, where it's difficult to know exactly what's the right thing to do. You know, and  because of these capabilities, we couldn't have these capabilities if we didn't have vast databases,  huge computational power. We wouldn't be able to use this information. You can't have total  information awareness without massive technology, modern technology. I just learned a great new  acronym, NOBUS. N-O-B-U-S. And it's a doctrine at the NSA. I didn't know about it. Nobody but us  can use it. And Michael Hayden, who was a former director of the NSA, apparently was talking about  it. The notion that there are exploits that would take, he used the analogy, four acres of  supercomputer power to take advantage of. So we don't have to publicize those exploits or tell  the companies about them or get them fixed because NOBUS, nobody but us can take advantage of them.

Start time: 2578.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yet. The NSA did recently release kind of a shocking release of information about a Windows  exploit that they at least had the good, the courtesy to wait until Microsoft had fixed it.  It was called Eternal Blue. And it was a flaw in the Windows crypto API, crypto32.dll,  that validates elliptical curve cryptography. And the NSA actually did something kind of  almost unheard of this past week. They had discovered this. They did get Microsoft to fix  it. Actually, before they did that, they told the military, stop using Windows for crypto.  Here's the threat to you and me. Because of this flaw, it's possible to spoof a certificate on  Microsoft Windows. Apparently Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019 were vulnerable.  Were vulnerable. They've been patched. They were patched last Tuesday. If you spoof those crypto  certs, you could, for instance, offer somebody a file that looks to be Microsoft Office,  but instead, and is signed by a Microsoft certificate, but instead is malware.  So it also impacts HTTPS, signed files and emails, signed executable code.  Kind of a serious flaw. This was not a NOBUS. The NSA did alert Microsoft. It has been fixed.  Nevertheless, there are other exploits that the NSA keeps to itself.  I love it. NOBUS. Nobody but us. By the way, if you're running Windows 10, you might want  to make sure that you got patch Tuesday's patch. As long as we're talking about flaws, this is one  Steve was also talking about on Tuesday that affects virtually all cable modems  and can't be patched by you. Can't be fixed by you. Patrick, did you read about  this cable haunt? Cablehaunt.com if you're curious. My modem is impacted. Almost all the modems in the  world are impacted. Any modem that has a Broadcom chip in it, and it's kind of not an unusual flaw.  Very often companies like Broadcom and Intel will write example code for how to take advantage of  certain features in their hardware. And it is not at all unusual for this example code to then be  taken up wholesale by companies put into their modems without any vetting, without any error  checking. It was Broadcom, of course, never intended it to be used, but it was widely used.

Transcript:  Intel, thank you for the code. Thanks, Qualcomm. I'll just use that. Cablehaunt is a critical  vulnerability found in cable modem manufacturers. The researchers found 200 million cable modems  in Europe alone that are vulnerable, virtually all of them. Both cable modems I use are vulnerable.  My Motorola Eris and my Netgear CM1000. It's because many of these modems have spectrum  analyzers. You go to the modem's IP address, colon 8080. They're open on port 8080. And  with a buffer overflow, you can take control of the modem. There's a proof of concept. There's  a test script at cablehaunt.com. Kids, if you want to get to work right now and start building that  malware, it hasn't been found in the public. But here's the real problem. Your cable company  has to fix it. You can't. And unfortunately, in the process of fixing this, even if you bought  the cable modem, which I did, you can't fix it. Even though it's my modem. Even though it's my  Android phone. Even though it's my modem, Comcast is the only one that can flash the firmware.  And they don't like to do it because it takes you off the internet for a period of time. All this

Transcript:  And they're probably going to get a million. If you're Comcast and you have tens of millions  of subscribers, you're probably going to get a few hundred thousand calls. My internet's out.  What's going on? Once control is achieved by attacker, it can be used to change the default  DNS server, conduct man in the middle attacks remotely, hot swap code. It pretty just the whole  firmware. You could change upload, flash and upgrade firmware, silent, disable ISP firmware  upgrades, change every config file and settings, get and set SNMP OID values, change all associated  Mac addresses, change serial numbers and put you in a botnet. It is a nasty flaw and you're almost  certainly affected. If you go to cablehaunt.com, they have a list of cable modems that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  vulnerable and it's a pretty good list. Well, they also say they don't really have any examples  of it being found in the wild, but they also point out that anybody who's sophisticated could  probably cover their tracks in the process of using this exploit, which is always really charming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Now, the only good news is they have to do this. They have to do it from within your  network. So what they do is they have to compromise a system in your internal network, which then can  write to the modem. They can't do it from the outside world in. They have to do it from the  inside world out. So once again, patch and do the best you can to protect yourself on all your  devices. If you've got an IoT device, good luck. And since this exploit now is the code is out there,  I don't know what's going to happen. Just thought I'd mention that. Let's take a little break so  you can absorb this and run to fix. Steve says, and I tried this, I couldn't get it to work.  If you can, first of all, check to see, you need to know what your, not your router, but your cable  modems IP address is. In my case for my CM1000, it was 192.168.100.1. And if you go to that address,  colon 8080, your spectrum analyzer pops up. If that's the case, then you have it. Then that means  you're vulnerable. And then he says you could set up a firewall rule that blocks outbound.  This is what I was having a hard time doing. Outbound traffic on port 8080. I can't figure  out how to do that. Maybe I don't know. I can block inbound, but outbound is a little harder.  If you can do that, maybe that's a mitigation. Well, but that may not be your, this is the problem.  It may not be 192.168.100.1. The port's usually 8080, but you have to know what your cable  modem is. Mine is 100.1. So if you go there, you get the cable modem login. Okay. So maybe you're  all right. I did the 8080 and it gave me a 404. Yay. Or maybe your cable company's already patched

Transcript:  Let's take a little break. I'm going to talk about protecting yourself online and then we'll have  more. There's some other fun stuff to talk about too. Good news, not just bad news.  Amazon wants you to pay with a wave. What could possibly go wrong?  Our show today brought to you by the ExpressVPN. This is the VPN I use and I recommend. It is  awesome because it's fast. They have VPN servers all over the world, more than a hundred countries.  Plus they use a trusted server technology. They figured this out and it's been audited by a third  party that not only do they not do any logging, they couldn't even if they wanted to. Their  trusted server, which spins up when you get on their server and it opened the VPN and then spins  down afterwards, is sandboxed so that it can't write to disk in any way, which means there's no  way they can keep track of anything you're doing. Your privacy is a hundred percent protected.  Be more secure. Protect yourself against bad guys at the open wifi access point from snoops at your  internet service provider. Besides protecting your privacy and security online, you can also use it  to take your TV watching to the next level. Because ExpressVPN has servers all over the world.  You can go to Netflix, go to ExpressVPN, turn on your VPN, pick where you want. Let's say you want  to watch Star Trek. You can watch it on Netflix in the UK. So all you got to do is tell ExpressVPN,  I'm in London right now and boom, you're watching Doctor Who and Star Trek on UK Netflix. Go to  Japan, watch anime on Japanese Netflix. ExpressVPN hides your IP address, lets you control where you  want sites to think you're coming from. It's so fast. They just do such a good job that you can  stream HD no problem at all while you're on the VPN. I know that because when I first tried this,  I wanted to see, does this work? And I was watching Netflix in Japan. I forgot to turn it off for three  days and I didn't even know I was running through a VPN on my iPad for the longest time. That's how  fast it is. I didn't even notice I was using. No buffering, no lag. It works everywhere. Mac,  Windows, Linux, iPhone, Android, even on media consoles, on smart TVs. You can watch what you  want on the go or on the big screen wherever you are. I love ExpressVPN. I love you guys.  Right now, expressvpn.com slash twit. You can get an extra three months for free when you sign up  for a year. Expressvpn.com slash twit. About seven bucks a month when you get that extra three months.  That's a very good deal for the best VPN in the market. Expressvpn.com slash twit. Thanks for  supporting us ExpressVPN. Apple's doing some good things. I just read a story in DigiDay,  which caters to the advertising community. Apple's new privacy features have further rattled  the location-based ad market. This is one for the good guys. You know that pop-up you get on  iOS 13? You get it on Android now too, when it says, hey, Google has just checked your location  four times in the last 24 hours. You know that pop-up? It says, do you want to allow that? Or  maybe only when the app's open or maybe not at all? That's been going on since iOS 13 was released  in September. Ad tech sources are saying it has been a big hit to the amount of data they can gather.  DigiDay quotes Benoit Grouchco, who has a great name by the way. Benoit Grouchco, he runs the ad  tech business Timo. They do software for apps to collect that location data. He says, three years  ago opt-in rates almost 100%. Almost everybody left location on. Ever since iOS 13, the opt-in  rate now is often below 50%. People, when they're given the choice, say, you know what? No.  Seven in 10 iOS 13 location signals analyzed by location sciences in the six weeks after iOS 13  came out. 80% of those users stopped all back where I'm tracking across their devices.  So if you're in the business of selling based on location,  public agency Starcom said this impacts the ability to tie users that research online and purchase  in store driving and measure footfall for clients. This is some Google offers by the way. Google  monitors credit card purchases and then says to an advertiser, hey, this guy saw your ad on Tuesday  and went to the store and bought your product on Wednesday. Your ads working. Not as easy.  Not as easy. Time to celebrate. Georgia, you're an iPhone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am. I love it. I love it.  What do you do when you see that pop up?  Always opt out. I'm actually shocked that there's 50% of people that say that they will still  allow it. What are you doing? Stop it. It's creepy. Would you want someone walking around  tracking you? If you could see them snooping into your bathroom, looking at what you're doing,  what you're surfing around, you'd say stop doing that. You'd close your blinds.  There's a few of us. Maybe you'd be like yay into that. Most people would say no.

Transcript:  Stop following me around. Actually, you know what? I'm weird, Georgia.  Are you? I always say always allow.  In fact, it pisses me off because Apple doesn't usually give always allow as an option.  There's really most of the time I see two options. Allow when app is in use. Don't allow.  You have to go into the settings to turn on always allow. And I do because I want them to know.  What do you want them to know? Everything.  Everything. I like it. Patrick knows.  I feel like they care. Do you think that you get better targeted ads?  Yes. What's wrong with that? I think I get better ads. I walk by the Levi's store and it says,  hey, here's a coupon. You can go in. My Google Maps. I love that feature where I can look at  my timeline and see all the places I've been. Why wouldn't I want that? Do you think they're  following me around? Is it like somebody? It is like following you around.

And the reality is through third  party marketing tools, if they can identify your phone, which is not that hard to do the level of  mapping and tracking they can do now without using any official tools is kind of terrifying.

You know, I've got, you know, I've got, uh,  Android 10 on, on my pixel three now, and they added the same thing in there so that now in all  the apps, you can go in and set your location preferences by app, you know, to always allow,  you know, allow when in use or never allow. And I was shocked, you know, after upgrading to 10,  you know, some of these apps that were coming up and asking, you know, for location permission,  that they had, I mean, you know, games and stuff that had no business knowing where I was.  I don't mind, you know, Google maps, you know, having my location. I mean, that's why I use it.  You have to, it's why it's there. Maps won't work. Yeah.  Yeah. And, you know, things, things like, you know, lift or Uber,  clearly they need to know where I am when I'm using them, but there's no reason for a ride  hailing app to know where I am when I'm not using the app. You know, anytime that I'm not using the  app, it's off. And I think the only app I have set to always allow is Google maps because like you,  Leo, I do like the timeline. It's, I find it useful. Uh,

It's that you  don't really know what they're going to be doing with it and who they're going to be selling it to  and what they're going to be using it for. There are no regulations to make sure that they're really  being honest and it's legible. No one reads the privacy. Like I have every once in a while,  it's terrifying. And then I always don't, you know, if I really want the app, I won't read it  because then I will say no, but no one reads it. It's illegible. So it's a big problem.

Transcript:  Remember the flashlight app that some nefarious company bought. And then it was basically,  it went from being like, you can turn on the light for your camera when you're not actually  using your camera. And then they did an update and it was looking for information. It was basically  accessing all possible information on your phone, your photos, your contact information, everything.  It was kind of fascinating to watch because, you know, the millions of downloads, this was before  they integrated this stuff into the operating system, people kept downloading it, installing it  and presumably saying, okay, that's how badly they wanted a flashlight app. But there's an article  the New York Times did back in the middle of December, 12 million phones, one data set, zero  privacy, where somebody turned over a data set, which was 50 billion pings, quote, 50 billion  pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they move through several major  cities, including Washington, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. And, you know, basically,  because apps that would track you and then report the information,  it also meant that these unregulated third party app data collection centers could allow  anybody with that information to track the location of people who probably shouldn't be  tracked or don't want to be tracked, whether they are celebrities or, you know, exes or abused.  It's kind of amazing how much information is out there. And just it's, you know, the William  Gitson line is my favorite, the street finds its own uses for things, you know, the streets going  to find its own use for this information, and it might be creepy as hell. That's actually a really

Start time: 3761.86
End time: 3836.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  important point is that you can invent a technology and have an idea about how it's going to be used.  Law enforcement can have an idea. But, you know, well, with kiosk, we'll only use the ring of power  for good, not evil. But the street finds its own uses is a really good thing to keep in mind.  I like that, Patrick. Yeah. Thank William Gitson. Yeah. It just that's the nature of technology.  It flows like water. I should have brought this up, Georgia. I'm curious what you thought think  about this was an article in the New York Times panicking about your kids phones. New research  says don't a growing number of academics are challenging assumptions about the negative effects  of social media and smartphone on children. See that kids even from Canada. And actually, he's  nice from Newport Beach. But this is research that was published on Friday. 40 studies, it was one of  those survey of surveys to psychology professors looked at the studies links between social media  and depression and anxiety among adolescents, they say, based on our meta study,  that's a small and inconsistent link, there doesn't seem to be a strong evidence.

Start time: 3839.12
End time: 4000.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't they didn't really take a look at a lot of different variables, though, like just from  in my office, and I see probably 20 families a week, every single week. And the amount of kids  that are negatively affected by social media is vast. And again, it's not a big data study. But  this is all I see. And this is kids that are talking to me. And they have no reason to lie,  because I'm not going to be telling their parents what they say. And there's none of them that say  that they wish they were on the phone more or that social media does good or that, you know,  how many kids are now bullied on social media or feel like they're not good enough because of what  they see, or they're trying to become someone that they aren't. Because of that, the amount of  cutting, you know, anorexia, wanting a plastic surgery for my actual clients is really strongly  linked to the media of which they are consuming kids are naturally mimics, they model behavior,  we are programmed to model what we see, there's a part of our brain that have mirror neurons.  And that means that they fire with what we see. And then like kids, they don't care what you say,  like a lot of this advertising, it's all about like, say this, they care about what they see and what  they consume. And so if you're they care about someone on social media, they want to become like  them. And they don't really understand that most of it is filters, it's expensive lighting, it's,  you know, professional makeup artists and having all of these different things that are out there,  you know, whim, and they believe the lies and then they're, you know, feeling of depression  and that they're not good enough and that they should be doing more and their world becomes about  all of this supernatural fluff that really is crap. Like you are not who you what you consume,  you're not your title, you're not your car, your drive, though, torque is awesome. You're not how  many VR systems that you have in your house, you really are your personal characteristics.  And the levels of care to that of building yourself as your character instead of, you know,  what other people will see has been changing. And that's been changing really quickly and rapidly  because of the effects of social media. So I, again, don't see my world does not reflect to that.  And so I looked at that article with a little bit of like, yeah, I'm not so sure about that that  wasn't, you know, pushed or propelled by lobbyists like, you know, Facebook and, you know, I don't  want to throw out that this might be fake media, but I'm just, you know, consuming it with a grain  assault because there's a whole bunch of this, you know, again, Facebook and Instagram and everything  else wants you to not limit how much your kids get access to it. But I would say limit it.

They say we've been outspoken critics of the industry on issues other than mental health,  privacy and lack of transparency. Ms. Ogders added she was not surprised that people had a hard time  accepting her findings. Her own mother questioned her research after one of her grandsons stopped  talking to her during the long drives she used to enjoy. But children turning out their elders when  they become teenagers is hardly a new trend. Some said also, yeah, there might be an effect,  but it's not it's not don't compare it to other factors like lack of sleep or diet. There are  things kids can do that really can severely impact them much more dramatically than smart food.

But first,  speaking of tracking you, we don't track you, obviously. There's a big move afoot. I've talked  about this so much. I don't want to bore you. But Ad Tech is coming to podcasting. There are lots of  podcasts that, well, Spotify, for instance, has already even announced that they're going to  do more and more exclusive podcasts. You have to listen on the Spotify app. Spotify already  knows everything they need to know about you. They've got your credit card number  and they plan on monitoring your podcast listening through that app. We do not do that. We will not  do that. I promise you. But in its place, we do have a voluntary thing we do once a year. We'd  love to ask you to participate in our twit annual audience survey. Just takes a few minutes.  I already am getting email from people who are taking it saying, but you don't cover my  unusual use case. Okay, that's fine. It's not possible to design a survey that fits everybody's  unusual use case. The questions we ask on there are questions that we can use both to improve the  product and to help us sell. Advertisers often want to know, for instance, how many women listen  versus how many men. So we appreciate this. It's completely voluntary. We do not track you. We  will never track you. That's not how we work here. But in order to help us sell the show,  we do ask you once a year to take this survey. twit.to. That's our URL shortener. twit.to  survey20 because it's 2020. Let us know what you think. There's no signup form. We're not going to  use this information about you personally, only in aggregate. It just helps us make twit better,  helps us keep twit on the air. And so thank you in advance. I know many of you do this. We usually  get about 20 or 30,000 people taking the survey. And that's enough for us to use it to make it  statistically valuable. So thank you. I appreciate you're doing that. twit.to. survey20 if you would  do that. Our show today brought to you by World Wide Technology. We are, I think we're going,  March 5th, I think is the plan to go to St. Louis to visit their amazing Advanced Technology Center.  Patrick, you, I know we worked with Jim Latterback back in the day at the Ziff Davis Labs in Foster  City. Those days of big magazines having giant testing labs so they could see, you know, test  300 printers or 800 network cards. Those days are long gone. Did you think, is that ZD Labs still  exist even, Patrick? Do you know? I have no idea at this point. I can't imagine it does. I mean,

Transcript:  up at four in the morning, you can't set up a Wiki. Unless you have ethernet.  Bingo. Worldwide technology is taking the place of these old, you know, centers about 10 years ago.  I think they realized there was going to be a need in enterprise tech for a place to trial  technology to test it out. They started building the advanced technology center. It has grown like  crazy in the last 10 years. It now has more than half a billion dollars in equipment. I bet you  they have a Faraday cage from hundreds of OEMs. Key partners ranging from high tech heavyweights  like Cisco, VMware, AI disruptors like Nvidia. Absolutely. They've got it all in there. This is  what the engineers at WWT use to spin up proofs of concept, to test the system before they set it up  on your premises, to pilot programs. It's a great way for engineers at WWT and their customers  to confidently select the best solution. But here's the best part about this amazing lab.  You can use it to on demand and schedulable labs or workshops like for instance, Nvidia's deep  learning workshop available to you 24 seven anywhere in the world. You don't even have to  go to St. Louis to use it. It's online. There are hundreds of labs representing the newest advances  in architectural solutions to accelerate customers on artificial intelligence and machine learning.  And a whole lot more. You can learn about products before you launch. This lab is a service,  they call it, is a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you could perform your own programmatic  testing using this amazing technology ecosystem built by WWT. Customers of WWT stay with WWT for  years and years and years because it's the best way to get help setting up enterprise technology.  And this ATC is just one example and these virtual labs is brilliant.  WWT's engineers themselves work in these labs. They're there every day beta testing new solutions.  Some of them based on the best, greatest and latest Nvidia technologies for AI, building reference  architectures, custom integrations, help their customers see results faster to help you know  ahead of time if it's going to work with a lot less investment.

Google is doing something I think unprecedented and boy color me  cynical because I'm immediately saying well okay well what are they planning. They've said  they are going to drop support for tracking cookies for third-party cookies by 2022.  Third-party cookies of course are the thing that we tell everybody you know most browsers except  Chrome you can turn that off that's the basically tracking cookies. Instead of using those companies  have now turned to other solutions like fingerprinting and all sorts of things. Google  said that they are going to deprecate third-party cookies. They didn't say what they're going to  offer instead they say third-party cookies and cross-site tracking are a problem starting next  month. They're going to limit insecure cross-site tracking. Cookies that don't include the same  site label as first party only and require they're going to block those and they're going to require  cookies labeled for third-party used to be accessed only over secure HTTP. That makes them more secure  and they're going to slowly phase it out over time. Apple and Firefox both let you block tracking  cookies so does Brave our sponsor. Microsoft says we're going to have some cookie blocking in their  new version of Edge that's based on Chromium. Is this a good thing or is this just kind of an  announcement that Google's going to find something worse? I'm puzzled by it. I think it's a good thing  and in fact privacy advocates like Benedita say I retract my criticism kudos to Google this is a big deal.  Any thoughts anybody? Sam?

But the idea which so maybe it's all I move but the idea of Start Page is they  use the Google index. So Google still is the gold standard for search right? Yeah. But what they do  is they anonymize it. And then and furthermore when you do a search startpage.com you'll get the same  results you'd get from Google but as if you were in incognito mode. And then there is a button next  to it to visit this site anonymously and then they route you through an anonymizer kind of like  a little bit like a VPN but not. And your IP address isn't visible to that site. So it lets  you visit a site completely anonymously which I think is really interesting. Start Page. I think

Transcript:  this entire. It's called OneSearch. It launched Tuesday. They say we will not store records of  what you search. We will not create profiles of your usage or share your search data with advertisers.  They also say it gives unbiased unfiltered results just like Start Page. That means it's not you know  Google because you're logged into Google when you're using Google tailors its results to you.  So that's why when I search for me I get such great results because it's tailoring it to me right?  Verizon says everyone seems the same result for the same search terms and one's search results  can self-destruct after a set period of time. Why would Verizon do this?  It seems odd to me. In hopes that then people don't regulate. I don't know. Give me a give me  something I can search for. By the way okay I immediately have one problem. As soon as I click  in the search private encrypted search I get a list of things people are searching for right now.  Tells me is that completely private? They're not telling you who's searching. Well okay yeah I guess  so. What should I search for that we would know if it was a good search? Sam you like you wouldn't  like if I searched for Chevy Corvette would you know what a good search is?

It doesn't have as  you notice the Google knowledge box on the right. It's just got search results. Let me just search  it does by the way have images video. It has that anytime button which lets you search by date  and they have safe search as well. Let me just search for Leo Laporte. Oh actually well yeah  and by the way the auto complete seems to be as as scary as Google. Okay if I typed is yeah I mean  and no there's a knowledge box from Wikipedia and other people this looks look Patrick people  when people search for Leo Laporte they also search for Patrick Norton.

Or it's  weird. I mean they own Yahoo. I covet unlimited data access to Verizon's network. I do not covet  dealing with Verizon itself.

Transcript:  Verizon said one search will generate revenue from the service by matching ads to search terms.  Remember when you do a Google search you make money for Google. Believe it or not. That's why  Google paid Apple 12 billion dollars last year to be the default search in Safari on an iPhone  because it's that valuable. Mozilla makes money on Firefox because of the Google Google pays them  hundreds of millions of dollars every year because of referrals. So when you so maybe this is Verizon  saying we don't want to give Google that money. We want to keep it to ourselves.  I don't know. It's one of those weird ones. Google's blocking third party cookies. Verizon's  starting a search engine. Cats are lying down with dogs. The world's about to end. That's all I can  say. By the way, good news. We misreported. I misreported this story and I stand corrected  now by Cameron Faulkner on The Verge. We had on Tuesday talked on MacBreak Weekly and iOS today  about the EU ruling saying there has to be chargers. All have to be uniform for smartphones.  And we took the tack that many did that this meant that the EU was asking Apple to get rid  of the lightning cable. It wasn't about that end of the plug. It was actually about the charger brick.  They've been trying to convince tech companies since 2009 for 10 years to adopt a single wall  charger instead of proprietary chargers because there are so many wall chargers, 51,000 metric  tons of e-waste per year because there's so many different proprietary charging methods.  Now, by the way, it might not matter. Technology is moving more towards type C and power delivery  and I suspect that all wall chargers, there will be a uniform anyway whether they make this law or not.

It would do email. And it would just sit  there blathering in the background. And it was strangely soothing just to have it sitting back  there. And then its ears would go back like an angry cat.

Like, oh yeah, I know that guy. I love Patrick.  He's no Dick Cavett. I would agree. It was a very strange thing. So there was a good article in the  Atlantic. This must be the kind of thing that reporters write at the beginning of a new year  as they talk about boxes of cables and stuff. This is from Robinson Meyer. What the death of  iTunes says about our digital habits. We started the 2010s with our electronic, obsessed with our  electronic hygiene, and it ended up a nation of digital hoarders. And actually, it was early in  the decade when Gmail arrived, this all began. Gmail said, stop deleting email. Stop cleaning  up your email. Have unlimited space. Just put everything in there. Leave it all. Don't delete  anything. Just use our great search and you'll find the file you need. It was in counter. I bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  remember that whole thing about inbox zero where, you know, the whole idea is every day you would  religiously go through every damn email you received and handle it in some way, delete it,  archive it, assign it, respond to it. And at the end of the day, you'd sigh a great sigh of relief.  And you'd tweet it too. I am inbox zero. And then it got so onerous that people started declaring  email bankruptcy. Remember that? Where you'd say, there's no way I get to you. So in order to get to  inbox zero, I'm just going to delete everything. I'm not going to even look at it. And I'm going  to announce to the world, I have declared email bankruptcy. If I haven't responded to you, I'm  not going to send me another email.

And actually the  thing that has been the best thing for helping me manage my inbox, you know, because I don't,  delete most of the stuff, most of it just stays in there. But it's almost all been dealt with.  But my smartphone helps me to triage that stuff. On Android, I can delete a message directly from  the notification so I can glance at my phone. Okay, read the subject line, who it's from,  delete, delete, delete. And I triage a lot of stuff right from there without ever even looking at it.  And then, I come back when I've got the time, if I've got a few minutes here or there,  I'll go through, do a quick read. If it needs a response, I'll respond. Otherwise,  just leave it, leave it in there. I don't have to mess with it.

They just started  sinking. And it was about that time that people stopped organizing their iPhones, where you have  the front page and then folders and stuff. And just put whenever they did, they stopped.  iPhone became seven, eight, nine pages of apps in no possible order. And they just use the search  to launch the app. Georgia, do you have an organized iPhone?

He said part of the problem is in the last 10 years,  the cost of a gigabyte of hard drive space has dropped from 10 cents to one cent. I just bought  a 16 terabyte hard drive for under 400 bucks. 16 terabytes. That's like the Library of Congress  on my hard drive. And then it was so much fun, I bought a couple more.  My NAS now has 30 terabytes of storage. I don't know. I don't ever have to throw anything out  ever again. So is that what's happened is that we've finally relaxed into our hoarder.

My problem is I think he makes a  bunch of valid points in this, especially Gmail getting people used to be like, oh,  just search for it and eventually you'll come up with the right set of vectors to get the thing  you want. Just leave everything where we can search it. It'll be fine. But part of the reason  iTunes died is because iTunes was always a tremendously difficult product.  It was awful. Yeah, he calls it all sorts of names in this article.  I recently moved back to iOS after a while on Android. I remember being like, oh, they deleted  the part of iTunes that would allow me to arrange all the icons on my page because of course they  wanted to get rid of iTunes. And now I have to sit there and drag things and just being like, this is  so irritating. But it is what it is. He says because of that, each of us,

Each of us adopted the tacit,  but still shameful assumption that we are just treading water, that the clock is always running  and the work will never end. Oh my God, that's depressing.  But so true. But so true. The final sentence, he's talking about a famous review of a Paul  Clay painting about an angel by German critic Walter Benjamin. This is back in 1940. The angel  looked, quote, as though he's about to move away from something he's fixedly contemplating. His  eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. The angel would like to stay and  waken the dead, make whole what has been smashed, but a storm is blowing from paradise. It has got  caught in his wings with such violence, the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly  propels him into the future to which his back is turned while the pile of debris before him grows  skyward. It is now clear, writes Robinson, that 80 years later the angel is looking at his iPhone.

Transcript:  I've been, I've been running an AMD rise in desktop since they were released.  It, it go moving, moving from my, my then current Intel processor to an AMD rise in,  dropped my, it basically, it was just such a massive reduction in the time it took me to  render files. It was a no brain decision. My one issue is for reasons nobody can quite figure out  the USB ports on the motherboard, but that rise in processor do something really peculiar to my  video capture device and made the video look washed out. But in terms of, you know, editing  video, computing, gaming, everything else, you know, it was a staggering amount of, of performance  for the money compared to an Intel part. And that gap is, is widening, isn't it?  What's going to be interesting is the, the big, as last year was crazy. There was so much PC and  especially PC gaming news at CES last year, this year and video doesn't present Intel kind of,  you know, Intel presented, but they didn't have any presence on the show floor. AMD though,  announced that they were, they are, they, you know, rise in 4,000 processors and they are  essentially gunning for the laptop, you know, Intel's laptop market, which is a big deal.  I am really curious to see what the performance on those processors look like  and which of the manufacturers will adopt them. When does that series come out? When it was the

Transcript:  two 86, 12 megahertz screaming 12 megahertz. Well, Patrick and I really, uh, were AMD fans back in  the day on tech TV on the new screensavers cause they were sticking it to Intel. And it was a good  thing. Cause that competition was what convinced Intel that perhaps the titanium was not the  direction in which to go. And they, and they actually ended up, uh, you know, finding a little  skunk works project they had going in Israel. And that was the genesis of what is the current  Intel line of processors. But, uh, and it was thanks to AMD that those prices stayed low and  the power went up and now AMD is doing it again, which is great. Cause they went through as kind of  a fallow period, a few lean years. There's the term. Another Wall Street Journal story,  Anna Maria and Reata's cash plastic or hand Amazon and visions paying with a wave.  They want to put checkout terminals in brick and mortar stores that allow shoppers to link  their card information to their hands. Uh, it's not, not just a Palm reader,  but I guess these cameras are fast enough and accurate enough that a wave would be, uh, enough  Amazon's discussed the project with JP Morgan chase and company Wells Fargo, synchrony financial,  uh, enabling consumer credit card accounts to work with  hand terminals. It's interesting. They have a patent for a non-contact biometric identification  system. The only problem I have with this is the same problem we talked about with face recognition  and fingerprint is you can't change your hand. You can change your credit card number easily.  And if it gets compromised, no problem. You can't change your hand, your Palm print. What do you do

Transcript:  apparently the way the app, maybe they woke up at four in the morning and instead of the bill  starting installing a Wiki, they bought full self-driving. Yeah, I've done that. Who hasn't?  Um, let's see. Sim swapping. Did you see this CD net article? Now I've seen some people  poopoo this, but, uh, this was a Princeton study in which they, uh, bought, uh, prepaid mobile,  cards, services, uh, testing five major U S providers to see if they could trick the humans  at the call center into changing a user's phone number to another SIM without providing proper  credentials. According to the team, AT&T, T-Mobile, TrackPhone, U S mobile and Verizon,  I don't know where sprint is in this, but everybody, but sprint were found to be using  vulnerable procedures with their customer support centers. For instance, and here's the,  here's the flow. Uh, you call up the CSR, you say, I'm a victim and I need, you know, and I need a  SIM swap on my account. They say, okay, what's your pin number? You give them a pin number,  one, two, three, four. They say, no, that's not your pin number. Oh, crud. Did I write that down  wrong? I'm sorry. I must've screwed up. Okay. No problem. Says the customer service representative.  Can you tell me two numbers you've dialed on your phone recently? This is literally how they do  that. Uh, you can provide those numbers perhaps because, you know, you tricked somebody into  dialing numbers. In some cases, they even ask you, can you tell me two inbound calls you received?  That's really easy. And then, uh, they say, oh, that is you or billing information, a lot of stuff  that isn't really that secure. And then they say, oh, that is you. Yeah. Well, we'll, we'll swap that  SIM for you, which is why you don't ever want to use a SMS for two factors. When providing incorrect  answers to personal questions like date of birth or billing zip code, research assistants would  explain, oh, I've been careless at signup. Uh, I can't recall the information. These call center  operators are required based on their procedures to move to another mechanism. In some cases,  they, they would ask, they would say, what's, what's, uh, what's a, uh, a date of your last bill?  And if you get it a little wrong, they say, no, no, it's, uh, it's you're getting warm,  warmer, no colder. They're helpful. They're helpful. They want to help you. The problem is they also  help the bad guy. So, uh, this was a, this was not surprising to me, but just a little word of warning.  Um, it's, it's pretty easy to do. Cause they don't want to be yelled at. They're so, they're service.  That's right. Customer service representatives. They're trying to serve you.

Cause I'd been at the company since before they'd implemented  them on the same account and hadn't changed my plan. And it led to a long and, you know, it was  just odd, you know, it's just takes time. Uh, but social engineering people have a funny habit of  finding a way to making this happen.

Now Joe Biden is going after it. Joe did an interview with the  New York Times editorial board. There's a very long detailed transcript. In much of it, I was  impressed by his command of the issues and his thoughtful suggestions and policies. But then as  you get down towards the bottom, they start talking about Facebook, Cambridge Analytica,  and the problems that Facebook potentially is creating by allowing candidates to lie  in political ads on Facebook. Charlie Wartzel asks,  are you worried about the future of the United States? I'm not worried about the future of the  in political ads on Facebook. Charlie Wartzel asks, in October your campaign sent a letter  to Facebook regarding an ad that falsely claimed you blackmailed Ukrainian officials  to not investigate your son. I'm curious, did that experience dealing with Facebook and their power,  did that change the way you see the power of tech platforms right now? He says,  Biden, I've never been a fan of Facebook, as you probably know. I've never been a big Zuckerberg  fan. I think he's a real problem. He knows better. From my perspective, I'm of the view that not only  should we be worrying about the concentration of power, we should worry about the lack of privacy  and, and this is where it starts to get a little problematic for me, them being exempt.  The New York Times is an exempt. You can't write something you know to be false and an  exempt from being sued, but he can. Mark Zuckerberg can. But he didn't write it. He didn't write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not what 230 is all about. 230. The last sentence says the discourse will be improved if  we all take a moment to actually read the text of CDA 230. Well, maybe we should start with  Joe Biden reading the text. This really worries me. He clearly doesn't understand it. He says,

Start time: 7239.88
End time: 7326.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's effectively saying that whatever appears on Facebook is the responsibility of Mark Zuckerberg  and Facebook. They're a publisher and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act says online  platforms aren't held liable for things their users post on them. Any more than the phone company  is held liable for the conversation you have on the phone. That is really important to protecting  the internet. If, if for instance, I'm responsible for anything anybody says on our forums or in our  chat room or in a twit.social mastodon, I'm going to take them all down because I can't,  I can't be held responsible for it. I'm not. It's people can, it's an open forum and it's impossible  to moderate that. Imagine now multiply that times one and a half billion users. It's, it's, what he's  saying is, Charlie responds, that's a pretty foundational law of the modern internet. That's  right, says Biden, exactly right and it should be revoked. It should be revoked because it's  not merely an internet company. It's propagating falsehoods they know to be false and we should be  setting standards like the Europeans do with privacy. Boy, I hope somebody maybe a little bit  hipper, a little bit younger, maybe somebody who's read the Section 230. He was, he was in the Senate

Start time: 7327.10

Start time: 7332.66
End time: 7396.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on. I know I understand his ire, but honestly, this is, this is much more complex than that.  He compares, you know, he talks about the Luddites. He does say something interesting. He says,  you know, tech tech things happen, technology comes along, create, you know, every industrial  revolution, every major technological breakthrough, every single one. He says there's an arrogance  he says we're in the fourth technological revolution, the hardest speech I've ever had to  make. I've asked to speak at the World Economic Forum and he says every other revolution we've  had technologically, it's taken somewhere between six years at this. I don't agree disagree with  between six years in a generation for government to come in and level the playing field again.  Remember the Luddites smashing the machinery in the Midlands. That was their answer when the  culture was changing. Same thing with television, same thing before that with radio, same thing,  but this is gigantic and it's a responsibility of government to make sure it's not abused.  I don't disagree with that, but it starts by reading CDA 230 and understanding why it's so

Start time: 7396.34
End time: 7443.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  important. Right. And, you know, I think that the answer, you know, not that there necessarily is  an answer, but to a degree there is one, is not repealing 230. But, you know, I mean, what,  what is the real issue here? The issue is that it's trying to manage this content,  trying to moderate this content, cannot possibly scale up to something the size of Facebook or  YouTube or any of these other major platforms. You know, the problem is these platforms have  simply gotten too big. We've allowed them to grow out of control and there's no way that we can  manage that. And, you know, I think we need to start moving away from these enormous platforms  and start getting back to smaller, more constrained platforms. That's why we have a

Start time: 7443.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Historically, we have not, for instance, regulated that in broadcast because what you don't want to do  is put the broadcasters or the FCC in the position of determining what is truth and what is false.  Because then there is, you know, that there's issues. It's not always the case that you could  say, well, that's a lie. And so what you don't want is government to say, okay, it's up to you,  Mark Zuckerberg, to prevent lies on your platform. That actually gives them an immense amount of  power. And so we don't regulate that in the United States. I don't know what they do in Canada,

Start time: 7507.62
End time: 7534.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but the US, we don't regulate that in broadcast. You see, the only thing is that my thought is  that if you know, Citizens United and companies or people, if you can, you know, someone else,  if you put up a lie about me and I could sue you personally for libel because you wrote something  that I could prove under a court of law was a lie and the court said so, then you should be able to  do that the same way with a company, which may make companies more careful about what they place up

Because if you try each one of these, those trials will end in a year  or two, by which time 25,000 ads have appeared in the meantime and the election's over. So that's  too slow a means.

Sonos, which is suing Google saying you stole our technology,  testified that, you know, there's abuse in the marketplace. Tile said, oh man, Apple,  Apple put, find my iPhone into the iPhone, largely mimicking what we do. And then in their app store  said, oh, you can't collect any information. That location data, that's anti-competitive.  See, this happened in Europe too, where you get smaller companies going after Google, for instance,  and using the regulators to in effect tilt the market in their direction. So I worry that it can  go both ways. This is difficult, isn't it? This is that double edged sword. I knew this would be the  theme for today. We are going to see there, the Supreme Court has agreed to take the Apple store  case. So that will be very interesting. You know what? I've kept you here long enough.  I think it's time to, on that note, to say thank you. Patrick is in an unknown location.

Transcript:  I'm in Salt Lake City. Really? Is that where you're going to move? Are you moving there or  just visiting? We are traveling through here on our way to Rapid City and then we are swinging  back around. Where we could end up in St. Louis. So you don't have a destination. We are, we are  exploring and figuring out where we move next. You're a family on the move. Are you all stuck  in an RV? What's going on? Well, we were stuck in an Airstream and now we are stuck in a somewhat  larger and somewhat warmer Creekside, which is an outdoors RV, four season trailer. What happened  to the Airstreamer? It turns out when you take two adults, a seven-year-old, a 12-year-old, and a  Husky, suddenly an Airstream, you know, 76 Airstream Sovereign seems so much smaller than it  did. But it's so cute, isn't it? You know, it is, it is aesthetically, it is a design icon. It is a  magnificently constructed beast. It is too damn small for my relationship with my wife and my  children and the dog to survive all of us in there in Coldwell. I had no idea you were doing this,  Patrick. How long has this hegera been going on? You know, let's just say a couple months and leave

We're homeschooling. Oh, well, Sarah's a very smart person. So,
