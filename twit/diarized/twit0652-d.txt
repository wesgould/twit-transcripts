Start time: 628.96
End time: 678.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  million right? Expensive. I'll be curious what the day after stuff is. I feel like  so this I feel like is the turning point of going online to watch the ads before  they're on the Super Bowl. I just think so many companies have realized doing  the banned ad and getting those up online beforehand. I know I've already  seen Danny DeVito smothered in chocolate on the internet. I know I've seen Sprint's  attempt to make a cyborgish thing that makes Sprint seem cool. You know these  things come out already. I don't need to watch the most obvious lopsided Super  Bowl to come. Correct me if I'm wrong future to see these ads. So I'll be  curious that's what I think is gonna be the interesting fallout is how many  people just rush to YouTube instead of watching the Super Bowl especially if  people don't care about you know East Coast versus East Coast. By the time this

Start time: 707.84
End time: 729.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Super Bowl 52 this is from ad age wix.com website right? They're competing  directly against our former sponsor Squarespace.com. Squarespace has hired  Keanu Reeves. Squarespace told us that it was too much too much to advertise on  Twitch so they're spending what must be upwards of five million dollars on one

Start time: 729.90
End time: 743.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ad on the Super Bowl given Keanu's fee. Quick thing about Wix if I may I believe  that was the URL of Windows magazine's social network or message board. And then they  got it? Yeah because that was closed in like 2000 or something like that.

Start time: 744.30
End time: 772.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wix will save money instead of getting Keanu Reeves for their ad they've got  Rhett and Link. Actually Rhett and Link might be more nowadays might be more  expensive than Keanu Reeves. In 2017 they had Jason Statham and Gal Gadot. Nice.  Before she blew up. Yeah. She's the best. Oh she is Wonder Woman right? Yeah. Still  haven't seen that. HBO time. What? I know.

It's their first Super Bowl ads in three years. You should just play one of your ads.  Yeah I know they just have me do that one. 60 seconds of you talking. You'll do it for five million  dollars. T-Mobile bought a minute. Sprint bought two 15s both featuring Evelyn a  robot. I'll be looking for that. Wendy's actually I'm looking if there's one there's a rap battle.  Hmm. Between Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones. That's a good ad. Versus Morgan Freeman right?  Yeah. Who's that for? It's Doritos and Mountain Dew. Oh I was just testing you to see because  sometimes these great ads you remember the ad and you have no idea what it was an ad for. Yeah I know  it's a good one. I really love that one. Amazon's gonna buy an echo ad series of echo ads.

Start time: 842.98
End time: 848.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Including? It's gonna set off every echo in the nation I'm sure. No because we found out how they do it.

Start time: 848.90
End time: 899.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. They actually I thought they were doing like an audible tone or something over the  a word when they did it because we can't say the a word because it will trigger your echo. Right.  But we have to try this. We're gonna try this in editing. They take out they notch the frequencies  between I think was three and six thousand kilohertz which is enough to I'm not sure if they've taught  the echo just ignore it if you don't hear it or it's right where the human voice is or it's just  it's for somehow it's modifying it sufficiently that it will not they say trigger echoes and then  they don't not only is it a bad PR you know black mark right they don't want to trigger  echoes because imagine there's a hundred more than a hundred million people watching a hundred  million simultaneous requests Amazon servers. Yeah. That'd be good. And you're suddenly not

Start time: 904.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be a genius it'd be a genius promotion if they just had something where if you had a device and  the buzz phrase played and then everyone got a coupon like that to me would be an amazing  combination stress test and promotional. Here's my question. That one for free guys. Yeah. Here's

Start time: 919.34
End time: 931.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my question. Are they able to tell who's watching the ad because because if you are a subscriber  of course they have an echo they know exactly who you are. You think Amazon is interested in

Start time: 932.06
End time: 962.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  personal data of how you live. They just are. I'll tell you why I don't believe they actually do  that because they would have to stream that data back to Amazon right now the way the echo and all  these devices work. They're not they're not communicating with a home office. They're just  listening for a trigger word to match in their internal memory. Right. And then anything said  after the trigger word gets sent back. Right. In order for them to know that you saw that ad they'd  have to actually be listening all the time. That would be so controversial. Well they do a lot of

Start time: 962.86
End time: 972.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  controversial things. Well yeah who knows what's in that EULA in terms of what it can and cannot  pick up. I mean let's go scrolling through that. Yeah. Remember the Fire Phone. So the Fire Phone

But they the single button turned on the camera the audio the everything.  So if you were taking a picture of something it sent the audio. Right. Some number of seconds. Boy  another reason not to get that phone. Right. Well but I mean the point is they didn't announce that.  We had to figure that out. And so we don't know what they're doing. What we do know is there's  a hundred percent certainty that they could do that very easily. Whether they would choose to

Start time: 1003.84
End time: 1013.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not do that. But they could do that. This ad looks trivial. This ad was a 90 second ad in the fourth  quarter. So that's got to be like that's a lot of money. Right. Well they made a lot of money last

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tiffany Haddish bandwagon. So the best the best story of this all though is TiVo. TiVo announced.  You know they have a feature which I actually really love when you TiVo when you DVR something  on your TiVo. Not all shows but some shows. Jeopardy is one of them. You can press the D  button when a commercial comes on it skips to the end of the commercial. I'm sure I don't know  how they get away with this. This is what put replay tv out of business right. The networks  sued them killed them. That's interesting. Somehow TiVo gets to do this so you press the D button and  it'll say you know you can skip commercials but it's not on every show so I feel like almost like  they're getting permission. Yeah. Or something. Yeah maybe they're paying for it. Yeah so they  announced we're going to do the opposite on the Super Bowl. We're going to let you skip the game.  Ha brilliant. And go right to the commercial. Brilliant. I love it. I think that's going to  get some real use. I'm TiVoing it. Although they've spoiled it really because you can see  almost all there are only a few companies that just don't say anything about their ads ahead of

Transcript:  Super Bowl. I'll tell you though the thing that bums me out about this Super Bowl still no 4k.  We're in 2018. When will any professional sports league step it up and say hey internet connected  world here's a higher resolution brand new spanking cameras get you close to the game.  The NFL has had a real problem with viewership numbers for the past year plus with every  different controversy in the mix. Why have they not turned to technology so that when you see  those Best Buy commercials for get the TV for the big game and then it's the big game is barely in  1080p resolution. Sometimes it's only 1080i depending on your provider and all that.  I don't understand. I've looked everywhere for someone to talk about this and I maybe I'm the  only person who cares since I have a perfectly nice high pixel TV. But how do they not make this  happen. Why is this not the story for at least us super geeks. I could come up with a couple of

Start time: 1526.70
End time: 1543.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  reasons. First of they don't shoot it in 4k. They should they have upgraded the fleet of cameras.  They do about this. So they can't they are shooting in 4d 4k. They have they have 8k cameras down.  Those 8k cameras they don't use as 8k cameras. They zoom they use them so that they can selectively

Start time: 1543.54
End time: 1554.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  zoom in. Yeah right right. But they have that stuff so 8k can zoom in but that's still you've  got 4k sort of as a possibility. Remember the say in nbc cannot broadcast in 4k. No there are no

Start time: 1554.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1565.60
End time: 1570.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1582.16
End time: 1603.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  live. Yeah yeah none of the the whole broadcasting over the airspec has to be upgraded but I still  just feel like that that's the one confluence of all these media companies joining forces with all  these internet service providers that I would like to see is them all at least combine forces and give  you some internet sports 4k-ness. So I'm just throwing that out there. This is though what we

Transcript:  see all the time which is you have an incumbent you have the nfl you have incumbent networks there's  a lot of money here. They they really are careful of the franchise. Remember Verizon had an exclusive  for a couple of years where if you had a Verizon phone you could watch the the Super Bowl on your  Verizon phone. This year there is more streaming. I can watch it on YouTube TV. Right. I imagine  Hulu and Sling and PlayStation view. I would imagine that if you have locals you'd be able  to watch the Super Bowl on those. So there are more streaming. That's what we're watching it on.

There's pyrotechnics. They're on different sets like it's the production value of it not to mention  the cost of having an ad agency create these things that you're you're paying them to do. I mean  at minimum I'd imagine a 30 second spot if you're paying five million dollars for it  you're going to want to go all in. Sure.

Well that's why it's I'm so curious  as to why they stopped just being secretive about it and then airing them the day of because  because that's a thing you would talk about the next day at the office. Oh but this way you're  talking about it for all week long and the week before. I guess but do you feel like if it comes  out on Wednesday before the Super Bowl it's kind of old news considering how fast the news cycle  is on the internet at this point like like we've all seen it. You put it out on Wednesday like

Start time: 1882.60
End time: 1906.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we've seen it it's over. Yeah I think ultimately there's a sense of global impact especially when  you're talking about Doritos Mountain Dew these global brands so you know getting something out  there and having that talked about all over the world spread across YouTube and every domain and  every Chinese video provider etc etc etc. My guess is there's a bazillion pounds of data that tells  these companies exactly when and how to drop these ads. I think you have to point to YouTube as a big

Start time: 1907.04
End time: 1941.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  factor in this because I don't know we should look at the YouTube viewer numbers but probably  100 million 200 million 300 million probably over the week that it's on you big and and even though  millions anyway we know that some of those numbers I don't know YouTube numbers seem  slightly inflated maybe it's one 14 year old and in Bloomington watching it a hundred thousand times  I don't know but but to an ad agency or to a big brand they they think of those as comparable to  the number of people watching the Super Bowl so there really is the numbers the numbers you get

Transcript:  was he stunned miss amashkovich i the thing about this quarterly uh release that was an interesting  takeaway was that amazon have predicted an operating income of a certain amount of up to i can't  remember the exact number but they exceeded their own estimate for how much money they were going  to make this past quarter by 69 like their top end estimate they exceeded and they don't say exactly  why except there's one quote from bezos saying yeah our echo devices are doing well and when  you look at the uh the number the the way that they describe all the stuff there's so much  so many little bullet points in the release but the big one uh there were two that i noticed was  one that echo sold tens of millions of units in the past year and then they pointed out that  their kindles took 11 years to sell quote unquote tens of millions so it sounds like they're not  saying exactly but that in about a year that the echo line is essentially getting to that kindle  level of saturation which is insane but just and i think the dot is the real driver they essentially  said it's 30 bucks this thing the speaker is good enough that's what the review said and that's what  i found is the speaker is good enough you can plug it into one of your spare ones in a pinch if you  want to listen to music but if you just want to dip your toe in so there's that half of it and  everybody is creating skills there are so many companies that are making these skills that are  so easy to get running you can just say a phrase that your echo doesn't support and it'll boop boop  search for that skill install it for you and tell you about it on your app and people are really  embracing this whether you're playing jeopardy on the thing or playing with some of these games or  weird radio show things or using company specific alexa voice skills it's happening and that really  matters and i'm really sorry i actually just turned my own device on by breaking our rule sorry about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the way that these i mean i picked around and tried to move little things around and all that  whatever would be weight sensitive may very well be built in but i do believe it is more about  visual tracking and if you look at the quarterly results they talk about how they are selling this  tech to other companies for watching warehouse employees watching retail shoppers and everything  this is a a product and this is you know putting this the store is really selling other companies  on what they could get if they bought into amazon's vision of tracking customers i know

Start time: 6758.12
End time: 6781.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they're at least their earlier version did have scales they may have changed it  but the point is that they're integrating all this thing and i i agree with you  i think that there are people who are double checking things behind the scenes that was the  case with facebook's m anything that's super magic ai where money's involved they always have a staff  of like 20 000 people like sorting through and making sure you see people in the store sam i mean

Transcript:  like employees i mean the the whole place has people walking around with their own little  tablets checking inventory moving products around so you look attractive there's also  a giant window with a kitchen as you walk to the store it's as if amazon is saying we haven't  replaced workers we're just having them do things for you such as make fresh food things more  interesting frankly than just having you know instead of having a cashier instead of having  that weight process because yeah it is for those who don't know you scan a phone walk in buy things  and then you don't even scan anything on the way out you just leave and then 10 minutes to an hour  and 20 minutes later based on my experience you'll get the thing that tells you exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i don't i feel like kind of icky about this and i think the reason why is because i think about  um a company like amazon who has traditionally not treated its workers super well um did i lose  everybody no we're still no no we're less yeah we're no um we're fascinated we're wrapped just  got cut like really hard it was really weird i can hear a pin drop but like amazon is a company that  traditionally has not treated its employees very well and and there are rumors that we see all the  time every year at least a quarter every you know quarter or six months we see these stories come  out of even in executive levels of management and things like that there's people saying that the  turnover is very high there's so much churn happening at amazon and so i really it's one of  those things where i feel like obviously no one is going to be a disruptor in the way of our  government here in the united states like i don't see that happening for a long time so so some  disruption is great like and i think in that way i'm glad amazon is you know stepping forward and  saying like we want to disrupt the space because it does need disruption it needs to be pulled  forward into the 21st century but on that same note i i just there's just so many ways that it  if you think about like the worst case scenario it just seems so or well can i piggyback on this

Transcript:  bezos's brain and i'm thinking he it's these things are distractions for him he has he clearly has a  vision of some kind to get a skim of all the economic activity okay maybe that's it  maybe he is totally driven by money but i think you i i think it would be a mistake to say well  because they're not philanthropic they don't they're not humanitarian i just think that jeff at this  point thinks the most humanitarian thing he could do is to focus and move forward with whatever this  vision is ben i think makes a really good case that what you're seeing here is a disruption  of a post-world war two economic system not just in health care but in general  and that the institutions don't just slowly one by one fall like 10 pins but instead the edifice  gets hollowed out from the inside it seems to be standing and then when it collapses it collapses  far quicker than anyone expected and it but what it takes is a lot of patience and and somebody  who's willing to say oh i thought we'd have put publishers out of business by now i you know this  is taking too long no somebody's got a really long-term vision jeff is undeniably very smart  about how he's going about this and doing it not that he doesn't make mistakes but he's it's it's  planned it's thoughtful yeah right right and i i think you shouldn't assume he's anti-humanitarian  i feel like he probably is fairly progressive but he just don't well this is not my mission right  now somebody else can do the charitable work we'll have plenty of time for that later bill gates  famously said that he said i'm not going to do charity until i can devote enough time to do it  right look at mark zuckerberg giving millions to newark just throwing it away gates once he was  retired did focus entirely on a charity but you might have said years ago all bill gates he's not  a humanitarian i i don't think that you should tar him with that brush i do think there's something  going on in and i think jeff bezos is somebody very interesting at least as interesting as  you know steve jobs was or tim cook or or even elon musk and in the same way as steve jobs steve
