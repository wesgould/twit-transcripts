It's time for TWIT, This Week in Tech, the show that covers the tech news of the  week and actually we're a little late.  Because we should have had this guy on last week, Jeff Kanata from the  Totally Rad Show.  Hey, glad to be back. This is awesome. Yeah, last week of course was E3, but I  wanted to give you time to play Duke Nukem forever.  You would want to punish me like that? I wanted to give you enough time to give us a  review.  We'll talk about that in a little bit, but I also want to introduce panelist number two,  Miss Molly Wood. So nice to have you.  It's good to be back. I missed you. We haven't had you on in a year, I think.  Something like that, yeah. That's crazy time. That was the court mandated cooling off period.

Start time: 142.36
End time: 144.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we worked it out. We had our drinks. It's good now.

Start time: 147.16
End time: 158.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So nice to see you, Molly, of course on CNET TV at CNETtv.com. The hosts of Buzz Out Loud and  many other fine things at CBS. They have a big shake up at CBS Interactive. I'm going to ask you about that.  Mr. Farber's back.

Start time: 160.14
End time: 165.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Farber's back. I like that. I'm not my boss though. I don't have that much to say about it. I like Dan. I'm a big fan, but

Start time: 165.32
End time: 205.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll ask you about that. What do you think it means? There's a new boss in town from  Click.tv, I think.  Clicker.  Also here, Mr. Paris Lemon himself.  MG Siegler not as some in the chat room would have it MG Lane.  I can go by that. You want to? I'll change it. Yeah, nice to have you, MG.  MG is probably the most prolific blogger there is at TechCrunch.com.  Wrote a great blog post today  likening  Facebook to  the victims of Sparta.

Start time: 206.60
End time: 208.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's been fun

Start time: 209.08
End time: 224.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dealing with ramifications of that. His headline, Tonight We Dine in Hell.  So, if I may paraphrase, your contention was that  Facebook...  Well, first of all, you hate PR people in general.

Start time: 226.26
End time: 237.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't say that generally sweeping of a statement. I mean, I like some of them individually just fine, but  I would say as a whole that their goal is like the opposite of mine. So, yes, we're at war.

Start time: 237.82
End time: 243.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would think, in fact, that PR people would recognize that their job is to help you do your job.

Start time: 244.24
End time: 248.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I feel like though we've gotten away from that entirely pretty much.

Start time: 248.94
End time: 250.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They become advocates for their company.

Start time: 251.78
End time: 269.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not even so much that. It's like the ways that they're trying to do it. Obviously, they're going to be doing that.  That's what they're hired to do. That's what they're paid to do. But some of the manipulation stuff is not cool  that they've been kind of partaking in. And Facebook is the perfect example of that, I think, recently.

Start time: 270.42
End time: 278.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, tell me what, in your opinion... Well, of course, we know the  Burstyn Marsteller story where Facebook hired a PR firm to slime Google.

Start time: 279.46
End time: 325.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. That was a really bad situation. This latest thing is not to that level. It's just more or less...  I had a few big Facebook scoops earlier last week, two of them, with the third kind of being a third story on it.  As soon as one of those hit, Facebook kind of just went into action and got their PR team to start reaching out to other  sites, other bloggers, kind of, and saying, hey, maybe you should write this angle, which is directly opposed to what  TechCrunch had said about it. And the problem is, of course, that I'm a little bit closer to some of these other people  that Facebook is reaching out to than they may have thought for some reason. So, I get these emails sent to me,  forwarded to me, showing exactly what they're trying to spin this as.

Start time: 325.36
End time: 337.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that when that happens. When a competitor tries to slime you, thinking that another blogger might be your natural enemy,  and they go, oh, yeah, right. I am a little more friends with MG than you, you little slimeball weasel bag of scum.

Start time: 338.76
End time: 340.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. That's more or less what I tried to say.

Start time: 341.96
End time: 342.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Real subtle, Leo.

Start time: 344.62
End time: 358.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, though, this ties into Duke Nukem forever, because the PR firm for Duke Nukem forever, Jeff Kanata,  well, at least one of the head of the PR firm wasn't too happy about the bad reviews, I gather.

Start time: 359.02
End time: 367.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And unfortunately, he made it public and said...  He tweeted!  He tweeted. Which, as we've come to learn, in any context, is the wrong way to handle anything.

Start time: 367.72
End time: 372.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think he shouldn't have sent the crotch shot to the guy at Kotaku. I think that was a mistake.

Start time: 373.00
End time: 441.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little over the top. So, yeah, he said that some of the reviews, in his opinion, were over the line  and had gone over into being insulting and sort of reveling in trashing the game and was going to make it clear that  in future cases, they were going to take a different stance on who was going to get early review copies of games  based on how people reviewed this game, which, of course, is ridiculous, and 2K, to their credit, distanced themselves from him.  And unfortunately, this is a public expression of this idea of limiting access.  It's always been that way. They do it all the time.  Exactly. So one guy actually comes out and says it and he gets busted, but it's been the case for a long time.  And unfortunately, in a lot of industries, and the gaming industry is one, that PR controls access completely.  So it's a difficult thing when you want access to these games early and you want hits on your site  and you want that review to come up when the day the game drops, and you need access to that game,  and yet they're asking you to play nice. It's a tough position to be in.

Start time: 442.56
End time: 487.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the PR company is the Reddiner Group and the tweeter is...  Oh, that's interesting. He pulled the tweet down. I was going to show you the tweet.  Yeah, I wonder why. Maybe...  He says, too many went too far with their reviews of Duke Nukem.  We are reviewing who gets games next time and who doesn't based on today's Venom.  Wow. But it does happen, doesn't it? We've all seen this where a PR firm, whether  thinly veiled or not, says, well, don't count on an iPod next time, buddy boy.  Right, Molly?

Start time: 488.12
End time: 503.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. And in fact, Apple is probably the worst offender in terms of playing that game.  Well, the worst offender on the tech side, the video game industry, I think it's long been an  open secret that the video game industry works on that system more than most.

Start time: 505.12
End time: 532.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the thing that's really a shame about the video game industry is how much review scores  are tied into compensation on the production side. I mean, you have guys whose contracts have  bonuses based on Metacritic scores, which is absolutely ridiculous to me. I mean,  I understand the motivation to try to make better games, but when you have that much emphasis put  on a number that's assigned by anybody on the web, really, you're going to get these conflicts  of interests. It's not going to happen.

Start time: 532.72
End time: 544.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems like a bad idea. Yeah, that's too bad.  It happens all the time.  I stay away from PR people. I know, like you, MG, I know a lot of nice PR people. Most of them are  very nice people.

Start time: 545.30
End time: 559.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, on an individual basis, of course, they're not evil people setting out to do,  to screw over other people. I just think that this is like the directive coming down from  their bosses and that's what they want them to do. So they're doing it.

Start time: 560.50
End time: 578.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I've always felt like it should be an adversarial situation. I never, I see you're,  I think you're in a different position because I don't know, I don't actually deal with facts.  That's helpful.  So it's easy for me. I don't really, I don't need anything from them.

Start time: 581.29
End time: 588.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really, it's the only way to go. Like, you know what? No, I'm not interested in your product  unless I can find something really kind of snotty to say about it on my show.

Start time: 588.82
End time: 606.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't say that either, but I just, to me, I just want to use, I don't want to deal with them.  I'll buy the product. I just want to use the product and I'll tell you what I think of it.  Period. That's end of that. And see, you did, for instance, MG, you opened the can of worms  because when you wrote about this new Facebook, was it the Sparta project?

Start time: 607.36
End time: 608.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Project Spartan.

Start time: 608.52
End time: 614.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Project Spartan. You see, you went to Facebook PR and offered them a chance to comment.

Start time: 615.16
End time: 616.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. Of course. Yeah.

Start time: 617.08
End time: 619.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like journalism. I don't understand that.

Start time: 620.98
End time: 637.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, sometimes we do that, sometimes we don't. I don't know. But this seems like a  natural thing. I mean, you know, I knew a lot about it. I had some access to it. And so I wanted to  see if they wanted to say something about it and they had nothing to say. So I published what I was  going to publish in the first place. And then they get all mad, you know, that I publish that.

Start time: 638.82
End time: 648.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they can get mad. What are they going to do? Actually, what they could do is they could embed  something in the Facebook code that makes it impossible for TechCrunch writers to see what's

Start time: 648.28
End time: 673.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  going on. So they already do that, actually. I mean, they literally have that feature and  they've joked about it. We posted a few weeks ago, we posted a video, a tech talk that they did at  their headquarters. Basically, they have a anyone but TechCrunch can see this little switch that  they can flip. The problem is this was this was totally outside of that. This wasn't live code  that I saw. This is, you know, behind a few different levels. It does sound like there might

Start time: 673.38
End time: 678.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be a little shooting war though between Facebook and TechCrunch. Just a little. Yeah, well, yeah.

Start time: 678.96
End time: 704.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't know if you remember the story, probably from like two years ago, I guess now,  they actually put a feature in the site. Yeah, Facebook facts. And we wrote about it. And it's  like, what is this feature? Like, who on earth is going to fax anything? It turns out this was just  a feature that they turned on for the TechCrunch network of employees right there. So we could all  see it. No one else could see it. And then, yeah, they had they had their fun with that one. So we

Start time: 705.02
End time: 759.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  owed them. You know, the truth is, I think is always gone on when when a president, no, actually  campaign, a campaigner, Richard Nixon, hired admin to run his campaign and and the Democrats  hired a guy named Dick Tuck to be a dirty trickster in the 1968 campaign. And he did things  like remember Nixon's campaign slogan was Nixon's the one. And Dick Tuck mentions this he was a  PR and ad guy mentions this in his in his memoir, he got a bunch of pregnant women to meet Richard  Nixon as he was whistle stopping with a sign Nixon's the one over their pregnant bellies. And  you know, they got a good laugh. Right. This has gone on for a long time. This is this is the dirty  tricks side of PR. Of course, of course. So I what are we going to do? What are we going to  complain about? Do you have Jeff? Have you ever been bit by this? You know, not not too much. I'm

Start time: 759.82
End time: 781.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like you. I'm not really a journalist. I'm pundits. Pundits. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I come on and say  my opinion and it's my opinion and no one controls it. And they can take it or leave it as far as I'm  concerned. But, you know, it is nice when you get access, you get that early scoop on stuff. I'm  just not willing to compromise anything. And I don't you know, obviously, nobody's going to

Start time: 781.78
End time: 788.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cop to that. But I don't even do embargoes. Do you do embargoes, Molly or NDAs? I guess you have to.

Start time: 790.16
End time: 838.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't usually personally, I think we've maybe agreed to one or two over the course of Buzz  Out Loud, obviously, news.com does. I mean, I can see why the PR people of the world and PR agencies  of the world are getting increasingly desperate because they cannot figure out a way to handle  the leaks. Right. I mean, the entire landscape has changed. They used to have at least a modicum  of control. That's a good point. It would be kind of surprising when there was a big like supply chain  leak. But now you just, you know, even Apple cannot legitimately keep something secret forever.  And I think they just it's kind of like dealing with a two year old. Like you just don't know  how to handle it. So you get madder and madder and madder and scream at them and scream at them.  And obviously, that's never going to work. They have to really respond to the fact that their  jobs are not the same as they used to be. That's a really good point. Partly that's because,

Start time: 839.02
End time: 855.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, it's all because of the internet, but there's so many bloggers, there's so many people  digging, and all it takes is one, you know, leak and boom, it's all out there. But this is good for,  frankly, it's good for the end users because we have more information and we can't be spun as

Start time: 855.28
End time: 877.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  easily. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, they really, they're just going to have to wake up to the  fact that we're going to get this information. We're going to publish it because why wouldn't we?  And that ultimately is good for consumers because the system of sort of control and,  you know, controlled release was always about media manipulation at its core anyway. Like,  I'm sorry PR world that we're not as easily manipulated as we used to be other than by Apple,

Start time: 878.30
End time: 897.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's a new world. Yeah, I consider it a badge of honor that I no longer get invited to Apple  events. It doesn't bother me. And we're able to cover it. It doesn't affect our coverage really.  I just thought it was interesting, the kind of open bickering now between journalists and PR.

Start time: 898.24
End time: 909.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you're fighting a good fight. I like it. It'll get much worse too. This is just, this is step  one of something that's going to continue to snowball into, you know, every publication.

Start time: 909.30
End time: 912.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the repercussions then of your article today? Have you?

Start time: 913.40
End time: 926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From them? I haven't heard a peep from them. I've heard a peep from every single other company,  I think, for everything from Bravo to, wow, you were really kind of harsh, those kind of things.  But I haven't heard a peep from them and I don't expect to. I mean, if they know how to get in

Start time: 926.12
End time: 947.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  touch with me if they want to, but I don't know. We'll see. In some ways, it's also the disadvantage  of writing for such a high profile publication or being on such a high profile show or, you know,  you know, I kind of like being in the backwater. I don't want the attention. I don't want them to  know what I'm saying. And every once in a while I get like, I'll get a...

Start time: 948.00
End time: 950.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're really in the backwater. No, I am. No, no, no, no. So far,

Start time: 951.40
End time: 992.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nobody knows we exist and I think that's good. I want to keep it up. Seriously, I'm not kidding.  Every once in a while, I'll get an email from somebody saying, hey, I heard what you said.  And I'm always shocked. And I think that it mostly comes from, because we have this tight-knit group  of listeners and viewers and they're kind of, it's insular, they're kind of insulated.  But they tweet about it or it's, you know, some of them are tattletales and they will go tell  somebody. And that's when I know, you know. Here's us casting a major, making a major stroke for  authenticity. Apparently, President Obama is going to actually tweet.

Start time: 994.38
End time: 1001.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? Do we think that's actually going to be him?  Oh, come on. His first tweet was today, right? His Father's Day tweet.

Start time: 1001.22
End time: 1004.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1005.48
End time: 1006.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's check and make. You're absolutely right.

Start time: 1006.88
End time: 1009.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should they reconsider signing it B.O. no matter what?

Start time: 1011.66
End time: 1024.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Hussein. I just can't wait until Barack starts having hashtags on stuff, you know,  like getting in with all the memes. So Barack is weighing in on all the pressuring issues on

Start time: 1024.88
End time: 1055.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter. How do you know if the first lady is macking on you?  So he said, so I'm looking now on his Twitter account. There it is. It's got the big B.O. on it.  Being a father is sometimes my hardest, but always my most rewarding job. Happy father.  I don't know. What does that mean when he tweeted it? Did he like dictate it to a secretary who then  went down the hall to the official social media consultant for the, I mean, seriously, what does  that mean? Does he, he's not typing it into his BlackBerry. I'll tell you.

Start time: 1055.52
End time: 1078.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I looked, I looked at the, if you look on the, the source of it, it says it's from the web.  So it wasn't sent from a BlackBerry or any kind of mobile device. I assume that these still have  to be, if not copy edited, you know, cleared for any kind of, you know, weird statement that could  be in there that could be misconstrued as something. So yeah, he probably dictates it to someone and  then it's his words and then someone tweets it for him. I just have, it's like a West Wing episode.

Start time: 1078.44
End time: 1096.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know what happens. He dictates it. They bring it down the hall to the social media expert,  who brings it down to the basement to the White House council. The White House council then vets  it and then they bring it upstairs to like some, it's somebody in the Navy who has a special typing  machine and, and, and, you know, he's like a naval officer and then he types it into the special

Start time: 1096.26
End time: 1110.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  typing machine and then it goes on the Twitter. Yeah. It's like being a father is my hardest job.  Now we don't want to go with is, we want to do sometimes is my hardest job because that would  make the constituents think that other things aren't hard. So that's true. I bet he did say that

Start time: 1112.56
End time: 1114.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet they said, can we put sometimes in there?

Start time: 1115.98
End time: 1129.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, I got to say like, I, I'm pro the authenticity argument, but I don't really  want him to have time for this. No, that's a good point. I just, I don't, I don't need,  I don't need this, you know, I need other things. Is this really the tweet we want to,

Start time: 1129.54
End time: 1140.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to read? If you've enjoyed the president's tweets, don't worry. He'll still make frequent appearances  here. It's like, no, come on, get to work, dude. Get off the Twitter.

Start time: 1143.08
End time: 1160.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the other hand, this is, this is all about his campaign, right? They're doing this now because  they're ramping it up for the 2012 election. Of course, before, you know, for the past few  years, whatever this account has been alive with 8 million plus followers. It just hasn't been him.  It's been the democratic national committee or whatever tweeting for him. So, so they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, well, maybe he hears now all of, you know, all of us saying this kind of stuff. And I think  other people are going to be putting this out there. Is it actually him tweeting?

And then it said, it's a lottery and you have to give him money and maybe you'll get to go.  I thought that was illegal. Maybe it's not in the White House.  21 million people like his Facebook page. That's a pretty big number. 21.7 million people.  Will 2012 really come down to how well you use the internet and social media? How important is  that? It was somewhat important last time.

I think you probably do  have to be part of it. And I think that Obama's done, President Obama's done a good job of,  being involved in live streamed Facebook town halls. I think that was pretty cool. Yeah.  Yeah. I mean, that's cool. And I think that's really important. And I think,  he visited Twitter headquarters for crying out loud. I think that that stuff shows  that he is of the community or he's aware of what's happening online. I don't know that it,  I mean, again, I don't know that it necessarily means he has to be tweeting. It's probably not,  it's not the worst thing ever, right? I don't want him to open himself up to attacks on, you know,  how busy he is not that he has time to tweet, but you gotta be paying attention for sure. And I  think you have to show that you're paying attention to these trends. Yeah. I think I,

So if they can manage to get an audience  that is completely unfiltered, that they have direct one-to-one communication with on either  side of the political aisle, that is something that they're going to want to take advantage of.

Every once in a while you go dark and then you come back.  I'm just maintaining my aura of mystery. Yes, I like it. The mystery woman from CBS  and MG Siegler from TechCrunch and Paris Lemon on the Twitter. Yes. Easy to remember.  Just think of Sour Lemon Eiffel Tower. Exactly. Stuck on the Eiffel Tower. Easy. Right. Perfect.  We're going to take a little tiny, little itty bitty break. You may smoke them if you've got them  panel and while you do that, I'll talk about Go To Meeting. Our good friends at Citrix have so many  good products based on their very high quality remote access back end. Go To Meeting is the one  I use more than anything and that's because unfortunately, I hate this, but as you become  a business, you got to have meetings. Gosh darn it. Who thought that up? And the worst kind of  meeting, the worst, the one you don't want to do is the conference call where you all sit on the  phone and you know the other guy's playing Tetris or harvesting his cauliflower and I just hate it.  That's why I like Go To Meeting. Go To Meeting is a great, in fact, even if it's just a conference  call, we will start it with Go To Meeting because Go To Meeting has built in a conference bridge as  well as voice over IP so you can use it on your computer with the headphones and mic on your  computer, on your iPad or you can use a telephone. And then should you need to show somebody something,  it's really easy just to fire up the, you know, say, look, look, here it is on the screen and they  can see your screen. Great for presentations, for training, for collaborating on documents  and because it's brought to you by Citrix, they've got great 24-7 support. They've got 128-bit SSL so  it's completely safe to use even in an open Wi-Fi access spot and it's just reliable, fast, easy to  set up and just great. In our calendars now, it's so funny, we don't say we're going to have a  meeting anymore. I'll get the email saying we're going to have a G2M. Okay, I know what you're  talking about. You will too when you try it free for 30 days. Go to meeting.com, click the Try It  Free button and use the offer code TWIT. G-O-T-O meeting.com, offer code TWIT.

It looks like it's felt.  Yeah, nice. Yeah, and a little tie on it. Happy Father's Day. It's so strange what they decide  to do doodles on and what they don't. You know, like IPv6 day, they didn't do anything but Les Paul's  92nd anniversary of his birth, they did something. It's like, you never know what they're going to  doodle. This one is doesn't seem to be interactive. I keep trying to make it do something. Have you  ever gotten a tie for Father's Day, Leo? Every Father's Day. You bet. He really? Yeah. How about

Transcript:  unless they get into new leadership stat. They, I mean, honestly, I don't understand why they put  their last best hope in the playbook in the first place. I think they got distracted by  a market that was, that is a little bit overblown. I mean, I think half the reason that,  you know, Android tablets aren't taking off and the iPad sales have plateaued a tiny bit is that  that's a pretty discreet market right now. Not that many people need a tablet in the first place.  And then they completely failed to articulate who on earth would need a playbook.

You could read when you  can't listen, but then it would take you to that point in the audio. Is that what you're saying?

Start time: 2089.36
End time: 2098.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 2099.24
End time: 2108.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

I will at least stop the book. Just a little nose sense. That's actually, that's why I switched back to the iPad.  Why is that? Because I knew, I knew if I ever fell asleep reading on my iPad and that fell on my face,

I don't know if this hurt the Father's Day sale of the Kindle.  For the first time ever gave the Nook their number one rating at just above the Kindle.

I mean, the reports, the few reviews  I've read of it said it works great. And Amazon absolutely has to match that very soon. Obviously,  Consumer Reports is one thing saying that this is better, but other places have been saying that  this is the absolute future of this E Ink technology. The question is, Amazon's been rumored  for some time now by the end of this year to come out with a whole slew of tablets, maybe an Android  based one. But they'll probably keep a dedicated e-reader one and they absolutely have to match

It was like worse than a  Blackberry Storm. But the new one is, I mean, that new Nook with the touchscreen E Ink screen is  fantastic. That's actually what I would get if I were upgrading right now.

I mean, I know it seems weird to borrow, although really, you know,  you're borrowing a lot of digital content when you stream it or you use any kind of subscription  service.

Transcript:  Never mind. I was going to tell a joke, but I'll leave that out. We'll be back in just a moment.  I want to talk a little bit about backing up your data. This is what you should do. You should call  your dad and say, Dad, have you backed up your data lately? I actually talked to my dad last week  and I asked him about it. Believe it or not, this is the kind of conversation. He said,  tell me about your backup strategy, Father. And he didn't have a very good one. He really didn't.  He said, well, I have this USB key and every once in a while I put it in my computer and I copy  something onto it. Dad, you need carbonite.com. I want you all to tell your dads about carbonite.com.  It's backup done right. For several reasons, it's automatic, so you don't have to think about it.  It's all the time. As long as you're online, it's backing up so you don't ever get behind.  Once you get that first backup done, you're going to always have copies of everything.  It does some nice stuff like you can always visit your data. It's available online even  before a disaster happens. You just log into your carbonite account from any computer or your  iPhone or your iPad or your Android phone or your BlackBerry and there's your stuff.  You can turn on encryption so only you can see the data. You control the pass key. And of course,  they always use 128-bit SSL, so it's always secure as your files go back and forth. And restore is  very simple. You just take a click of the mouse away. The best part is this is not expensive.  For a PC or a Mac, unlimited backup of your internal drive, everything on your laptop,  for instance, just $59 a year, 16 cents a day. And if you use my name or actually our name,  twit, when you sign up, you can get two extra months, just get 14 months for the price of 12.  So here's what you do. Go to carbonite.com and do the free two-week trial just to see if you like  it. Use the offer code twit. You don't need a credit card, just twit. After two weeks,  you decide you want it. You can continue the backup that you began with those two weeks and  extend it for 14 months for the price of 12 if you use the offer code twit carbonite. It's backup  done right. You got to back it up to get it back. So do it right with carbonite.  So the lulls go on and on and on. Sega's been hacked.  Hacker stole data. You got to wonder if this is, you know, Jeff, is this related, you think,  to the Sony hacks or do you just hackers figure let's go after all the game machines?

It's brick and mortar has been  not the preferred method from publishers for a long time now and I think that that's only  going to continue and more of these companies are having their own dedicated online services.  And it's interesting that as we get more different kinds of companies offering that kind of service  to the user, having your data with all these different companies, they're opening themselves  up to that kind of attack and where, you know, selling stuff in a brick and mortar store or  having only a few companies that you give your money to like an Amazon or whatever, they sort of  offload that responsibility to a third party. And you saw EA having this weird thing this week with  Esteem where some of their titles were having to be taken off and put back on because there's  competing sites all trying to have exclusive to games. So having more different places where  your data is stored, I think, is a liability to the companies. I mean, the companies themselves  are taking on that responsibility rather than having a storefront do it.

Last Monday, those 25,000 Bitcoins were transferred from 478 accounts on Mt. Gox.  And now Mt. Gox is admitting to a major breach and has shut down.

Start time: 2882.86
End time: 2917.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I just got an email from them about that actually.  Are you a Bitcoiner?  Yeah. Well, you know, here's the funny thing. I've been trying to ride the Bitcoin bubble  and it takes forever to like set up your Duala account and then transfer money into your Duala  account and then transfer money from your Duala account to your Mt. Gox account. And so as I'm  going through this entire process, you know, the Bitcoin crash happens and it goes from 30 to 11  and I'm like, yeah, score. And then the next thing I know, I finally get it all transferred in and I  go to log in today and I've got this, there's a note right at the front that says they've suspended  trading because it was a huge sell off. It went down to a penny.

If you  don't, there goes your money. And if somebody steals it, I guess they could steal your money.  So a little flaw. It don't mean any flaw. It's a volatile marketplace at the moment. I

So I don't know.  The Bitcoin will be back to around $17.50 per Bitcoin after we roll back all trades.  See this? Okay. I'm sorry, but that's it. All confidence is gone if they can even do that.  They're going to roll back all trades that happened this morning.

So somebody must have shown them a picture. But after looking at Silk Road,  they say, oh my God, there's drugs. And they're actually trying to ban Bitcoin. They want to ban

But otherwise, no, like today they don't have anything big that I  know of anyway, you know, that's not going to help them sell the app. But a good counter argument to  that is what I think fortune did, right? When they had supposedly that, you know, inside look in Apple  and they sold it only in their app at first. That was awesome. And you're right. That was smart.

Start time: 3500.88

And, you know, in that regard, maybe,  maybe that model works, but is that really, is that scalable, you know, to the,  to every kind of thing? I mean, this is all about getting information then of course, and then  you would have to be able to time it correctly if you had like a big exclusive story and then you  would release it first via the app or another mechanism, payment mechanism, paywall or whatever.  But I'm just not sure that there's enough of that information out there that would be,  people would be willing to pay that much for that it would scale like, you know,  too enough to make an actual business out of that model. I just find it, I just find it annoying.

And if you do have $4.99 worth of something there, then maybe it's like a  Watergate story, in which case it would be totally unconscionable and the worst sort of  journalism is to hide behind a paywall and sort of trickle it out. I mean, anything that you're  trying to trickle out is just something that you're proud of. It's kind of an ego play.  That's a good point. And nobody should have to pay for that. If you're in the business of disseminating  information, then just get it out there. That's a very good point.  I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. Speaking of what you don't like.

Transcript:  To be quite honest with you, I have not played the whole thing. I played enough of it at  preview events to know that it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. And there were enough  exciting games coming out this week that we skipped it for TRS.  Really?  Yeah, Child of Eden came out the same day and it's a pretty interesting game. But yeah, Duke is  it's sad. You know, it seems like Gearbox really wanted to make a Duke Nukem game. And I think  there's a lot of there's a lot of speculation that the next Duke Nukem game will be the game  that they wanted to make. But this one just sort of had to come out in order to get that franchise  off the ground. I think it could have been a really interesting franchise to look at in a kind of  ironic self aware way where we have this kind of anachronistic character who behaves in a way that  doesn't really fit in in modern times. You know, he's sort of that Arnold Schwarzenegger brash guy.  And this game seems to take itself very seriously and in a way that people don't really appreciate

Transcript:  there's a game that came out last year called Bulletstorm that was crass and over the top in a  similarly juvenile way. And it was really kind of funny and self aware and interesting and ironic  and I think pretty well written and could have been a similarly off putting kind of experience  but wasn't. And it's too bad that Duke Nukem, which has the sort of marquee value that  Bulletstorm did not have, was that off putting experience. Here's a child of Eden. What is this?  What is this game? It's sort of the first real hardcore game for the Kinect. It's a... So there I am.  Yeah. Yeah. And I'm touching fish. Ooh, jellyfish. Now what? There's this designer named Tetsuya  Mizuguchi and he's done a few games, one of which is called Rez, which is sort of a Dreamcast era  shooter that has a lot of geek cred. And this is kind of a spiritual successor to that. It's  an on-rails shooter where you actually can control it with the Kinect moving your hands  across targets, painting targets, and then you shoot your hand out in front of you to release  your laser beams and then you use your other hand to shoot a different kind of weapon. So  you're really playing physically with the game, but it's a shooter and it works really, really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mouth is hanging open like a dork. Yeah. The cool thing too is that it's integrated with music.  The music in the game is really created by your movements and the shooting of different targets.  So you're creating the rhythm and the beat of the music as you play, which is something that  that designer has been doing for a long time. He did Space Channel 5, which was the first dance  rhythm game, and Lumines, which was another music integrated into puzzle game. It's really,  really spectacular to watch and the Kinect integration works really well. It doesn't require  Kinect either. Oh, you don't? You can use it. No, you can play it with a controller if you

Transcript:  touch screen. What do you think? I was kind of perplexed by the messaging of their unveiling of  that device. But after I got my hands on it, I was a little more sold on the idea. It's pretty fun.  What they were showing so far are these games where you can have a solo experience on the screen  in front of you while other people are having a different experience on your television. And  for that kind of party environment, which is kind of how the Wii, the original Wii works  best as well, it's really fun. It remains to be seen how that's going to be used in just single  player experiences. Ubisoft was showing a shooter that was built for the device that, you know,  where you kind of looked through your screen to shoot and use the accelerometer and gyroscope to  aim. And I don't think that's going to be a sustainable application for the tech. But  it'll be interesting to see what other kind of weird things they have in mind for this device.  It really is the DS for the home. You know, you have this. Well, that's what it reminded me is  of the DS because you had two screens. Yeah. I think there's going to be a lot of DS games that  will be ported into HD and turned that kind of experience will be translated into a bigger

Sony had a deal with the Stars channel for Netflix streaming and everybody freaked out  the other day when Sony's movies were suddenly pulled from Netflix streaming. Well, it turns out  Sony says, well, Stars reached the limit on the number of times those movies could be viewed.  So we got to revise our deal. It's crazy. It's crazy.

And I had to tell him in June  2012, you won't have a site anymore. Apple's just going to, oh yeah. Wow. Not only they're going to,  and the problem with iWeb is, you know, it's not like you can then use some other tool. You've  designed something that's completely incompatible with the rest of the world. And so what I want to  do is, and I got to call Dan and Anthony over there at Squarespace. They would do so well if they would  write an iWeb importer tool. Yeah. That's a good idea. Wouldn't that be brilliant? And you say,  look, we'll host it.

That was the price that if you were  an institutional investor, you know, you had friends in Wall Street, whatever, you could get  it for 16 bucks. Right. Opens at 20. Now, if you were smart, you sold it immediately. It closed at  $17.42. It is now down, I think, 13 bucks, something like that. It's below, it's under

Start time: 4746.78
End time: 4805.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  its opening price considerably. Right. Yeah. I mean, Pandora's been really interesting compared  to what happened to LinkedIn. LinkedIn, obviously when they IPO'd, it exploded and people were like,  oh my God, you know, this went across the board. It went from everyone saying times are great too.  This is the definite indication of another bubble happening right now. I think the Pandora thing is  actually in many ways good what's been happening because it shows that people aren't just going  crazy over this stuff right now. You know, there is actually some thinking, some sanity and some  thinking going on to the way this should be. You know, when, when Pandora first put out their S1  filing to go public, I think the initial price that they had was something like $8. And then they  upped it a little bit to 11 before finally doing the $16 price that they eventually opened with.  But so it's not like, you know, they knew too, like maybe it should be a little bit lower. And  they were just kind of reacting to, I guess, the way that the market was shaping up at the time.  But I think it's good, you know, if they stay in kind of this 10 to $20 range, which is seems

Start time: 4805.56
End time: 4838.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reasonable. What's going to happen with Groupon? I would hope that something similar happens with  Groupon actually, because they're in a little bit of a similar boat in that they have an easily  replicatable business idea that in fact they have competitors coming out of the woodworks and Spotify  ends up here within the next few weeks. Like it looks like they finally might. I can't, I'm sorry,  not Spotify. Living social is, I was going back to- Spotify's Pandora. It's literally confusing my  bubble-ish IPOs at the moment. There's so many bubbles, so little time. But you're right,

Start time: 4838.14
End time: 4850.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anybody could do a Groupon. But there is, I hear people say there's this low barrier to entry.  But one of the things you have to do and look at Groupon, you have to hire a lot of salespeople  because you've got local salespeople everywhere. I don't know if it's that low. Yes, their strength

Transcript:  I think, 7,000 sales people or something like that. That sort of feels like a web van. Like  that's just not that sustainable. Whereas if Facebook and living social with the huge Amazon  capital and then Google start to roll out these very similar services, not only do they not have  to pay to acquire users, but they have built-in sales forces. So you say that it's the barrier

Transcript:  as much of an investor hole. Right. Yeah. At the same time, I just think that a lot of,  obviously there was so much love for Groupon to begin with as this is exploding. And now there was  this huge backlash against it, of course, leading up to the IPO and all the talk about they're  losing a lot of money. I do think that there is still something to be said that these guys running  it did a pretty smart thing. They really opened this market and now everyone is trying to copy it,  of course, which is a problem. But I think that they'll, you know, they have other ideas about  what they want to do. I think one of the mistakes that they've made has been trying to so aggressively  go with this international stuff. And that's where they've been losing so much money. They're  basically break even in the United States right now, but overseas, they're losing hundreds of  millions of dollars every quarter because they're trying to expand to combat would be Chinese  replicants of the model or, you know, Japanese, whatever. So I would say stay out of the

Transcript:  there's a cultural difference. And I think we're seeing that now. I think Sarah Lacy for TechCrunch  wrote an article about this either this week or last week talking about how they're going. They  realize that they now have to kind of scale back the amount of spending that they've been doing  internationally. And hopefully they're able to do that before the IPO. So, you know, one thing that

Start time: 4978.00

Transcript:  venture. Yes, that's the other really interesting thing here. And that's what's also led to a lot  of this backlash. I mean, 96% right. People talking about it being a Ponzi scheme because,  you know, like everyone's just pouring money into this thing while the, while the founders are the  ones getting paid for this, they can take all that money off the table. They've got an interesting

And now they have to think, boy,  I think the Pandora slump might've scared them a little bit. Sure, sure. They're looking at LinkedIn  and saying, yeah, we want that. And then Pandora, oh, yeah. I mean, I still think that they have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Just last week though, or maybe the week before there was a story about how tech stocks  in general are about as low as they've been since 2002, I think. So there's some arguments we made  for the possibility that there, that some tech stocks are underpriced. I think maybe don't,  you know, don't go crazy in the IPO market, but I think there's probably some goodbyes out there  that I can't participate in. At least I'll be saved from losing my, I'm going to go ahead and  lose my shirt on the Bitcoin instead of tech stocks. So here's the good news. Geeks who use

Transcript:  social networks have more real friends. Pew, the Pew Center for studying of America and the  internet or whatever the hell it's called, surveyed 2,255 American adults last fall, found that of  1,787 internet users, 47% use a social networking service, 92% Facebook, 18% LinkedIn, Twitter, 13%,  29% MySpace. So then they asked people how they use their services. And they found that compared  to a study that they conducted two years earlier, twice as many people are using social networks as  before. And that Americans report an average of over two, just over two close friends,  which is an increase of over 2008. So that's good news. Many of us have two friends now. We only had  one in a fraction before. Those who use social networks have even more friends, 2.45 friends.  Or maybe they just think these people are their friends. That's probably it.

Who was it? I can't  remember who it was. Was it GigaOM? Somebody did a kind of asked which companies will be around  that around today will be around in 100 years. Not Instagram.

No, I don't think they'll be  around 100 years from now. Facebook maybe? Twitter? No. I don't think Facebook. I think Amazon could be.  Amazon. There you go. Google? They're going to have to reinvent themselves. Clearly search  isn't going to survive 100 years. Not as it is now. Are even companies like

It's like if this were the kind of law that  would affect your day-to-day civil liberties, right? People would be up in arms about how  absolutely ludicrous this law writing has become. And the fact that really the RIA and the MPAA are  just handing prewritten law out in whatever state they can come across. What was the one in  Tennessee? There was just something insane passed in Tennessee and the Tennessee governor was like,  I didn't really know that... Somebody told me copyright is pretty bad, so I signed this law.

Transcript:  Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John Cornyn of Texas have introduced... Now remember,  if you remember, I'm just a bill on capital... Just introducing the bill doesn't make it the law yet.  They've got a long way to go, but S978, under current law, reproducing distributed copyright  works are federal felony charges. That includes P2P transfers and web downloads, but streaming  is considered a public performance. It's not illegal. It's not a distribution. And holding  a public performance without a proper license is not a felony. This bill adds public performance  to the felony list. So now reproducing, distributing copyrighted works, or performing them,  as in lip syncing them, would be a felony facing up to five years in federal prison.

This will be the first, it will be the first show we do. But we have a wall. When you come in,  there's a wall behind the reception desk and we're putting,  letting people buy bricks to help support the studio because frankly it's very expensive.  And if you- Waterly support it, right?  Yes. It holds the wall up. Literally. Literally. So it doesn't have to say this.  It could say 15 characters, two lines on the four by eight. That's 128 bucks.  You can buy a replica suitable for throwing through windows, but don't do that because  your name's right on there. That would be kind of a giveaway. And then we have,  somewhere I have the larger, we have eight by eight. You can get your company logo on.  Anyway, go to bricks.twit.tv. It explains all of that and we do appreciate it.

There's somebody,  somebody says, one of them says a 404 brick not found. There's one, this says,  one that says press here to open wall. I like that one.
