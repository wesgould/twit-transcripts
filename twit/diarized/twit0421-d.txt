Transcript:  I just bought the OLED TV that Samsung is shipping.  Robert Heron said he wants to come up and calibrate it.  I'm going to have a calibration battle between Robert Heron and Scott Wilkinson.  It'll be like a rap battle.  Interesting. It'll be very dark.  Yeah, then go back and forth. No, that's flesh tone.  No, that's flesh tone. It will be dark.  Also, you're Jason Snell, editorial director at IDG where he runs  both Macworld and PCworld. It's good to see you.  It's great to be back. Cross platform. You're still wearing a pebble.  I can't believe it. I still have a pebble.  You haven't given up on that. I haven't given up. It's comfy.  You feel good about wearable technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you. I guess we could start with wearable technology coming up.  The IFA conference in Brazil and the big kickoff will be September 4th.  Samsung is having an event at which we knew,  we always knew they would announce the Note 3,  but now apparently Samsung executive is saying,  yes, we have a watch to show you.  The Galaxy Gear watch.  Does anybody know anything about the gear?

Start time: 243.48
End time: 287.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The pictures we've seen make it look gigantic.  It looks kind of like a slave bracelet. OK, yeah.  It does, yes. And they were shown on an unfortunately thin wrist,  which makes it look like this giant clasp, you know, like handcuffs almost.  It looks like it's pretty big.  Hopefully it's just that that's a very small wrist that they pictured on in those press photos.  But it does look to be a pretty big thing.  It's got I think we've heard of the three or four gigs of storage.  It's going to have an OLED screen on it.  It's going to be running Android, of course, and there'll be definitely a big health focus.  But the question is how much functionality it'll have beyond health focus.  I mean, there's definitely a big opportunity for going after things like the Fitbit.  But certainly it needs to be a little bit more than that,  I think, to really be successful.  So I'm definitely eager to see what Samsung announces when it comes to functionality here this week.

Start time: 288.58
End time: 311.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not going to have a flexible screen, according to Li Yonghe,  executive vice president of Samsung Mobile.  She did confirm that they would show it, but it does not have a flexible screen.  That that kind of limits it. You can't have too big of a display if it's not flexible.  You know, you don't want an iPhone strapped to your wrist.  Or do you? Or do you?  Do you do you think this will be a standalone device or will it require a Galaxy phone?

Start time: 313.18
End time: 341.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm hopeful that it'll be more standalone than now,  but I don't think it'll have any kind of a wireless connection.  I don't think I'll have a 3G mode emitter or anything like that.  So I'm guessing that it will have to tether to your smartphone in order to pull down data  if you want to get, you know, any sort of web connection or do any Skyping or anything like that.  I'd be very surprised if it had any kind of 3G connection within it.  But hopefully it is a fairly independent device.  You know, it'd be great if it had GPS in it so we could track you run or do that kind of thing  without having to have your phone along, too.  But that's definitely one of the bigger questions that I have going into this week.

Start time: 341.22
End time: 349.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And are we ready for people taking pictures like this and, you know,  pointing at their wrist and talking into their wrist?  Or is it going to do that or?

Transcript:  Wasn't Dick Tracy doing that?

Start time: 351.50
End time: 356.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Dick Tracy did it, but that was a comic book.  And I don't know if that really.  You never know.

Start time: 356.08
End time: 359.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was Dick Tracy wasn't real.  Well, they had a great fedora back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't tell Roger that.

Start time: 360.70
End time: 373.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they mentioned Internet access.  So I'm wondering if that actually, I mean, they didn't really detail it,  whether or not you actually need to tether it to a cell phone or it actually has built in wireless,  which would be cool.

Start time: 373.16
End time: 376.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like Google Glass.  Google Glass doesn't do anything if you haven't tethered it to something.

Start time: 376.66
End time: 424.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would assume that it needs to be tethered to something for its coolest functionality.  The giga ohm report that I'm looking at here talks about 10 hour battery life.  And nobody really knows what that means.  It's just a leak that says 10 hours of battery life.  What concerns me about this is if you have to charge it, even if it's every day,  it becomes a lot less fun than if you like I do have a pebble.  I have to charge it once a week.  And I think that's not unreasonable.  But that's partly because the pebble doesn't do much.  Well, that's true.  But it's also because it doesn't have a backlit display.  It's got this low power.  It's a low power LCD display, which means it's not pretty like the like the Samsung phone will be.  But I just I wonder how different people use their watches.  And if people are too willing to take it off every night and plug it in and then, you know,

Start time: 425.48
End time: 434.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  aren't all of these things just kind of preemptory strikes against Apple's eye watch or whatever?  I mean, it's everybody saying, let's get in the market quick before Apple owns it.

Start time: 434.78
End time: 459.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that, though. I really love I mean, Samsung has been knocked so many times for  following Apple.  And I think it's great that they're going to come out with something in front of Apple.  I think that's fantastic.  Now, what will be interesting is if you remember when the iPad came out, all of those pre-announced  slates from CES were like, never mind.  And they reconceived those products.  It'd be interesting to see what happens after Apple does whatever it's going to do.  But I love that Samsung is coming out first.  That's great.

Start time: 459.92
End time: 494.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a believer in wearable computing.  I mean, I'm just I don't think the Google Glass is all that compelling.  I don't think a wristwatch is all that compelling.  But I love the idea.  In a way, to me, a smartphone is a wearable computer.  You're wearing it. It's in your pocket.  It's with you at all times.  I'm not sure you have to do something that much improves on what is already pretty good experience.  You've got 1080p displays.  You've got super fast processors.  It's functional. It's compact.  It doesn't look weird on your body, which both Google Glass and most of these wristwatches do.  Even the Pebble is not exactly attractive.  You think it's attractive?

Start time: 494.54
End time: 511.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of people wear watches that are of, you know, who am I to judge the fashion of the.  But you're right. This is this is something that everybody knows is probably going to be a thing.  But when and how.  And it's not yet.  I think we could come out and say that anything that comes out even in the next year is not going to be the solution to this.

Transcript:  Oh, that's even.

Start time: 522.38
End time: 543.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that was pretty awesome.  So I what I'm saying is this is not a product until the first thing that happened.  Are you wearing one?  Oh, my God.  This is not a product.  Something in our audience is actually wearing.  It's not a product until you don't want to shout nerd when you see it.  Then it's a product.  I mean, we don't care.  We're all nerds, but I'm talking about a real product to a real audience.

Transcript:  The Nike Fuel Band and things like that are much more successful in getting regular people to use them, and they don't call attention to themselves.  But they also don't stare at them either.

Transcript:  Is because of Livestrong.  If if if Neil Armstrong.  What is his name?  Lance Armstrong.  Whatever his name is.  Tim Armstrong, the CEO of AO.  If Lance Armstrong hadn't popularized these ugly yellow rubber bands and everybody was wearing them, I don't think these Fitbit flexes or any of these other than the Fuel Band would have succeeded.

Start time: 591.78
End time: 604.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that's what the Samsung is.  So what is in a well, OK, medical or that's a good example.  What is in this watch or whatever it is that makes it incredibly valuable?  It's it starts with physical stuff.

Start time: 604.24
End time: 628.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I mean, sensors, I think it makes sense doing things like what Fitbit and the Nike Fuel Band do so that it can say this is how many steps you took and this is how far you walked and things like that.  That's a start.  Telling you the time is not bad.  I love that the pebble you the time, the time.  What a concept.  Put that on the list. Right.  Holy cow.  When people ask about the pebble, I say, well, it does tell the time.  So it does base functions of a while.  So does the Nike Fuel Band.

Start time: 628.62
End time: 629.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was using a little bit as a watch.

Start time: 629.94
End time: 660.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I do like having some glanceable information on my watch.  You know, I like being able to see somebody sends me a text message.  I can glance my my wrist and see whether I need to bother answering.  Or my wife sent me a text saying, you know, I'm going to go pick up the kids.  I'm like, OK, I didn't need to pull out the phone.  I didn't need to respond.  I just needed to get that.  And so getting your push notifications sent to your wrist so you don't have to pull out the phone.  I mean, that's on one level.  That is the height of laziness.  Right. It's like, oh, my phone is all.  The way down in my pocket.  But, you know, there's something to that that I don't want to do.

Start time: 660.28
End time: 663.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree. When I wear the pebble, that's a significant investment.

Start time: 663.18
End time: 703.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As you pull that out of your pocket, you got a big phone like Samsung produces  and they do produce a lot of big phones.  So, you know, that can actually be a significant investment.  Anything that keeps me from having to take my phone out of my pocket  and from having to kind of hunch over my phone and read information on it  and enter in my PIN code and everything else.  I think that actually is a significant thing that these devices can do.  But also that they've got to do voice chat.  I mean, it's got to have Google Hangouts built in so you can do some video  conferencing with people.  It should be, again, pretty easy thing to do.  And you should be able to do some Google Now stuff, too.  You should be able to get your flight information.  You should be able to get directions somewhere or at least get traffic warnings.  You know, if it's getting late in the day and there's an accident  or a jumper on the bridge or something like that and traffic is screwed up,  it'd be great to get some push  identification like that going right to your to your watch.

Start time: 704.12
End time: 728.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've actually been building the infrastructure for this for a while.  Twitter, as an example, Google Now, we it's you know, a technology is about to  emerge when all the pieces start to come together.  Right. Bluetooth, low energy, low energy. Yeah.  In fact, a number of phones, iPhones supported  Ellie for a while, but a number of Android phones are now supporting it.  That's going to be universal.

Start time: 728.28
End time: 739.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you're Samsung and you've got the Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Mega,  these gigantic devices, then maybe it even makes more sense  because you can just leave that in whatever giant pocket.  Leave it in your man purse.

Start time: 739.74
End time: 748.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you had Ant Plus support, too, that'd be great.  And plus is used for a lot of wireless sensors for athletics training,  heart rate monitors, cadence sensors on bikes and that kind of thing.

Start time: 748.42
End time: 750.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's what's that technology. What is it called?

Start time: 750.78
End time: 773.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called Ant Plus, A and T Plus.  Something that Sony handsets support, but almost no other Android devices do.  And it gives you support for heart rate monitors and lots of other things.  If that was built into this, too, that'd be a really great advantage  for anybody who's doing strength training or running or cycling.  They want to track their metrics.  That's something that, again, you can't really get through a lot of Android devices.  And if we're in here, that'd be a big bonus.

Start time: 773.40
End time: 792.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ant can support heart rate, speed, cadence, foot pods, power meters,  activity monitors, calorimeters, body mass index.  So, yeah, this is all the stuff. Blood glucose.  But you'd have to have the add on, right?  So you'd have to have an ant supported body, blood glucose measure  that would then go into the watch.

Start time: 792.76
End time: 819.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the kind of thing that the Nike FuelBank can't do  and the Fitbit can't do because they're too simple.  The devices are, you know, they don't have the power to kind of pull on  that kind of information.  But if you use an app like Strava, which tracks your cycling  or there's a lot of running apps, those will all pull in information  from heart rate monitors or from cadence sensors or those sorts of things.  But most smartphones can't connect to them.  So you had to go out and buy special Bluetooth sensors,  which are a lot more expensive than the Ant Plus ones.  So, again, if this could do that, that'd be great.  I would probably go out and buy one myself if it does.

Start time: 820.38
End time: 836.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems to be that we're getting close.  What I'd love it if maybe it would know my blood pressure would be useful.  Could it do that if it knew my heart rate, my blood pressure?  I guess it could do that, right?  Every once in a while, it would get really tight and then really loose.

Start time: 837.88
End time: 844.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, couldn't they manufacture just a special, like,  undershirt that you just wear that has all the sensors?  Oh, that's what I'm going to do.

Start time: 844.34
End time: 848.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to get a three hundred dollar undershirt.  Like an astronaut.  Why not?

Start time: 850.34
End time: 886.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are those sensors on your temples?  I guess we'll get used to all of that stuff.  But to me, well, there's a crossover point.  OK, Geeks will buy anything like the Pebble is a geek product that they'll buy  because it's just a cool factor.  And we as geeks see the future,  but we're willing to invest in something that's not yet really usable.  And then there's a crossover effect where at some point it becomes big enough  when it has enough capabilities. Right.  And it's not ugly enough that people really will say, oh, I need that.  I would love that.  I don't see that crossover happening yet.

Start time: 888.06
End time: 920.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not yet, no, but I think, you know, I think we're not far away  from being at that point and these sorts of products,  getting them out in the market to try to figure out what people want  and what people need and what people don't want from these devices.  You know, go ahead and get something out there for the early adopters  who will spend a lot of money to get these sorts of devices  and play with them and get their feedback on what they're doing.  Find out what they like, what they don't like,  and then they can come out with a product next year that's really great.  And, you know, if indeed Apple doesn't get its eye watch out until next year,  then that could give Samsung a pretty big head start.  They'd have a year's worth of data that they could then go back to  and design revision 2.0 of this thing.  Have a really great product next year.

Start time: 921.02
End time: 955.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Samsung's history is creating new products that have kind of  they throw a lot of stuff against the wall to see what sticks  and they'll have like the Galaxy S4 has got like eight wacky  bits of software and hardware in it.  And really wacky.  Some of them are, yeah, like when I'm not watching the video.  The eyeball stuff is so bizarre.  But my point is they get this product out there, they spend a year with it,  they talk to the people who buy it and they'll discover the one or two things  that like people really love and then they will have learned something.  And I think that's how this is going to go.  I don't know.  Knowings have the battle.

Start time: 955.56
End time: 960.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, like one of the questions I'm still thinking about is a wristwatch.  Really, the form factor people want.

Start time: 961.44
End time: 974.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the question is it glasses is a wristwatch?  Is it a fanny pack?  Is it a tooth implant?  Is it a removable tongue?  An ear that looks like an ear, but is it really an ear?  What is it?  A shoe phone?  New hair?

Start time: 975.04

Start time: 990.52
End time: 1016.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Smart hats. Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I look at Google Glass and it's just it seems  as long as we've got eyeballs in our heads, hanging something  right in front of your eyeball seems like it's going to be pretty intrusive.  But the watch has been used for hundreds of years as something  that's for glanceable information.  So it's not a bad place.  But short of hanging things off of our  like having a little mobile that lives in front of our face, you know,  there are limited places, real, real estate on your body.

Start time: 1016.76
End time: 1035.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's limited places that you can hang things from.  Although if you look at you go to your neighborhood piercing shop,  you'll find there's many more places than you thought.  You can't words for implanting things.  I don't know. I feel like smart hats now.  I feel like I don't feel like we've cracked it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's what the Scion was.  It had a keyboard and screen. Yeah. All right.  Enough of this. We'll find out.  We'll look at the gear. I'll probably buy one.  What do you think it'll cost?  One hundred bucks, five thousand dollars. What?  Anywhere in between three hundred three ninety nine.  Three ninety nine.  It'll be smart. Little less than a smartphone.  Do you work for Samsung, sir? You seem to be nodding.  He's confirming it.  The guy in the back, you work at IDEO.  I could tell you look like a designer.  He's confirming it's going to be something like that.  Now he's hiding his head in shame.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't really call out people in the audience.  It's mean our show today brought  brought to you by some all.  Oh, my friend, Dana Atkinson has done something very interesting.  S.U.M.A.L.L. dot com.  I want you to take a look at it.  It lets you connect data from Google, from Twitter, from YouTube, from PayPal.  Actually, they're adding new inputs all the time.  Facebook to get insights into what you're doing.  And there this has been another insane month for them.  Twenty percent growth this month or actually last month.  Sixty thousand customers and companies using some all data analytics.  You probably heard about big businesses using business intelligence.  Well, now anybody can use some all  companies like Amazon and PayPal and eBay and authorized dot net  are connecting their stuff.  Big commerce, base camp, AdSense to some all.  And then you get amazing graphs, amazing information  connecting the data, telling you this is modern analytics.  You can integrate your stuff with other related data streams.  You can have personalized daily or weekly emails  telling you how your business or company or social project is working.  You can have an if you're doing a Kickstarter, you'd be crazy not to set this up.  Find out how your tweets are impacting your revenue.  You can export into spreadsheets.  There's a spreadsheet view built in.  There are dozens of features.  There's also new a some all mobile app for iPhone  that gives you up to the minute real time data.  Imagine the real time data on your phone,  on your online stores, performance or how things are going on that  on that PR campaign you launched.  Historical stats allowed to keep track of where you were versus where you are today.  This is all in the iPhone.  You could track revenue, unit sold, discount patterns and Android app soon to come.  So what I suggest you do is just go there.  It's free and sign up for an account.  Start connecting a few web services.  Three would be a great place to start.  You know, everybody's got Twitter and Facebook, maybe Google Analytics or,  you know, something like that, Amazon.  And start taking a look at the kinds of insights you get.  Why should this be limited to only big business?  Everybody can take advantage of some all no credit card needed.  It is free.  As in doesn't cost anything.  S.U.M.A.L.L. dot com.  We use it. We're using it now to track how our social media campaigns  relate to downloads and to attention and to visits on YouTube, stuff like that.  It's really, really great.  I guess I didn't want to I didn't want to go all gawker on you,  but I guess I kind of have to now.  Me got to talk, got to talk.  Where were you love, love, triangle, baby.  So it started this week when Hugo Hugo Bara, who was really in many ways, the face  of a guy of Android at Google's I.O.  and other presentations, he demonstrated the Nexus seven  at the breakfast with Sundar Pichai a couple of weeks ago.  Hugo Bara announces I'm leaving Google.  To go to a Chinese Android manufacturer,  he does it on, of course, Google Plus.  How do you say this Chinese Android manufacturer's name Xiaomi Xiaomi Xiaomi,  which means Little Me?  I guess if you want to paint a bright light on it,  he's going Xiaomi's potentially a huge partner for Android.  And here's the guy from the Android team going over there to work with them,  to join them together with Google.  Or you could point out who knew Sergey Brin apparently is separated from his wife  and has been dating Hugo Bara's ex-girlfriend.  Maybe she was an ex when it started, I don't know.  I don't want to get all gossipy on this, so I don't know.  But it might be Germaine.  If I mean, it was sudden, you also have people saying, what's going on at Android?  Andy Rubin leaves Hugo Bara leaves other very big names in the Android team.  Depart.  None of you want to touch this, do you?  It's well, you know, I don't blame you.  I don't even want to bring it up.

That's yeah, I was thinking about about the life cycles of companies.  And the fact is, I mean, every company has at least, you know, they they if they're lucky,  they have this big ascent phase and then they get people when they're on top.  And a lot of those people have got a lot of money or they've got a lot of cash  or they feel like they're not getting the exposure that they deserve because they're behind  the number one. And it happens.  And I feel like Google in personal issues aside, I think Google is at that point  where we've seen some of this movement with Andy Rubin and and and some of these other  executives where Google is so huge and has been so successful that some of the people  at Google seem to be a little a little restless.  And it happens everywhere. It happens at Microsoft, happens at Apple.  You know, it happens everywhere.  But I think we're seeing some of that now because Google has matured as a company.

Start time: 1409.92
End time: 1417.30

Transcript:  It's there's a lot. I don't know.  I don't know what the story and I don't pretend to know what the story is.  But Hugo Barra didn't feel like the kind of guy who was about to abandon ship.  Right. I mean, this wasn't so long ago.  He was showing us the Nexus seven.  He was in many ways one of their best presenters, one of their one of their faces up front.  And it was because he felt like kind of an abrupt departure.  Maybe it was just a clash of egos.  And maybe Xiaomi said, hey, we'll give you five million dollars signing bonus.  And it's hard to turn that down. I don't know.

Xiaomi and Huawei are both making some pretty big advancements  or advances, I should say, right now in trying to really be a bigger player  in the worldwide smartphone market.  And they're making huge steps forward to the devices are really nice at this point.  And it just seems like they kind of need a little bit of extra help on the presentation front  and probably could use some more insight into the worldwide market  if they want to conquer the worldwide market.  So so Huawei and Xiaomi are both making big plays and ZTE as well.  So, you know, I'm sure that was a part of it, too.  But yeah, it does seem like there's a little bit more of the story.

Transcript:  It's yeah. What can I say?  I don't want to go all gawker.  It's just it is what it is.  Actually, as long as we're talking all things,  DeKara Swisher has an interesting article in which she kind of posits  that we were talking last week about Steve Ballmer leaving Microsoft  and wondering what happened there.  And she says it was much more abrupt than one thinks.  And in fact, there's now it looks like going to be a little bit of a.  Well, it's there's an interesting.  Tit for tat, I would guess.  Value Act, which is a activist investor, was planning to file a proxy.  Are you having thunderstorms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've been given a seat on the board  and some were thinking that Value Act also helped push Steve Ballmer out the door  and might have even said, hey, give us a seat on the board and get rid of Ballmer.  And we won't have this proxy.  We won't have to fight this ugly fight.  They don't they only have.  A point eight percent in the stake in Microsoft,  but I guess that's big enough to make a stake to pay to pay attention. Yeah.  Well, Kara also writes that it was a fairly swift departure,  more sudden than portrayed by the company.  According to sources close to the situation,  it was neither planned nor as smooth as portrayed.  The decision to go seems to have technically been Ballmer's, writes Kara,  interviews with people inside and outside the company,  including many close to the situation, indicate he had not aimed to leave this soon,  especially after that recent restructuring that he had been so heavily involved in.  He they she says that that her sources say the timeline had been moved up  drastically first by him, then the nine member board, including his champion  and friend Bill Gates, who all agreed it was best if he leaves sooner than later.

There was that story this week about how all things D that they're actually  in conversation with Dow Jones about whether Kara and Walton  Company are going to stay what with with Dow Jones or go out on their own.  That's the one story that Kara hasn't been reporting on.  Yeah, she didn't write about that.  I think jokes about it, though.  It's who knows what will happen. They built they built a great business.  It's not widely known.  Dow Jones owns all things D.  But other than Walt, none of the all things D people are employed by Dow Jones.  Tara was a Wall Street Journal reporter.  They now all work for all things D.  But they built this big business.  And it'll be interesting to see what happens because, you know, they they are a real asset  to to News Corp.  And I wonder if Rupert Murdoch is going to end up having to make a call about,  you know, are they going to make a deal with these guys or not?  So the way baseball, I know, but that's a really great.  No, it's very, very good.  Kara's been on the show many times.

Transcript:  Well, there's there's a lot of people on the outside  don't realize the degree of autonomy that all things D has.  It's not total part of the Wall Street Journal.  Walt writes for the journal.  But this is a totally separate set up in San Francisco.  They're right across the street from us.  They're on on Second Street, I believe, by South Park in San Francisco.  And yeah, it'll be interesting to see because they built up  a whole lot of personal brand themselves with all the people.

And now they're, you know, they're all names.  Is News Corp a liability to them?  I don't think so.  I think I think there's, you know, but I don't think they're  necessarily as big an asset as they used to be. I don't know.

Transcript:  And you see that. I don't know if you remember that.  But you'd see that at places like tech TV, where they really want to kind of keep  their thumb on you because their fear is if Patrick Norton gets too big,  then we can't afford him. We're going to lose him.  So it's a balancing act.

Start time: 1917.98

Transcript:  And I think the Internet era has has completely changed that,  because really, as as all of these names that I just mentioned have learned  Tim Stevens, too, I'm sure at some point you considered  maybe I shouldn't join CNET and I should just do my own thing.  It's certainly part of the calculation, right?

Start time: 1938.95
End time: 2008.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It certainly was.  And there certainly a lot of questions, a lot of decisions that went into  to that process. But ultimately, CNET is a great platform.  That's why I decided to go there.  But certainly, I mean, it's certainly an age when you can be very successful  as an independent.  The question is, how successful can you be when it comes to monetizing  that success and how well can you do that without having to, you know,  compromise your your your core values and doing that sort of thing individually?  And how much time do you want to spend lining up advertising deals  and that kind of thing?  And that's really a lot of what comes into being a success,  both in terms of, you know, putting food on the table for your family,  which is an important thing,  but also having a zillion Twitter followers and all that good stuff, too.  So, you know, you have to decide what priorities you want and that kind of thing.  But ultimately, if if indeed Karen Walton and Mike  the incredible writers that they have there do walk away, that's a huge loss.  No kidding. Sure, they make a ton of money.  And I hope that I hope that the folks there realize that.  I mean, I get the feeling that this is kind of a traditional corporation  that maybe they don't realize just how important this this news publication  is to the world of tech journalism at large and how the world of tech  journalism is as fragmented as it is.  But yet this is an incredibly strong voice.  It'd be a real shame if that got kind of messed up through whatever is happening  now and whatever is going to continue to happen over the next few weeks.

Transcript:  It's you know, it's it's really interesting to watch this happen.  In fact, I think I'm going to quit Twitter and start my own company.  Because I only I only started my own company  because I was kind of thrust out of tech TV.  I would have probably stayed at tech TV forever, but they they got rid of me  and they sold the company.  And but it was the best thing that ever happened to me,  was starting my own business and owning it all.

Maybe it's millions and millions of dollars of investment to build a new brand  or to extend the existing.

And I can easily see them saying,  what do we need Burdock for? What do we need Doos Corp for?  We could do this.  We could take all the money, all the revenue and make it easy.  Well, I love it. I didn't even I didn't know that was happening.  Since you mentioned Kara, we love Kara.  We love Wall Street. We love Kara. We love them.  That's a great it's a great company.  Now, the only thing from the point of view of the user and I'm a user,  I'm a reader, is it's nice to be able to go to one place and see all these.  And there is a certain synergy of having Ina Freed and Liz Gaines  and Kara Swisher out on the street and then coming back  and creating an entire narrative around what's happening in technology  that you lose when you're just by yourself.

But I think there's room for something in between.  And all things to is actually a great example where they're not  newsroom with 100 people, but they're also not a bunch of individual bloggers.  They've they're they're all kind of together and coordinated.  And I think that can make for some really cool sites with, you know, five,  10 core contributors.

As you try to get large enough, you want to maintain the same size,  you know, you know, for the rest of the foreseeable life of wherever your operation is.  I mean, that's probably not an issue.  But if you want to grow it, you're going to grow into a bunch of growing pains  and you to start adding on those elements that you wanted to divest yourself of  initially. So, I mean, like what kind of Tim was was alluding to, I mean,  there's just a lot of other things that you now have to start thinking of  besides just doing the editorial journalism portion of it.

You know, it's not exactly a hugely lavish affair,  but it is incredibly great conference.  You know, we always covered it very thoroughly and get a lot of great news  out of it, adding gadget.

Just finished a book this morning, a book that was got awful long.  I'll be honest with you.  Great North Road by Peter Hamilton.  I've been ready for it to be done for about 18 hours.  It's like 40 hours.  So I'm going to do something short now.  But that's why it's great when you're an audible listener,  because I've been as I've been listening to the book, I've been buying other books.  I've got a whole library of wonderful books waiting for me at audible dot com.  I decided I was listening to science fiction,  so I like to alternate fiction with nonfiction.  So I'm currently listening to I think it's nonfiction.  It's called The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker.  Somebody told me I should listen to this.  Maybe Alexis Ohanian or somebody like that.  So you got to listen to this.  It Pulitzer Prize winner in 1974.  It is it is why evil exists in the world.  That's all I'm going to say.  On the other hand, maybe you'd like something a little lighter,  like Mark Maron's Attempting Normal.  Mark narrates it himself.  If you ever listen to WTF, his fabulous podcaster watches his new show.  This would be a great one to listen to.  Funny guy.  Now, the point is, I'm going to get you one of these books, maybe two.  Let's get two free.  What do you what are you listening to right now?

It's these guys who collect people's collect the souls of the dying,  which is a which is a great benefit to their culture,  except that they're also their opposition or kind of these guys  who tear the souls of the living away from them and kill them.  And there's this kind of battle between good and evil.  And the kings who rule and it's really great.  It's one of the better books I've read in the last year.

We often have said create a unique email address just for password resets,  not your main address, so that people don't guess it.  So how many people did that and made it on Yahoo.com because it was free.  And now that's their password reset and they don't ever use it.  Six months later, badda bing, badda boom.  Somebody else has it. That's not right.  Can you and by the way, Yahoo can coin an entire new set of email addresses  by changing it from Yahoo to Yahoo Mail dot com.

None of this would help you, though, if you'd use it as a Twitter backup  for your password reset, right?  We will also unsubscribe these accounts from commercial emails.  Although kill spam from commercial emails, such as newsletters  and email alerts, among others, upon deactivation, we will send  notification for these potentially recycled accounts to merchants,  e-commerce sites, financial institutions.  So, oh, God.  Well, Yahoo, you could you could just put an exclamation mark in there  or something and get the whole namespace over.

It's nice idea, but they didn't code it right.  Is it a blurred line?  Is it a blue line?  There's one.  Tom Mara and Sarah Fener talk.  Now, what do I do? I click the line.

End time: 3229.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's making it a bit more like Google Plus, which is good.  That was always one of the biggest complaints that I had about Twitter.  And one of the things I like best about Google Plus is that if somebody asks  you a question about a tweet, you know, 10 of the people ask you the same question.  And you have to reply to them individually.  Now, in theory, if someone actually takes the time to expand that conversation,  they'll see the answer to the problem is, of course, they actually have to take  the time to do what you just did and click on the link and expand it  and then read everything.  Whereas in Google Plus, it's all neatly organized and categorized.  So it's a step in the right direction.

See, I have been saying, no, that's I agree.  I love threaded conversations.  That's why I left Twitter way back when and went to  what Jaiku remember that? Right.  Yeah. And then I left Twitter again and went to Plurk.  And then I left Twitter again and went to Pounce, all of which had threaded  conversations and all of which failed because they had threaded conversations.  It was too complicated.  People just wanted to tweet out into the universe.  And I'm turning into some reason I'm turning into that comedian,  Louis Black. I don't know why.  And then  and then  and and and I think threaded conversations were always grafted  on Twitter and didn't belong there anyway.  Why are you having conversations? That's not what it's for.  I love Google Plus. Here's Google Plus.

And I've seen a lot of people complaining about the blue lines because  they complicated it.  People don't like seeing duplication in their timelines.  It's just weird that that all said, it is really hard to follow  conversations on Twitter. So I don't have that they're trying to.  Well, people are having them, though. That's the thing.

I think like Veronica and Tom and a bunch of people had access to this.  And we would each get one sentence.  And you had to build on the other person's sentence.  It was a really good idea.

Did you get the email today this week saying we're changing everything,  but don't worry about it because it's all the same or something?  I don't understand what it was.  It was very strange.  New privacy policy.  But it's just for the old privacy policy.  Rewritten, right?  Because they've always been using.  So the whole apparently when it was all about using your name and image in advertising to your friends.  Is that right?  So they changed the language.  To to say, well, let me see.  I OK, so the old language.  And this might have had to do with the fact that they had there was a court settlement on Monday dealing with these.  They called them sponsored stories.  The settlement required us, says Facebook, to provide additional language around the use of people's information for sponsored stories.  So we had an example.  And provided more detail, they didn't make it any easier to turn it off.  The new language says, in fact, is actually kind of a little bit more assertive.  You give us permission to use your name and profile picture, content and information in connection with commercial sponsored or related content like a brand you like.  Served or enhanced by us.  That means and here's the example, for example, that you permit a business or other entity to pay us to display your name or profile picture with your content or information without any compensation to you.  If you've selected a specific audience for your content and information, we'll respect that choice.  So when I see Roger Chang recommends depends adult diapers.  Potentially, at some point at some point in your life, it's basically an uncompensated ad endorsement by Roger Chang.

Transcript:  It was starting to get tough in the tech journalism and news world because a lot of companies were starting to post press releases and news and product launch information on their Facebook pages.  So I had to go through and like Samsung and like a bunch of other companies that I may or may not actually like.  But now these sorts of endorsements almost are showing up in my friends feeds.  And it looks like Tim Stevens like Samsung, which is it almost looks like a paid paid endorsement.  But I kind of had to do it just because Samsung was announcing product stuff on Facebook.  But that's that's damaging to you.  Absolutely. It's damaging.

If you go to your Facebook page and click the padlock next to your name in the upper left hand corner, what you'll get is the you know, the quick and easy privacy settings.  But that's not what you want.  What you want is Seymour settings.  And they've they've spread out these privacy settings over six different categories, including security, privacy, timeline, apps and ads.  You've got to go to ads and then following along.  Follow along. There's two kinds of ads.  There's everyone wants to know what their friends like.  That's why. That's why.  Oh, that's why everybody wants to know this.  That's why we pair ads and friends, an easy way to find products and services you're interested in based on what your friends share and like.  And you can have that set to only my friends, which is the default or no one pair my social actions with ads for no one.  Please, I don't want to I don't want to be, you know, Tim Stevens loves Samsung.  Why don't you?  Roger recommends depends.  Or Roger recommends depends.  Now, there's an interesting one above this.  Facebook does not give third party applications or ad networks the right to use your name or picture and ads.  They don't do it currently.  But if we allow this in future, the setting you choose will determine how you have to choose for what they might do in the future.  Just in case. You know what?  I would suggest changing this because if they say we might be doing this, they're probably going to do it.  Right. Preemptive opt out, preemptive opt out.  And again, that's one. Well, who will who will see those third party sites?

If you go into parental controls and if you're not a parent,  you may never have done that on the Apple TV.  But under parental controls, you can literally just turn off  as many of the channels as you want to on your app.  So if you've got if you're tired of all of those channels  on the Apple TV and you only use five of them,  you can actually turn the rest of them off.

Transcript:  I know what I wanted to talk to you, John, because you were very outspoken about stack ranking.  We're going to take a break. Some people say that the problem that Microsoft's been facing,  that the reason Bomber's got to be gone is stack ranking. And I want you to explain  what that all means. And then we have a Slate article in which an ex-Microsoft manager said  it was totally demoralizing that stack ranking made him secretive, cynical, and paranoid.  Yes.  I'm not surprised. We'll talk about that in a second. But first, a word from Carbonite  online backup. Nothing to be cynical about when it comes to backup. If you're not backing up,  you're at risk. You're at risk of losing all your data. Hard drives die. I'm sad to say houses  burned down. We just had our favorite restaurant down here. They just had a fire in the grease  trap. What place was this? Central Market over here is closed. And I was so sad to see the owner  standing across the street watching his restaurant burn, crying. It was heart-wrenching. So don't,  these things happen. And now, fortunately, I know Tony, for a fact, was backing up his data.  His recipes, his supplier lists, his accounts, you need to back that stuff up. If you're a small  business, a fire can do more than destroy your property, can literally put you out of business.  Would you be able to get back on your feet if all the computers and all the backups in your  business were destroyed? That's why you got to have backup. Same for home users, too.  Carbonite is great. It's automatic. You don't have to think about it. There's no employee  who has to remember to back up. Your life is not in their hands. It's secure. All your files are  encrypted and backed up safely offsite. It's affordable. Always one low, flat yearly rate  for all the data you've got. It's great for a small business. It's great for a home. $59.99 a year  for a single computer. They've got business plans that are very affordable. I want you to check it  out. You got two weeks free.

It was featured in one of the ... This  American Life has done two stories on patent trolls. The second one talks about the podcast  patent troll, but also talks about David Friend and their decision, even though it made no economic  sense, to fight the patent troll. That's how they usually work, these patent trolls. They set a price  that's just below the cost of fighting them. The cost is generally $40,000 to $50,000.

Well, and I'll tell you, having talked to lawyers, that the cost of defending one of  these is well over a million dollars, often several times that. It's not a cheap thing to do. David,  everlasting credit, decided to fight this patent troll which had sued him and EMC. They had already,  so many companies had already given in, but Carbonite decided not to cut a deal. He said,  our lawyers said it's going to cost millions of dollars more to take this to trial, and if we  lose, we're really screwed because then not only do you pay the legal fees, but you have to pay  now the licensing fees. Friends said, I was sort of like, well, because we're not in violation of  their patents, why should we pay them anything? Not even a nickel. I like that. Good man. Fight

Was it General Electric?  Jack Welch that? Yeah, Jack Welch popularized it, but it's not his invention. He popularized it,  and incidentally, after he quit and then they screwed with him, they dropped it. The GE doesn't  really use it. They don't use it? As far as I know, this is what I've been told. Whatever the case is,  it's a form of creating an environment. This is actually, I think SAS has it built into some of  their software so you can use it as a- Make it easy. As a mechanism. It's for lazy HR,  because the way it works is that the employees rank each other and the supervisors rank each  other and the employees rank the supervisors, supervisors rank in these little groups.

If I'm ranking you and you're ranking me, I have to choose between, and say we're in a group,  I have to choose one person in this group and give him a number one, and somebody else gets a  two, somebody else gets a three, and somebody else gets a four. It's forced ranking. Somebody  has to be a one, which is the low number. Of course, you could reverse and make the number  one the best, but it's beside the point. In a group of, let's say, four people, everyone has  to have these numbers given by the other employees. If you come out with a bunch of low numbers, the  ones, you're essentially fired. You're voted off the, it's like survivor.  Very much. Generally, with a stack ranking situation, 25% of your force, your team is  always going to be fired. Oh, Jesus. That's not good.  You can do this on a quarterly basis, twice a year, or in the case of Yahoo, which apparently  has this implemented with Marissa, they do it monthly. It seems so apparent that this is a

You don't know these  guys. You can use it for about a year or two, and it really does trim the company down to a bunch of  go-getters. Then if you continue to do it, which everyone does because it's a lazy way of evaluating  people, it starts to create these problems, which are psychological. People start becoming  yes men. They're worried more about their ranking than they are doing their job.  You end up with a declining, deteriorating company with all the talent leaving because  nobody with any real talent wants to stick around to be humiliated like this.  Microsoft basically lost all their people over time because they just love this stack ranking.  They've been using it since, I don't know. Before Balmer. This is an article by David Auerbach,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tales of an Ex-Microsoft Manager. He talks about stack ranking. He says,  to be entirely fair, stack ranking predated Balmer both as a cause and a symptom of the  corporation's decline. He was a software developer, later development lead at Microsoft between 1998  and 2003. He had to participate in this. He says stack rank was harmful. It served as an incentive  not to join high quality groups because you'd be that much more likely to be a low ranked member,  right? But better to join a weak group where you'd be the star and then coast.  So it's a great way to get the least possible out of every single employee.

Generally speaking, if a team like that goes and wins a championship,  and I would cite the Golden State Warriors when they won their championship in the 70s,  they immediately did some trades. You got a team and they swept. They swept the Washington Bullets  four straight and then they immediately traded people. This is like idiotic. If you have a  perfect team and in corporations sometimes you have a perfect little team that just kicks butt.  Why would somebody come over and say, look, you got to fire one of these guys because this is our  system. It's idiotic. Anyway, that's my little thing.

I didn't realize until the non-stacked performance  review time at my new job that I'd become so wary. At the time inside Microsoft, it just seemed the  only logical way to be. While that may not be the only problem at Microsoft, if they're still  doing it, if Yahoo's doing it, it seems like a bad idea. It seems like a bad idea.

I feel bad about it. He was one of these guys. He worked with  the media. If you had a problem, you call him and he would take care of everybody. The media  relations were fantastic.

Transcript:  There are 10 car companies that Tesla now outsells in California, which is the state  with the most Model S consumers. They are beating the Audi A6. They're beating the Lexus.  They're beating the Mercedes E-Class, the BMW 5 Series, the Lexus GS, the 7 Series,  the Porsche Panamera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing how Tesla has come from kind of nowhere to be outselling  a lot of these major popular cars. The problem is they've got a lot of momentum on the side.  Most of these manufacturers don't really have any response. BMW is the only one who's really  doing anything that's even close to Tesla at this point. They've got the i3 and the i8.  We should be learning more about the i8 here next week.  But nobody else really has anything to compare with. They're all building evolutionary steps  forward on their existing gasoline engine cars. They're all used to having new models that are  all very, very much based on previous models, sharing engines or transmissions or something  like that. But they're really a clean slate design to be able to compete with what Tesla  is doing these days. And only BMW at this point has shown anything that is indeed a clean slate  design. And I'm curious to see whether Audi could do anything like that or Mercedes-Benz  or any of these other luxury manufacturers that Audi is now a legitimate threat to.

Transcript:  They completely underestimated the market for an electric vehicle, I think. I mean,  they just thought, no, no. We already did this. Nobody wants this.

Start time: 5742.74
End time: 5764.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because their designs were not... the Tesla design for an electric vehicle,  it can go 340 miles or whatever it goes. Yeah. It's a luxury vehicle.  And everyone who owns one, everyone, without exception, loves them. Of course, they could  fall apart in a year, for all you know. They could be glued together or spot welded. We don't know  what happens after a year of use. Oh, they'll be fine.

Start time: 5764.86
End time: 5776.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know that. Actually, they could be more strong than  welded, this one. There are a lot of adhesives that are being used in cars. Lotus uses a lot of  industrial adhesives and GM actually uses industrial adhesives on the new Corvette,

End time: 5853.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the highest rated car they've ever tested. Ever, in auto safety.  These are the sorts of things that Tesla can do because, again, they don't have any legacy behind  them. It's like creating a brand new operating system versus Microsoft creating a new version  of Windows that has to have all the legacy support for everything else. If GM comes out with a new  car, the frame is based on an older car. The engine has mounting points based on an older  frame. Tesla just said, we're going to create a completely clean slate design. We're going to  put the battery pack where it belongs. We're going to put the motor between the wheels where it belongs.  There aren't really any other manufacturers, again, other than BMW, trying to do something  like that. Mercedes is working on the SLS, which is an electric version of their SLS Roadster.  But again, it's basically just a conversion of their existing car. Audi's got some e-tron  prototypes they're playing with, but again, they're conversions from their existing gasoline-powered  cars. So they all have compromises. The Tesla Model S is largely uncompromised.

Start time: 5853.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tim, why don't you have one? I live upstate in the Northeast, a long way away from any of Tesla's  charges. They're going to be doubling their charger network here the next year. Plus,  it's cold and cold weather's not good for battery life. Cold does cost about 10 to 50 percent and  also it's an expensive car. I am a tech journalist, so we've got to remember that too. Well, I think

Start time: 5880.40
End time: 5890.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  watch because, okay, now they've got the 50 to 85,000. That's where this car is. The next one's  going to be under 50, I'm sure, right? Probably under 30. Yeah, but that's... 2015 and they're

Start time: 5890.84
End time: 5923.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hoping to be around $40,000. That might be after the tax credits, so it might be actually closer  to 50. But if they can get something in the Audi A3 or BMW 3 Series in money range and have a car  that's got a 200 to 300 mile range, and if by then the supercharger network is as broad as they say  it will be, and they've been building that out incredibly quickly, so I have no reason to doubt  that, that could be a really, really strong threat to the big money makers for these cars, which again  is the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes E-Class, and lower cost but still luxurious cars that are selling in

I can actually crash it at will, which is kind of  interesting on a television. But the picture is astounding. On the other hand, you're going to  have to spend a few hundred bucks now to calibrate it because I don't think it comes out of the box.  Well, you got what's here and it'll do it for free. Robert said he'd come up and do it because he  wants to review it for HD Nation and Scott Wilkinson, our own home theater geek, is going  to come up and I'm going to have them battle over it. This will be fun. You should record that. We  are. We are. It's going to be battling calibrators. No, you got the biases, Rod. That's not flesh tone.  How can you call it flesh tone?

Transcript:  vehicle by 2020. And I would say if they don't buy 2020, they'll probably be the last in the market  to do so. Audi and Toyota have both shown off prototypes and multiple. I think we talked about  this before on here, but multiple manufacturers are told me they're ready to go. They're just  waiting for the buyers to want this as an option to be willing to pay the extra, you know, $1,500  or so for the sensors in the cars to have it. But the technology is there. They're just waiting for  the market to be ready for it and the laws to be ready for it too, which is not a big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. It's a combination of lidar cameras to read road markings and signs and  of course GPS to to know roughly where the car is. But yeah, certainly the software is there.  It's pretty impressive that they can do this sort of thing, you know, in limited situations. It's  not the kind of thing that you could program an address in and have it pull out of your driveway  and take you somewhere, but it's certainly the kind of thing that you can get on the highway,  tap a button and then kick back and open up the newspaper or even have it drop you off at the  restaurant and hit a button and have a drive up the road and find a place to park. Those are the  things it can do right now. And if it crashes, you're not in the car, so who cares? That's the  question because if it does crash, if it does go park, you get sued.

Start time: 6201.60
End time: 6216.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  brilliant thing about Tesla is the people who want to buy an electric car are people who are willing  to spend extra money for it, at which point they want a car more like the Tesla than the Leaf.  So that's why they've been more successful to be a luxury car. An economy electric car is wrong.

End time: 6228.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6247.76
End time: 6277.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you've got the money, the Model S is definitely the best. The i3 should be very interesting.  It's going to be fairly pricey around 40k, but I would say that would probably be a little bit  more fun to drive than the Volt, but that's just going by BMW versus Chevy. But certainly the i3  looks pretty pretty promising and the i8 should be great. But again, we're talking probably  Model S money or higher for that car. That we don't know just yet. That should be announced  at Frankfurt or all the pricing details should be announced in Frankfurt, which is actually  the same time as Apple's supposed to defend, unfortunately, which means I won't be in Frankfurt.

Start time: 6277.34
End time: 6294.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unfortunately, is it the case that the success of these high-end electric cars will promote the  whole concept and the whole category and that this is the way it needed to happen? You bought an A8.  Well, I'm an outlier. Everything starts up with cars. I don't care about the high end.

Start time: 6296.72
End time: 6339.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the halo effect for sure. These are aspirational vehicles. They're pretty expensive.  A lot of people can't afford the Model S, but a lot of people, they see them, they recognize them.  When I was doing the road test of the Model S, I had one for a week and I would park it outside of  a restaurant and come out and there'd be four or five people standing there who would be very  excited to see this car. And I've done road tests with Ferraris and other very expensive cars  and they wouldn't get nearly the reaction as the Tesla did, which was very surprising to me because  it's not really that shocking looking of a car compared to something like a Ferrari or something  more exciting. But it's the aspirational effect for sure and it's something that you can really  genuinely get excited about, whereas a Leaf is kind of hard to, it's an impressive machine for  what it was at the time, but it's not really that exciting in a lot of ways. I think the Leaf failed

Start time: 6339.48
End time: 6344.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because it's goofy looking. Well, that and that would have had a hundred mile range. Yeah, you need

Start time: 6344.52
End time: 6373.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  more range. And they were selling it at a loss and it wasn't really meant to be a mass market car.  It was really more of a rolling testbed for Nissan to figure out what exactly worked, what didn't work,  what kind of range loss they'd see in cold weather, how it worked in a crash, that kind of thing. So  it was more of a test but that they were selling and trying to get out in the market. It wasn't  that they sold to just about anybody who wanted one, but ultimately it was more of a research  vehicle that hopefully will be followed up on by something a bit more impressive. Finally, Elon Musk

Start time: 6437.48
End time: 6473.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tony Stark is a fictional character.  On YouTube from a guy named Oliver Krylos. There's a lot of research in this sort of thing.  It's O. Krylos, K-R-E-Y-L-O-S. He does a lot of research into kind of next-gen interfaces and 3D  interfaces and remote telepresence and that kind of thing. He's done a lot of prototypes with this  sort of thing just based on a Kinect basically and a couple of 3D input devices. He does some  pretty cool stuff. So you can see that it's sort of out there in the research world, but really  people haven't commercialized it. And so it'd be great if Musk could make something that we could  actually see distributed and actually starting to replace Windows and OS X and that kind of thing.

The Tomahawk missile. Now, the cool thing is that the  Senate and the House has voted themselves that they can make insider trades, they can do anything  they want. It's totally legal.
