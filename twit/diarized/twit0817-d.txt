Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am amazed at how much play that story, the Amazon drivers story got.  I guess my feeling is it's not really a tech story.  Yes, Amazon, I guess, is kind of a tech company, but it's really much more of a labor story.  It's a shame that that's what we've gotten to.  Let's protect workers in these tech companies.  You'd think they're so insanely profitable that this wouldn't be an issue.

Start time: 297.44
End time: 308.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed with the tone of the Amazon news tweets that  came out.  It's like, you don't believe that peeing in bottles thing, do you?  Well, they've backed down.

Start time: 308.68
End time: 342.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got photos of it.  Yeah, we do believe it.  Yeah.  And in fact, they were forced to apologize.  Yeah, the official Amazon Twitter account has now apologized.  I guess we're doing the story.  I guess we're going in, folks.  They said Friday that the tweet, see, there's some tech, the tweet was incorrect and, quote,  did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment  centers, from which I'm taking, yeah, the drivers pee in bottles all the time.

Start time: 343.24
End time: 367.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're not employees.  See, this is how they're getting around that.  They're because most of the time, the drivers, see, the drivers work for a vendor.  They have a number of different driving services who contract with Amazon, so they're not actually  paid by Amazon, whereas the fulfillment centers, as far as I know, they might have some outsourcing,  but as far as I know, everybody who works at the fulfillment center is employed by Amazon.

Start time: 368.08
End time: 393.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Amazon apology goes on and on and on.  It's got bullet points.  It's numbered.  First, the tweet was incorrect.  Second, our process was flawed.  Third, we know that drivers do and have trouble finding restrooms.  This is a longstanding industry-wide issue.  By the way, I might add to that, podcast hosts also sometimes are stuck in front of a microphone  for hours at a time.

Start time: 395.13
End time: 429.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they are slightly right, though.  Okay, no one's going to want to hear this, but this is just facts.  It's true.  My grandpa was a truck driver.  My dad was a truck driver.  And yeah, when you have long hauls overnight and you're in a rush, maybe you have a bonus  because, but like Christina said, they had their trucks, so they were responsible and  it was a thing.  So they're kind of right, but not right.  You know what I mean?  Like they're going for the fact that, yes, you can get a hole in one on a golf course,  but how often?  Wait a minute.  Now, wait a minute.  Was that an analogy?  Hold on now.

Start time: 430.12
End time: 471.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say the difference too is that, because you're exactly right, Doc, like this isn't  a new problem and people who are truck drivers have dealt with this for years.  What I do think is new is that people are penalized, don't get work assignments, have  quotas to fill for how many packages they deliver.  That's what's different here.  And I think that that's the thing where, where it's not the same, where if you're doing a  long haul trucking thing, yeah, you might have instances where it's overnight or whatever  and you have to make do, but you're not in this situation where you say, okay, I have  to deliver 70, 80 parcels in this shift.  I don't have time to go find a place to go to the bathroom.  Well, I don't even know where they go.

Start time: 471.54
End time: 474.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do they go to?  The gas station?  Where do they even?  Right.

Start time: 475.50
End time: 484.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then even worse, if I do, if I miss this window, then I'm penalized and I can't book  a future assignment.  Like to me, that's the big difference.

Start time: 484.58
End time: 497.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's true of UPS and FedEx as well.  Sometimes I'll get a package at eight in the evening because my poor UPS guy had so many  packages to deliver.  He's working a 14 hour shift trying to get them all out of the truck.

Start time: 498.16
End time: 507.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think that their quotas are quite as intense as the Amazon ones, although I'm  sure that they're bad.  I don't know if their labor practices are quite as poor.

Start time: 509.06
End time: 511.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can blame Amazon for this a little bit.

Start time: 512.00
End time: 549.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can blame Amazon because the UPS guy is doing what?  Delivering Amazon packages.  It's still the same thing at the end of the day.  I thought really about buying one of those blue trucks a couple of years ago when I was  getting rid of the co-working space.  And so that's the other thing, like Christina said in the beginning, a lot of the guys that  own the blue trucks, they might own it themselves or they work for the owner.  The owner can have five or six trucks.  So it's positive.  They're not employees and I get it, but they're really messing with the verbiage a little  bit, if you will.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 549.72
End time: 570.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not employees, but Amazon sets standards for those vendors.  So it's ultimately still an Amazon kind of thing because Amazon is telling those owners  of the blue trucks, they're saying if you don't have this delivery ratio, we won't keep  you as a vendor.  Do you think that's why Amazon has demanded that their drivers consent to surveillance

Start time: 570.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the vans?  Absolutely.

Start time: 572.96
End time: 600.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the whole Amazon ethos seems to be built around this McKinseyite thing of this  is how you must work most efficiently and that it completely ignores human problems,  but this is what you can do within a certain timeframe.  The Amazon cameras thing is just, A, it's great litigation cover for Amazon, but also  it enables the work time process thing to go on and people should be squeezed to the  last ounce.

Start time: 601.31
End time: 643.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, at least there's jobs, right?  And sometimes jobs, especially in some parts of the country, are hard to come by.  I wish that companies, even big companies like Amazon, would stop thinking of humans  as cogs in a machine because I think that's not a great way to treat people.  Yeah, not a very efficient one either.  It's like Lucy making chocolates at the conveyor belt.  And I guess it probably started with Henry Ford and the assembly line.  That was the first time humans were really seen as parts in a larger machine, not as  human beings, but as actual parts.

Start time: 644.84
End time: 725.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it goes back further than that, Leo.  We're not going to get into that, but I mean, there are things before the assembly line  where human labor was used.  And yeah, I think the difference is that we haven't seen like, it's weird because in  the United States, I think, at least from my perspective, and maybe this is my own  naiveté, but in the time that I've been alive, we haven't had a lot of manufacturing in  the United States.  It's mostly been outsourced.  And we still had some car plants and whatnot, but a lot of it had been outsourced.  And so this notion of a lot of the kind of some of the labor and I think some of the  labor policies were things that we as Westerners haven't had to think about because so  much of our stuff has been assembled in other countries where we hear about the poor labor  practices and we can rail against it, but we can also kind of forget about it because  we have that privilege of being like, well, it's not in my backyard.  Whereas when it comes to this fulfillment stuff and when it comes to a lot of these  logistical things and things that were formally referred to as gig working, I don't  think that that's really a correct term anymore.  We have to start taking these broader labor practices into account.  And a lot of the things that we look at are not very different than some of the labor  battles that unions and other labor groups fought for 50, 60, 100 years ago.

Start time: 726.98
End time: 734.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody in the chat room said it goes back to slaves in ancient Egypt building  the pyramids. I guess they were also cogs in a machine.

Start time: 734.56
End time: 780.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah. And well, it's funny because a lot of the stuff that happened in Middle  Asia happened long before the pyramids, too.  So it's been around for a hot minute.  One of the things that that comes to mind as well, though, is everyone hears these  stories and everyone gets the feels about it.  But then how many people are willing to go back to seven day shipping?  I mean, I'm OK with it. I like Hawaii.  I'm kind of used to it anyway.  But how many people where the most affected by this are actually willing to forgo  their instant gratification in order to do something about what has happened?  So I think part of this could go away if we all say, look, do we love pride?  No, but you can make your package come a day later.  No, right. Not giving up.

Transcript:  People know you're dead on.

Start time: 782.46
End time: 812.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. I don't mean cancel prime because that's not going to happen.  I love pride. Let's give us back.  Give it up. But I want it tomorrow.  Being instead of being 20 minutes or instead of being the next day, can we back it up  for day? You know, like, let's try add 24 hours to prime and see if that helps.  If that doesn't work, let's add another 24.  But, you know, let's not harm people.  And I don't think most of I don't think most of the people that have prime would  agree to that right now because they're so in love with I forgot it.  No biggie. I'll prime it.

Start time: 813.14
End time: 815.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's know you're dead on.  Let's change the same way.

Start time: 816.00
End time: 827.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Sorry. Let's change to some happy news.  Microsoft Build is coming up.  You've announced it officially.  That's going to be a big deal for you, right?  Because you deal with developers.  This is the big developer conference.

Start time: 827.66
End time: 834.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I deal with developers and I'm not 100 percent sure what my ship is going to be,  but I'm going to be one of the hosts that are live.  So, yeah, yeah.

Start time: 837.22
End time: 841.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Virtual again. Was there much discussion over whether to do this virtual or live?

Start time: 841.84
End time: 906.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that I don't think I don't think there was for this one.  I think it was we we had announced sometime last year that all of FY21, which is our fiscal year,  which ends July 1st, was going to be virtual events.  So we knew like from the offset, we had.  Yeah, exactly. So we had both of both ignites with the spring and the winter or the fall  at night were virtual.  Microsoft Build was virtual.  Last year was our first one we had to do.  It was a real all hands on deck sort of situation.  We were flying blind. We didn't really know what we were doing.  And this time we had.  You got it. Now we've done like four or five of them.  And the crew, we've been working with similar crews, similar writing staff, similar event programmers and whatnot.  So I feel like we have a good method down.  I'm very personally very hopeful that, obviously next year it will be back to in person.  But I don't think that the virtual component is ever going to go away.  And that is actually a good thing.

Start time: 906.66
End time: 939.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because, you know, we talk about it all the time as as journalists going to these events or people covering these events.  And for us, I think most people say this is great.  The information is more condensed.  It's easier to absorb.  I don't have to compete for a ticket or fly to Redmond or anywhere else.  So it's I like these virtual conferences a lot.  But I'm curious because I think there's some people want to want that hands on face to face.  And from your side, as somebody who's relating developers for Microsoft, you feel the same way.  You need that personal touch.

Start time: 939.62
End time: 997.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's it's I'm happy that it's not going to go away because in the past,  what we've done is we had like video, you know, we recorded sessions and we got to the point that we recorded all of our sessions  and we had like a live broadcast, you know, on the Internet.  But it was always kind of seen. The virtual experience was always a second class citizen.  And so if you're watching remotely and we know this as journalists, we know this as people who can't attend every conference.  You know, you didn't really feel like you were there. It was always kind of an afterthought.  And and I used to produce the, you know, Channel 9 Live or the Build Live show.  And then that became the show, which was kind of funny, you know, that that model kind of became the show.  And which was fun for me to kind of see.  But it was also kind of scary because you're like, this was this thing we sort of did in private that had no adult supervision.  And now this is the real thing. And so a lot of other people who were better at stuff than we got involved.

Start time: 998.00
End time: 1009.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny to watch because Channel 9 for a long time, really, people didn't even know about it.  It was really great. It was like this skunkworks thing completely suddenly.  It's front. You're right. It's front and center.

Start time: 1010.60
End time: 1062.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the stuff that we were doing before has kind of become the model.  So on the one hand, I'm really glad that we're not going to be abandoning that,  because I think that, as you said, more people than ever can attend.  It is more flexible and it just works.  Having said that, I personally and this has always been the case for me in conferences.  There's so much value that I get not so much from attending the sessions in person,  although there can be some of that might be able to have the opportunity to ask a question or there's a really amazing demo.  And you're like, oh, I see it and I'm there.  But it's the sideways. It's like the hallway conversations.  It's the serendipitous meeting of people.  It's that stuff that to me has always been the biggest value of any conference.  And that's whether it's something like Microsoft Build or WWDC or something like South by Southwest or Macworld,  which is, I believe, where you and I first met.  Those are the things where you meet people.

Start time: 1063.54
End time: 1069.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point. I knew about you from Twitter, but it wasn't until we met.  That's when you make the real relationship start.

Start time: 1069.44
End time: 1074.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. So that's the thing.  The parties, the hallway conversations, the serendipitous things.

Start time: 1074.94
End time: 1080.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember you sitting on the floor at Macworld Expo, eating your lunch and coming up to you saying, film girl.

Start time: 1083.12
End time: 1124.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember that very well.  Yep. And yeah, like there's a conference I go to in Portland called XOXO.  It's my favorite conference. It's my absolute favorite.  And there are people, there are relationships I've met there.  There are people who I don't ever see any time other than at XOXO.  We don't ever talk outside of that, but we somehow run into each other at XOXO, have a great time.  And those are the things you can't capture virtually.  And I don't think you should capture virtually.  But I do feel like from a conference perspective, the content itself shouldn't be siloed and behind a wall,  where you have to fly out and pay the ticket.

Start time: 1125.12
End time: 1147.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These developer conferences are so big.  There's usually a lottery to get in, not everybody who wants to can.  Exactly.  And that's what's been great. It's really democratized this.  So Build, it's now official, is the 25th of May, starts.  And Microsoft also announced that the campus is not going to open until September 7th.  It was going to open in July.  That also seems sensible.

Start time: 1148.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1149.52
End time: 1158.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the hurry, right?  Or is Microsoft going to do what other companies have done and said, look,  I think they said what, three days a week you can work at home, something like that.

Start time: 1158.58
End time: 1171.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's going to be a hybrid model.  And what they'd announced before is that we can, they're much more open to people,  especially it depends on what team you're on.  Not every team can work this way, but they're much more open to people working from a real locations.

Start time: 1172.22
End time: 1174.64

Transcript:  Ian's laughing at this because he's never left his house.

Start time: 1175.38
End time: 1222.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right. But historically, and this was weird to me,  I moved from New York to Seattle to take the job at Microsoft.  And it was a little odd to me because I thought it was such a big company and they knew they had offices all over the place.  I figured Microsoft would be a really remote friendly place.  And some teams were, and the team that I work on was before any of this, we had people all over the world.  But there were certain teams where it was very much like, if you want to work on this team, you have to be in Redmond.  And that's changed.  Really?  Yeah, not for every team, but that's changed.  And I think that's going to continue to change.  But I think the model going forward is going to be a hybrid, which I personally appreciate because I like being able to work from home.  But I'm not going to lie, I live, you know, I pay a lot of money in rent and I live in a relatively small apartment.

Start time: 1222.38

Start time: 1224.88
End time: 1255.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I would I would think about it.  But I think for what I do, I still they still need me on campus to do in studio stuff and things like that.  But I like the idea of being able to work from home a couple of days and then go into an office.  The thing that I've missed and it's been difficult for me is that, like, I've given up half my living space for work.  And so you lose the whole separation of you never off.  That's what I'm saying, right?  Like, you know, you don't have that separation.

Start time: 1256.20
End time: 1266.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, change in this one.  Yeah. I mean, I've gone from now.  It's basically eight to eight days.  And yeah, OK, I don't spend two hours sitting on bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually why I still come into the studio.  I don't have to. But I but I want to make a distinction between being at home.  Right. Very early on when I started doing the radio show, I realized I could do it at home.  And I did at first.  But the energy level was terrible because I would kind of be in my jammies.  And I slump over into the studio and I start doing the show.  And it just there's something about getting dressed, getting in the car,  driving to the office and doing it just sets.  It's the set and setting that really gets you up for the show.  Doc Rock, you are we work at home all the time. Right.

Transcript:  Well, no, mine's a hybrid.  So I am going to agree with you 100 percent that working in the house  could be dangerous because working in the house, it's easy to like show up  with like half dressed and, you know, party down the bottom.  Yeah, it's just not you're not in the right thing.  It's the mullet of the wardrobe. Right.  So here's what I did.  And this has been the best thing I've ever done in my condo.  There's a commercial section in the bottom.  OK, so I rented a commercial space in the bottom of my condo.  So you have a little business center downstairs.  Yes. That's really even quarantine.  I can just ride the elevator down, cut through the back  where the garbage things are and never be illegally outside.  You know what I mean?  Like so I can come to my studio.  So I have my studio here in the basement of my condo.  But it is separate enough that I can be in a different frame of reference.  When I come downstairs, this is my studio.  I do work. But if I get hungry in the middle of the day or, you know,  in the time that you do a commercial, I can seriously run upstairs,  go to the loo and then run back downstairs and be done.  So, yeah, I'm kind of in a good space because it's half half.  And I didn't have to take over any space in the house.  And so I guess that's been that's brilliant.

You know, you've got to actually get.  I feel the urge to brush my teeth before doing the news meeting on video.  You know, it's just you've got to set some standards.

Transcript:  Although I would say, I mean,  I'm definitely an extrovert, so that's my own bias there.  But I have a lot of friends who consider themselves introverts  or sometimes like a weird kind of hybrid thing  where they appear to be extroverts, but are really introverts or whatever.  And I think that some people have thrived, but some people when you  because this has been such a traumatic experience for all of us.  It hasn't been kind of the normal thing.  I wonder how many of these people have truly thrived in that way  and how much of it is like.  The lack of any sort of interaction at all.  And then the interaction you do have has been like this space between you.  Like, I actually I actually wonder how much people really thrive,  because we are social creatures.

But in fact, there's I'm looking at a post from late last year,  Psypost, psychology post, introverts fearing worse than extroverts,  probably because we feel like, oh, this is good.  We should enjoy this.  But even an introvert needs to be around people if they don't even if  even if we sit in the corner shyly and don't talk to anybody.

They don't get the opportunity to shut people down.  You're actually feeling part of their tinkerbell.  You don't get to feel superior to other people.  Yeah. Yeah. So you take that away.  I guarantee you it has the fact is I'm joking. Yes.  But that's also I think most of my introvert fans love the shutdown  and they don't get to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great city, but they're asking for 50,000 people to come into the city.  Seems like a bad idea.  Absolutely insane with no vaccination reports at all.  Now, OK, I love conferences as we were talking before.  I miss them a lot.  Lobby con, you know, the rest of it.  But seriously, Mobile World Congress, Google said it's pulling out.

And one by one, all of the big attendees said, you know, we're not going to go.  So they shut down.  And it was, I think, the very first conference to say, yeah, we can't do it.  Then how did the very first conference to go back?  And I note on their web page, they've got a big statement from Verizon CEO saying,  we can't wait.

Transcript:  I wonder how much of this was like contractually bound, maybe based on  like their commitments to some of the locations or, you know, like  like prepayments or other things, because it seems awfully soon,  especially as Ian points out, you don't have any vaccination rates beyond that.  This is an international conference where you have people from all over the world.  And we were talking before the show about, you know, what the process has been  in the United States.  But to be honest, at least based on people I've been talking to globally, as bad as  the U.S. has been with everything pandemic and coronavirus, and we've been one of the  worst countries to deal with it, we have a better handle, at least, I think, you  know, on a vaccinating number of people than because we bought all the vaccines

So so I look at something like Mobile World Congress, where most of the  attendees, I mean, because I've been to that conference a number of times and  it's a great conference, but it is an international conference.  So you're talking about not just bringing in 50,000 people, but 50,000 people from  regions that might not have vaccinations at all, might not have other things into  an area where we don't know what the vaccination rates going to even be.  Like, I just feel like for the city of Barcelona, if I were a citizen in Barcelona,  I'd be pretty angry, to be honest.

But nobody goes outside. I really miss conferences.  So I would love to see this stuff get straightened out.  You know, I had just planned this time last year to go to Seattle.  I would have been just on my way back, actually.  And then I had planned to go to two of the big YouTube conferences.  And, you know, it's just weird to get those taken away.  I was going through photos today and I remember Macworld 2013.  I came to go visit.  Oh, yeah.  Excellent. Yeah, there you are in the studio.  So like just the idea of missing stuff like that or, you know,  coming to do a lot of taping or the hallway track again.  Like we talk about it all the time.  And that's what Clubhouse kind of reminds me of.  It reminds me of the club.  I mean, the hallway track at conferences, but it's just not the same.  Sitting on the floor, crappy, expensive coffee from the Marriott vendor  and waiting for your keynote or brushing up on your speech or, you know,  write articles really fast.  Yeah. Yeah.

So the last macro was 2014.  The massive explosion in Apple sort of happened at late 14, 15, maybe early 16.  So I think they would have come back just as a hey, thank you guys.

We don't need to be at this smaller show because we're everywhere.  Right. Like I feel like I mean, we saw similar things with CES, like  like Microsoft left CES, Intel left CES.  There were a lot of big companies that left CES and CES changed.  Microsoft was back at CES virtually this year.  I don't remember what our exact involvement was.  But, you know, but it's you see this happen where companies realize  you can go direct to the audience rather than having to be part of these other things.  But you do lose that community touchstone.  And I feel like something like the Mac, that's that's a real shame.  Apple's always had an arrogance problem.

It's just like, yeah, that's where mistakes like the butterfly keyboard happen.  Oh, exactly. And the same with the screen problem that emerged this week as well.  Yeah, they're getting, you know, it's like this is how it should be done.  Get used to it.  You're going to have to carry around 20 dongles or whatever.

Yeah, I just click the download link.  You can stop asking me now.  But it's going to always do that from now on.  That's Safari.  There's a lot of very problematic decisions about what you can write to.  Every time you want to write.  I wanted to I tried to store my home directory on an external drive.  Don't ever do that, kids, because Apple just doesn't want you to do that.  And so there's all sorts of roadblocks to, frankly,  I was talking about this before the show, got rid of my iMac and got a PC  not to run Windows. I'm sorry, Christina, but to run Linux,  because I feel like Linux is the last place where you can do what you want to do.  And there's there's downsides to that, I admit.

Yeah, I get that they made it so that I don't have to ask  as many answer as many questions to my sisters and my mom anymore.  They can just do it by themselves.  But then there's certain things that you miss.  And the same thing with the idea of over shrinking everything.  Right. Like I'm the big dude.  Like I didn't mind it when the laptop weighed a pound and a half.  I didn't need to carry that.  I can't even need it to be the, you know, like  point seven ounces in a super flat and thin bezel made out of a single piece  of aluminum, you know, like I didn't need that.  And it's funny, my friends and I were talking about buying the domain  Mac dongle's and a parody show over one billion with a bunch of.  Yeah, because we definitely I mean, you need a dongle for everything.  And I mean, OK, get it is when you want the minimalist desk, it looks dope.

And I might regret this because Apple's next IMAX,  which will come out probably at WWDC in June, also a virtual conference,  will be a 32 inch bezel list, chinless display.  But I like the idea of separating the computer from display.  I want a different kind of display.  You all are doing that.  And I feel like Apple is kind of where Microsoft was.

Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  I am so if you're a business owner and you're hiring, I am.  Thank you. Thank you.  We're coming back. Thank you.  But, you know, it's funny, you probably forgot  what a pain in the butt hiring is.  All those phone calls sifting through all those resumes.  And then you always feel like I know the right person is out there,  but how do I reach them?  That's why you got it. You got to try Zip Recruiter.  Zip Recruiter immediately post.  It's it's it posts to 100 plus job boards  with one post with one click of the mouse.  So right there, you know, it's not a needle in the haystack.  You got there's there's a lot of needles out there  and the haystacks a lot smaller.  Not enough applicants with the right skills or experience.  Oh, trust me, they're out there.  Too many resumes to sort through.  Don't worry, Zip Recruiter doesn't send them all into your mailbox  or your phone.  It it handles it all in the Zip Recruiter interface.  They even reformat the resumes so you can scan them quickly.  Not knowing where the the person who's looking for work is.  Don't worry, their zip recruiter reaches them all.  Hiring feels like trying to find a needle in a haystack,  but Zip Recruiter comes through.  In fact, one of the things they do, they have matching technology.

The Jedi contract may be up again for grabs,  but Microsoft just got a big contract with the US Army  for one hundred twenty thousand plus HoloLens units.  A contract worth twenty two billion dollars.  Wow. What is it?  Do you know what the Army is going to use?  Goals. Yeah, that's a that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I know that the HoloLens has been really successful in industry.  It's one of those products that I think,  especially the way that was originally introduced.  And I was at the original launch.  And I remember talking to people on that team that it was very much made to be  like, oh, this is going to be a consumer thing.  And then obviously never was some of the mixed reality headsets  have had more of a consumer appeal, but never hasn't really taken off that way.  But it's been very successful in industries.  And we've seen it in construction and we've seen it in like logistics and other stuff.  So I guess it makes sense that the Army would want to do something with it.  But they don't tell me anything.

Transcript:  They're smart enough to like not tell me stuff like this.  Well, let me read the Army's statement, because they're a little more forthcoming.  They say the equipment is made up of high resolution.  It's not your papa's HoloLens.  It's made up of high resolution night, thermal and soldier borne sensors  integrated into a unified heads up display.  I mean, you could think if this thing is robust, this would be.  And they plan to use it both both for training, but also in combat  so that close combat force personnel can rehearse before engaging any adversaries.  So it'll help you fight as well as train.  And, you know, I've you've seen we've seen pictures of combat  personnel wearing night vision goggles and things like that.  If this thing is robust and reliable.  Huge benefit, I would imagine.  I mean, maps, situational awareness,  thermal imaging, it would be incredible.

You've got night vision.  They don't. And you can get after it.  I gave a in fact, I gave Twitter very  excitable interview after trying the first HoloLens back when it was launched.  It was just like, this is brilliant.  And it really is.  If they've got it into a usable AR format,  Microsoft could actually steal a march on this.  Google tried it failed.  Oculus tried it has failed.  Maybe it's Microsoft's turn.

Transcript:  As the resident soldier here, here's what's going to  what I think is going to be dope.  And I think every time these stories come up, that's right.  You served in Iraq. I forgot. Yeah.  You're the expert.  Kuwait, but Kuwait.  OK, the the idea, the guys that are entering the service now  grew up playing games like Halo, where this was part of the deal. Right.  So bringing their most training that they probably had more than anything else.  Some of us are still doing it. Right.  Being able to bring that environment to a soldier is going to make them better  because you don't even you won't have to spend a lot of time training that  because a lot of the people have been training that for many, many, many years.  So being able to know that, you know, my my friends are on my six, they're OK.  Know who has how much rounds they have left because of telemetry in their weaponry.  I can be like, OK, this guy only has four rounds.  Look, I want you to fall back and watch the back.  This guy still has a full clip.  I want you to come in.  I want you to cover flank.  You know what I mean?  So like I can take inventory.  I could check on my guys. I can see my stats.  I can look back and I can be like, report your heart rate is up.  What's going on? You good?  And you're like, yeah, yeah, I'm good. Just a little nervous.  OK, look, if you're nervous, I want you to pull middle and just watch Ariel.  Right. And I'll get somebody that's a little bit more situated to cover point.  Right. You know what I'm saying?  Other than guys lying and say, no, I'm good.  I'm good. And then not really able to do what they need to do.  Right. So as a sergeant and I'm running my platoon,  if I got all of their data running by on the screen, I can make way better decisions.  And it's OK, because a lot of guys, until they see their contact, they're nervous.  Once they see their contact, they drop in, they're settled.  They're you know, what we call fit the fight. Right.  So I would love to be able to see all of that.  Or even as a medic, like to get an alert from some situational thing on my head  to tell me that, you know, someone's down, I can get to them quicker.  Do you like what so much I could do with this?

Transcript:  If it's reliable.  Yeah, you know, I remember in Vietnam, I was lucky enough not to have to serve.  My draft number was very high, but a lot of my friends and we certainly heard  about in the news, those M16s would jam.  And there's nothing worse.  You're in a firefight and your gun is jammed.  I worry. And these are much more high tech devices.  But I guess you would train to both have them and not have them.  Absolutely. Yeah, you would train them.  And not have them. Absolutely.

Start time: 2957.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you would train for all contingencies like we've been trained  for what to do when there's no sound radio silence.  So in all the games or in every movie, they make it a point to show you the  the hand signals.  Those exist because there's times when you have to go radio.  That's right. That's right.  The reason why night vision goggles was such a boom  is because before what we would do is throw illumination  grenade in the air, which has a small parachute.  It comes down and turns the lights on for a second.  We can do what we need to do.  Sometimes we just throw it.  Take a look. OK, we know where everything is and then go when it gets dark again.  So there's that you always train for both aspects of it.

It's been controversial at Microsoft, even more so at Google,  doing defense contract work.  But I would hope.  I mean, this used to be, you know, the patriotic duty of American corporations.  You know, Ford started making tanks  during World War Two to support our troops.  I would hope that this would be a non-controversial technology.  Have you heard anything at Microsoft about people saying,  oh, we don't want to be making this for the Army?

I think that kind of says it all.  And that's, I think, completely appropriate.  It's it's cool.  My only concern would be I don't think of the HoloLens as being rugged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it looks like they've they've adapted.  They clearly have recognized it.  It seems what they've said. Right.  And I'm sure that with the size of the contract, they'll do more R&D on that.  Like, I know completely different use case, obviously.  But I do know that, like, they created a hard hat versions of the HoloLens  for construction sites that worked really well.  So they can adapt it, obviously, and they'll need to do more than that.  You know, for people who are in different  conditions where where you might be using this on missions.

Transcript:  I was thinking firefighters.  Firefighters.  When you're talking.  Yeah, I think firefighters would be amazing.  I am I interviewed a New York City,  a battalion chief and got to know about what their process is for fighting fires.  And so much of it is it's all information based.  And they certainly don't want to rely on technology because they have to do  what's there in the field, but they can be aided by it.  And so but, you know, you think about like having thermal imaging and having,  you know, access to maybe a map of what a location might look like  or direct communications or, you know, oxygen levels or other things.  Like it can be really, really useful for firefighters.  Obviously, they can't rely exclusively on that stuff.  They still have to use their own instincts, their own knowledge.  But having that, I think would be fantastic.  And there are all kinds of, you know, situations where if you have to adapt  something like that to work in certain weather conditions and in certain,  you know, like lower powered, you know, or conditions where you might have access  to, you know, a power supplier or whatever, where you could really open up  how this could be used absent, you know, of looking at it in a military context.

And and, you know, look, it's not a peaceful world.  And sometimes the best path to peace is a strong defense as well.  So I think this seems like a very good thing all around.  From for Microsoft, for the army and for future uses of the hollow ones.  I'm glad that I'm glad to hear about it.  Anyway, oh, it would be nice if you could put Cortana in your earpiece and she could say,  you know, I don't know, I just like when I play Halo, I expect a little help.  Not anymore. Cortana's gone.

Everybody has that one cousin and you defend them  because well, you have to because grandma's saying  you have to because you because they're family.  The thing to me, the reason why Siri will always be last place  in poor Siri is because it was originally set up  knowing that there was privacy screen.  Oh, I think that there was going to be a screen. Right. Right.  And the other guys came after the fact.  Oh, that's interesting.  So Apple thought Siri was going to have a screen.

But initially, Siri always know, hey, OK, here's the answer. Look at it.  So the most frustrating things about Siri is here's the answer.  Look at it. And I'm like, woman, if I could look at it, I wouldn't have asked you.  You know, I got my hands covered in like dough or, you know, something that I'm doing.  My hands are covered in dough.  Yeah. I'm like, yeah, can you convert, you know, how many tablespoons  to whatever, you know, the Japanese measurement is?  And she's like, OK, look.  And I'm like, not look. You're over there.  I got my hated when they do that. Yeah.  So that's why. And so whereas the lady or, you know, the OK frugal  will just speak it out because they were always speaker born.  And so that's a good point.  Defense for Siri.  But she's still kind of little stupid.

Then if you're setting up a new device, it's going to, I guess, be randomized,  but it's not going to automatically default to the to the classic female voice.  They also added two new voices.

Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  We got more to talk about, of course, with these guys.  It's just, you know, whatever you want to talk about, they're always the best.  Great to have Doc Rock, Ian Thompson.  Christina Warren, our show today brought to you by Express.  VPN.  I you know, this is a sponsor that is near and dear to all of our listeners' hearts,  I think, because you more than anybody I know care about privacy.  And thanks to the Internet, that's privacy is tough.  Everything you browse for, everything you search for, you  watch your tweet is just known.  You might want to keep some of that your own business,  but in an era where everyone's online, you know, it's not automatic.  Your Internet service provider can see what you're doing.  They often log it and sell it.  If you want to be protected, you need Express VPN.  That's what I used to keep my data private.  Now, you might see, well, wouldn't any VPN work new?  Because the VPN now is getting all that data  you're depriving Google and your Internet service provider of.  And many VPNs, especially the cheap and free ones, will do the same thing.  They'll sell it, not Express VPN.  They guarantee no logging.  They're absolutely private.  In fact, they go the extra mile to prove it.  First of all, they have regular audits by an independent third party,  PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Aren't those the same people that add the Academy Award ballots?  I think so. You can trust them.  They have not only audited the ExpressVPN privacy policy and said, yep,  they have audited their trusted server technology, which I think is really cool.  This is a company that's so committed to your privacy.  They modified their way the VPN server works.  So it runs only in memory.  When you press the big button on the ExpressVPN app to go online,  you're spinning up whatever server you choose.  You're spinning up that trusted server technology runs in RAM in a sandbox.  It can't write to disk no matter what.  It cannot keep track of anything you're doing.  And then when you exit, it's gone out of memory, out of sight, out of mind.  It's gone. There is no record.  That's the kind of VPN you want.  Data harvesters will use your IP address.  Like every time you do a Google search, they know exactly where it comes from.  They see your IP address unless you're using ExpressVPN.  Then they think, well, we don't know who he is or she is because that's a VPN.  If with ExpressVPN, all of your data is routed through an encrypted server,  which means your IP address is masked.  You're given a random IP address shared by other ExpressVPN customers.  So third parties really don't know who you are.  And it's easy to use ExpressVPN because it runs everywhere.  Even your smart TV.  There's iPhone, great apps on the iPhone and Android device.  Very easy to use laptop desktop.  You can even put ExpressVPN on your router in many cases,  which means the whole house is protected.  Just tap one button. You're safe.  That's why I choose ExpressVPN.  I'm not alone. It's the number one VPN  rated that way by wired by CNET.  I've been using it for a long time now.  And it's fast enough to watch HD video anywhere in the world.  And I think that's really important.  So if you're like me and you believe your data is your business,  secure yourself with the number one rated VPN on the market.  It's the only one I recommend.  The only one I use ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  You'll get three extra months free with a one year package.  See why Wired CNET and others have picked ExpressVPN as the best  ex PR ESS VPN dot com slash twit.  Get the number one trusted VPN ExpressVPN dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  See, good. I'm glad she didn't have to pee in a bottle.  She got up. She was responsible.  She got what you get a beer.

Well, no, I have too much sugar in my diet.  But so and now when I drink regular soda, it it's just too sweet.  I can't do it.  So the only soda that doesn't make me like hate myself is diet Dr. Pepper.  So I usually drink La Croix, but I'm going to drink.  I almost thought it might be either La Croix or Topo Chico.

Transcript:  So who doesn't have a clubhouse clone now?  Let's let's count the ways.  Twitter's got one, right?  Facebook's got one.  Mark Cuban's got one.  Discord's got one.  Discord just announced backstage.  Spotify bought locker rooms, so they're going to have, I guess, really, the only,  you know, clubhouse is no longer the unique.  Why is it? No.  What's so good about it?

Start time: 4234.46
End time: 4247.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's because it's a feature and not a thing.  I mean, it's kind of like Snapchat stories, right?  Like everybody has moved on from cloning.  I think Aaron Lovey of Box said this.  He was like, you know, all the engineers who are making stories, clones  cannot move into making clubhouse clones.  And I was like, oh, yeah, that's completely correct.

Transcript:  That's the part that kills it.  But you know, it's funny is we had Voxer back in the day.  It's nothing new, is it?  I mean, Voxer was just pushed to talk.  I mean, it's kind of a little bit different, but that was, you know,  ground zero for, you know, the last couple of conferences  was getting around on Voxer and catching everyone.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is more ephemeral.  I mean, I think that that's one of the big things that's different about it  is the ephemeral nature.

Start time: 4288.82
End time: 4293.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 4333.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the case with a lot of them.  And I feel like and I don't know how the different clones are going to work.  I feel like, though, that's the sticky thing with Clubhouse.  Think if you add recording into it, which just makes it a podcast,  that ruins it like the appeal, at least for me.  And I've been using it  since March or April of last year is that I don't use it all the time.  I can't live on it.  Some people who live on it, I don't know how they can do that.  But the appeal for me is like, if you miss it, you miss it.  But if you're there, you're actually part of something that's organic and ephemeral.  And I feel like that's that's unique that you don't have with some of those other things.

You know, it's like, you had to record a certain, you know, TV shows  or discussion shows were only shown at a certain time of the week and you had to be there.  And if you didn't record it, that was it.  You lost out on the whole thing.

Transcript:  Well, I was going to say it's the whole fallacy of choice concepts, right?  Or the paradox of choice concept, right?  Like when you have access to everything, it becomes really difficult to make any decision.  And then this is discovery has been the the I believe one of the primary  like like just problems that have been facing.  It's all too easy.  It's all because you have access to it all.  You know, you need curation.  You need a good discovery experience.

Start time: 4435.18
End time: 4449.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say Clubhouse is running on that, too, because there are now so many rooms and  so many people and so many things.  This is, I think, what what TikTok is brilliant at is that they're  their algorithm for their discovery.  Yes. For discovery is just bananas.

So I've been finding some gems, which I never would have searched.  Oh, good. Just popped up in my head.  And I'm currently addicted to a show by four friends who just started hiking everywhere.  And it's called Adventure Archives.  And it was a random bump up in my feed.  And it's incredible.  And then there's really something cool, which you would probably dig, Leo.  This dude bought a ghost town.  I saw that. Oh, my goodness.  Fixing it up. That's better than regular TV.

It's like cartoons mixed with basketball.  I don't get it.  But if it hit you at that right age, you can.  I have a new theory. If I were a car, if I wanted to, if I were a carny,  and I were looking for a gig, I would ask you your favorite song,  your favorite movie, your favorite, I know, comic book.

In fact, the only April Fools joke I saw, I hate it.  By the way, everybody who works in tech journalism, it backed me up on the scene.  Hates it worse because you don't know what to believe.  March 29th, Volkswagen of America put out a press release.  I thought, well, it's March 29th.  They even said it's not an April Fools joke  that they were going to rename Volkswagen of America.  Volt Swaggin with a T.  Yeah. So they made a few strategic mistakes.  They released it three days too early.  By the way, I love the verge  from the company that brought you Dieselgate.  That is good. There were people upset about it.  I was upset only because I believed it, because it wasn't April Fools.  Gosh darn it.  Well, it was March 29th Fools.

And they're suing IBM again over Unix.  What? Are you serious?  So we did this story.  It was just like we got so many comments in the forum section.

Transcript:  You know, it's a funny you should say that, Leo, because when OK,  first of all, the first chance I was ever going to buy a stock,  I was going to buy Apple and it was like four dollars.  And this was during the Schiller years.  And everybody was like, no, don't do it.  I was like, I'm just going to throw like 400 bucks at it.  It won't be that big a deal.  If I ever lose the money, no biggie.  And everybody was like, no. So I did it.  And the second one was when you still have the Apple stock.  No, because when I left Apple from working there,  I sold it because I was going into tech journalism, working at T.U.A.W.  You had to. Right.  And you had to say, oh, my God, you used to say all the time that,  you know, all the, you know, ethical tech journalists,  they don't carry the stocks of the stuff they talk about.  And I got there for my fault.  And I was the one to I wanted to be Leo.  So I completely sold it all.  And then like a year and a half later,  it will shut us down and tried to make us become a gadget,  which wasn't happening.  And then I found out later on, a lot of guys never really sold their stock,  which is maybe illegal. I get it.

And at one point, Halsey and everybody.  There was only four of us.  They they kind of ran low on money.  They said, if you put in ten thousand dollars, we'll give you a quarter of it.  And I had just bought a house.  I said, yeah. And I didn't think there was much.  But ten thousand dollars, a quarter of CNET would have been worth.

Start time: 5364.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would.  And then I made the mistake.  I bet for you, it would have paid off for me.  I bought my national stock.  And when they sold zero.

But anybody who was earlier.  Which exactly. But anybody who was in earlier was screwed.  Employees were obviously going to be screwed.  My grants were worthless.

Transcript:  I mean, and and and and and I mean, I had some  what turned out to be incorrect, let's say insider information that,  I mean, serves me right. I got burned.  But it was one of those things where, you know, you work at a place for seven years,  you help build it. You don't want to walk away with like nothing.  You know, it's a risk.  But I still didn't necessarily anticipate it to be, you know, the way that it ended.  But I'm much happier.  Let me just say, like working for a public company who doesn't issue me grants,  but like doesn't issue me like the opportunity to buy.  But I don't get options. Shares.  Oh, I get shares better. Yeah, exactly.  I get shares. So which much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the last thing. Yeah, you could have been Mark Cuban,  but also could have been it could have gone the other way.  I mean, that's the thing is that you always remember those those instances  where we could have won. Yeah.  But we don't ever think about the opportunity because it's like you could have lost  if you'd invested. Right.  So like on the one hand, like it sucks to be like, oh, I lost.  I sold this Apple stock and yeah, I made a profit, but it could have been bigger.  And you don't look at the situations where like, what if I'd worked at BlackBerry?  Right. And I had that when I got all that blackberry stock.  And now it's worth like seven dollars. Right.  Like so by knocking it out.

Apple, of course, has always made the iPhone chips,  but now they're making their desktop chips.  Google and almost all almost all the other Android manufacturers  have not been using Google's been using Qualcomm chips.  Samsung, I think, is the only one that makes their own chips the Exynos.  And in fact, it looks like Google's Whitechapel chip will be made in partnership  with Samsung. It's not going to be an Exynos,  but it will be Google's own.  There are real advantages if you're a big enough company to do this  and you have the wherewithal to do this.  There have been some rumors of Microsoft might be doing their own thing as well.

Transcript:  And in turn, this. Go ahead.  So this has been the problem with Pixel phones for a while now.  I mean, when they were the Nexus range, they were very generic.  And generic. Yeah.  And they went the Apple route.  And now it seems like they're going back to their original route.  Not very expensive.  Strip down. Still going on.  But the new chip thing is going to be really interesting.

Start time: 5719.92

Start time: 5725.36
End time: 5795.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes complete sense.  What would be interesting to me about this less so much like the  some of the prowess of the chip itself, because I'm assuming it's still going to be using  just standard ARM architecture.  Of course, it will be.  But I'm just saying, like, I'm assuming that it's going to be based on the existing  platforms would be if they're doing certain stuff that the Google  software is then explicitly going to be tuned to.  Right. Like that to me becomes the interesting case where you're saying, OK,  are we building in some things into our hardware design that our software is going  to be specifically tuned to around memory management or around, you know, like  the way that we handle security or the way that we do AI or on board,  you know, processing or whatever, because that's what makes the the Apple stuff  so special is all the software and hardware integration.  And if this is also going to be used on Chromebooks, that becomes really interesting,  too. And in my mind, lets me think, you know, I've been predicting this for years  and as of a lot of other people.  But like this makes it seem like it's going to become much closer to getting that  fusion between the Chrome OS and the Android platforms.

Start time: 5795.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and I'm surprised that the Chrome OS or the Chrome  EAM Chromebook style OS hasn't migrated to phones faster.  It will be really huge for them if they would get this straightened out sooner  rather than later. You want Chrome OS to run on a phone?  Well, only just due to the fact that it adds another option.  And there are literally people right now who are in limbo.  They're not super stoked about iOS. They're not stoked about Android.  They want something else. And Windows phone was good.

Transcript:  But I think, you know, and I remember talking to somebody from Huawei  when Huawei announced we're not going to sell phones in the US.  And she told me the reason very simply is you cannot make it  in the United States unless your cell phones are sold in carrier stores.  It just won't make it because people aren't too few.  People do what we do and go maybe to the Google site and buy a phone  or go on Amazon, buy a phone.  Everybody goes to the carrier stores.  And so Huawei gave up.  And that's probably hurt the Google Pixel.  And it's massively hurt them with Microsoft.  You know, they were too little, too late.  And even though they were in the stores, I heard time and time again,  you'd go in a store, say, I want a Windows phone.  And they'd say, no, no, you want the Samsung.

Oh, God, I forget the guy's name.  He used to do it for a super big guy from Michigan.  So we should just fight about Michigan and Notre Dame all day.

And I would just have mine out of my hands.  And I would sell out the entire stock in usually about two and a half hours  just by showing people the iPod.  That was all they needed to do. They just needed to see it.  But we didn't have any on display.  And so I would make bets with people like, how long, how long is it going to take me  to sell the 15 iPods we have?  And the same thing with sidekick.  It would be like I would just like show people my sidekick and they would be like,  signing up, getting a T-Mobile plan.  That was the bump.

Transcript:  Twitter now also available in several colors of unapologetic plastic.  We're so proud of that.  Thank you, Jim Cutler.  Our show today brought to you by Gabby Insurance.  How would you like to save two thousand dollars next year  on your home insurance or your auto insurance?  You've probably seen the ads for Gabby.  Let me tell you, I saw the ads and we had just the day before  gotten a notice that our home insurance was going to go up eight thousand dollars.  And I said, honey, I'm going with Gabby.  I had promised I would do the the shopping for a better insurance policy  because we didn't want to pay the extra eight thousand dollars.  When I realized I had to go one by one to something like 40 different  home insurance sites and each one required me to reenter the same data  over and over and over again.  By the way, Gabby says there it's on average  eleven hundred keystrokes per site to get a quote and one by one.  Plus, they never make it comparable.  So it's really it's very hard to shop your own insurance.  Gabby has made it easy.  They've actually gone out.  They've they've encouraged insurance companies to create APIs  so that the Gabby software can go out and do this automatically for you in minutes.  How would you like to keep an extra nine hundred sixty one dollars a year in your pocket?  That's how much on average Gabby customers save on car and home insurance.  I thought Gabby was great.  In fact, I threw in our car insurance as well.  Now, I should explain so you don't get thrown by this that the way they get your car,  there's no keystroke entries because the way they get your car insurance details  and your home insurance details is you you give them the logins to your insurance companies.  They get the information from them, of course, completely safe, completely private.  But that way they are going to compare apples to apples.  They're going to apply for exactly the same kind of insurance.  Give you a quote from 40 of the top insurance providers,  the big guys, progressive and nationwide and travelers.  They immediately came back to us and said, we could save you two thousand dollars on your home insurance.  The other thing I like, they also came back and said, but by the way,  you're getting the best price we could find on car insurance.  That made me feel pretty good.  It's like, OK, good, I don't have to change my car insurance.  But we did. We did change our home insurance thanks to Gabby.  We went through the whole process.  They connected with the insurance company.  They got us the quote.  They sometimes you may have to talk to an underwriter.  That's that's sometimes the way the insurance companies require you do it.  But all you have to do is link your current insurance accounts.  You're going to get a quotes in a few minutes.  It'll match the coverage you have.  That's why it's really important to use Gabby.  If you want to move forward with one of the quotes, the insurance company you selected  will, of course, review the details, confirm the final price.  That price may change depending on what information they find out.  And sometimes you have to speak with a Gabby agent.  We didn't have to. It actually went very smoothly, very easy.  And it saved me an immense amount of time and two thousand dollars a year.  I mean, that's fantastic.  Now, on average, nine hundred sixty one dollars.  I was very pleased we saved twice that.  Wouldn't that be nice to have in your pocket?  If they can't find you savings, they'll let you know.  So you don't have to, you know, worry about it.  And they promise they will never sell your info.  And I can vouch for that because I gave them that info, but I've received no spam.  I gave them a special email and special phone number.  And that number has been dead silent ever since.  No spam, no robocalls, nothing.  They protect your information.  I wanted to check them out. I really did.  And I am happy to say it worked great.  You know, you probably are overpaying on your car and home insurance.  The insurance companies count on the fact that it's not easy for you to shop it.  Well, now it is. And it's good news for consumers.  Let Gabby do the work. See how much they can save you.  It costs you nothing to do it. It's easy.  You're not bound into an insurance contract until the final step.  And you say so. No obligation.  Gabi.com slash twit.  I cannot speak more highly of this.  This thing works. Absolutely.  And actually, I think I want to support them because they are by their success.  They are really pushing insurance companies to offer these kinds of APIs.  And that's good for consumers.  You're we're all going to benefit from Gabby.  You could benefit right now.  Gabby.com slash twit. Gabi.com slash twit.  This is where technology can really do a lot for you.  On we go with the show.  Facebook.  Admits that half a billion records were stolen.  Actually, this personal information was leaked in 2019.  Facebook says we fixed the hole, but now it's showed up on the dark web.  It's being sold by a bad guy.  I don't think it's anything to freak out about.  It's not social security numbers or credit cards.  It's phone numbers, full names, location, email address, biographic information,  the kind of stuff you give Facebook.  So should be aware of it.  It's out there. It's half a billion users.  It does make me think Facebook should probably be doing a better job  protecting all that information we give them.  Then I saw this story.  This makes me so mad.  ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union says,  yeah, we've been sending user data to Facebook.  What the hell?  What? Yeah.  What the hell? What the hell?  ACLU says it shares data with, quote, communications platforms,  including Facebook, to deliver content to people who may be interested  and to target specific users with digital ads.  Now, I've always said you don't have to worry because Facebook's never going to  give your personal information to an advertiser.  They hold that tightly.  They'll sell you in a block.  But they don't. That's their secret sauce.  But I didn't realize that advertisers may be giving information to Facebook  to target ads.

Transcript:  They said, well, wait a minute, Facebook promised us  it would keep the data confidential and use it  only for the purpose of carrying out the functions we've engaged it to perform.  But then we know I just I mean, the story I just told you showed you that Facebook  it cannot guarantee that.

Start time: 6781.98
End time: 6825.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. And no, I'm reading this article.  It says the data includes people's names, email addresses, phone numbers,  country of residence and zip codes.  ACLU, some of that information is not stuff that people who donate  to your organization want public, let alone like shared companies like Facebook,  let alone benefits hacked and gone other places.  I give to the ACLU.  Me too. I'm on that list.  Me too. Like, this is not making me.  I do not have a Facebook account.  But now Facebook does all that stuff.  I mean, I do. So they already knew this, but it doesn't make me feel any better  that like. I give to the ACLU in part because I don't want them reselling  my information to third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm not I'm going to guess on this, but Facebook has always had one of the  features of Facebook is you can.  In fact, I think it was was it Gary Vaynerchuk or somebody?  Some marketing guru told me this.  Oh, you know, one of the best things of Facebook is you give them your mailing list.  These are people who are already subscribers are already devoted to you.  And then Facebook will will match will go through all those names and say,  know what it knows about them and say, look, here's a list of equivalent length  of people not on your list, but who have the same attributes.  So they would be good people to reach out to.  I mean, from an advertiser's point of view, that's gold.  Right. These are people who are not yet subscribed,  but who have all the attributes of your subscribers.  So they would be most likely interested.  But and I bet you that's something like what what ACLU was doing.  Here's all our donors.  Here's the information.  Now tell us who else we should go after with the ads.  Right. Right.

Start time: 6908.46
End time: 6937.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's not OK.  No, it's not like I understand that the organization is thinking, OK, we can now  find a way to get more money out of this and have more people to go after.  But no, like I give you money as an organization  because you're supposed to be diametrically opposed to these sorts of things.  You need to do a better like find another way to do fundraising,  find another way to increase your reach that doesn't include selling my data to  Facebook. Absolutely.

Start time: 6962.42
End time: 6985.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they could do something totally different, like where you  you run the information into a thing that would change all of the readable data  into their ways to do it.  Hash it right.  And then based off that hash, it could, you know, get what it needs,  make the stuff and then send another hash that met the other database.  So none of it would have to implement that.

Start time: 6986.34
End time: 6991.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

It's just it's like I expect and I didn't realize the extent of this,  but if you give to political campaigns, they sell your email address.  They sell your information.

Start time: 7040.64
End time: 7161.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the other hand, I, you know, and I,  I, I agree with Supreme Court that Facebook should be allowed  to send text messages saying your information might have been compromised.  That's what the case was about.  But to do it, they had to qualify as what's called an automatic  telephone dialing system under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  And they were sued  and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court saying, you know, Facebook,  you are not you should not be able to robocall people,  even though I think in this case, Facebook was right.  This was a security alert saying somebody. Right.  You know, that's appropriate.  The Supreme Court unanimously sided with Facebook  in the opinion just authored by Sonia Sotomayor.  The court adopted a narrow and I'm hoping this is really narrow,  a narrow reading of a key definition, the federal ban on robocalls  and robotexts to cell phones.  I don't know if it was narrow enough.  It held to qualify as an automatic telephone dialing system  under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  A device must have the capacity either to store or produce a telephone number  using a random or sequential number generator.  That's not that.  So they're saying because it's not a random number,  it's OK to send this out.  The general, you know, I'm looking at SCOTUS blog,  but generally the reports I've seen said this is seen as a real blow  for people who don't like telemarketing because every telemarketer is going to say,  oh, good, we're not using random calls so we can start.  We have a phone number list, which we got from Facebook probably,  or the ACLU, depending on.  And we're just going to start dialing out.  And so you're going to start getting lots more texts thanks to this.  So thank you, Facebook twice.

But in general, I think it's a good organization.  But like you said, like I understand that my donations are public.  I understand that information is being bought and sold and whatnot.  But the ACLU, like the EFF, I would I'd be like, no, but they're not going to take part in this.  They're not going to sell my I didn't when I was told about this, I didn't run and say, oh, good,

And then more people would have bought games  because they would play on their PCs as well as their Macs,  as well as their PlayStations.  Then I think a lot of the other competition never would even surface.  So them hardware getting greedy and blockings, S.E.N.  AKA software side, they kind of screwed themselves.  Like they should have just left it the freak alone.  They had to go and mess with it and they created all this competition.  And now they spend tons and tons of money trying to outdo Microsoft,  which never would have probably had to even start and they left it alone.

Kristina Warren from Microsoft Developer Advocate,  film girl, as she likes to be known, daguerreotype girl.  Daguerreotype girl.  Yeah, once you get that Twitter handle, you can never change.  That's why I use my name.  I don't you know, your generation, they have handles.  I see this in the chat room all the time.  People have bizarre handles and they it started with like their ICQ.  Start with their AIM names.  Or their AIM names, right.  And you just never can you can never get rid of it.  That's your brand.  Was it your AIM name?

Transcript:  I was lucky. I'm old, so I had no numbers.  We didn't know you put numbers back then.  We had this regular stuff, but I just wanted to be a computer nerd.  So I did Info Freak and I was into making, you know, little hallmark cards.  You put on a payphone for free calls.  And that was called phone freaking back in the day.  I was so elite.  Oh, you are elite hacksaw.  Wow. That's where I came from.  I was making like little freaking things with hallmark cards.

So on kicks, which is the first UK bulletin board, I got E&T,  I like which was was pretty damn cool. Yeah.  And in Britain, they know how to spell Ian.  Well, OK, yes, I am rather annoyed about this.  America, please.  There is no such word as Lane.  It's Ian with two I.S.  It's that simple.  I've never met anyone called Lane.  Please stop calling it me.

You guys are all our show today brought to you by Extra Hop.  Oh, man, this we can't stop talking about the solar wind, sunburst attack.  And that was such a wake up call.  Then there was the Microsoft zero day exchange flaws.  Oh, yeah.  The problem is, he's not only these cyber attacks more advanced,  harder to detect.  The real threat is the bad guys who are in your network.  Thanks to these flaws.  You know, they most I think something like 90 percent of the exchange  servers have been patched.  But what we may never know is how many are were attacked at the time  and how many threat actors are just advanced persistent threats  living inside that network.  The most advanced threat actors are the ones already in.  The ones who've been there for a long time without our knowledge.  When cyber criminals get past your defenses.  Businesses need a plan for detection.  And of course, once you detect them response, the old model of protection  and prevention alone is no longer enough.  We know that.  That's why you need extra hop reveal X.  It's the only solution that shows you not just where intruders are going,  but where they've been.  So you can investigate incidents and prevent them from turning into full  blown breaches.  When cyber attacks like solar winds and hafnium make the news,  the first question that security teams need to answer is, have we been compromised?  Extra hop reveal X makes it super simple to answer that question.  This is what you need.  90 days of record look back, complete network visibility across the data center,  the cloud, all the way to the device edge.  That means the security team can get the answers they need  and they get them right away.  In this post compromise world, your greatest chance at stopping  advanced threats is with extra hop network detection and response.  NDR learn more about how extra hop stops breaches 84% faster.  You can explore the interactive demo right now.  It's very cool, actually.  You're going to love this at extra hop dot com slash twit extra hop  dot com slash twit.  Somebody in the in the twit community was asking, what's the name of that?  What's the name of that?  I can't remember it. Extra hop.  Think of a bunny taking one more jump.  Extra hop dot com slash twit.  We thank him for supporting this week in tech.  TSMC, the big Taiwanese  semiconductor manufacturing company, has announced  they are going to spend 100 billion dollars over the next three years.  This is their response.  They make all the Apple chips.  This is their response to the chip shortage, which has been devastating.  That's why you can't get a G force.  You can't get a PlayStation five and Xbox Series X.  TSMC is going to build fabs big time.  Some of them in even in the US, most of them, I think, in Taiwan.  Qualcomm.

Start time: 7692.30
End time: 7710.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, it's come to a pretty pretty state of affairs where  TSMC is putting 100 billion into it.  The US government is putting 50 billion and Intel is putting 20 billion.  It's like, right. OK, so we might be a little behind the scale on this.

Start time: 7712.34
End time: 7718.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fabs are phenomenally expensive.  I remember when it was a billion dollars to build a fab.  It's 10 times more now. It's 10 billion at least.

Start time: 7719.80
End time: 7730.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's been Intel's, you know, like one.  I mean, they're Intel is so screwed right now, but like that's been  historically one of their big advantages is that they have their own fabs.  Right. And they're doubling down on that.

Start time: 7730.62
End time: 7738.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought they might move to the the fabless model.  No, they're going to go.  Pat Gelsinger, the new CEO, says we're doubling down on this.

Start time: 7738.80
End time: 7797.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I think is actually the correct thing for them to do.  They need to get their nanometer process figured out. Right.  So that's what we're seeing still at 14.  I'm still working, but they need to be correct.  Right. When they crack that, I do trust that they will.  I do actually think that having their own fabs is the right move  because we see what happens when I mean, look, it was a whole like, you know,  like calamity of events coinciding.  But when you do have like these fab shortages, like when everybody is using  TSMC and when even non TSMC fabs are, you know, all pushed to their limits  and you know, cars can't be made and basically, you know,  and then when you have the water shortages in Taiwan, where they have  to have to ship the water in so that they can actually run the fabs like  there's been so many disasters.  I actually do feel like, yeah, Intel having its own fabs, it's expensive.  It makes them, you know, like slower to maybe iterate than, you know,  the fabless chip makers like like AMD or whatever.  But yeah, I think it's a benefit, right?

Start time: 7798.38
End time: 7818.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also because there's some, I think, shakiness  in the fact that all of our chips are made in Asia. Yep.  And that Taiwan, I mean, Taiwan's a constant under constant threat from China.  So if I don't, I don't know where TSMC is going to build these,  but it would be probably wise to build them in other regions.

Start time: 7819.32
End time: 7848.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely. A couple of a couple. Sorry.  They are doing a couple of fabs in the US.  OK. But you're right.  An awful lot of their key technology is based in Taiwan.  And China can walk in there any time it wants.  And there's not a lot anyone else can do to stop that.  So it makes sense to diversify in that front.  But as Christine was saying, you know, the amount of money involved  in fab plants now is. So much higher than it was.

Start time: 7848.80
End time: 7868.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Intel's new fabs are 10 billion dollars each.  They're going to build two new fabs in Arizona for 20.  Yeah, they've done some bad ones as well.  Yeah. TSMC is going to spend that 100 billion over three years.  Samsung is going to spend 116 billion over 10 years.  I mean, you know, Ford has suspended production of its F-150  because they can't get the chips.

Start time: 7869.20
End time: 7892.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't get the chips.  I mean, I think this is actually one of the opportunities for Intel.  This is what the new CEO was saying is that  and this is a different model for them, right?  Before they maybe would kind of, you know, like let other people use their fabs.  But that really wasn't their model. It was all Intel using it.  But now they're going to be basically saying, hey, we can be your fab.  Yeah, but who wants to make a 14 millimeter, 14 nanometer M1?

Start time: 7893.10
End time: 7900.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one. Apple's going to be three nanometers next year.  No, there are five now.  There are going to be three next year.  Totally. I mean, you're not wrong.

Start time: 7901.06
End time: 7912.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm just saying, I mean, you could also concede that  they could have retrofitting tooling for stuff.  There are things you can do as you're building those fabs out.  Where it might not have to be just what the current nanometer process is.

Transcript:  Right. And Intel released this week their 11th generation Rocket  Rocket Lake S gaming CPUs.  Jim Salter's article in Ars Technica, sad digital trombone.  Yeah, they did not impress us.  Does not look like a very compelling upgrade,  especially when your lunch is getting eaten by AMD Ryzen chips.  Both Christine and I just built new PCs or bought new PCs with the Ryzen.  Ryzen, I call mine, by the way, thanks to the chat room.  I said I told the chair, I need a name for my new computer.  And I think it was retcon who said, how about Mojo Ryzen?

Yeah, it's true.  But the point of Krump's story was they managed to get into your source code.  They managed to get into your basic admin level access.  So, yeah, no customer personal information was lost.  But in the meantime, you've been comprehensively polled.

Krebs said, if you have ubiquity devices installed, we all do,  and you haven't yet changed the password on the devices since January 11th,  now would be a good time to take care of that.  It also might be a good idea to delete any profiles you had on those devices.  Make sure they're up to date on the latest firmware and then recreate those profiles  with new and preferably unique credentials and seriously consider disabling any remote  access on the devices.

Transcript:  Oh, no, but I've been good so far.  My ubiquity stuff has been really, really good.  Like, I just love it because I think what's impressive to me is everyone  is out here buying bigger and better things with like all kinds of stuff  growing out the side in like nine hundred antennas and really crappy UI.  But yet the commercial one that's not supposed to be for the end user  has like one of the best UIs out there.  I could probably throw my 11 year old niece at it and she could handle it.

Transcript:  And I have to say, the access points are really rock solid.  So I had to do this because I was Lisa was just  very upset with the quality of the Wi-Fi and when she was working at home,  Michael was attending high school at home.  It just it wasn't working.  So I just I bit the bullet and it worked very happy.  But I guess a password change is in the offing.  Let's see film girls here.  So she might be interested in the fact that Comcast is thinking about moving  its universal movies from HBO Max and Netflix over to their new Peacock.  Further fragmenting the streaming world.  Why is it stupid?

Start time: 8304.66
End time: 8391.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, because there's a reason that this model has existed for 30 plus years,  which is that, you know, you license or you sell your films to different services.  It's why Warner Brothers films could be on Showtime.  They weren't just on HBO, even though HBO and Warner Brothers  have been the same company for decades. Right.  Like you go to wherever the highest bidder is going to be.  You shouldn't force it to be on your service.  Like, I feel like this is dumb because NBC or Comcast, whatever, is doing this  thinking, oh, the desire to see these films will be so strong that people  will sign up for our service.  No, that's not the case.  There are a few cases where that'll happen, but usually that's going to be your original properties.  You simply see like the only way you can watch this content,  especially if it's catalog, is if you sign up for this service.  We talked about earlier how, you know, how much choice we have in our content.  People will just choose not to watch your content.  So, I mean, I think that it's completely misguided and short sighted.  I mean, I understand if you're developing new properties to make it on your service first, fine.  Right. But if you're talking about, you know, making it, you know,  taking stuff away and not going to the deal is like, OK, congratulations.  You've just lost the mind share that's already on these other places because,  I mean, they need subscribers to Peacock.  I get it. But this this just seems completely short sighted to me.  Isn't it funny? There are better ways to do it.

Start time: 8391.98
End time: 8406.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now, you invest in making new content that will come to the only reason  why I own Peacock right now is the Premier League.  If it wasn't for the Premier League, I wouldn't ever turn that thing on.  But glory, glory, man, united on there.

That's why we have this beautiful shot from a distance of the hovercraft.  Probably will be a week before it takes off.  But so far, so good.  Lots of tests are being very careful, moving very slowly.  The first quadcopter on Mars.  It's not a quadcopter. It's a duo copter.  It's a it's a one copter. It's a helicopter.  Yeah, you're right. It's not a quadcopter.  It only has a unit.  It's a it's an old fashioned.  But how many blades does it have to have a lot of blades?  Because the air is very thin.  Right. Two giant blades.

We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon,  right after the radio show, about two thirty Eastern five thirty Pacific,  about 11 in the morning, Hawaiian time thereabouts.  You can watch us do it live at Twitter TV slash live.  There's live audio and video streams there.  If you're watching live chat live at IRC dot twit dot TV.  After the fact, the show will be made available for download from our website,  as all our shows are, Twitter dot TV.  You can also find it on YouTube.  There's a YouTube channel for this week in tech.  Easiest thing to do probably is go to the main YouTube channel,  which is YouTube dot com slash Twitter.  And then you'll find links because every show has its own dedicated YouTube channel.  So you'll find links to all of those and you can subscribe.  As the kids say, mash the subscribe button, hit the bell, something like that.  That's correct. Is that right?  I guess correct. I had to talk that YouTube lingo.  Actually, the best thing to do is get a podcast application and subscribe.  And if you do subscribe in your podcast, get an E cam.  If you do, why is he cam there?  I don't know why. Get a cam and then get a podcast.  There it is. And subscribe.  If you subscribe, you'll get it automatically.  You don't have to think about it.  That's nice for us and nice for you as well.  And if your platform allows reviews, please leave us a nice review.  I will thank you later.  It's eight thirty in the morning in Sydney, so it's time to say goodbye.  Thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next week. Have a great Easter.  Another tweet is in the can.
