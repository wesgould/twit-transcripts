It's the complete YouTube experience completely offline.  Join YouTube videos has never been YouTube.  Well, it's been conveniently organized into a system of nested modules.  Simply navigate through the modules until you find the DVD of your choice.  How to open your menu is populated with video thumbnails.  Just like on YouTube.com, you can select your playback resolution.  Yes, full screen mode is available if desired.  YouTube collection doesn't require the Internet, but you don't lose interactivity.  Just fill out the comment form and place it in the self-address stamp on that.  Don't forget to throw in a green thumbs up or red thumbs down.  Your feedback will be sent directly to the creator.  Just as first as first.  So you can maintain the dialogue that you're used to.  Link.  The YouTube collection isn't just a sampling of YouTube.  It's all of YouTube.  Every YouTube video uploaded ever.  As soon as you sign up, we'll dispatch a fleet of 175 YouTube trucks to your home.  Your nested video modules will arrive securely shrink-wrapped on pre-categorized pallets.  If you live on a steep grade or in an area with low overpasses, your DVDs will be delivered  by package.  Since approximately an hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, you'll receive a  new truckload every week.  And if you sign up now, we'll give the entire DVD library to a friend or relative of your  choice totally free.  Visit youtube.com.  It's pretty well done.  I actually haven't watched the video yet.

Now you can change it in your region by selecting from the dropdown to change precipitation  and setting your own temperature.  So you'd set the temperature, set the precipitation, you'd press update weather.  It'd give you a warning.  Warning.  You were about to actually change the weather in this region.

This actually comes from the register initially.  Patent 1,042,012.  And he says there is prior art.  When we sued Samsung in April of last year, Apple said one of our assertions was the company  had modified its original design to include square icons with rounded corners that were  copied directly from iOS icons.  So how much of a legal leap is it from the assertion of owning squares with rounded corners  to asserting we own the rectangle?  All right, I think that's a joke.

Transcript:  It's called...  Hi.  I'm Glenn Murphy and I'm a designer on Google Chrome.  When we're on the web, we're always trying to get more done faster.  But research has shown that most people don't really save time when they try to do multiple  things at once.  On the Chrome team, we don't think this is a problem with people.  We think it's a problem with the tools they have at their disposal.  We realized that any one time while browsing, you're only using 50% of your hands.  Why?  Because you only have one mouse.  Chrome multitask mode changes that by giving you access to not one, but two mice at the  same time.  Does that actually work?  It's got to try multitasking.  At first, it might be a little tricky to get the hang of steering two mice.  It might.  But over a period of time, it feels completely natural.

One was that they wanted more hours and that they didn't like the food at the cafeteria.  Those are the two biggest concerns.  And so they respond like, oh, you want more hours?  How about less?

Transcript:  Yeah.  Chen Yamei, who is a Foxconn worker for Hunan, said,  We're here to work, not to play.  Our income is very important.  We've just been told we can only work 36 hours a month.  A month?  A month.  A maximum of 36 hours a month of overtime.  I tell you, a lot of us aren't happy with this.  We think 60 hours of overtime a month would be reasonable and that 36 is too little.

Start time: 2756.40
End time: 2767.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, and in fact, Apple's policy says that we don't want to see overtime greater than 60 hours.  But the Chinese law itself limits it to only 49.  And I don't know how seriously anyone takes that Chinese law.  Or if they should.

Transcript:  I think there's a danger here that we're trying to apply Western values to an Eastern culture.  And here you're saying to workers, and I'm not saying they should be overworked.  Of course, I'm not saying that.  But they're saying that we want this.  That's part of their culture to be hard working like this.  So they're rightfully upset.  It kind of goes back to the whole Coney situation.  Here we're in the Western world judging what's going on over there.  And they're sitting there in our country, it's like, wait a minute, what are you all talking about?  This guy's been gone for years.  Handle your own business.  So I think that's a problem that we can't get over that.

Start time: 2810.86

Transcript:  And keep in mind also, like a lot of the employees over at Foxconn, they're traveling from very small villages,  traveling far away from their families just so they can have an opportunity to work really hard  for a specific amount of time and pull down a bunch of cash.  And they send money to the family.  Right. And it really is.  It's like we've got this vision of, oh, I want them to live life like I have a life.  So I don't have to feel guilty when I buy my new iPad.  And I think it is very well intentioned.  But as most of these initiatives do, they're going to have terrible unintended consequences.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, you had the thing with child labor and people being whipped.  Whipped?  Well, I'm just saying.  I hope not.  But, you know, if we want to look at the situation that's really bad,  we have to look at our own country and the essential slave labor.  We have more prisoners per capita than any other nation in the world.  We have more prisoners in total than any other nation in the world.  And we pay them 23 cents an hour to do just about everything.  Right. Yeah. No, it's terrible.

Start time: 2866.36

Transcript:  And why are, and I guess maybe this has been asked before,  but why is Apple being targeted where there's HP, Samsung, Amazon, Nokia, Nintendo, Sony?  I think that's unfair as well. I agree.  All these other, they use Foxconn as well.  So like, maybe that's just a rhetorical question,  but it just seems a little weird that they're being targeted, maybe because they make the most money.

Transcript:  Well, nevertheless, well, yeah, because they're earthy, crunchy, they're Apple, there's higher standard, whatever.  But nevertheless, I don't think we should back off on looking at these conditions, but you're absolutely right.  It's more complicated than just, well, you know, we've got to pay them more.  And maybe, you know, there's an unintended consequence to cutting their hours.  That's not what they're there for.  Tim Cook was the first Apple CEO to visit Foxconn.

And when they're bad, then we blame the president when in fact the president has very little  to do with the economy.  And likewise, the CEO has very little to do with the specific...  You know, the very specific direction of the show.  I mean, this is...  They're rich.  They're happy.  They're sitting on gajillions of dollars.  So, of course, they're happy with the CEO.

This is about a 34-year-old Jacksonville, Florida resident, Christopher Chaney, who  had the email address for celebrity stylist and handbag designer Simone Harouche.  He didn't have the password.  He just used the password reset feature on Apple's cloud servers.  It's me.com.  Answered the required security questions by supplying publicly available information.  A little tip here.  If you're a public figure or you have a Wikipedia page and they say, what's your dog's name?  Where were you born?  Where were you born?  Don't use that.  When you ask, when I use questions like they say, what is your mother's maiden name?  I say banana slug.  There you go.  And then that way.

It's embarrassing for all men.  Chaney obtained several photos of Johansson and you've probably seen the pictures.  I know I have.  Yay.  Heyo.  Heyo.  She confessed she had taken themself with her smartphone.  These are old from three years ago.  They were sent to my husband, her ex-husband, Ryan Reynolds.  There's nothing wrong with that.

Transcript:  Am I the only one who's utterly unconcerned by this?  Because you realize every credit card, part of the agreement is that your total liability  is $50 and I think they even got rid of that.  You have no responsibility if somebody steals your card.  Your only obligation, which you should be doing anyway, is keep paying attention to  what charges you have.

Transcript:  This is a wrong attitude on your part.  What?  I'll tell you why.  Dude.  Look at him, John.  Dude.  The chaps.  of casual the way you are, it encourages more thievery and all they do is jack up the prices,  the rates that you pay for your card to pay for the criminals that rip everybody else  off.  What am I supposed to do in this case?  You're paying more money over time because you're lax attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it depends.  If you're tapping it in the bathroom.  What comes out of you is that, and I found this to be the case, I can hardly use my credit  card anymore because, I'll give you an example.  I like that.  That's good.  And John gets scared as he jumps.  I'll give you an example.  I bought something.  So, okay, Zappos got hacked.  My credit, everybody in Zappos account, they had to reset their passwords.  They never could reset it.  So I said, all right, well, screw it.  I'm going to Shoes.com.  I ordered something.  It's the first time I ordered.  I ordered two pairs of sneakers.  That's a mistake.  Why?

Start time: 3920.35

Start time: 3926.12
End time: 3971.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they canceled the order.  We talked about this before because I had gone to some sort of a conference where at  the time the CEO of American Express discussed some of the security measures.  And you can test this yourself because people have done it.  I'm sure it still works.  If you get your card and you go get two tanks of gas.  Yeah.  In the same day.  Yeah.  In the same day.  And then you go buy sneakers.  Your card will be canceled on the spot.  Yeah.  And that's what happened.  Because the guy says that what happens is a guy steals a card.  The first thing he does is he gets a tank of gas and then he brings his buddy over for  a tank of gas in his car so he can be a big shot.  Because that's an unusual behavior.  Nobody would buy two tanks the same day.  Totally unusual.  And so then he goes and he starts buying clothes.  You know.  Well, is that what you are?

Start time: 3971.04

Start time: 3976.88
End time: 3982.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's well, that's the point.  It was completely normal.  I bought two pairs of sneakers because I want one pair for home and one pair for the gym.

Start time: 3982.60
End time: 3986.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And he has to refill his tank every couple hours.  I didn't do that.  Not giving us touchdowns.

Start time: 3986.32
End time: 4009.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other thing I did was I was having shipped to a different address.  Now, it was, so, but this was I'm having shipped to work, not home.  I gave them the credit.  Usually like on Amazon when they do that they say, okay, but you're going to have to give  us the credit card information again to verify this really is your credit card.  And then they go ahead and do that.  But I guess it was the first time I'd ordered from Shoes.com.  And they did try to call me, but the number, the phone number is some, I don't know where  it is.  I don't answer my phone.

Start time: 4009.70
End time: 4012.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  But this isn't even a credit card thing.  This is just a Shoes.com thing.

Start time: 4012.52
End time: 4020.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was their policy.  They canceled the order.  That's all.  I think most people would do that.  You don't know when, wasn't the credit card kicking it back saying, hey, this is suspicious.  Not authorized.

Start time: 4020.80
End time: 4032.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's my point.  And so that's what, that's the other side effect of this kind of thing is it gets harder  and harder to use a credit card.  We can't use our corporate card hardly at all because we get dinged all the time.  The constant calls saying, or did you really buy this?  Yes, I really bought this.

Start time: 4032.84
End time: 4037.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, once they see a pattern of behavior, then that goes away.  Apparently buying anything is the pattern of behavior.

Start time: 4038.74

Start time: 4047.52
End time: 4062.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Because look, at least with a credit card, if you, if they say you owe money and you  dispute it, you're like, no, I don't know that.  They say, yes, we do think you owe that.  Then you can just, you know, sit there, cross your arms and then take it to court.  But when you tie your phone to it and all of a sudden Apple's the one saying, no, you  owe it.  And I'm like, no, I don't.  They're like, guess what?

End time: 4099.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I do like the idea of one time use credit cards.  And I think that that's something that the credit card companies don't like so much.  It's a lot of work on their part.  Well, it's a you can if we buy online, you can in some credit cards will do this, say  I'm going to use this number once.  You can only use one charge on it or I'm going to use this credit card only for this merchant.  This this is now tied to Amazon and no other merchant can use it.  And those kinds of things have a lot of security.  But of course, it makes it much more complicated for the fees.  Although it's not complicated.  It's all done by computers.

Transcript:  Hey, do you feel sorry for Rim?  Sure, I do.  I feel bad.  I liked I had a little Blackberry pager.  Oh, I got some good stuff to say about this one.  All right. Take it.  So Rim has a new CEO.  They fired. They fired those other guys, the clowns, three stooges, three to two stooges,  two stooges and the new CEO.  Well, Rim sales fell sharply last quarter.  First revenue decline in seven years.  Subscriber growth rate all time low of three percent.  The two CEOs stepped down.  Morale is flagging, according to executives inside and outside the company.  At the dinner meeting in February between Rim's chief technology officer,  one of the executives who left Thursday and chief information officers from companies  that govern in many agencies, the mood was somber.  It's like going to a wake, said one person there.  So there's a lot of pressure on Thorsten Hines, who was the new CEO, to turn this around.  They've got the Blackberry 10, the new operating system's coming.  They're going to roll out new Blackberry smartphones later this year.  But they are also conducting, what does this mean, John?  What does this corporate speak mean?  A comprehensive review of strategic opportunities.

Start time: 4192.30
End time: 4214.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have never.  Closest I got to was a Palm Trio, which, you know, it's the same thing.  But yeah, I think Rim really needs to, I know they denied it a couple of days ago.  They need to really consider whether they need to keep this consumer business,  because I was reading about, I think Mike Elgin told me about this book,  The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing.  Oh, my God, that is the best book in the world.

Start time: 4215.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  The only thing that's better is their origin of brands, which is even better.  But it comes out of the same material.  I will read that.  Alan Laurie Reese, I bought you The Origin of Brands the very first time I came.  I have it.  I gave that to you.  That book is amazing.  Oh, that's an awesome book.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry. You were saying, Lamar?

Start time: 4230.12
End time: 4275.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, no, no. So what that book was talking about was the problems that companies like  Pepsi or Coke had with line extension.  They tried to do too much clear Pepsi and all these different flavors when it should  have just stuck to something simple.  And I think that's what Rim tried to be all things to all people.  And when you do that, like Samsung is doing now, when they're, you know, they push out  15 different tablets and start to focus in on one or two and, you know, just trying to  see which one sticks, you know, you dilute your market.  So I think it's really important for Rim to, you know, do an IBM or do what HP was going  to do, you know, last year and say, hey, maybe we need to focus on what we do best,  corporate, focus on that.  Forget about the consumer market.  Let Apple, Google have it.  To some extent, Microsoft.  I would even just focus.

Start time: 4275.92
End time: 4284.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_16

Actually, it's funny because I'm starting to see interesting  rumors that Google may not go Android.  Google is going to start selling a tablet.  Right. Did they go Chrome?  They're going to call it play.  This is this. I can't remember who wrote this, but I could be absolutely.  Be the moment. No, no.  This was more supposition.  I know it could be.  But, you know, they moved everything to the Google Play market.  The Android market is is play now.  The books, the music, the movies, the TV, it's all play.  This is a brand.  And the problem and I have to find this article.  I can't remember who was was writing it.  And he really deserves credit for it.  But the problem is they've lost control of the Android name.  Yeah, completely out of control, completely out of control.

But then once it stopped meaning that it became 18 billion different flavors.  And every 20 minutes, there's a new dessert named version of it.  And it's like you just throw up your hands.

Transcript:  So I wrote a call and I believe it was in Market Watch.  It could have been in PC magazine.  I can't remember.  I know they all blurred out.  But I suggest the following.  Sony divvy up the company.  That's the only solution.  They have to split the company into three.  They understand the same thing for Microsoft.  Yes, I did.  For for for Microsoft nowadays.  They should split up the three companies, the movie entertainment,  record movies that yes, that's a mess.  Then the computer hardware, consumer electronics,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I know this is that same article, the same same argument about brand,  where you confuse it by being too many things. Right.  Sony, which was the consumer electronics brand, has completely lost it  to brands that were for a long time cheesy.  Samsung is a cheesy brand.  Yeah. LG used to stand for Lucky Gold Star.  It was the TV set you bought in the back of Kmart.  Yeah. And Sony was this is the set and has completely lost that. Yeah.  I agree. They should have.

Start time: 4813.20
End time: 4842.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Now, I mean, I guess really the real answer is they never should have put in  put everything under the Sony brand to begin with.  It takes a lot more time and effort to build a brand from scratch.  That's why everyone loves the shortcut of borrowing from the more popular brand.  That's why, you know, there's, you know, Miller High Life was a popular beer.  Then when they came out with light, the light version, they didn't want to just  call it light because they. What's the sixty four thing?  What is that all about? The six of the six for calories.  Is that how many calories it is? It's like a half beer.  Yeah, nasty. I see the the answer. Cute. Yeah.

I, you know, if anything that needs to be saved is Flickr.  I don't know if anyone agrees that that somehow needs to be bought by somebody  because I think that's their only property.

I'm always stunned because every so often Yahoo says,  well, we're going to cancel this.  We've had it for two years and now we're killing it.  They kill some product.  You look at it and you say, I never heard of this.  If I had known about it, I would have used it.  And how you know that that happens over and over with them.

End time: 5012.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it threaten you a little bit, Lamar?  I mean, here you are. You've got a YouTube channel very successful.  But is it scary that there are so many people,  there's 60 hours of new video every minute being uploaded to YouTube?

Start time: 5013.00
End time: 5026.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, it did it did bother me when I when I was, you know, not yesterday,  but as I was hearing about this, I think joining you see more and more  YouTubers joining networks like, you know, I joined Revision Three.  You know, there's Maker Studios, there's Big Frame.  It's always different.

Start time: 5026.48
End time: 5031.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5031.78
End time: 5052.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, first of all, you get protection from click bombing.  You don't have to deal with that kind of issue.  What's click bombing? I'm sorry.  It's basically when people would go to your YouTube,  click all your ads and they click them over and over again.  You know, AdSense would just say, you know, they're going to disable your account  and they won't appeal and then you are no longer a partner and you can't get money.

Start time: 5052.94
End time: 5077.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, in other words, you've hired Revision Three as an enforcer, basically.  It's like it's like my bodyguard.  These guys were stealing your lunch money.  And now you've got this big kid who's going to come in.  And this is one of the things that bothers me because we don't have an enforcer.  And Google, you know, YouTube screws with us all the time, like Wednesday,  when they pulled down this week in Google, because they said, yeah, we own that.  And we don't have an enforcer. So you need an enforcer.

Start time: 5077.98
End time: 5102.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, Revision Three can be, you know, they they could talk directly  to people at YouTube.  So that gives me that protection and advantage.  And plus, you know, distribution and you get a higher monetization.  So that's that's why you're going to see a lot of clusters happen on YouTube,  because people are trying to kind of keep their turf to themselves.  It's going to be this year's going to be really interesting to see how you two  kind of divides and stuff up.

Start time: 5103.02
End time: 5110.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  No, no, it legitimizes new media in general.  This is this is part of a general flight to quality  that will shape the perception of new media  and hopefully be a rising tide for all of us.  You got to remember, we are in the early days of something revolutionary.  This is the 1970s of cable where nobody knows what the rules are.  And we're trying to establish what new media means.  And in the old days, whoever is there first won on cable.  CNN was the first cable news, 24 hour news network.  And because nobody's watching it first, but then as cable became  a legitimate platform, CNN rose to the top.  And likewise, as new media gets legitimized,  Twitter's only going to benefit.  But that's wrong.

Transcript:  So for those who don't know,  Minecraft's an amazing game.  Notch, we were talking about earlier,  wrote it, just kind of, I think offhand,  because nobody knew this would be a hit.  It's all in eight bits,  it's very clunky, very chunky.  And you have this hand,  just this club,  that you can hit things, collect stuff.  There are night falls,  there are creeps who will come after you.  You have to defend yourself.  Usually you want to build something,  but you can build a lot of things with a lot of effort.  This is an operating,  this is like a scientific calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Now think about it this way.  Now you roll your eyes and be like, get a life,  but you realize that by having a very simple virtual space  with reliable rules,  this is the great-great-grandson  of Charles Babbage's difference.  It is, because it's all mechanical.

Start time: 5852.20
End time: 5903.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not digital.  Right, I mean, it's all virtualized.  He has to do multiplication,  he has to do division,  he's got BCD to binary decoders,  he's got memory,  he's got square root log sine and cosine,  I mean, this thing,  and it's all mechanical.  I mean, it is Babbage's inference machine.  Now he says-  But will it blend?  Well, that's the thing,  when I look at this,  that's the thing I think about is  how easy this would be to break.  Will it come alive and attack you?  You've got to be very, very,  I mean, the amount of detail and refinement  in making this thing,  now it's not super fast.  So you can add, subtract, multiply, divide,  log sine, cosine, tangent, square root and square.  It also is a graphing calculator.  You can do linear, quadratic, plot, graphs, equates.  This is amazing.  So what do you want me to do?

Start time: 5904.82

Transcript:  That's pretty amazing.  Anyway, we'll bomb out of that,  but you can go to Tom's Hardware to see that,  or other places, that's where we're playing it from.  And it is on YouTube as well.  Just real quickly, I'm gonna check through these stories.  Half of US cellular subscribers own smartphones.  There are nearly a billion smart devices  were shipped last year.  Just taking it over.  For the first year, first time ever in 2011,  digital beat out physical.  That's a big one.  In music, in music, and streaming services  gained 300,000 subscribers in 2011.  We didn't end up talking about,  what is it called, Girls Around Me?

Start time: 6084.78
End time: 6094.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6095.10
End time: 6104.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, it's not stalking so much as it's,  I just want to see if you're near me  so I can knock on your door at night, late.  Or maybe not even knock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  See, now I read this, I didn't read this  as being serious as all.  I read this as being a cautionary tale  to let people know that they're putting  public or private information in the public.  Look at the launch screen

Start time: 6126.94
End time: 6128.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6133.50
End time: 6143.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a stalking app.  It's a little creepy.  It's a little creepy.  But anyway, I've always believed that four square  and all these things were just pretty much tools  for stalkers.

Start time: 6143.52
End time: 6160.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's funny, most of the women I know  will not use four square, except for one.  But maybe now this will make people  more aware of that, I guess.  E-books are the fastest growing area of book sales,  especially, and this is not a surprise,

Start time: 6160.26
End time: 6175.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with young people.  No, these things are skyrocketing.  It's only the beginning.  Just the beginning.  I'll tell you what.  We'll lower the prices.  And this guy sitting over here in the end over here  has already made like a half a million dollars on his book.  How's that scam school book going?  It's doing really, really well.  This guy, he won't even come on the show anymore.  Did you get to number one?

Start time: 6175.94
End time: 6199.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  You know what?  We got number one in Canada.  We hit number three in the US  because we released the same day as this 50 Shades of Grey.  It's erotic BDSM fan fiction based on Twilight.  Oh.  They've already got movie rights.  You're never gonna be there.  You're not gonna get movie rights.  So we're very, very happy with the release,  but more importantly, I'm amazed at,  the reviews have been insane.  People are calling it a game changer for educational books.

Start time: 6199.82
End time: 6208.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because you're using video, you're using audio,  it's multimedia.  I don't have my iPad here, I'd show people,  but it's really cool.  Get the, if you can, get the iBook version,  because that really is the best.

Start time: 6208.48
End time: 6247.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It's slightly better in order right now.  iBooks looks best.  Second place goes to the Barnes & Noble Nook,  because that's EPUB.  And depending on what device you're viewing it on,  they are updating the Kindle app,  so it's just gonna look better and better.  In the next month or so, the Android version's  gonna look as good as any of the other ones.  But the platform, we did it on VOOC.com,  asked if they could, it was a weird call,  because they're like, hey, we would like to make your book  the official case study for VOOC.com.  Well, it should be.  And so if you look like it's on the front page now,  of VOOC.com, I think it's the third picture in there.  VOOC?  VOOC, V-O-O-K,  because you got all these different publishing platforms,  they're all contrary to each other.  VOOC?  It's one platform.  It's a book with a V.

Yeah.  That'd be kinda cool.  They should use all that social media.  We could track asteroids around us.  Channeldvorak.com.  That's the place to go for more John C. Dvorak.
