In front of it's head the eWorld logo and on the back of it had  done in that kind of soft pastel style an ant being squished by an anvil. And what  did that mean? I don't know what that meant. Oh you squashed a bug? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's great. Do  you think it'll be enough to change the landscape? No, it's gonna be, it's gonna take more than this  but you know what's funny is we have flood advisories. Oh yeah, of course.

Transcript:  the, yeah. Anyway, great to have you Dwight. I'm glad you're wearing the t-shirt that's the first  product Steve Jobs introduced after his return to Apple in 1998. That's right. Also joining us,  Mr. Mike Elgin, the king of Google Plus, back again, former editor at Computer World and he's  still right for Computer World from time to time. I write for Computer World and a bunch of other  publications. But you're really a web guy now. Web guy, cover, all this stuff. We're really glad to  have Mike back because he's great. Also here from Gadgets.com, Ryan Block. Good to have you Ryan.  Thanks for having me. You wrote some interesting things on Jobs' passing. I guess everybody here  did. I didn't because I talk, not write. But I talked some interesting things. This was a week,  Tuesday, Apple announces the iPhone 4S in a strangely somber event. I wasn't at the event,  you were at the event. I was there, yeah. And we saw the video later and that's when it hit me.  I didn't know at the time. Did you feel like Tim Cook and the others were a little bit down?

Start time: 250.70
End time: 324.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I heard people who were there say that they thought Tim Cook was a little nervous.  Maybe. I definitely heard people say after the fact that they thought that maybe he was a little  depressed. I didn't really get that. It was all in hindsight, I guess. Here's what I think. I mean,  maybe they knew that Steve was about to pass or that he had just passed and we found out about  it a couple days later. I don't really know. What I do know is that these guys are so heavily trained  to do these keynotes that they've rehearsed it so many times that when you get up there, your mind  just goes blank. You just do it. Yeah, you're just doing it. So I really actually don't think that  there was probably a whole lot of latent emotion going on there. And I think just generally,  if you want to kind of get the Steve feel during one of these things, you got to tone it down a  little bit. You have to be supremely confident. I think that is actually what really separates  a Steve note from many of these other tech keynotes where the random CEO of whichever company  you'll have gets out on stage and is super pumped and Steve Ballmer sweating. That is actually the

Start time: 324.66
End time: 338.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  anti-steep. That shows a lack of command. No, I agree with you. In any performance, the great  performers are relaxed. They're present. They have an internal energy and centeredness,  but they don't have a lot of external energy coming out of them. I agree with you. I think

Start time: 338.68
End time: 370.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's true of performance in general. And if you watch that, I notice that even in just that little  clip, Tim Cook is holding his hands together like this, like Steve used to do. He makes the same  kind of gestures, does the same kind of sagely head nod. They get a lot of media training, I'm  sure. I'm sure they do. And I'm sure that probably Jobs may have spent some time with them if there  was time for him to give them a little coaching. They have a very rigorous program that they've

Start time: 371.02
End time: 402.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  adhered to for years about how these keynotes go, how you get trained to do a keynote when they have  guests up from other companies. They always have app demos now during these iPhone events.  There's some stories that have come out about what exactly that looks like as a third party  company doing a demo on Apple's stage. To say it's rigorous is actually kind of reductive. It is  just down like crazy from what people have reported. Did you see the chair in the front row with the

Start time: 402.68
End time: 428.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reserved sign on it? I did not see that. It shows up in the video, of course. It's front row, on the  aisle where the executives sit. Obviously, a reserve for Steve Jobs, whether he'd be there or not.  There was a story, and I don't know how true it was, that Jobs watched the keynote in his comfy  chair drinking his favorite apple juice and eating rice pudding. We have no idea if that's true.

Start time: 429.86
End time: 436.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The author may have been drinking apple juice. It could be true, and he smiled afterwards.

Start time: 436.30
End time: 449.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what they said. The family said that Steve Jobs passed away the next morning, so I'm going to  give that cretins. It did feel somber to me. Again, it's hard to say. In hindsight, you were there,

Start time: 449.96
End time: 468.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you were watching. I really didn't walk away thinking, oh man, something bad happened.  It's kind of easy to apply that. It's 20-20 hindsight.  It felt very low-key, but it was meant to. Let's pretend that Steve Jobs did not pass away

Start time: 469.72
End time: 476.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  afterwards, which of course changes everything. Did it seem to you to be a disappointment,

Start time: 476.76
End time: 541.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a letdown the phone itself? No. I think there were a couple factors that came into play here. One,  people forget that Apple has a cycle to their product launches, and this kind of follows their  cycle. For them, every other year has been the big launch. The original iPhone is a big launch,  but it wasn't the iPhone that they knew was going to make them a worldwide success. It was their  entrant. They had to get that product out the door. It was the 3G that they really got behind.  That's the one where if you look at the sales charts over the years, that's when they hit the  hockey stick. It was on the 3G. 3GS was an upgrade. They sold a gazillion of those things, but  we all kind of acknowledged that that was a minor upgrade. Then the 4, again,  huge hit. Then the 4S. It's every other one. Yeah. It doesn't feel like for the iPhone that this was  some huge shock that it wasn't the quote, unquote, five that I think had been kind of...  And it really didn't help that some of the sites that had been starting these rumors,  I guess they really started kind of kicking off from April. We heard everything from,

Start time: 541.44
End time: 552.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there's going to be a new iPad, there's going to be two iPhones, there's going to be a Facebook  application. I mean, there was a lot of hype around this. I actually went back and kind of

Start time: 552.72
End time: 572.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  looked around. It really started in April with one kind of big report about the iPhone 5. This  year was going to be a huge year for the iPhone. Expect one of the bigger screen and all this stuff,  the teardrop shape. It all came from this one report. And it all, I think, kind of...

Start time: 572.70
End time: 580.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what happens, isn't it? You forget the source. You forget that it was a single source.  Yeah. It becomes like this mystery. It becomes canon.  Yeah. It's very weird.  And we all believe it.

Start time: 580.72
End time: 611.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think this was a huge launch, mainly because of Siri. And from a business perspective,  which I think is mainly what Ryan is talking about, it's a slight continuation of the  trajectory that started previously. But from a cultural perspective, I think 10 years from now,  we're all going to be talking to our computers, all of our computers, to artificial intelligence  agents like Star Trek. And I think that this will be traceable back to this moment.  This was the day that started.  Exactly. Now the Android...

Start time: 611.98
End time: 613.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Android does it, but it doesn't talk back to you.

Start time: 614.24
End time: 621.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android didn't mainstream it. We remember the mainstreamers. We remember the Edisons  and the Fords, people who didn't invent the light bulb with a car. But the mainstream...

Start time: 621.32
End time: 629.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what Steve Jobs is. He didn't invent the personal computer. He didn't invent the GUI.  He didn't invent the MP3 player. He didn't invent the smartphone. He didn't even invent the tablet.

Start time: 629.14
End time: 653.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a new interface like the iPhone introduced the touch interface to the world.  Again, there was already devices out there that had multi-touch interfaces.  But this would be the popularization.  In the future when you're using... Five years, 10 years from now,  our desktops are going to be like iPads with Siri. That's how we interact with our computers,  with touch and voice, and it'll all be traceable back to this announcement and the 2007 iPhone  announcement.

Start time: 653.80
End time: 682.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you and I have been around a while. And of course, we've been saying both, I'm sure,  for years that the GUI, the user interface hasn't changed since 1984 when Apple came out  with the mouse and Windows interface. And everybody was... I think we were all saying,  well, what would be the next big thing? And it would be speech. It would be touch.  Just like Bill Gates said it would.  We knew it. But it happened finally. Now, has anybody here tried... I mean,  we've all tried Siri, but nobody's here to try the new Siri Assistant.

Start time: 682.94
End time: 688.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if I had tried it, I wouldn't be able to talk about it. So there's that.

Start time: 691.44
End time: 709.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That doesn't help us at all. So the thing is...  The thing we don't know until Friday is, well, how does it work in a noisy environment where  the baby's crying on the beach? If I'm really running, can I actually say,  Siri, schedule an appointment for noon? I'm sorry, you have an appointment for noon.  Would you like to move it?  Yeah.

Start time: 710.18
End time: 723.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I'd like to know is why Siri doesn't work on the iPhone 4. I mean, the iPhone 4 has that  audio DSP that'll allow it to do the voice control. Siri sends a lot of that stuff, sends a  lot of your voice to the cloud for processing, and then returns that data back.

Start time: 723.94
End time: 736.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The bigger question is iPad 2, because the iPad 2 has the same processor, same amount of RAM.  So you could say, well, the iPhone 4 only has a single-core processor, it needs more.  You're right, it's all done off-site, so it doesn't really matter.

Start time: 736.82
End time: 738.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think most of it, not all of it.  Yeah.

Start time: 739.40
End time: 747.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. So let's assume, let's say Apple says, oh, well, you need a dual-core processor.  Well, the iPad has the same specs as the iPhone 4S.  I think...  So this is an artificial restriction there.

Start time: 747.86
End time: 754.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's more about the dictation that's done on the phone, because it also does dictation.  And I think it maybe nuances technology and the dictation.

Start time: 754.84
End time: 760.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Ken from Chicago has it right. He says,  Siri doesn't work on the iPhone 4, so you'll buy an iPhone 4S.  Right.

Start time: 760.64
End time: 788.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course.  It's a business decision. Apple's making a mistake, I think, in... They're pulling the iPhone  app for Siri, starting on October 15th.  It's already stopped working, I think, hasn't it?  No, it'll work until October 15th. You just can't download it.  And it has this very strange message when you fire up the app now.  It says that it's going home on October 15th, almost like God is calling me home.

Start time: 789.96
End time: 795.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Has anybody actually played a Siri back?  I mean, it's been around for a while, so...  Yeah. Oh, I love it.  And it's a year and a half old version.

Start time: 795.64
End time: 798.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's cool. It's flawed, but very cool.

Start time: 799.56
End time: 802.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we've been wondering for a year and a half since Apple bought them.

Start time: 802.86
End time: 861.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are they?  Well, you know, Siri is a really interesting project because it begins with the Pentagon.  Not a lot of people realize this, but the Pentagon, a few years ago, decided to create  HAL, 9000 for military applications.  And so they brought together about 300 of the world's top scientists in all these different  areas. It brings together all kinds of different areas about machine learning and all this kind  of stuff. And the head of the project is a guy named Adam Chayer, I think is how you pronounce  it, Chayer, something like that. And that guy now works for Apple.  Interesting.  And he spent all of his time, he was one of the leads at Siri as a startup, but these guys  they've devoted their lives for the last five years or so to taking stuff from the Kalo project,  C-A-L-O, which is the Pentagon DARPA project, and cherry picking items from that project that  could be brought to consumers. And that's what Siri is. It's a really kind of an, it has a really

Start time: 862.18
End time: 875.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting excited now. So it sounds like you should buy the i4s not because of the dual core,  not because of what else is in the forest, the better camera, but because of Siri.  Well found.  Would you agree? Can you say that much?

Start time: 877.02
End time: 910.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't, you know, honestly for me, I get the long view why the voice is potentially so  transformative. But, you know, I'm thinking, am I going to buy this product? And if I am,  what am I going to, you know, what do I really need it for? I'm an iPhone 4 owner. So what do I  need right now that I don't have? And I don't really feel like I need Siri yet. It's cool.  It's an introduction. It's going to take a while to get there. I really want the camera. I really  want the faster processor. I wouldn't mind the ability to switch from AT&T to Verizon without  potentially a ton of trouble at some point.

Start time: 910.58
End time: 970.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? I was sitting there because it's 12 midnight on Friday and I woke up,  like I said, the alarm and I got online and I went to Apple and they, you know, they were,  as usual, the failure point was AT&T. You'd go right through the thing. I'm on upgrade. Yes.  And AT&T would spin and say, I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that. So I just on a whim because I  wanted the AT&T. I have an AT&T account. I do have a variety. I have an account with all of them. But  so I went to the Verizon and yes, that one worked. And then the thing that stopped me,  they said, do you want this to be an international phone? And I said, yes,  that'll cost you 30 bucks extra a month. And I went, ho, they didn't say that. Hold on there.  You mean I have to pay. Now I found out since somebody said, well, I called Verizon on that  one and they said, but you could turn it off until you travel. So it's very much like the AT&T.  That's actually the plan. It's not the hardware. It's not clear though. When you sign up and this  is what stopped me. When you sign up and said, do you want a SIM? Do you want this to be international?  I said, yes. Well, choose your international plan. And the cheapest was 30 bucks a month.  It looked like that. You'd have to pay that forever. And I said, that's not, I'm not going

Start time: 970.86
End time: 984.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do that. Yeah. And you don't need to. That is correct. I went with Veronica to France  last December and I just activated on my AT&T plan. I activated international data for a month  and then I turned it off. Yeah. That's what I did. Do not forget about it by the way,

Start time: 985.56
End time: 1047.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because you'll be 200 bucks a month for the next five months, which is what happened to me.  Are you going to France again this year? No. Can I pass on that one? We actually will be in  France for the web this year. We're going to do Twitter in France. So you can watch the video.  It'll be warmer. Oh my God, it snowed. It was cold. So let me, we're going to take a break.  I think Siri, I agree with you. I think Siri is going to be very interesting, Mike. It might be  the beginning of this talk to the computer talks back, but I also think that there's all sorts of  issues that until everybody's talking to their phone, you don't really appreciate my, I'd use  the Android stuff all the time. You know, send texts to Mike. You will see it. My son sitting in  the car every time I do that goes, he messes with me. And I have a feeling this is the future.  The yes. Is that people are parenting. Of everything. Is that people resent,  look, it's bad enough people talk on the cell phone. There's going to be signs that say,  do not talk to your computer while you're in the shop. Right. Well, see, this is, but this gets to

Start time: 1047.92
End time: 1077.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why I'm biased in favor of this type of technology. Not, not just Siri, but about all the, the coming  age of artificial intelligence. Cause it solves all the problems that I personally have because I  always run with this thing. I do trail running and it's like, I always, I'm actually, you are that guy  while I'm running, I'm trying to like, I don't have my glasses on in the, you know, it's a, I,  I use the alarm five, 10 times a day for cooking, for taking a nap, for getting up. And you can just  say, you know, waking up 30 minutes, whatever it is. It's, I love that set alarm for 30 minutes

And I said something like,  no, no, something like that. And then it sent that message. And then it sent a message to my wife.  Oh no. And then I did an expletive, and off it went.

Damn you.  We're going to take a break, come back with more. We've got a great panel. We've got Ryan  the Block from gdgt.com, Mike Elgin from, I want to say from Google Plus. Don't go to Elgin.com.  Go to Google Plus, baby. And of course Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle. More to  come in just a bit. In fact, we will start to talk about Steve Jobs. He kind of deferred that  sad stuff for the second break. But I actually have, they've published the preface to Walter  Isaacson's biography, which comes out in a couple of months, and I'll read a little bit of it from  for you. It's very touching. It's coming up in just a bit. But first, a little bit from Citrix and Go  to Assist Express. When we were doing the screensavers, we tried out a prototype for this product called  Expert City. And the idea was you could get into people's computers and fix them remotely.  Well, they've come a long way, baby. Go to Assist Express is fantastic. It's everything I had hoped  for and more. It's fast. It's easy to use. It's cross-platform, Mac or PC. You could do  unattended support so you don't have to wait till your supportee is there. It's really easy for the,  I use it with my mom. It's so easy. You send her, I sent her a link. She clicked it. 30 seconds later,  you know, there's a, you say, okay, when it says allow, click allow. That's the Java pop-up. And  that's it. You're now in there fixing it. You can chat with her. She can see you working.  It's really remarkable. You get support done the way your client wants it. Fast and right the first  time. Go to Assist Express. Very affordable. Monthly fee means you can assist as many people  as you have time for without paying extra for it. They've got a nice feature. It allows you to do  eight sessions at once. Why would you want to do that? Well, let's say you run a scan on one.  You don't have to wait. You can just go to the next one, run an install on that one, go to the  next one. You can continue to move along. It's great if you could drag and drop files from your  computer to there. So if you've got a hot fix, for instance, for Microsoft, just drag it right  over Malwarebytes or whatever. It also will give you an assay of what operating system exactly down  to the point number, what security software, everything running in the background. Look,  I can go on and on, but the best thing to do is go to the website, go to assist.com, G-O-T-O,  assist.com slash twit. And you could try it for free for 30 days. It is absolutely the IT support  tool. And if you do support, whether it's as an IT person, a software support person, or just the  geek around the house, they've got day passes for people who don't do it every day. It's fantastic.  Integrated live chat too. Go to assist.com slash twit. We thank them for their support.  This is from canoe.ca, Canoe Technology, special to QMI agency. This is the  the forward from Inside Jobs. Is that the name of it? Inside Jobs? No, I thought it was just called  Steve Jobs. It's just called Steve Jobs. Well, I wonder, I hope this is not a fake. Oh, there it is,  Steve Jobs. Maybe this is what they titled the article. All right. There's the cover.  I think it was originally called like iJobs or something. And then i was. Yeah, that's not good.  Just Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs. That's plenty. That's good. It's perfect because it's about Steve Jobs.  That same image that Apple used on their website when Steve passed away, which is a very dramatic  image. Isaacson was handpicked by Jobs to write this book. Former managing editor of Time magazine.  He's the chief executive at Aspen Institute. He's written a number of very good books.  But I want to scroll down. I won't read you the whole thing, but let me read you the last  a couple of paragraphs from this obviously written after Steve passed away. He says,  a few weeks ago, I visited Jobs for the last time in his Palo Alto home. He had moved to a  downstairs bedroom because he was too weak to go up and down stairs and he was curled up in some  pain, but his mind was still sharp and his humor vibrant. We talked about his childhood and he gave  me some pictures of his father and family to use in my biography. As a writer, I was used to being  detached, but I was hit by a wave of sadness as I tried to say goodbye. In order to mask my emotion,  I asked the one question that was still puzzling me. Why had he been so eager during close to 50  interviews and conversations over the course of two years to open up so much for a book when he  was usually so private? I wanted my kids to know me, he said. I wasn't always there for them and I  wanted them to know why and to understand what I did. Wow. I'm looking forward to this book. It goes  on sale October 24th. Of course, pre-orders on Amazon are through the roof. I hope it will not  be a hate geography. I hope it will be an honest portrayal because as we know, Steve Jobs was a  complex person. He wasn't always good. He wasn't always kind. He was always demanding. He was a  perfectionist. What did you think, Mike, when you heard the news? Well, you know, it's something

I'm sure we  all did that one of these days this news is going to come out and what's that going to be like? It  was kind of hard to imagine. I thought one of the most interesting things about Jobs as a person,  as an icon and all that stuff is, and one of the reasons I'm looking forward to this book,  because really we don't know that much about Steve Jobs. There are some stories that have been  told and retold again and again and again, but they're little fragments of his life. We don't  really have what was in between all of those famous moments. I'm hoping the book will finally,  for the first time, have those things out there. This is a guy who's a pure product of Silicon  Valley. People nowadays come from all over the world to go to Silicon Valley. He was born there.  He was born in San Francisco. He was raised in Mountain View. If you look at Silicon Valley on  Google Maps and try to find the center of Silicon Valley, it's like his house. He was born in the  middle of it. It's not just the place, but the time. He was raised in a time in the 60s and 70s,  growing up, running around the valley. This is before they had play dates and all that stuff.  Kids just ran free and did whatever they wanted. What did he want to do? He went dumpster diving at

That gave root to Intel and all these other companies.  I'm mispronouncing the name. Anyway, it all happened right there. When kids, when teenagers  were idolizing pop stars, Elvis and the Beatles and all that stuff, he idolized Hewlett and Packard  and apparently Land.

Transcript:  In addition to the technology influences, and this is something you rarely hear people talking  about, he was also influenced by other aspects of the Bay Area. One of them being a sense of  optimism about the future that existed in California at that time, which I remember personally. I grew  up in Southern California and it was just an overwhelming sense of optimism. Nowadays,  all these emo kids are walking around...

He took all that in and integrated  into his total personality. You can't really understand jobs without understanding all of that  and the degree to which he really was a pure product of Silicon Valley.  I think that's a very good point.

Transcript:  Within the consumer electronics industry, you're assuming that Steve was very personally  involved up until the end or close to the end. You'll see his hand in products for the next two  years. It goes out that far. But I think the important things were trying to instill the  way that he thinks and works and the culture that I think he wanted Apple to become.  When he first left earlier this year, I wrote a piece then and I've heard the sentiment that I  basing it all around. I called the piece, Living in Steve's House. The sentiment was basically,  he built this house and it's not Scully's house anymore. It's Steve's house and everyone who  comes into Steve's house is going to be thinking about him and what would Steve do.

Transcript:  If you could come up with the right answer to what would Steve do.  That's not easy. Guy Kawasaki heard him on CNBC saying, I was just at Disneyland. Obviously,  Disney survived Walt Disney with its image intact. In fact, it's not true. Disney almost  went under after Disney died. They went through a very bad period. It wasn't until  Eiger came along that really they were able to turn themselves into a very different company.  Disneyland may preserve Walt's vision, but that's about it. I don't see anybody in the current  executive suite that has anywhere near Steve's vision or creativity or even taste.

Start time: 1866.82
End time: 1888.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's unfair because we just don't know the executives there. We've never gotten a chance  to know them because it's always been the Steve show. Tim Cook is a great logistics guy. That's  why he's there. Genuinely, I don't know that Tim does not have his vision. I can't say that  confidently. We do know that he doesn't have his impact, his influence over people in the company.

Start time: 1890.04
End time: 1965.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead. I think Tim Cook... There was a story that came out shortly after Tim Cook  was named CEO about him dispatching a worker to China to begin some of the work that was done  there early on with establishing the factories there. It was a very Steve Jobs-like statement.  He said to the guy, okay, we need to do this. He spoke to someone else and he turned and he  looked to the guy and said, why are you still sitting here? That's very Steve Jobs-like.  Profiles that you saw of him after he was named, he has this spine of steel, this  gentlemanly Alabama nature to him, but very forceful and in a quiet way.  I think if you combine that... We forget about Johnny I, who is the design and usability. He is  one side of Steve's brain and Tim Cook is the other. I think what Apple should hope for is that  those two guys mind-meld if they haven't already. I think those two are it. Jobs surrounded himself

Start time: 1965.20
End time: 2011.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with great people. He did on the Macintosh team. He was clearly very good at that. I think in  every respect, he was the leader that they needed to get the very best out of themselves.  I agree, we don't know Ryan because we haven't seen these guys, but I have to think that Jobs  is a truly unique individual and it's highly unlikely that there's another Steve Jobs lurking  there. Let me put it this way. Steve Jobs would have never worked for Steve Jobs. If there's a man  Steve Jobs drive, that's right. If there's a man with Steve Jobs drive in that number two position,  what the hell is he doing there? Because that's not the kind of person that works for a Steve Jobs.  So I think there's almost the nature of the environment is that when you have a Steve Jobs,

Start time: 2011.62
End time: 2070.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the people who are surrounding him are not. The only point that I'm trying to make is that,  well, there's a couple. One, Apple doesn't necessarily need Steve Jobs at this point  to go on and thrive. I mean, okay. There may be enough momentum there to continue.  Let's say that Apple now becomes 80% as good as it was with Steve Jobs at the height in the past  10 years. That's still going to make it 50% better than number two. That's a good point.  The other supposition here is that you need to find a replacement. Nobody's going to replace  anybody. If Johnny Ive went back to England tomorrow, you couldn't replace Johnny Ive. But  you move forward. And I think Steve made it his personal goal to ensure, I mean, he knew he was  going. He knew he was on his way out. And he made it his personal goal to ensure that his legacy  would live on. I mean, that's what you want as a founder. You care about the legacy of your company.

Start time: 2070.14
End time: 2110.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what you hope for. I just wonder how easy that is to do. I keep hearing the phrase,  he injected his DNA and so forth. And certainly, I'm sure he shared with all these guys. There's a  story somebody told me, an Apple employee told me that in his last days on campus, Steve took a walk  with Tim Cook and pointed and made sure that everybody saw him walking the campus going like  this. And then that and I want you to do that. And we're going to be doing that. Almost to say,  I am passing along the plan to Tim to implement. That's the kind of thing you write. A  founder wants to do. But I think it's so hard to really continue. Look at the stories that people

Start time: 2110.50
End time: 2194.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are telling about Steve Jobs. Here's just one typical story. Originally, the front of the  original iPhone was supposed to be plastic, a very high grade, high tech form of plastic.  And everybody said it had to be plastic. It made sense from a manufacturing point of view,  from a durability point of view, from a cost. Everybody said it had to be plastic and it was  going to be plastic. And at the very last minute, Steve Jobs says, you know what, I can't live with  plastic. It has to be glass. And the only reason is not that Steve Jobs had that opinion, but because  he was Steve Jobs, that opinion is the reason there's glass on the iPhone. And so who's going  to do that? Who's going to say move it over two pixels? Who even has the power to do that?  Right. Even if there was a clone of him with a different name, they don't have the power and  influence and adulation of the company. But also to Ryan's, that's one perspective to Ryan's point  and just to build on what he was saying. I think that when he came back, what he learned it next  was how to be a kick-ass business leader. And when he came back, he cleaned house. It was the  Godfather. He replaced the board. He replaced the executives. And rightly so. He didn't hesitate  to just put the right people in place. Today, all the family's business will be done.  And so the Apple of today is everybody in that company is there because Steve Jobs won't be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right now. Well, they were in the short term. I mean, they'll be back. They'll be fine. Like I said,  they've got a couple of years before they really need to start proving that the transition of  vision has occurred. And it is that vision, I think. I'm glad you said that. I think that's  great. I hope that's right. I just, you know, I try to take a long-term view of these things. I mean,  you know, if this is not the Apple of the 80s where, you know, there was a huge void in vision  and it was just coming from all sides. I think this is a dramatically different and much more  organized and far more, you know, personalized to Steve Jobs' vision and way of doing things and way  of thinking. I just, you know, if there is going to be something that really falls apart,  I don't even think we're going to see it immediately. I think it's going to take a long

Start time: 2251.78
End time: 2292.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  time for us to get there. There's one word that explains why you should hang on to your Apple stock  and that word is China. Apple has barely begun its takeover of the Chinese consumer electronics  market and they love Apple stuff in China. Love it so much that they make their own.  They have their own Apple stores.  Yeah, exactly. So, but, you know, you look at, you know, they're not on China mobile yet officially  and yet the iPhone is the number one phone. Unauthorized iPhones are the dominant phone  on China. Wait till that, you know, that's a done deal and the iPads and I mean, it's really,  you know, China is going to be half the global market and it hasn't really started.

Start time: 2292.88
End time: 2308.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a very interesting point. And I have to say, I think if there is a next Steve Jobs,  he will probably or she will probably come from China because the culture there does  support that kind of, you know, capitalism and innovation and I think we might be surprised

Start time: 2308.36
End time: 2336.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as to who the next Steve Jobs is. You know, actually, the story that you told about the glass  is really interesting to me and, you know, as you were telling the story and I'd heard it before,  you know, it just kind of made me think, well, what if the iPhone had come out and it didn't  have glass, you know, it still would have been a huge success. I mean, like, yes, it would not  have been the iPhone exactly as we know today and yes, like the glass is clearly preferable.  I mean, I would not want an iPhone without the glass at this point. But the iPhone is the result

If we do see changes, there'll be little things.  Yeah, it'll be subtle. There'll be little products will come out and say, people will say,  people like me will say, Steve Jobs, Steve would never have done that. Yeah. Yeah. I think a big

Start time: 2352.30
End time: 2412.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  part of it, though, and this is kind of behind the scenes magic is just that Apple at the size and  the scale and the influence that it has now can actually make those decisions almost willy nilly  and not have to worry too much about it. I mean, if Samsung were in that position, maybe not Samsung,  they're actually really, really big, but, you know, take, take, you know, a couple of steps down. If  the Motorola was in that position, they might not have the ability to make that decision because  they don't have the clout, the resources necessary with manufacturers and materials makers.  They don't have the scale to be able to pull something like that off. Whereas Apple actually,  yes, we, we, we, I think we can agree that maybe there isn't an individual who's going to step in  and make that decision yet. Maybe it's I've maybe it's cook, but if they're forced on whoever it is,  if somebody does make that decision, we know that they can execute. Right. And that's not something  every consumer electronics manufacturer can say. They just have a scale where they can do whatever  they want. They have a juggernaut. They're limited only by their imagination. They have a production

Transcript:  And Mike, Mike, one of the, one of the things, you know, about you're saying that people like  me will point that out. I think people are going to be lying and wait for the non-steam jobs products  and they'll be hypercritical and they'll find the two pixels and they'll say, see Steve has gone.  But, you know, the average person may not necessarily see it that way. I think, I think,  I agree that, that Apple is really good in the long term. I think they have five,  about five years to run in the momentum of Steve jobs. And I think after five years will be the  real test, but Apple has been through a test and that's also burned into their DNA, kind of that  failure from the eighties. And you have to remember that when Steve left, when he was kicked out,  he already had lost control. It wasn't Steve jobs Apple anymore. You know, the Macintosh project was  something he had to do because Apple had become too bureaucratic and he had to sneak off to do it.  Right. And so it long ago had become not Steve's company. And that has changed dramatically. I  think they've got about five years and, and then I think we'll see the real test. You know, Dwight,

If so, if you, if you see any kind  of failure with iCloud, if iOS five is not as great as you want it to be, or if, you know,  there's like really bad production problems with the iPhone four S that we don't yet know about  because it's not yet out, there's some kind of hardware failure, whatever you see anybody say,  oh, that's because Steve is gone.

I don't want to rush us because this is a huge  topic. We've talked a lot about Apple. I have mixed feelings about doing any media about  Steve's passing. It just feels strange. You know what we did?

In fact, we asked Oum to be on the show,  and he said it was too personal for him to talk about. But Oum said he's our Elvis. And in a way,  I think he is. Or our John Lennon.

Transcript:  Yes. Maybe. Yeah. You know, people feel the sense of connection with Steve,  I think maybe through the keynotes. But I think I actually came most from the products. And I was  thinking about why this is. And part of it is Steve's goal with every product that he made was to  create something that I think that he felt people could connect to and that was intuitive.

Start time: 3061.22

Transcript:  You know, and I think what we wound up with in the end was, you know, a series of products that some  of us have had for decades, depending on how far back you go with using Macs, that, you know,  in the end, it wasn't just that the products worked well and made sense and were intuitive in  ways that other products weren't. And it wasn't even that they were products that we were able  to forge emotional bonds with that I think that we, you know, before the iPhone, I don't think  people had very many emotional bonds with their cell phones, for example. This is something that  very early on in the early days of Engagile, like 2004, it's really what drew me to doing a site  just about consumer electronics is the emotional bond that you form with a piece of hardware.  Sometimes.  It's very interesting, isn't it?  But it wasn't those things to me. What it was, I think, was that because these products made sense  and because these products were usable, they made you feel like somebody understood you,  that Steve understood you. And I think that might be a big part of the reason why people  felt such an emotional connection with him as an individual.  Wow, that's really interesting.

Start time: 3149.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Leo, one of the things I wanted to, one of the stories I wanted to point out in this shows how  emotional people in Silicon Valley got as a result of Steve's death. Brian Lamb,  who was the editor at Gizmodo when the iPhone 4 prototype incident happened, wrote this remarkable  apology, essentially, the way he behaved. And from reading it, and maybe Ryan knows a little bit  more about this than I do, but it reads almost as though one of the reasons that Brian left was  because of, was the result of the iPhone 4 incident and the way they handled it.  He felt bad.  Yeah, he felt really bad. And he called himself an a-hole.

Start time: 3199.52
End time: 3255.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't speak for Brian. I mean, I think he would have to speak to that. He's one of my  dear friends and I, you know, I had a lot of conversations with him at the time when this  was happening. And everything he describes in the piece on the wire cutter is exactly  how I remember it going down behind the scenes. Of course, I've never been able to talk about it.  I mean, he can talk about it freely. I don't, I think that there are definitely some misgivings  about the way that Gawker Media as a company wanted to handle that story. And I think maybe  there were some differences between how the editorial staff wanted to treat it and how,  you know, the people who run Gawker wanted to treat it.  But, you know, all that stuff is kind of, I think at the end you see that Steve maybe thought it was  water under the bridge. And I think that's kind of the important part is, you know, that you got to,  at least Brian got to, you know, bury the hatchet a little bit.  I love that he talks about getting a call from Steve Jobs when they have the iPhone 4 prototype.

Start time: 3258.28
End time: 3333.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the call goes, hi, this is Steve. I really want my phone back.  The fact that he called is very interesting. He says he wasn't demanding. He was asking and he was  charming and he was funny. I was half naked just getting back from surfing, but I managed to keep  my stuff together. I appreciate you had our fun, your fun with our phone and I'm not mad at you.  I'm mad at the sales guy who lost it because, but we need the phone back because we can't let it  fall into the wrong hands. I thought maybe it's already in the wrong hands. He continued,  I thought maybe it's already in the wrong hands. He continued, there are two ways we can do this.  I can send someone to pick up the phone. Brian says, I don't have it, but you know, someone who  does, or we could send someone with legal papers and I don't want to do that. He was giving us the  easy way out. And before he hung up, this is what I love. He said, by the way, what do you think of  it? And that is, I think that says it right there. There's a, this is not a, you know,  I think we often see him as a, as a calculating machine, as a person who was calculating every  moment, but I think he genuinely loved these products he was creating. And, and he had,  he's saying, Brian, so what'd you think? You like it? I mean, that is a guy who really wants to know.

Transcript:  Levy obituary that he wrote on wire? I think I did. Tell me what that one had a really interesting.  So Steven's, you know, been talking to an interviewer jobs for, you know, since the early 80s.  I mean, he has perspective that very few people I think in the industry haven't.  I love what he wrote, but he did mention, you know, at a particular point that Michael Moritz,  who's now a very famous VC, who used to write for time, did a profile on Steve and wound up  naming that I think is the Mac was the person of the year when Steve was expecting it to be him.  And ever since then, he'd felt like he'd been burned by journalism or journalists and had never  really been able to shake that. I don't know if that's necessarily exactly. I mean, I assume that  it is because I think Steven would know better than anybody else. Something had never let that go.

Start time: 3461.22
End time: 3507.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something happened because I, you know, as I said, I'd spent time socially with him. And later,  you know, he recognized me, but he would never speak to me. And I was told Steve does not trust  the press. He will not speak to you because he doesn't trust what you will write. And so something  definitely happened at some point where he said, I know that most of these guys, maybe there's a  few exceptions, maybe the Walt Mossbergs of the world, I can trust with, you know, the last  interview Pogue had David shared this with me. David was told not to ask certain questions. He  did. And that was it. Boom. And never again. And I, you know, despite the fact that he's writing for  the, you know, arguably one of the most prestigious outlets in the country, you really can't, you go  in and you read the press. They're not on your side. They're not on your side.

Transcript:  deceive jobs would get on the phone with a journalist with an agenda saying, I want to,  I want to convey the following three things. And the lead would be something irrelevant.  You know, that's how, that's what it's like to interact with the press. That's normal. That's  our job. We're not your press agents. So there's just no advantage for Steve to be always talking  to people like you, Leo, who are, you know, who are going to be out there being journalists.  He's got very little to gain. Exactly. But if you know, he carefully chose the journalists and they  were, they weren't the tech press, never. He always cultivated the mainstream press. Interesting.

Start time: 3553.12
End time: 3604.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go in and you read the Walt Mossberg piece, which was just really touching, even Mossberg,  at the beginning, when he talks about Steve calling him, he says, I realized, you know,  he was talking to a journalist and he had an agenda and Steve knew that and journalists,  hopefully who talked to him knew that. And, you know, I, I still go back to this. I think a lot  of what he did was, was very calculated and he knew exactly what he was doing. And I think you  see that in Apple's PR machine. I mean, I think Apple's PR machine really reflects Steve Jobs'  attitude toward the press and kind of the way he wants to control and make sure that everything's  done. And there are, you know, there are infamous stories about the, the PR group at, at Apple  being vindictive and cutting people off because they don't write exactly what,

I mean, we can,  we're all going to get back to that part of the world soon enough. I, you know, I would just kind  of prefer to, to, you know, reflect on why, why we have the emotional connection with these products  that we do and, and I love that. I love that topic. I think you're right. Why we, why we feel this way  about someone. Are there other products that we feel that way about? Are there other companies

There's a, there's a hierarchy of, of, of products that  give you an emotional connection and they, you use them as part of your identity as a way to,  to tell the world, you know, this is part of who I am.

I think it's oftentimes as a response to Apple, you know, I mean, you get a  lot of people who look for an anti-Apple response, right? Who look for products that, that are a  strong alternative to an existing Apple product. And, and, you know, the zoom kind of comes to mind  is that was a good product and I still hold it. It was a good product, but I think that way,  what the zoom did better was galvanizing people who were sick of the iPod. If they loved it,

End time: 3761.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

So we know, we know that like clearly there are enough people to get  that kind of a response in, in, you know, the mainstream consumer audience and that it's not  even just that like a bunch of geeks line up outside the Apple store.

Apple stuff is kind of  commoditized. They own the stack though, right? They, they own it from end to end,  as we like to say in the industry.

It wasn't window dressing. It wasn't decoration. It was, it was  from the very center. The elegance started from the center of the device and it came outward through  the software. Well, as geeks, we love that. And so if you look at app, if you look at HP,  it's perfect example of a company that's trying really hard to make computers personal again.  And what it's doing is it's taking a commodity thing and slapping a bunch of junk on top of it.

Transcript:  But, but look at the iPad. The iPad has weaker electronics than most of the Android competitors.  And yet the performance is far better. It's got 512 megs of RAM. They don't even,  how do they do that? You know, there's, they're really seriously, you know, it's kind of a black  box. You don't hear about the people inside Apple doing what they do, but there's a lot of really  brilliant people in there doing something because, you know, if you look at the, the performance of  the iPad, just the, you touch the screen, an instant response compared to many of the Android  tablets. And there's a line somewhere where your brain says, okay, this doesn't feel real.  On this side of the line, it does feel like real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with you. I think that people looking at, say, the Android Zoom, Android tablet and  comparing it to the iPad, they may not have been able to quantify it, but it was that  responsiveness, that just that feeling. And that came from this kind of underlying attention to  detail that makes Apple unique. And it starts with the CPU.  AT&T said they sold 200,000 iPhone 4Ss in the first 12 hours of pre-ordering. I can only imagine  what Verizon and Sprint did. You know, you don't have to announce a revolution. People,  what that says is that people trust Apple. That's sight unseen. They're going to order  this because it's the next thing and Apple always delivers, right? Isn't that what that's saying?

Start time: 4136.18
End time: 4157.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, by Apple scale, 200,000 doesn't seem like crazy.  If you look at any other cell phone company in the world, any of them, they would be so happy  to have their best phone sell 200,000 units over the course of its lifetime. So, I mean,  200,000 units is... This was by noon.

Transcript:  When it is the free iPhone. That's right.  It makes me scratch my head. Now, I'm a very happy Samsung Galaxy S2 user. I love it. And I'm very  intrigued by this Galaxy Prime. Now, this was the Samsung, whatever they're going to call it, Nexus  Prime. So, Tuesday, they were at CTIA is going on in San Diego, Tuesday, and we all got invitations.  Big announcement from Samsung and Google. And it even appeared on Google's Android channel. So,  I think it's pretty safe to say it was ice cream sandwich that they were going to announce,  running on a new Samsung handset, the long rumored Galaxy Nexus Prime. We even saw a video of a very  beautiful kind of curved thing. Then we got the email, I think it was Friday, saying, nope,  it's off because it would be tasteless to announce a new product in the wake of Steve Jobs' death.  That seems odd, given that Samsung and Apple are at each other's throats. Not much love between  Samsung and Google either. What do you make of that? Is it really that they thought it would be

Start time: 4241.68
End time: 4259.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tasteless to announce it? What's the acceptable time to wait? I mean, that did strike me as odd  and almost a little self-serving. How long do you wait? I mean, if you have a product,  you're in the pipeline, it's already been announced. I don't see why that would be offensive

Start time: 4260.38

You can't compete against those two  mammoth companies. They're already kind of... Which is why I think that one of the reasons the  Department of Justice, in fact, said maybe we better block this. It's not going from four to  three that we're worried about. It's going from four to two that we're really worried about.

They blew it, too.  They bought a technology at the end of its life. Yes. Not as Apple says in the spring,  which is when they like to do it. So Nextel was a huge, huge investment for them. I mean, it was  so much so that it could have just completely put them out of business if it had gone worse.  Then they did Wimax, which was impossibly stupid when we could all see that the world is heading  towards LTE. They need something. Look, if they go out of business, nobody's going to say like,  oh, well, the circumstances and this and that. I mean, they put themselves in this position.

Transcript:  If I remember correctly, Ericsson had a very similar pattern that Nokia's had over the years  where Ericsson used to have two big parts of his business. One is the infrastructure business,  towers, radios, all the things that make the infrastructure side work, which is actually  the more lucrative side. And that's why the Sony Ericsson handset business came to exist.  They did the JV with the handset part of their business. So it really doesn't surprise me that  they want to be spinning that out. I think Nokia got rid of their infrastructure business.

Well, they had it. You know, this Windows 8, they have Mangoes coming out, and now Xbox  TV? I don't know. We'll find out. Before we do, though, let's talk about audible.com.  I am sure they will have the jobs biography on Audible. I hope they do. They were talking  in the chat room about it. I wonder who's reading it and all of that.  I think it should be you, Leo.  I would. You know what? I would do it pro bono if they'd let me. I would do it for free. I would  do it tomorrow if they don't have her. Hey, audible. If you don't have anybody, I'd like to  do it. No, of course, wouldn't that be a great book to read out loud? I don't care if it's a  thousand pages. They do have a lot of Steve Jobs books, almost all of them available on audible.com  if you're interested in reading icon or even some of the older Steve Jobs books. In fact,  those are even perhaps more interesting. There's one we had talked about. Let me see if I can find  it. That was the return to the Little Kingdom. No, that's not. That's the Michael Moritz book.  Alan Deutschman's The Second Coming of Steve Jobs. Of course, there's Jeffrey Young's icon.  It seems like there was an older one. Maybe that is The Return of the Little Kingdom.  No, that's not it. There it is. The Second Coming of Steve Jobs. That was it. This came out in 2000.  It's an earlier book about Steve Jobs and a very interesting read. There's some great stuff  on audible. If you're interested in reading about technology, history, classics, business,  sci-fi, they're wonderful. Audible is 75,000 great books and one of them is waiting for you.

And they all tend to be with  providers who have infrastructure that's not cable. So it's like, you know, we can do like,  you know, fiber, we can do, you know, high speed DSL stuff like that, where they can get a really  high speed pipe to your house enough to deliver IPTV, but they maybe don't actually have dedicated  cable infrastructure. So I think we've still kind of yet to see this really come into play  here. But you know, the stuff like HBO Go, I mean, that's to me very, very exciting.

But, you know,  at the end of the day, they're always going to be hamstrung by, you know, Comcast or whomever,  who doesn't want to see them basically replace their cable set top box business.

Not to keep bringing it back to Apple, but there was one thing that they kept kind of  talking about that Tim kept bringing up in the Apple keynote last week, and that was,  Apple is the only company that successfully marries all of these products and design and,  you know, integration across all of their products all the time. Nobody else can really say that.  Sony definitely can't say that. I mean, when was the last time that you saw a Sony machine  that could do anything with, say, a PSP or with your PS3? Or, you know, what does your PS3 do with  your Sony HDTV that's any different from any other HD? I mean, you know, they make everything,  and yet none of that stuff is coherent together. And we could talk about like the quality,  individual quality of some of this.

That's just bizarre. In fact, remember Mark Zuckerberg at F8 said, I still don't think this  could possibly be true, that they had half a billion people use Facebook in one day.

No. No. I really have not. Come on. That would be funny.  Come on. He was the man of the year in 2010. On Wednesday, Thor Bjorn Njaglund, chairman of the  Nobel Peace Prize committee, said, for me and the committee, it's quite obvious if you look at the  world today and see what is happening out there, what are the major forces pushing the world in  the right direction? Mark Zuckerberg. I don't think he actually said Mark Zuckerberg, but the  implication was National Review writer Jay Norlinger, who has a book on the history of  the Nobel Peace Prize coming out this March, said, it is possible Zuckerberg could win the

You know, well, I mean, he's created something amazing, but it seems like you're forgetting  that it's actually the real invention of note. The thing that's actually important here is the  internet and the web. That's the real important thing here in that there's going to be connective  tissue always. I'm actually kind of surprised it's taken so long for one company to accumulate so  much of that in one place, but there's always going to be something that connects people. It's  really the technology that underlies it. He has united the world in opposition to

Transcript:  done. They're following through. She said that they were going to make a decision this month.  She has said or actually Ray Lane said that they would not sell it. So it's either to raise the  chairman of the board. Right. Right. And he said they will not sell it, but they may spin it off  or they may end up keeping it. I was out last week at the old Compact campus. HP was doing an event  showing off how they build and design their business computers. And there was some speculation  at the time off the record and not from anybody I could talk about that the people who are out  there are hoping that if they spin it off, 70% of the employees who work for the personal systems  group are at the Houston campus and that they would essentially, if they spun it off, it will be  based in Houston. Wow. And it will be the rebirth of Compact essentially because that's a lot of  the people who are there. Well, I'm sure you'll be following this with interest. I think they should  spin it off because I think it will give them more agility and make them a better competitor.  I think right now they're just kind of buried under the weight of HP's bureaucracy. They should call

But there's something that really bugs me about that whole Palm thing and  it's this. Remember that scene in Pirates of Silicon Valley where Steve Wozniak takes the  wooden Apple 1, 2 suits at HP. They have the future in their hands. They own it already.  And they don't recognize it for what it is. If the future is multi-touch user interfaces,  HP already owns a really good one. And are they doing that again? And it's not commodity.
