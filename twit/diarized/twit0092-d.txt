Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is twit.  Bandwidth for this week in tech is provided by AOL radio at  AOL dot com, slash podcasting.  This is twit.  This week in tech episode 92 for March 25th, 2007, the Tiki gods.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for twit and an unusual kind of a  cast of twits this time.  In fact, a really, I think might be one of my favorite casts of  twists this twit this time.  Starting off with the guys from Tiki Bar TV, Tiki Bar dot TV, Kevin  Gamble and Jeff McPherson are Johnny Johnny and Dr.  Tiki respectively.  Kevin, it's nice to have you.  Thanks for joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having us, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Johnny Johnny.  I can even see his leopard fez right now.  Yes.  Hello.  And then Jeff McPherson is the good doctor.  Aloha.  I tried to get you on twit when I, I, I've been a Tiki Bar fan since I  think episode two, I just fell in love immediately and I sent you an email.  And at the time you said, oh yeah, I'll be on the show, but I have to stay in character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, indeed.  Actually, I pulled that email up.  Let me see if I can pull it up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, framed it's framed over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I thought, well, I could put him on, but I don't know.  The conversation wouldn't go very far.  I mean, no, it's not a dream.  I like the technology.  But he really is Dr.  Tiki folks and he is wearing the lab coat.  He's got the clipboard and he's about to write you a prescription for a cocktail.  Do you die for, in fact, Merlin man, who's also on with us from the Merlin show.com.  Hi Merlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How's it going, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He asked Dr.  Tiki for, what was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need a 400 email, a backlog cocktail, maybe something for gin and lime and some  templates in a tall, tall glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would this be something you drink while answering 400 emails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just helped me forget the pain as I tried through four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't really have 400 backlog emails, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man.  It's a long story.  I made this decision to start shunting off all of my kind of over the transom  public mail to this one Gmail account that I can really easily avoid.  And then when I finally open it, it's like, I'm doing something like that now with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually Doc Searles, who was on the show last week, inspired me.  He uses a service called to IDI, uh, which is an O it's one of these open ID companies,  but every open ID company has some sort of secret sauce to add to the open ID and  their, their open ID secret sauce is email.  So, uh, if you go to leoville.com or my radio show site, uh, and there's a  contact me link, what you'll get is a form at two ID, two ID, I.net, and then  you fill out that form and it validates that it's you.  So I thought, well, at least now I can put up an email safely without  worrying about spam and stuff.  And, and the fact that you have to, you know, authenticate and all that might  get people, it doesn't help at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing else does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do I mortgage payments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need a cocktail for 11,218 in box messages.  You got something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have that many Leo Leo.  Do you, Leo?  Yes.  You, all your email goes to the same place for all your shows and your personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I use filtering.  So if it comes to two ID, I, it goes into a separate folder.  So, uh, but it, but it, but I, but it all goes in the same,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but the Tiki guys are going to now join the, the existing coterie of people who  are constantly being pinged by people to go, Hey, how's it going?  I like your thing.  Hey, can you give me Leo's email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Merlin gets that a lot.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's like, I'm your communication.  Butler.  I get a lot of people who have some very important business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually did that to get Leo's email.  I had the, I am Kevin Rose and say, Hey, Kevin, I know his email address.  Oh yeah, sure.  I almost did that, but you know what I did?  I went back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What'd you do?  Dr.  I went back and looked at the, at the old email, uh, from the, from Tiki, Tiki  TV at J mail.  Did I, did I diss you when you said I want to stay in character?  No, no.  Do you want to hear it?  It is.  I'll do it as Leo Tiki bar.  TV is what my Vip pod was made for.  What is Vip pod?  That was one of your video, video, video, iPod, video, iPod.  I understand that was a neologism that didn't take.  Anyways, it says the whole world wants to know who you guys are.  Would you be interested in a quick Skype interview for Twitter?  We'd run it on our next episode.  Uh, if you wish to remain anonymous, I'll understand.  Cause that was why you were cultivating that.  That's right.  We were really taking advantage of the fact that nobody knew who we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before we go on, I really should, Craig is sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He can't say anything because he's anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our fourth, our fifth around the table is Craig Severson, the, the, the  grunt media guy from pod grunt.  Is it pod grunt.com or what do you grunt doc?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It grunt media.com is the main site, but we need, we need more level from Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More level.  I was complaining about how loud you were.  And then I made a mistake because you've now become very quiet.  Is this getting better?  No more, more, more, more, more, more level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's that?  Yeah, perfect.  There he is.  There's Mr.  Severson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There we are.  Craig, you've heard Craig, Craig on this week in media.  I think it's your first time on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, except for being a guest at a, at a, at a show at a, you know, at the podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  show down in Ontario, I'm about as I'm actually like a pig in doo doo right now,  because these are four of my favorite guys as in terms of user generated content.  That's what we're going to talk about today.  But anyway, now that I've introduced you, Craig, yes.  And it's, and it's gruntmedia.com.  Is that the best site to give out for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  Yeah.  It's the central hub of all things.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I might add that I've checked.  And in fact, uh, Randy South says we are audible in talk show.  So consider that we are now live.  We, I can't get the talk show client up, but, uh, if I can, I will,  we'll be taking questions later.  Anyway.  So what did you respond to that, uh, vi pod message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, what did I would do to that, to that vi pod?  Um, uh, hi Leo.  I've been meaning to get back to you.  Oh, again here.  See, this was a backlog.  You know, I'm sorry.  I did.  I appreciate the invite to be on Twitter and would still like to take you up on  your offer.  Uh, it wasn't my intention to come on the show and character.  I just wanted to avoid using my real name, but the cat is out of the bag now.  So we were, yeah, it was really interesting because people were writing stories  about, you know, this, this show, which is quite popular.  Nobody knows who these people are or where they're from.  And we sort of took advantage of that and thought this is funny.  And this has really never been, been able to occur before for people to put on.  Uh, a show and still be anonymous.  It's great.  Uh, yeah, it was cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think, I think Elvira did that.  The mistress of the dark.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But nobody's ever Elvira, but I mean, it wasn't just the performers that were  anonymous, it was like, who's making this, what cities it made it.  Where's it coming from?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And plus we were sponsors didn't want to be known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, uh, but you said, uh, Kevin, that, uh, you kind of let the cat out of the  bag a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we'd occasionally drop stuff on the show.  We'd have, we'd spell something in a, you know, the Canadian spelling color  with a U and so our fans would hop online saying, ah, they spelled color with a U.  They gotta be Canadian.  They're either Irish or Canadian, right?  Yeah.  And they, we didn't talk like fishermen.  We're obviously from Western Canada.  So they were starting to like narrowing in on us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were.  Yeah.  I wrote the name like Reginald Hordenstein.  I mean, you kind of want to, you know, kind of want to hide that.  Where's the man behind Reginald Hordenstein?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hordenstein and Hordenstein.  And it turns out I'm mispronouncing the name as well.  It's actually Hordenstein.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is actually a girl who is like Susan Hordenstein.  I, Hordenstein actually emailed and said that's, you're mispronouncing the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your own name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're mispronouncing your own fake name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought I kind of invented it, but apparently I did not invent that name.  It already existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a clan of angry Hordensteins that have a picture of me with the picture.  Hordenstein!  Hordenstein!  This man is the Antichrist!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys, I mean, if people are listening right now who haven't seen Tiki Bar,  pause your ViPod.  And download it right now because you've got to see what we're talking about.  And there's a third member of the cast, Lala, but she's actually a computer  generated, so we can't really interview her.  She's like, she's like Max Headroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She doesn't exist outside the walls of the interweb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's nobody shows much interest in her anyway.  So we've figured out, right?  She's really, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People come to the show for us really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I come for the Fez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, thank you.  I came for the Fez and stayed for the Lala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought this would be an apt time to get all of you on because you all do  video podcasts.  Merlin does the new one, The Merlin Show, which is doing quite well.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's a,  that pause is for you to bake a plug for how good you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually Leo, I'm really glad you asked me that.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, it's actually not too bad.  We've we had a nice little kind of breakthrough on the tech area of iTunes.  Well, I mean, that's one thing might be interesting to talk about is how iTunes  has kind of become sort of billboard charts for podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's that's kind of what I was going to talk about, which is now  that Apple TV is out, it's it's really a new playing field.  So you've got The Merlin Show, obviously Tiki Bar TV's video,  30 some episodes at 33, something like that.  For Tiki Bar.  Yeah. How many?  Twenty twenty three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twenty four.  Twenty four coming out in shortly.  A couple of days or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and Craig does a really good podcast called Video Grunt all about video.  Right. This is all professional looking.  His looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's yeah.  You know, well, I learned when we have this is now that I don't know.  This is going to be confusing.  We will have Kevin and Jeff on the lab, but we already taped it  last week talking about Tiki, and I had no idea how much work you put into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We put at least an hour into every episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it is a huge not only you tape for eight hours,  but you but you edit for days and weeks and months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a fair bit of consuming in there.  Well, eight hours of, you know, from the first drink being poured  to the cabs being called to take us home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where that's how I time it.  Anyway, what how does Apple TV change all this?  I install Merlin, you got one right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. And I'm having a heck of a time with it.  It's funny. I just.  Merlin, you have so much trouble because I how is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got the new airport extreme and it stalled fine.  I got the new Apple TV.  I installed it like it was midnight.  I installed in 10 minutes later. It was working great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, mine's mine's working great.  OK, I'm very happy with who else has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you guys have one or Craig, do you have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not yet. I'm waiting for a better input manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not. Whatever that is discussion later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not yet. Alex got one.  So yeah, he's going to work out the bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been happy. I'll have I have some negatives.  But let me let me ask you, Merlin, what was your experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, first of all, the setup, as I hope.  Well, it's funny, we talked about this a little bit on Macbreak Weekly.  This the whole thing with Apple's products kind of either stand or fall  based so much on how they feel to use, you know, when you're actually  putting your hands to them.  And I think the experience of it, one of the best parts of it,  to be honest, was the setting up.  It was just it was really easy as opposed to my airport extreme experience.  But the yeah, it's set up really easy.  Hooked up fine and automatically discovered  what turned out to be the computer that was right next to the computer.  Excuse me, right next to the TV to do the syncing.  So, yeah, I think that worked great.  And it's really it almost it's probably shares almost, I would say,  90 percent of its DNA with the iPod experience just in terms of syncing.  It won't it won't play the same movies that iTunes will play necessarily.  Oh, really? So you found some content that it wouldn't.  Well, it once it once I don't know if this has to do with streaming  or if it's an arbitrary decision, but it wants everything to be an MP4.  I believe there's some of these played everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because some of our high def stuff that would play in iTunes  on Mac break will not play on the Apple TV.  But once you got it synced, you guys see the hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's brain dead. It's just you sync it and then it just pushes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody somebody took the image.  Are you talking about the one that the guy who took the image off of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know somebody somebody rejigged their Apple TV already.  They've already figured out a way to put bigger hard drives in it.  Yeah. And you can run X, V, D, VX on it as well.  And that's what I'm looking for.  Because all of the hours in the hands of nerds,  that doesn't see what this thing can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and somebody's already posted the image, the drive image.  And apparently it's stripped down OS 10 and will run on other Macs.  So, oh, my goodness.  It's it's pretty pretty well been hacked, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, is that like it hasn't even arrived in stores in Canada yet.  And it's already been torn apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's good. See, that's one of the reasons we delay shipment to Canada  so that you guys can stand on the shoulders of giants.  That's right.  Oh, for those of you who aren't fans of Sir Isaac Newton,  I'm not insulting the Canadians. OK, no, no.  I have to say the thing that to me excited me and prompted me  to get this group together is that very prominently,  along with TV shows and movies, there's an entry podcasts and Tiki Bar.  I played Tiki Bar immediately on it.  It shows up. It's you're on a par now with Lost and The Office.  I mean, it's just another one of my shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how awesome is that? That's pretty crazy.  That's great. It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't heard people gather on the water cooler asking how, you know,  what the secrets of Tiki Bar are yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't stand around the same water cooler as I do.  Mostly they say so. How can I meet Lala?  Mostly what they're saying right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should we should bring her on the lab.  Have to be some kind of special party,  party event. Oh, there's a pretty PG show, though, isn't it?  The lab with its G baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  GG. Why is Lala foul mouthed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, I should mention that Tiki Bar probably isn't for the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Lala has been known to admit an expletive or two, but it's oh, yeah.  It's all a good fun. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She can control herself in public. I just thought that.  It's a rat.  A dance. We could come and dance.  Who just opened the ear to dance? I heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who does actually that was actually a Coca Cola beverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm enjoying. Oh, yeah. Sure. Johnny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh huh. Do people come up to you?  And I mean, they must assume that you are heavy drinkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They would assume correctly.  Actually, we tried that, actually.  I I crashed a dig taping.  I go to Comic Con every year for work as I do.  You know, work on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should mention this.  You work in the in the real traditional business as a producer of a cartoon.  I sort of straddle both worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, old school media in the traditional broadcast model  and also in new media, which is kind of cool.  So I do right now.  I'm producing a series for Cartoon Network and Teletoon here in Canada,  where we're doing George of the Jungle.  So I'm producing that, which will be on the air in the summer. George. George.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  George George George George.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, please stop. Stop singing.  So I'm probably so sick of that.  So many times.  I'm George of the Jungle.  It's like, hey, I see one more guy hit a tree again.  The show is the show's looking great.  So that's really good.  Is it CGI or is it standard selling?  It's flash.  It's a flash show.  So it's painted backgrounds with flash animation.  And but I go to Comic-Con every year to sort of look for new stuff and everything.  And they're taking a Dignation there.  And so I went to the Dignation taping and we had this funny thing  where Johnny Johnny was going to arrive and hand out some cocktails and stuff.  And it was my first time sort of putting on the Fez in public and walking around,  which is a totally cool experience, because people are like,  we share a lot of the same fans, guys who watch dig, also watch twit, also watch Dikibar.  Afterwards, everybody wanted to do a shooter with Johnny Johnny.  I'm like, oh, yeah, hey, Johnny, Johnny's to a shooter.  I'm like, you bet.  And that was that was my first time not saying no.  And also the last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you know, Alex Albrecht's pain weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, good.  He and he kept sliding them over to me and passing me.  It was just it was very rapid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin was ditching that Kevin Rose was actually what hiding them.  He was tossing them over, throwing them over the bar and trying to just ditch them.  I've actually talked to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually talked to Kevin.  I think I mentioned this before, because I love Dignation, but I really wish they would.  It feels to me like they promote binge drinking.  And frankly, I think kids listen and watch Dignation.  His audience is very much teenagers.  And it bothers me.  Now, you guys are clearly aimed at adults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We certainly we have the explicit rating on iTunes.  And I mean, that's we don't we're not a show for the six to eleven crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but it is something that we take into account that I think about.  When we started the show, it was there was no audience.  So we thought maybe there was a couple of hundred people watching.  You know, what did what did this behavior matter?  And in fact, we were sort of mocking and satirizing,  you know, collegiate drinking and just being fools.  And now that there's hundreds of thousands of people watching, we do think about it.  We think like, you know, how much are we still letting people know that it is show  while we are enjoying some drinks?  The you know, the joke of the Foster Brooks, the Dean Martin excessive drinking.  Right. Is the joke.  We're not really pounding, you know, it's happened on one or two episodes  where there's there's been a few cocktails.  But but I think about that.  I'd like to actually come up with that.  And I'm glad. I mean, I think there's still something else going on in there.  Apart from, well, very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in a way, dig, dig, to me, is gone wild.  It's a little different.  And that's one of the things I don't like about Dignation.  I've talked to Kevin about it.  He said, well, yeah, we're I know.  And Kevin is sensitive to this.  And he said, yeah, we're going to cut it out, phase it out at the end of 2007.  Well, I see it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's quite true.  I mean, I'm entertained by it.  I find them wildly entertaining.  These guys are such charismatic fellows, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like when you get on a roll, those two are just so fun to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Alex is a hoot, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, he's really I would, you know, just on one final note on that drinking thing,  I would, you know, I've thought so many times about do we add the drink  responsibly to the end of the episode?  But yeah, here's the problem I have with that.  It's like our little slogan,  one line of slogan cannot take place of, you know, years worth of good parenting.  I can't if that little line really does change whether or not you're going to get  behind the wheel of a car or get into a bar fight.  I just I just don't believe it.  I don't believe that little slogan.  Not with the younger audience either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll just be taken as exactly the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's just it's like, you know, like, you know, car commercials.  Why? I mean, it's it's it's insulting in a car commercial when it says  this is a closed course by a professional driver.  Do not attempt to drive your vehicle on high tension lines 300 feet above the ground.  You know, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. And this raises the issue.  I mean, we when you are a sideline, you know, a subculture medium,  it doesn't matter so much.  But increasingly, we have to face these issues as we move into the mainstream.  And is is is the fact that podcasting is on Apple TV and is a par with other media  now pose a whole new set of problems?  Merlin, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think it kind of does.  I mean, one thing that I really like about podcasting,  apart from the fact that it's pretty easy to kind of bootstrap your show,  is the fact that, you know, you really can kind of focus on a fairly narrow  slice of pie in terms of the people that very narrow in this case.  You don't need you don't need to be satisfying the audience to watch Happy Days.  You know, I like definitely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's ironic because Twitter is as narrow as you can get.  I think all of the Twitter podcasts are very narrowly focused,  and yet they do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's what I think the surprising thing happens with like you guys.  Like so, I mean, like one thing, it's funny, any time you do something creative.  I think it's always interesting to look back at what you thought was going to be  the hook when you started versus what it ends up being after people,  after the world has kind of decided what's what it's about.  And so you may start out doing one thing and then find yourself going, oh, wow.  Well, people seem to really have connected with this character or this thing.  Yeah. And that can be that can really kind of land you somewhere quite different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is one of the negatives I was thinking of is that you're not your own property

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anymore. Oh, it's absolutely.  Yeah. I mean, you can say whatever you want.  I mean, you realize this, you know, the first time you put up a blog post,  you have, you know, as long as you want to prepare it.  But then the world decides what it's really about after that.  And that's that can sometimes be a really strange experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, to your point about Twitter,  Twitter is it's a wide spectrum technology audience.  You know, you're not super focused on one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, even Windows or security now, which, which, you know, do do well.  I mean, these are niches that frankly, look what happened to tech TV.  We tried it and it failed.  And I think the networks in the US have decided there's no room for technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But look at that cost.  This is something that Alex Lindsay talks about a lot that I think is fascinating  is the whole concept of what it cost you to shoot a minute.  Right. I mean, this costs nothing to do.  Literally. Yeah, exactly.  And so, I mean, even with the high quality that the folks like the Tiki guys  and Craig are making, you compare that to an episode of Law and Order.  And I mean, obviously, we're talking about a different scale, but, you know,  pound for pound user for user, it's a much less costly experience.  So you can afford to do stuff that's a little more segmented.  But then it catches on.  And well, that's what's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in a way, there's a big there's such a big audience when you super serve  a niche in a way that mass media doesn't do.  Can't. Yeah, can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, what's interesting, it's true.  Like it would be a mistake for us to try and broaden our appeal  because that's being handled by companies that have been doing it for 50 years  and they have millions of dollars.  So we really are trying to do the very best we can in our niche,  as we say in Canada or niche down south.  But super serve your niche.  You know, my experience when I watched Twitter,  sorry, when I watched, I watched, I watched Dignation and listen to Twitter.  I'm watching the guys on the on the sofa.  The level at which I am entertained is at par with other shows like, say,  you know, watching, I don't know, Lost.  I am fully entertained.  And granted, there are plenty of people that turn on Dignation and go,  this what how could you possibly be interested in this?  These are two drunk guys on a sofa talking, talking into their laptops.  But but when you're really captivated and I see that when people come up to us  and talk to us about how excited they are about Tiki Bar TV, they are  they are as engaged and fully engaged and entertain as as any of the other  content that they're into.  It's just that it's just a niche.  It is. It is an amazing time.  You've come on. North.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody somebody take over with a bit of vocabulary.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an amazing time now, like you say, with Apple TV, that literally anybody  with a Libsyn account and a Gmail account can be an  network television station.  And that is that's crazy.  Like, actually, Craig and I have been talking about this camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's coming out next month that actually I have pre-ordered that can and HV 20.  And so you get a camera now for like eleven hundred bucks  that does HD and with HDMI out.  It's just extraordinary to me with for like, say, a four or five thousand dollar  investment. You can have what used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars  even like 10 years ago.  And because you don't have this television and because you exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't have this corporate oversight, suddenly you can be much more creative.  You know, when Merlin and I were talking about, you know, what we would do  on the in a video show on the net, I said, you know,  I look at the earliest days of television and think of the freedom  that people had there because the medium wasn't defined.  And I think we're in the same position now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like 1948. I mean, they're really we're still this is sort,  you know, it's still kind of wrestling and we can be Ernie Kovacs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you know, we can really create a new medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other thing for me that's exciting about it is the  it's the short form video, you know, which which all of us are experiencing  is that this this whole medium allows us to do things that are short,  which really hasn't happened in mass media except for cartoons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think of people who do short short films and there's been a dearth  of places they could show those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And but I'm talking about even, you know, five minutes and under.  I mean, it's it's really quite a quite a wide opening,  especially in the world of nonfiction.  I think it's especially challenging for the Tiki guys to do something  that's fictional and really good, which I which I think is amazing what they do.  It's very hard.  Yeah, doing doing nonfiction is a lot easier,  but it's also gives us more documentary type people this opportunity  to create five minute programs, a series of them, you know,  that wouldn't ever be able to happen before before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that's also me, I had a post on 43 folders about this is  the whole challenge of HD and like I've got to, you know, whatever,  the low end HDTV, I'd love to have stuff from iTunes in HD.  But if it's going to be four gigs of downloading to get a movie,  I may not wait for that, but I might get a 720p podcast.  That's five or 10 minutes long.  So there's almost this competitive advantage to having short stuff  because, you know, nobody's going to wait around for Norbit in HD.  Thank God. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm not convinced that the Apple TV is a huge thing for my particular audience.  I don't feel I'm competing with loss because I actually don't want my stuff to go big.  I have no interest in someone watching video on HD.  But that's just me.  My whole thing is I love the portability.  I love the smallness and the efficiency of these things.  And it's not, you know, I think it's not to sit down on the couch and watch it.  Now, I am going to sit down on the couch and watch Tiki Bar  because that's more of an entertaining and it's more of a, you know,  a fictional sort of fantasy world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you get up and you're done.  I mean, it's like there's all sorts of food.  I can have a power bar and I can walk and eat that at the same time  or I can have a great dinner. It takes three hours.  I don't think anybody, you know, thinks that it's true.  People are going to consume dinner now in bar form.  Who's ever going to sit down for dinner again?  It's sort of like it's all sorts of storytelling, all sorts of media,  all sorts of stuff out there.  And like the great thing about this stuff is Udallik.  And it's a story on the go.  It's a five minute bite piece of media and you're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's jump back and talk about, you know, competition again for a second,  competing with one another.  You know, when this when this podcasting video podcasting first sort of broke out.  And that would have been around the time that Jobs announced the video  iPod or the Vipod as my friend before.  But I remember being  being advised by an agent friend of mine going, oh, you know,  other people were emailing me going, how do you encode, you know, and what  frame are you using?  And the agent said to me, oh, don't tell them, don't give them competitive advantage.  And how are you promoting your podcast?  What, you know, where are you listing it?  Are you listening on podcast pickle?  And and so I was sitting there going, oh, yeah, I got to be cool.  Don't tell anybody our secrets.  I'm going, we don't have. Wait a minute.  We don't have a secret.  You know, Apple noticed the show and gave us a huge boost in PR.  But pretty much the, you know, the Internet people found the show.  And and further to that, like now I'm trying to share any information  with anybody and have  because I realize, you know, I'm not competing with it.  Ninja audience or your audience or revision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not like TV in the 70s where you got three channels.  There's no.  It's just a question of people wanting to put stuff in a queue  and watch it at their convenience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we are all front runners to this new media.  And only by helping each other out, we actually advance the form.  And by like, by talking with the big guys  and talking to the ninja guys and talking to the homestead guys,  we're all there.  We're all in the vanguard of this new brand of storytelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think this is because it's a new medium and that as we get successful  and achieve parity with the networks, will we all become cutthroats once again?  Or is this really a new era?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're competing.  This if I may jump in, but if we're competing, did I just mute?  No, no, no. Outstanding, outstanding.  If we're competing sort of  with a portal or some technology based competition, yes, perhaps.  But if it's on with entertainment value, frankly,  I can't see how we're going to be competing with one another  except for, you know, somebody somebody said it was a TV  producer from old media and he was at a convention and he said,  you know, if I have to depend on other people's inability  to entertain their audience in order to capture an audience for myself,  I don't I don't deserve the audience.  And so I thought it was interesting.  Burnett, Mark Burnett, the guy who created Survivor.  And that was talking about the fear of competition in a wholly  on demand world where every show is always available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an attention. It's an attention competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyways, I hope we don't.  You know what? If we are competing against one another,  we're probably very, very wealthy at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would submit that it is a whole new hippie thing going on here,  that we are it's no longer.  I've been really thinking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks,  that what seems to be happening is that the corporate environment  doesn't suit this fast paced Internet world of ours.  And at the same time, individuals have become so powerful  thanks to these inexpensive digital technologies.  Individuals now can compete.  This is what we're seeing at a corporate level. Yes, they can.  And but who we're competing with is the corporations.  And ultimately, I think what we're what happens is you get these loose  confederacies of people like all of us here who would in a corporate  environment be at each other's throats.  But in this modern kind of hippie environment, we're all working together  to solve our problems.  And I have a feeling that that may be the way it is going forward.  It's a small scale revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what's interesting, I guess, why I'm interested  in participating with different people and why I choose to is that  I'm really impressed with their work, you know, and especially with  what you're doing, Leo.  I mean, you're just you're very entertaining and you're really  bringing the information across.  And it's like you're good.  And that's why we're here.  And that's why we're, you know, we're talking to one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so the issue that people raise that there's too much good stuff  and a lot of good stuff is going to start falling through the cracks  because nobody can keep up.  There's too many podcasts already.  There's a lot of you don't need everybody to keep up there.  You just want people in your audience to keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's enough of that to go around.  And there's again, there's no scarcity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me ask you all, because you guys are experts.  How do you find an audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just do good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, exactly. They find us.  Yeah, really, you think that's sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I was do something unique that nobody else is doing.  I mean, I do something that you truly believe in that you can put  your heart behind and be like, this is my show that I have a vision for  and I can free yourself into it.  Yeah. Yeah.  And I get the biggest questions that I get asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say that again, Johnny.  Sorry. Don't try to overreach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, I mean, like the we have a lot of guys saying,  oh, I want to do a podcast and I want to do the next Lost.  And I'm like, you can't.  They have two million dollars an episode.  You can't beat Lost.  It's phenomenal storytelling with some of the world's best writers.  What you can do is make something that's equally entertaining for 50 bucks.  What happens to big scale entertainment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  George Lucas said it's the end of big budget movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he's one to talk. What's he spent on his movies?  He said that recently, I think.  Star Wars, 1977 and pick.  Oh, I'm still not finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will there always be room for the 100 million dollar film  in the two million dollar TV show? You think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course. I think Battlestar Galactica and Lost are some of the best shows  on television and I could never pull that off.  They're amazing work.  I mean, that's also a question of doing what you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't want to use the word tour because it's not exactly appropriate.  But you take somebody like Scorsese, who had a vision for what he wanted to do.  And at that time in the studio system falling apart,  he had the ability to go out and get independent people together  and come up with something that he really believed in.  He got control over the final cut and he got to do what he wanted to do.  But a lot of people blame this.  A lot of people blame this on money when it's really about having a lack  of a vision for what it is that you want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you slice the pie into a thousand tiny slices,  is there enough money to still make the big blockbuster?  Yeah, revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then you get picked up.  I mean, look what happens.  That's it. It's already happening in film.  Like, I mean, a lot of people get their legs in short film  and you make a short film to try and get noticed, try and get people to see it.  You take it to a short film festival, you run it, you cost a ton of money.  This for the first time ever, we're seeing independent television  where you can do that for television.  You have an independent audience.  You can get your stuff out there and show it off.  And if you're really, really good and you have a great, great vision,  you're going to get money and you're going to find people  and you're going to go to the top.  Is there going to be a lot of guys sinking to the bottom of mediocrity? Sure.  But that's happening already in literature and television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And film all over the place.  The real competition, if there is any, is going to come, I think, from the other way.  So right now, competition among a bunch of people who are kind of just  putting stuff together and cobbling stuff together with no budget, isn't the problem.  The problem is going to be when NBC finally wakes up and goes,  we don't want to spend hundreds of thousand dollars per broadcast minute.  And they start throwing some of their talent at podcasting.  I mean, go look at the iTunes charts, the stuff that consistently holds  the top positions is stuff that has the market power to kind of push into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's and that's kind of is an issue, because of course,  if you have mainstream media, you can market yourself and you will get, you know,  that's why Fresh Air is number one, because at the end of every Fresh Air  broadcast, they say, and we're now a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't don't kid yourself.  Mainstream media is feverishly aware of this new stuff.  Like, I mean, Michael O'Lean is the head of Cartoon Network.  He runs the programming.  Who's eating a snack bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just want to point out this is a long form broadcast.  It's a grapefruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that didn't sound like a grapefruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I go to a lot of like, you know, the old school or mainstream media  conferences, and they're all talking about this, all trying to put their heads around it.  And they have very, very smart people working as well.  Like Michael O'Lean, who is one of the heads of Cartoon Network, knows more about  what's on the Internet than anybody.  I mean, I listen to him do a keynote and I'm like, wow, he's dialed in.  Like, he is incredibly in tune.  So they're not just a bunch of titans sitting there saying, we make the TV show.  I mean, they've been trying to hire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they've been trying to hire Tiki Bar TV, the team and me for the last year.  Really? Every meeting, they're like,  you know, but why don't they?  How come you for hire?  Because this is why, because frankly, the money they're offering in exchange  for total ownership of the show and is just doesn't make any sense to me.  Like two years ago when they had not you had no opportunity  to sort of own your own show and distribute it worldwide.  Wow. Even as I say that, that's pretty cool.  But two years ago, it would be like, yes, absolutely.  Are you telling me that I can come there and make my mini TV show  and I'll be the producer and director of it and you'll pay me?  Wow. And now, but the money that they're offering is very low  because they know it's we're talking about dabbling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if they offered you a ton of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, a ton of money now that it gets interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, find me in Tiki TV at Gmail dot com.  I'll be waiting for that.  If they offered me a ton of money, well, then we'd have to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was merely that they didn't offer you enough money.  I mean, I'm wondering if you hear this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it really?  I know I should I should clarify that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how important is control to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is very, very important.  This conversation has played itself out in film.  I mean, Jeff and I both come from live action and from film.  And this is all over the independent live action circuit  where independent filmmakers like I would never take the money.  I never take the money.  And then somebody does really, really well.  And all of a sudden he's made traffic.  You know, like, it's hard to turn down the money.  Bumped up. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you pay a price. Is it selling your soul?  Sure. I would like to make a big project shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He made a great little movie and all of a sudden he's making phenomenal work.  I don't think it's any less.  And traffic is a great film.  He's a phenomenal director.  And he got recognized. I have no problem.  Independent stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, we feel that way.  I have no problem with with with doing a big budget show.  I mean, I'd like to make a television show  or a feature film with a good budget.  I'm not interested in the offers of making  independent Internet television programs  where the big network owns owns the show,  whereas I could create it because it's because I know the resources  that I need to make the shows that I want to make.  These this is what they want to pay me to do.  They will own them thinking I'm willing to bite the bullet and eat a canned  tuna and own it outright and then decide what to do with this property  once it's successful. Does that make sense?  Yeah, you can afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I totally make sense.  I mean, money is not it's not a moral issue regarding money.  It's really about.  No, what Jeff said is right.  It's not only has this opened up the the ability for an individual  to have absolute distribution, but also the ownership of the of the intellectual  property and the and the actual ideas that you're creating.  And that's that's very empowering for an individual.  And no no corporation is going to be able to pull off  that level of of of instinct and power that the individual can have  in making their own show.  So they are going to come down. Sorry.  They are going to come down and they are going to start doing these shows.  But just the very structure of the corporation and the committee decision  making, you know, it's it's it's not going to be it will happen.  And they're going to be a lot of them, but they're still going to be those  individuals out there making great stuff and who are thriving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to just have a little program.  No, we are in talk shoe live and we will be taking calls on talk  shoe in just a little bit.  So cue up your calls for the guys from Tiki Bar Dr.  Tiki is here.  He's in the house.  Jeff McPherson, Kevin Gamble, Johnny Johnny, also Merlin Man  from The Merlin Show and Craig Severson from Pod Grunt.  So if you have a question for them, we will be taking your questions live.  Also, for those of you who hate the talk shoe chat client,  one of our listeners has set up a a kind of IRC, a standard IRC client  or a chat room that you could go into if you go in.  If you're in the chat room right now, you'll see it.  But it is thanks to a piratis.  It is IRC dot caffeine net K.A.F.F.E.I.N.E.  net dot com.  And the channel is Pound Twitch.  So it's a good net caffeine net.  You've been on it. OK.  I don't know. You just like that. Just like the name.  So thanks to a piratis for making that competing chat room.  Anyway, we'll continue on.  It's I'll tell you, one of the things we usually do on Twitter is talk about news.  And there is there is quite a bit of no dimension to Apple TV.  There's quite a bit of news appropriate apropos to this subject.  For instance, on Thursday,  you NBC Universal and News Corp announced a new online video network.  They'll debut it in summer, which will feature full length  programming, movies and clips from their own shows.  But other television networks, a dozen of them and at least two major film studios.  AOL, MSN and Yahoo are jumping on the bandwagon.  They will be distributing. The big guys are here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not they're not going to just take this land down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they going to take us away for take it away from us?  I mean, can we fight back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I mean, we're not going to go away.  It's going to be they can do the main line version of what we're doing,  but it's still big, you know, lumbering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think I think that, you know, it's interesting.  They said that, you know, the indie film scene or the independent film scene,  which is now very different and quite, you know, dominant and competing  with with Hollywood studio pictures in terms of, you know, the attention  and the quality.  But the reason that we have sort of interesting, independent,  creative, low budget films is as a result of the mainstream Hollywood films  that just don't they just don't fill that need.  We're pushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're pushing mainstream very hard to to innovate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was interesting.  I guess mainstream is sort of coming on the heels of the indie guys.  I mean, they certainly are in terms of what the indie guys all want their shot

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at mainstream, though. I mean, that's what independent films are for.  They're guys queuing up to be recognized so they can get the money to go big time.  Like indie film and short films is literally the farm league for Hollywood.  And they're like, you have a vision.  But the guy who just directed 300, I forget his name.  He'd done what commercials and stuff before.  I just put a film out there that's made 200 million in two weeks.  Like, he's a phenomenal storyteller.  Where did they come from? Small media. Right.  So that's like is is short films and doing that already for for Hollywood.  Hollywood has a voracious appetite for new storytellers and new stories.  I'd like to think of it as best and pull them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to think of this as more, though, than a farm league for Hollywood.  Definitely. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it depends on what the individual wants to do,  what they want to do with their life.  I think they have a choice.  You know, if you want to be a director and you want to be a Hollywood guy,  then use this as a farmly.  If you want to create your own stuff for the rest of your life, you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you know, I went and did no, if I went and did a Hollywood production  right now and the opportunities are there right now to as you know,  to to to make that leap to not a major Hollywood movie,  but to be working for Hollywood.  I would every night I'd come home and look on the Internet  and see what other people were innovating and how they were pushing  this new medium and thinking, you know, this is this is only going to happen  once in history and it may happen again.  But this emerging new independent Internet television,  you know, whatever you want to call this.  And I just I want my Wikipedia entry to be big.  Yeah, I want.  Actually, I don't have one. Can someone create one for me?  Anyway, you don't have a Wikipedia entry.  Oh, neither do I.  Jeff, you should do shows too, but I don't and I can't do it myself.  It has to emerge naturally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's because nobody knows who you are.  Oh, that's why. No, honestly.  Hornstein has an entry.  Reginald has an entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff McPherson, M.A.C.P.H.E.R.S.O.N.  Small P and Kevin Gamble.  That's right. And G.A.M.B.A.M.G.  And K.V.I.N.G.  And anyway, just make a Wikipedia entry for them, would you please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can mine start with one of the most and then say whatever you want?  Or whatever else after that?  You know, you're somebody if it's a devilishly handsome

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  record from Vancouver, British Columbia.  You've already written it.  It's like writing.  Have you also written your Academy Award acceptance speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why, I'm so surprised to be up here today.  Wait, it's in the filing cabinet. Hang on. Let me get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Jeff, what would be your thing for Tiki Bar?  I mean, what would be your best wish for that right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow.  Yeah, like sponsorships.  I'd like to be.  Yes. Yeah.  Sponsorships.  It's sustainable for us to expand a bit and get more episodes out of more frequently.  And I'd like to develop the the site and help, I guess,  give the community what they're looking for, which is just a, you know, the sites.  So it's kind of rough in places.  And it's a community that really likes to socialize.  And they're usually online every night on our on our chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultimately, that's important, by the way.  And it's something that only the best network shows can even hope to aspire to.  And no movie can, which is you're creating a community.  Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's different because we're small enough that we can actually email people back.  I mean, we get emails and I write back and they're like,  oh, my goodness, you wrote back to me.  And I'm like, yeah, just sitting in my living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one of the things I've started to realize is the real power of twit.  It's the twit army. It is a community of people.  And and while I don't want to sell them down the river, I think that's something  advertisers are very will become if they're not yet savvy enough,  but will become very interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also important whenever you're thinking about an independent thing  and you start generally doing something, you don't start out with the idea  that you're going to become a mogul.  You do it because you enjoy it.  You like to think you're good at it.  But I think for anybody who's doing independent media,  you've got to start by saying to yourself, OK, in terms of the Tiki bar,  what are we what is it we're not capable of doing right now  where it's really just strictly about money?  What would change that?  Because I think a lot of people, whether it's music or film or whatever,  they go to these big companies thinking that's going to be their big brass ring.  And then they just end up with a different set of problems  and a whole new set of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we all say as independent auteurs that this is really fun and weird?  We love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely. If it wasn't fun, we wouldn't do it.  You know, it's because we're not making any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we know it must be.  By the way, our community is working hard.  Box Game X has now set up a website, caffeine net dot com slash  twit. If you don't have an IRC client, you can go there.  K.A.F.F.E.I.N.E.T. dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crowdsourcing, you call it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And it's really an amazing, powerful thing  that scares me in a lot of ways, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you send me can you give that URL one more time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please. Yeah, actually, yeah, I'd like to invite you guys to go in there.  K.A.F.F.E.I.N.E.  E.I.N.E.  Net and E.T.  All one word dot com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That threw me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make sure you don't put a U in caffeine net dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no U in caffeine net.  K.A.F.F.E.I.N.E.T. dot com.  And then the nickname is there's no Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you create your own Nick.  You could be Dr. Johnny.  I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little coffee cup for caffeine.  That's clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  This is this is Java.  It's Java.  Caffeine like coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so this is a but this is really an example of how I mean, we're doing this live on on the fly and people are immediately.  There's a community sprung up around it, an ad hoc community that will be for this podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I just it kind of I mean, I'm just Johnny, not Johnny Johnny.  Didn't like didn't like the space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many people got in this room?  OK, yeah.  And you know, that's what it is.  The I love it when I answer somebody on one of the social networks, Facebook or MySpace.  You know, it's funny at the point now where people will write, well, how do I know this is the real you?  And I'm thinking, wow, there are people out there impersonating me.  There's a room full of Dr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tiki's to handle all of our emails.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only that was so.  Yeah, not quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I got I got I like to call it my I Keto maneuver, but I got a particularly nasty email on everybody.  You know, these things happen not very often.  But one was, you know, I just watch a show and it sucks.  You guys really think you're funny.  You know, I'd have more fun smashing my face in dirt.  I've got to email.  Yeah.  And I get that email all the time.  Funny enough, it was sent from Johnny Johnny at Tiki's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about.  You know what I did?  I've been spoofed again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's your Keto maneuver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My my you know, I did I wrote him back and I just said, you know, they do it because  it's anonymous.  And you don't really have to.  You wouldn't say it to somebody's face.  So what if I take that sort of anonymous aspect out of it?  And so I wrote him back and I said,  so I read your email because that's what we do here when you email somebody.  And I'm I'm the guy who makes the show.  And if it was your intention to hurt someone's feelings, well, you did.  Oh, you heard, you know, and and I understand you watch this episode.  And frankly, it's not my favorite episode either.  You might want to try these couple.  They really be popular.  And then I said, and here's another couple of shows that people enjoy on the Web.  You might like these better.  And so and I said, it's not a big anonymous corporation.  It's a couple of guys in their apartment.  Right. And that was it.  And that's very effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done that a few times, too.  And it's very effective because you're right.  They don't think they're talking to anybody.  And I just have the response that I got and then type back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The response that I got from him was I'm really sorry.  I reread I reread that email and I was having a bad day.  And it turns out that he is a guy who wants to get into filmmaking.  And the next thing I know, he's giving me a friend request on my space.  Yeah. So that was that was a really good feeling.  But it was it was weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff now has a Wikipedia entry under that is so fast.  It's terrifying. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and does it say he's a wuss, too?  But to actually say you're the most easily he's one of the most wuss like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  regarded of one of the more wussy  podcasters, then it links to my Web page saying that I pwned you all,  which is that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really nice.  No, I think that that's actually really  important point is that people think we are just like, you know, lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're not. Yeah. Yeah.  I had an interesting experience.  Someone did a parody of my show called Video Grump.  And it's actually quite funny. I love that.  Yeah. It's hilarious.  And I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's somebody's highest praise of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone posted a comment on the show saying, you know, this is hilarious.  It shows, you know, it really paradises Craig Severson's goals  to be his Hollywood bound goals.  And I thought, wow, that's really interesting that someone would  actually think I'd want to be in Hollywood.  They know your motives.  Right. And it's like that is so not what I want to do.  It's almost exactly the opposite.  But it does go back to the same where there's this assumption  that we all want to rise to the quote top, you know, and it's really  from a personal basis, it's about Maslow's hierarchy, really, for the individual.  You know, what do you want to do?  You want to be actualized.  Yeah. What's fulfilling for you and for me doing this stuff.  I could be here at the home with my family, you know, and do this on my own time.  It's to me, that's great.  I don't I don't want to, you know, go down and do a 60 million dollar movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not my I'll be honest here.  I mean, when I got into broadcasting, I think I probably did want to rise to the top.  I mean, that, you know, I've been doing this for 30 years and that's the goal.  Right. You get the major market, you make the big bucks and you get the major market wife.  But I did after I did this for that's a joke, by the way, that major market.  Yeah, I like that. I like that.  No, I got it. I like a smile.  Yes. Yeah. Because your wife will kill me.  But you're saying she's the major market.  Leo, she is major. She's my major market wife.  I just OK. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a line that DJ once told me.  He said, now that you're in the major markets, you need to get a major market wife.  But I but but now having entered this new medium, this user generated stuff,  I have to say that there is immensely more satisfaction in just creating it  and knowing people listen to it than anything else, than any other goal  I might have had in the past.  And maybe that's one of the real valuable things about this is that you can get off  that rat race, off that hamster wheel and start to appreciate the joy of raw creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And if I could turn that back around to the earlier point in the conversation  about what makes the show successful for an individual.  It's really about the you know, to make a good show, it's about finding your own unique point  where something that you're really, really good at.  You look at the Dignation guys.  It's a static camera.  It's not particularly well lit of two guys sitting on a couch.  You know, as a treatment for a movie, that's the most boring thing in the world.  Show it's awesome that pitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so it's right on a couch. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's it. That's a show.  It's great because it's Kevin and Alex.  And it's just like it is a good show.  You don't have to have high production quality.  It has to be legible.  You know, I leverage high production quality, but you don't have to.  You know, it's really about if you just do something that's unique and good,  I think you're going to be fine.  And big media cannot even touch that ever.  It's just they can't forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. The authenticity, they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, in the software world, you know, there's this dichotomy  between open source and commercial software.  And people often say, well, it couldn't open source couldn't possibly be any good  because the people aren't being paid to make it.  And the obvious counter is it is better because it's people who are doing it  because they want to do it. They enjoy it.  And who's going to do a better job?  Somebody who's stuck in a cubicle 12 hours a day to make a living  or somebody who goes home from that cubicle and does something because he loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And I'm not making a world again.  It's not a moral judgment about money.  I want to make money and what I'm doing.  I'm doing it to make money.  I want to have a living with it.  So the two are completely independent.  There's no there's no code that says I can't make money in doing something I love.  That's just, you know, bad thinking.  That's so Calvinistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that is that is bad thinking.  But you don't do it because you want to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about now have you guys watched Justin dot TV?  Anybody watch Justin Justin dot TV?  I'm pulling it up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it'd be like, you know, a little bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is live broadcast.  Actually, it's slowed down, so I'm going to stop it right now.  This is a live broadcast started about a week ago.  Justin's a kid who's put a camera on his head and he says, I'm not taking it off  24 seven for the rest of my life.  Oh, that's not so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The version of the tattoo.  I'm sure he'll get by.  This is not the real forever tattoo.  It's going to be great.  Well, actually, not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about it, batteries as they have the first.  He did. And it's like right now he's outside in the park somewhere.  I actually asked him to join us and he wanted to join us,  but he's he's busy doing something else, but he will join us at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think in that world right now, he can't get away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's interesting is how this is spread as a meme over the Internet  very rapidly and a lot of people are watching this and are even hooked to this.  The most mundane of lives.  And frankly, I tuned in when he was peeing.  And I mean, it's everything.  It's everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, but we shouldn't judge this.  I mean, I think this is this is in some ways the next step of what we're talking about.  I mean, this is talk about slice of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or I would say it's really similar to the kind of the webcams of the of the late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like Jenny Cam only live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jenny Cam, that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beat Sandy Warhol.  Yeah, I remember that is his 20 cam 24.  Yeah, well, and it is I guess it has the same appeal as Jenny.  Oh, no, I don't know if Justin speaking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't.  So speaking speaking of sorry, Justin, I know it is a problem.  I know I'm going to meet him at some point.  So I'm sure in the small community and everyone can see it too.  And everyone can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can I can say if he has a girlfriend, she may be one of the most  tolerant people on the planet because she's going to be part of the show too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe she has her own cam and they get like different Google ads by  cross traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of porn, didn't you have  see, I'm allowed to do that segue because you had a story.  Did you pull? Yeah, we have a story that was in the news about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the porn. You want to talk about child protection?  Yeah, this is falling.  Once again, 1998, they made this law to protect kids online.  And once again, the judges tossed it out saying it violates free speech.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how what was the technology behind?  I mean, I understand like the wording.  I guess a law doesn't.  It's a child online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called a child online protection act.  And the judge said, well, I sympathize with the goal of restricting  minors from seeing pornography.  That you because software filters exist, that's good enough.  And you can't make a law saying that the web is somehow going to be safe for kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's something interesting.  The original law way back said that it was illegal to have,  you know, I guess it was women's breasts as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was indecency is what it was in indecent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, I know it did include I looked it up on Wikipedia,  but there's something about even their breasts.  And of course, and there's some cultures, you know, many cultures where  women's breasts are exposed and that's fine.  And this. Well, France, you know, France, but I'm also thinking of maybe more  African nations or something like that.  It's on their money in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? They got boobs on their money.  They got boobs on their money. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jiminy, so you so tangible value.  I can see the value in that legal tender.  OK, it's right on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's trade currency.  I tried to a five for a five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, give me the five.  That's why you've got all the money.  That's why I saw the money in the bathroom again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If to back me the 10.  Disgusting. Oh, I think about that, too.  You know, you know, if I have kids, I'd like to know about it.  But no, if I have kids in the future,  they're, you know,  this Internet thing is totally unrestricted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have kids. I have a 15 year old and a 12 year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The how do you regulate it, Leo?  How do you keep your kids?  Yeah, you know, it's like have the computer in the living room and like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to see what you do. Yeah, we have a computer in the living room.  That's one thing that certainly helps.  And I do have a filter on there, although it's lately disabled.  What's interesting is, you know, I I have Google's, you know, I sign.  I have a Google account and I don't think the kids know this,  but their search history is logged by Google and I can go.  And so every once in a while.  Well, I'll just give you an example.  When I was in Vancouver last week, I saw that Henry had searched for  boobs on the golf course.  I don't know.  I don't know what he was looking for or whether he found it.  I actually clicked the link.  I'm not your silly, silly antics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that your revenge to him now?  You're going to announce his history on the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I told you I would change my behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Henry, everything you search for is known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ouch. You put it on Delicious or something.  But but what about this crazy idea?  And I'm and I'm not proposing that it's actually true, but  but in an environment where it's impossible to to, you know,  keep images of sex away from anybody  and everybody just starts to be raised having seen them.  Would that take away from that?  I mean, does some of the trauma or shock of seeing sex  come from the fact that we shield our kids from it,  whereas they don't do that in all societies?  I thought, yes, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I hope that I have to say, though, that some of the sex  that you're seeing on the Internet very easily is is is not I mean, you know,  I've been in countries where  fathers and mothers will make love and the kids are in the same room  or in another room, and it's you know, that's kind of normal culturally.  But this is not what we're talking about on the Internet.  I mean, this is not stuff that anybody would normally do.  Dark corners out there.  Yeah. I think some of this stuff is extremely strong and  and inappropriate for kids, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I agree with that, but that's where software filters come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It is going to be a case of I mean,  it could be also a case of, say, you know, a kid comes across something that's sort of,  you know, just some of that not cool stuff. Right.  And they'll just be repelled by it.  Well, they are repelled by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an image in their brain that you can't get rid of.  And frankly, I think you're seeing kids in high school now do have  there are sexual practices that are common in high school  that wouldn't have been except for the predominance of pornography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aren't you also sort of impressed by a judge who at least has the awareness to go,  hey, well, you know what, actually, it's a mood issue because the filtering is better than anything.  He did the right thing.  Would that have happened 10 years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He clearly had the right thing.  Actually has happened.  It's been happening consistently since 1998.  They've never been able to get this law enforced for these very same reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other great thing that the judge said was that the damages to the First Amendment  are far greater than the damages to the child.  In his opinion, we talked about this on this week in media.  I called him my personal hero.  And not that I'm all for porn reaching children.  I have a child, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really on record for that.  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I'm going to get it.  I'm going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really about the individual child and the parents relationship with that child.  And my feeling is, you know, they're going to they're going to find it no matter what.  This is just evolution of our society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They find it at their friend's house, even if I find their friends out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. If we have 67 filters here, it's not like when I was a kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and we found the cache of Playboys somebody somewhere and we looked at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're always in a forest.  They're always in a forest. They're all right.  How did you know that?  That's exactly where we found it.  It was under a bush.  As you're 10, you're like, holy grail, you're trying to get to the  hideout. It's an naked lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's really true.  It was under a bush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a paper bag full of Playboys.  They were all wet. How did you know that?  Yeah, we did. I think they're like the same thing.  It's the same magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like a holy grail that goes from kid to kid.  But it's true.  Your job as a parent, kids are the most curious creatures in the world.  And they're going to find they're going to see you.  You know, there's new info.  And your job as a parent is to guide them and say, that's not cool.  That's cool. And then keep that conversation open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't worry too much for my kids because I know it's exactly the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. In 10 years, it's going to be on the hollow web.  And then it'll be streaming in your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it began, frankly, with it with VHS tapes.  I mean, that's where it began, really, with that MTV.  They had to do with their crazy hip shaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That started it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That Elvis. Gosh, Darden, he started it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He started it.  We don't shake. They shake no hips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can no chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of times, you know, somebody wrote a couple of times that if someone  will check out Tiki Bar, not knowing what it is, or just get a clip of it and think  that it's porn, I guess, because it's sort of the production value.  And not even close.  And stiff acting. Pardon the.  Well, it's not to his booze porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's like porn without the sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's what someone said called it.  He says, what is this?  It's like porn without the sex.  And I thought that was hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or it's like booze porn.  I'm like, that's pretty funny.  It was poor. It is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun. That's what it is.  It's very. This is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll change that right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The number of times that we've mentioned porn, this is going to be your most listened  to show, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just come up by the Google searches alone. Absolutely.  Yeah. Should I play a little bit of I'll tell you what, just for people who haven't  perhaps heard Tiki Bar, I could play a little bit of audio.  I mean, obviously, it's it's  not not you're not going to see the video, even if you have a Vipod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you stream it over the audio channel on the interwebs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can, but I have to figure out where which one you would you want me to do  red handed or something a little older or what do you what do you want?  What do you want me to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you pre screened it for Naughty Words?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, hey, that's a little late for that.  Here we go. Here's a little bit of the beginning.  OK.  And of course, Lala is just adorable.  She's dancing around at the beginning of every show.  This is red handed, the episode 23.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aloha. Welcome to Tiki Bar TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Welcome to Tiki Bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Tiki Bar TV wouldn't be possible without us because we make it.  But from time to time, we like to acknowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it. Jeff laughs at his own jokes.  I think that's good.  You enjoy your show.  I think that's good.  That's a good. That's a very good sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's the thing. It is a whole lot of fun to make it.  That's why we keep doing it. And it's totally cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things we learned on the lab, which is neat and, you know, it's funny  because I I didn't notice it until now that I know is that you you do a lot of  post processing with color and so forth.  It's very the colors are very hot.  And, you know, I knew there was something going on, but I'm not  savvy enough about video or tell or movie production to know.  I just knew that there was something going on.  Now, of course, I watch it. I go, Craig, Craig figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's all on to us. Craig knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure. Yeah. Magic bullet, right?  Magic bullet. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah.  Yeah, it looks good.  I like it. Yeah.  And that's intentional. It's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an aesthetic that you're that Jeff, I think, works very hard to create visually.  Yeah, it is.  But when you see it, at least as a raw consumer, you may not be  aware of all the work that's going into that.  You might just think it looks like bad porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you look at episode one,  yeah, if you have without it, if you use Magic Bullet on porn, maybe it'd be cool.  Please don't look at episode one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you guys say that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, it even says on the feed, crappy old episode.  Don't waste your time with this one.  Which means I watched it first.  I mean, that was. Oh, no.  What's wrong with it?  But I've had I've had people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, back when we started, it was the the you know, the only thing out there  really was video blogs.  And so it was fine to all we were doing really was changing camera  angles and adding a bit of music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost exactly two years ago, by the way.  You celebrated your second anniversary on the 15th.  I didn't realize that. Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should we take some questions at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Would you like to? Yeah.  All right. Sure. Let me let me.  We're going to crack you guys down for some questions.  Why not? We got a massive audience who's got just dying to talk to all of you guys.  But I have to turn some knobs here to make this all work like magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's do not touch your dial.  They make something like Magic Bullet for Final Cut.  Yeah, that's for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a final cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should do the Merlin show and it would really look more like porn.  It's also really neat looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's called Magic Bullet.  We're plugging the magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks sweet.  I'm I'm I'm giving you the the the thing, the magic bullet.  Look, it's a red giant red giant software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dot. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Merlin, don't do this. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pricey. But it's mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you saying, Craig?  It's like the power tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, just don't you don't need to.  You don't need to for your show.  You don't need to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I should add like some film grain and some nicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not for the format.  You're right. There's only one thing, Merlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would change. And I've told you this already right at the beginning.  You've got that great music.  You're sitting there on a chair looking pensive.  It says the Merlin show.  You should be tapping your toe. That's all.  That's the only change I would make.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Go download it now.  We've made the change already.  It's done. Really, you can get so much done so quickly.  Magic Toe Tap.  Yes, post toe tap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're going to take questions for the panel.  Craig Severson, of course, from Video Grunt, Pod Grunt, Grunt Media.  We've got Merlin Mann from the MerlinShow.com at 43 Folders.  Kevin Gamble, who is Johnny Johnny from the Tiki Room Tiki Bar.  I want to say the Tiki Room. It's a Tiki Bar.  Tiki Room is the Disney Disney ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Discontinued in the Tiki Tiki Tiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want to I want to play Dvorak today, too, if I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. Craig Severson, aka Dvorak.org.  And Jeff McPherson, who is Dr. Tiki.  So your questions, please, when I put you on,  have a question for them, if you don't hang up now.  And and please tell us your first name, where you're from.  And actually, our first caller, I know it's John B.  from Memphis, Tennessee. Hello, John B.  Oh, let me press the button now.  Hello. Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, thanks for having me on.  I was wanting to know  what the main cause of the long lead time between episodes.  I really I'm not trying to say it's a problem,  but I really do enjoy watching it.  And also, I just have a wanted to make a comment  at the end of the episode where you guys show the recipe.  What me and some friends of mine started doing a few weeks ago  is we'll all come over and watch the episode.  And when you guys show the recipe, we'll pause it,  make the drinks for everybody.  When we're done drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. I was going to ask, is there a Tiki Bar  drinking game? But I guess you don't really need one, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole show is a drinking game.  Why the long?  That's probably the complaint you hear the most, which is in a way good.  We want more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Why?  Why the long?  Last one you did was November 30th.  Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, the dog stole our next episode.  I've heard rumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's on your Wikipedia article that you're dead.  Oh, really?  One of the most dead on the Internet today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, we both got heavily involved in other projects.  And I was doing an incredible amount of traveling.  And we have now, I think, three episodes in post-production in editing.  Oh, that's good news.  That's good.  That are in the can.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the can.  How many days do you work on these in edit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It takes a very long time.  It takes too long.  If I were to actually figure it out.  Like, I was thinking about this music video in, I think,  Drinkbot, where I'm singing this song.  I love Drinkbot.  Whatever that song is.  I can never remember what song it is.  An Aaron Neville song or something.  And in just that music video was like a full day of editing.  And I think that's just like a 20-second thing.  Probably because I'm such a slow editor.  It takes a lot longer when you have an incredible amount of footage that  is like five hours, that has no script, and is totally improvised.  And we're trying to manufacture something really weird, wacky,  unpredictable, and cut it down to five minutes.  And especially me, because I go over, I want to familiarize myself with every  shot and every piece of footage.  And we have two or three cameras sometimes running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The whole thing is improvised.  So we'll be hopping all over a take.  And there's just bins and bins and bins of footage.  And poor Jeff has to go and make heads or tails of it all.  But I've found that when I work with an editor.  Do you guys shoot multiple takes of each one?  Do you try to do that several times?  We just keep rolling until we get something.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't have a script.  You have a concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a concept.  Some of them are a bit more fleshed out than others.  There'll be like five or six notes on a piece of paper.  That's about what we go for.  We understand what the problem's going to be and how we're going to solve it,  which is by a cocktail.  Sometimes we only name the drink.  We only name the drink after the episode's been completely edited sometimes.  Because we don't really know what this thing is.  So are you making the drink up completely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a lot of cocktail books here that I pull drinks from.  And then we try and find something that works for the theme.  And then we augment and modify.  Some are original creations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People say, in fact, the first time I saw it, I thought,  boy, Absolute Vodka is a natural sponsor for this or so.  But that's actually not the case, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Well, Alexis actually has Absolute as the bumper sticker.  But no, I don't have Alexis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the case.  No, there was an internet rumor and there's still a pesky old press release  hanging around the web that said that we were sponsored by liquor companies.  But that's not the case.  We are, however, in talks with one right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Partly it's because of the way you treat drinking.  It's not the liquor companies would like to pretend that people don't drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not allowed to be drunk on booze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an American Association of Distillers has a self-regulating body  that just says don't associate liquor with drunkenness.  That's literally what the wording says.  They don't.  But it's an elective thing.  You don't have to be a member.  You don't have to be a member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think that at least maybe the paper umbrella industry would want to buy in somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there are different ones.  You know, we're doing deals.  We're working with Tiki Farm right now, who are a really cool company.  I think they make the Royal Dalton of Tiki mugs.  I don't actually know of Royal Dalton.  Royal Dalton is the famous figurine maker.  The Wedgwood.  Wedgwood.  Yeah.  Okay.  And so we have some really cool stuff and some custom mugs being made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to make the Tiki mug of death that Lala picked on that episode, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're actually selling that.  We're actually selling it right now on the Tiki store.  Hey, we got our first tip today, by the way.  I took your advice and set up a PayPal tip jar.  Good.  Does it work?  And people do want to give.  Someone gave $40.  How do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  I would do that.  I would do that in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are asking me to do that.  Yeah, I should do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we did that on Twitter from day one because we had fixed costs.  We had no advertisers.  We still, you know, advertising is very spotty, but we have fixed costs that we have to pay.  And people are very generous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  People are willing to support what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you find, Leo, that when you ask for gratuities that people expect you to deliver on a regular  basis, is it an increase?  You know, it's funny.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And that may be an issue for you guys.  I mean, one of the things that happens, we start off, I want to make it a very low amount,  but I wanted to make it a monthly amount because our, you know, my bills come in monthly.  So I made it $2 a month.  And it's funny how many people think that for that $2 a month, they now are, they have  literally, in fact, one guy put a post saying, well, now that I'm a shareholder in Twitter,  I'd like to see your financials.  And he was serious.  No, no, no, he was serious.  I mean, there's some interesting people out there, obviously.  Most people know better than that.  But yeah, there is a sense that once you are contributing to something that we owe you  something.  But I've always felt we owe the audience something.  I don't know what it is, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, what's your take on advertising on Twitter now these days?  Are you still into it?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have an agency working very hard.  In fact, we will always, I mean, we'll always keep it to two at most two commercials per  podcast.  And I think that's something that will always be delivered by me, not interstitial, because  I don't want to break away from the feeling of the podcast.  And they're more effective that way, frankly.  And so far, you know, PodTrack, who does our metrics and does the pitching, it's been hard  because you have to convince agencies that there is such a thing as a podcast and then  that there is some merit in it.  But what PodTrack has done, and I'm to their credit, I know you all know Mark McCrary and  PodTrack is they've done a lot of research.  We've helped them quite a bit.  We did a survey after one of our big campaigns, a survey which they distilled down and delivered  to the, if you'll forgive the phrase, still delivered to the company.  And the company, on the basis of that, has committed to podcast advertising for all its  products going forward.  I believe that what's going to happen is that people are going to realize how valuable this  podcast stuff is, this audience is, video or audio.  And I think in a year you will see a significant amount of money shifted from mainstream media  to podcast.  Yeah.  That's a prediction.  And I told you guys, the Tiki Bar guys, this when we were talking in Vancouver, if you  can hang in for another year, I think this is all about to turn in a big way.  Again, we're not here to make money.  We just want to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all we've been talking about convergence for so long.  Everything is converging.  And I think now like we have devices where everything is converging too, that things  are, the doors are really going to open up.  I think the Apple, the iPhone is really going to change a lot of things.  Well, and Apple TV, don't you think?  It's like the device where everything goes.  Yeah, the Apple TV is a great step in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy who's buying ads is going to say, hey, there's one channel here that has no  ads.  It's this podcast channel.  Why aren't we on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what's the Xbox's new version, the elite that's coming out with like television built  right in or something like that?  I mean, it's all going there.  It's all getting there.  Eventually it's going to be just the box.  And the box is everything from email to video to phones to movies.  And that's all going towards, we're all content going towards the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Talk tech, talk tech.  What's your real name and first name and where you calling from?  Oh, wait a minute.  The button didn't take.  Hold on.  Talk tech.  Oh, I'm pressing the wrong mouse.  Hold on.  I got too many mice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Talk tech.  This is Joe from Rockford, Illinois.  Hi, Joe.  I got one comment.  The, the, when it comes to kids accessing porn on the internet, there is a really easy  solution for that.  And that is to add, add a record, you know, where, or where it keeps all the domain information,  you know, is this website have, have pornography in it?  You know, that's, and then just have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean make pornographers do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Make it required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the idea of the triple X domain.  The problem is how do you require, I mean, if you, you can have a triple X domain, but  how do you require people to put themselves there?  And does Playboy go willingly?  I don't think so.  Is Playboy going to say we're adult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well Playboy probably will.  They're a reputable corporation.  You know, will-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Playboy has given up that dot com address anytime soon.  And I'd be very surprised if they'd allow anybody to put any, anything in their DNS  record saying-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they will probably self-regulate as opposed to the shadier guy-  Well, I would hope so.  ... who's got like, you know, some sort of thing going on.  I mean, there's, there's, there's home solutions you can do for that.  Is that guy still in your basement, Kevin?  It's really irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rachel, welcome to Twitch.  What's your, I guess your first name is Rachel.  Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm calling from La Crosse, Wisconsin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, Rachel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hi.  My question is, I'm actually really nervous that I have to write this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You're acting like this is like a real radio show or something.  There's nothing to be nervous about.  It's just us people talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're all listening.  All four of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole internet is listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know how many people listen to this show.  I have reason to be nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Yes, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  My question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me fix you a cocktail.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.  Do you have a prescription, Dr. Tiki?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't think about the thousands of people all over the world who can't hear this.  And the fact that it's being recorded and will be available forever in the archives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.  That's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's terrible, isn't it?  Take a sip of this drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Poor girl.  Go ahead, Rachel.  Just ignore the boys.  They're just being boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As a small podcaster, I started out with about 11 downloads my first week and now I get almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't that feel good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know.  I'm excited about it, but I'm starting to get fan email and it's sort of freaking me  out a little bit.  So like how do you get past the freaking out phase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Welcome to my world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could.  At first I was concerned and I went crazy making sure that the Tiki Bar's address was  nowhere on the Internet and it was for a while.  It was registered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean the actual address of your home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And as a Tiki Bar because it was the registered domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually physically move every few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah?  But I had old party invites too.  Come on over.  Come to the Tiki Bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've had a blog before they were called blogs.  It was just a webpage because nobody had a place to put their photos.  So we've had to go back through that, delete references to where the physical location  of the Tiki Bar actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say though it's a little harder for a man than it is for a woman than it is  for a man.  I mean Lala has a lot more at risk than you guys or I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess how I dealt with it is that at first it was a little strange and I was concerned  that no one could find me or just be weird or obsessive.  And then I realized over time that really it was okay.  Nothing's really going to happen.  If I go to a public event I just make sure that the one thing that I do make sure of  is that it's easy to be socializing at a public event and you become very friendly with everybody.  And if someone is maybe weird or obsessive and wants to be your phone number and be invited  over to your house, in those situations they may act, and this might start freaking people  out, but they may act as though they don't really know the show.  They're a real fan and they're sort of hiding information that they're a super fan.  And then an hour into the conversation when they say, so what do you do for a living?  And I go, oh I do this show.  And then they go, in episode 13 when you turn to the camera and then I'm like, you sly dog.  I prefer it when someone lets me know right away they're a big fan.  We do work really hard and it's fine to watch an episode 10 times.  It's like great, I watch it 600 times before I podcast it while editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes people are apologetic to stopping me on the street, which doesn't happen that  often but when it does.  And I always say thank you for stopping me.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, you would know more about it.  How do you deal with it?  It's weird at first and then you adjust to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the hardest thing is psychologically.  I don't think it's particularly risky.  Who knows?  There's always the Mark David Chapmans of the world who are creeps.  The audience that we get, and I include all of us here, is a smart, for the most part  normal audience.  They're fine.  They're very nice.  Merlin, I'm sure you have the same experience.  They're good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not on anywhere near the level of scale that you guys have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what's weird is more the personal sense of putting yourself out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mostly I've got to say, whatever.  I don't know what that says about me.  But sometimes it's really nice.  It's nice to put something out there and have people.  There's a difference in scale, too.  If you guys have ever spent any time with Leo, it's a little freaky.  Going some black world with you is pretty weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I can eat in restaurants.  I can go grocery shopping.  There are people who are so famous they can't have a life.  You know what?  Actually, you're bringing up a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also part of this larger discussion though of what in terms of like, okay, hey, I want  to make it big.  I want to be capital B big.  Well, you give so much away of your life.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you really?  You can't really put that toothpaste back in the tube.  Personally, I'm not worried about that.  I don't think I'm ever going to.  I don't want to be and I don't think I ever would be anywhere near that level.  But you've got to be careful.  You can find yourself accidentally a lot better known than you probably realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had some wonderful experiences.  Patrick Norton and I have driven up in a limousine to a mall where there are 2,000 people waiting  for our autographs.  That's an amazing experience.  That's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they think it was the anti-virus guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, it's pretty.  Yeah, it was Patrick.  I got Peter Norton with me in the car.  I love you.  I love your utilities.  Now that guy probably gets a lot of weird autograph requests.  The guy with the folded arms.  Wide tie.  Yeah, with the folded arms and wide tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a real person.  He's actually a billionaire.  But that's another story for another day, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like a wholesome kind of, I don't want to use the word fame, but where it's  genuine.  I agree.  It's not this unapproachable adoration.  They don't like it because they've seen you photographed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can call it that because we're so small that we can take the time to get to know people.  I go to Comic Con and I was saying that story about getting all those shooters bought for  me that one day.  Then the next day I was supposed to meet one of our fans, sent me an email saying, hey,  I'd love to get a picture with you.  I'm like, you bet.  Let's meet up at this booth and we'll get a picture and be totally fun.  I was so hungover that I missed the appointment.  I actively chased her down and then took her over for a coffee and a cookie.  Now she's scared of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, I'm so sure I'll hit you bang.  I like your hair that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even like, we're not superstars.  We're not superstars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what makes us, you know, that gives us that edge because we're approachable and  we're not, you know, get on the phone and call us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But to address really what Rachel I think is really asking, which is there is a psychological  have to cross to be a performer where you say, okay, I'm going to, I am going to make  myself personally available.  That is a very difficult barrier to cross.  In fact, a lot of performers don't cross it and are not successful.  I remember the first time I blogged, it was, well, the first time I blogged, I thought  this is creepy.  I'm talking about my life in front of this audience.  It's creepy.  It feels wrong.  And I think there is a natural aversion to this that you have to overcome to be a performer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's almost people who don't get that who need that.  We're like, they just say, that's a different thing.  You're like, Oh, hang on.  The whole world's reading this.  You need to not type that so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's, it is psychologically difficult and, and it can be rewarding, but it, but it kind  of makes you a little queasy.  I think too.  I mean, it's not, I know, I know how Rachel's feeling frankly, because it is a difficult  thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If she's still on, can you get all of her personal information?  It's already on the IRC.  We should all totally contact her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did Rachel promote her show?  Did she make some of the luck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  We didn't.  Rachel.  Oh, you know, I forgot to record this show.  Shoot.  I did it again with Twit last time.  Now we're going to record it.  We're going to record Rachel's part, particularly.  Once the, once the, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you say you haven't been recording this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've been recording it for posterity, but not for talk show.  There's, there's two separate recordings.  Oh, believe me.  Oh, okay.  Twit is recorded.  No, no, no, no, no.  Rachel.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rachel plugs into a series of redundant servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I never, no, I never lose.  I never lose shows.  Believe me.  I have, I did lose shows and once I did that once, I never did it again.  Rachel, what's your podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is Sims 2 challenges.  We discussed different challenges for the PC game with Sims 2 and it's on talk show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sims 2 challenges.  That's fun.  That sounds great.  I'd like to, I'd like to, I'd like to be a part of that.  I think I'm going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we be guests on your show?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sure.  Next one's Tuesday at 9 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  Tuesday at 9.  Good one, Rachel.  Talk show is kind of neat because talk show has this live streaming capability.  Oh, wait a minute.  I just unmuted everybody.  Quiet everybody.  Press the wrong button.  You pressed the wrong button on talk show.  You're sorry.  So it's kind of neat because it's live streaming and at the same time you can have interactivity,  which is kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I can't get over this chat we're having in the other window.  It's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that wild?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take another call.  Cyber Larson.  You are next.  Welcome to Twitter.  What's your first name?  Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello.  Michael from Rhode Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I have a, I have a podcast I've been doing for a couple of months and my question is  how, how do I broadcast it or promote it?  I've got it on Podshu and iTunes and that, but I'd like to be able to promote it to get  more listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get that question a lot.  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the number one question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I did.  I worked for six years on a cable network that was kind of a cult thing and then it  folded and that I recommend that.  I think that works very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some of our, some of our viewers have done is if you find shows that have an audience  that you think you'd like to, they would enjoy your show, get into their forums and start  meeting people and then gain a presence there and you know, get yourself some friends.  I think that's a really good way to do it.  Yeah.  We have friends who come into the Tiki Bar chat room and we have a really big broad base  of people who all share our sense of humor and a couple of them have started up a podcast.  A couple of guys started one called Brain Gravy that's based on conversations from our  chat room and all of a sudden they've got lots of links and lots of hits and so.  It's about community.  Those viewers.  Yeah.  Find the community you think is going to best like your show and sort of just pop in and  open up an account and say, Hey, check out my podcast here and take the time to get to  know everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, yeah, you know, one of the things we did when we started before we got the big  boost was I found Tiki communities, even though I wasn't, you know, I was into Tiki because  I thought it was funny.  I wasn't over the top into Tiki, but we found Tiki Central and I think they've got a user  base.  It's like a forum with almost 30, 30,000 registered people there and said, Hey, there's a show  called Tiki TV and people like Tiki will consume anything with the word Tiki connected to it.  And then also I think modern drunkard.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Craig, what do you recommend?  Because you really study all this stuff.  I mean, you've become kind of the meta podcaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is about cross-promotion when you're when you're first starting out.  It's it works very well.  I think what Jeff was saying is great about finding a Tiki place that's, you know, not  necessarily another podcast, but just in your area of interest in your area of expertise  and just participate in that community.  Have your URL as your signature.  Just just be out there.  Just don't be aggro about it.  You know, don't say, yeah, we've got a podcast.  Come on down. Check it out here.  This link. Yeah, it's going to be awesome.  Just answer the question if you can.  You know, if they're asking a question that's in your area of expertise and just speak,  be gentle about it.  And yeah, and that's the best way.  Just be genuine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Merlin, otherwise you'll be.  Go ahead.  It's like you're an ad or something like we've had a drive by, you know, yeah, you don't  I can't remember what's that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Drive by link, link spamming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a nightmare.  That's just Merlin.  When you started out, obviously you're well known now.  So it's not quite the same issue.  But when you were starting with 43 folders, what did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, as far as the podcast stuff, I have a real I mean, there's a real specific  reason that I'm, you know, whatever, trying to do things the way I am with the Merlin  show. And it's partly so the Merlin show.  Part of what I do is I'm trying to talk to friends of mine who are not podcasters and  who are not necessarily internet people.  Some of them are in bands.  They're people with I mean, so but so the dirty little secret, which I'm happy to share,  is that each of those people has their own, if you will, fan base.  They bring their community to do.  Yeah. Yeah. So tomorrow morning I'll have Peter Hughes from the Mountain Goats who have  this really wonderful, you know, community of fans that follow the work.  And probably a few of them will stop by.  I guess I would say it's the most organic thing to do.  And this is true for your blog.  It's true for your podcast.  Whatever you want to do is to focus on ways to, like, make your content, make your content  interesting to a broader base of people.  Not broader. It doesn't need to be broad.  But you know what I mean? To try and reach out to people, let the content do  the talking. There's only so much of this trickery and SEO stuff and link begging.  Link begging for me is just about that's just, you know, that's a nonstarter.  But if I but you know what, if I discover your site and something's really interesting,  I'm going to link to it because it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys said at the beginning of this show that excellence will out that all you have  to do is be good. Is that really true?  It's really true. So where did you hear about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask just a couple of people here.  Where did each of you hear about Tiki Bar from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably somebody else who said, hey, you got to watch this great podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was word of mouth.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iTunes. Yeah.  I found that a lot of people will that our big boost came from different people,  you know, with podcasts with their own audiences saying, check this out.  He got to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I certainly did that on Twitter very early on.  I said, you got to see Tiki Bar.  We talked a lot about Tiki Bar on Twitter, actually, come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't take long.  Once you start getting interested in something, you can find great links to a lot of great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  shows. But if people if people what you're saying is if you're excellent, people will  talk about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah.  But you also I mean, the thing is, it's important to distinguish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I want to be clear.  It isn't just like you. Hey, you make great content and you just pray to the sky.  You do have to go out and do some heavy lifting to try and reach people.  But I'm just saying it needs to be something more organic.  I crap you read in dummies books.  I completely agree. Yeah.  Yeah. Right. I find turns off so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing one thing that I find the big question is people will before they've even got  their show produced or they've got one episode out, they make broad announcements about  the show. You know, we're this show, we're that show.  And they come and they ask us and we're more than happy to do interviews with, you know,  up and coming and startup shows and stuff like that.  But it feels to me like I like what we did with our first episode of Margaritaville.  It was the show isn't even the product.  And I would say product. But the show isn't even done yet.  It's not even not even made in the software, the software, the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They talk about printing the teachers before you write the software.  That's it. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So get the show working because pre-elder casting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what you call it? Yeah.  Vapor Casting. Vapor Cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a new Vapor Cast. I'd like to try out on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I got my t-shirts on.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because your show, you know, from episode one to episode three even will be remarkably  different. And you'll look back at one and go, wow, that wasn't even entertainment.  I don't know what for anything. Even today when we launch a new podcast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I almost don't want to publish the first couple.  I do. But I often say don't listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good advice for bloggers, too, though.  I mean, I've said this for years now, is if you're starting a new blog and it's the  first time you've done it, give yourself a few weeks to build up a backlog of content  and to get a feel for what your voice is.  Because you guys are exactly right.  You never you know, you could end up someplace completely different from where you  expected. And it actually is much more interesting.  It's almost like when you're a writer and you end up throwing out the first sentence  that you write, I think the same thing happens with broadcast podcasts, blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my I agree also back to the excellence thing.  In my case, I actually created three video grunts before I told anyone about it and  then showed that to.  So I had really worked out the format ahead of time and had already done my 10 shows  before I even did the first three.  But having having three in the can that were consistent and that got the attention of  Apple, Apple promoted it heavily and things went from there.  So, you know, it it really does help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it that we have to get Apple to promote, though.  I really hate the power.  I didn't have to. No, but it makes a big difference.  It doesn't make a difference.  It bugs me because they're the only game in town.  I mean, I'm very grateful to Apple podcasting.  They helped put podcasting on the map.  But at the same time, they wield way too much power, editorial power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they make it easy.  And like it's one button and you can click.  No, no, I agree. And that's what my mom, I agree.  And RSS feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's what's great about it.  But at the same time, it should be as easy on other platforms.  And I'd like to see, you know, Microsoft step up.  And I just think it's too bad.  I mean, look, I the guys at the iTunes guys, I love them.  They're great guys. They've been very generous to tweet.  But they wield a huge amount of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it interesting, though, that the story that was out,  Scott and Pete word out, Scott and Pete word out and word out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my official. We love you, man.  Dr. Deke loves you, man.  I just had to get that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was subtle, guys. That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say and they know who they are, but I guess we all know.  I wasn't going to say anything, but hey, sorry, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't hear you guys. My old G4 is just so slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I work. Believe me.  Um, no. What were you saying, Merlin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, then no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll say this. Your show, when you tell somebody you're sending the link  and they finally come and check out your show, if you only have those two  episodes, you haven't found your voice yet and they're rough.  It's not like it's it's not like other forms of media where broadcast,  where, you know, the person may happen to come across season two and go,  oh, this thing looks better now. Maybe I'll watch it.  The person's probably not going to come back, even if they've heard  and you know, Tiki Bar episode one is totally different from now.  But once you've heard of it and you checked it out, you know, like it.  I don't think that audience is going to come back.  The other part, I would argue that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I would. Yeah, I would say Tiki Bar one is not that different.  I think the spirit of it was there in the beginning.  I think the soul of it is totally.  I agree. I like that one.  And that's what I watch.  I'm not looking for production value or magic bullet or whatever.  I'm looking for the vibe and for the fun and the goofiness.  And it was there from the beginning.  And that's the reason your show is is is good.  It's that's the thing I've been talking about is that if the voice  has got a very good authenticity. Yes. Yeah.  Yeah. And it's just so, you know, one thing on that thread, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of getting your of getting the word out, though.  And so again, here's something that's completely different  than being part of big media.  So if you if you guys did get the big, you know,  limo full of Led Zeppelin money pulling up and pulling you guys in,  what does that mean? Well, that means you're now you're now you're exclusive.  Now you're on NBC Universal and you do what they say.  But you know what? If you started up today, like you could go out.  So you put stuff on Libsyn, you put stuff on blip, you put stuff on river,  you put stuff on on YouTube.  You have all of these options for how you can put this stuff out.  And you can cast your net really widely without worrying  about the exclusivity and stuff like that,  which I think is a kind of a lot to give up.  So it's another thing just to suggest if you're out there  and you're just getting started and you just want to get the word out.  I mean, if you've got one listener and that turns into two listeners,  you've just doubled your audience.  So you've got to start somewhere and just getting it out there is  is easier than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And speaking when we were ecstatic, we had a thousand viewers were like,  Oh, my God, a thousand people watching the show.  And it just takes time. You make good stuff.  People watch.  So how big is, you know, you go to like the modern library,  there's thousands and thousands and thousands of books, but great ones  get talked about and people read them.  And it's a new edge of media.  It's a new get tons out there, but just believe in it.  Put your heart into it.  You know, ask the ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DVD D 127.  I know that's not your real name, unless your parents have a real sense of humor.  What is your real name? Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Real name is Davoud, and I'm calling from Chicago, Illinois.  Hi, Davoud. Welcome.  And yes, this is the same person who called you on your radio show.  Few years back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's OK. It all kind of intermingles at this point.  It sure does.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have been a fan of yours, all of yours for a while, for a while, a long while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We thank you. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I completely agree on the topic of adult content on the Internet  with what you guys are saying.  There really is no way to control it.  And I wanted your opinion on.  I know you guys talked about it last week, the whole OpenID movement.  What do you guys think will be?  The standard will it be open ID or will it go back to  Microsoft's passport?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of open ID.  We did it just for people who want to refer back to Net at Night last week.  We talked a little bit about OpenID.  And by the way, I just want to mention there will be no Net at Night tonight.  That's why this show is going to go till eight or nine at night,  because it just scared it.  I just scared everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we have a bio break.  And I know it's going to stop because I got to pee. But  I didn't want to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I mean it. But no, you can always just go ahead and go off.  Just make sure you mute your mic before you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin's going to open another can here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it ain't for drinking.  Exactly. But just I don't know.  This window here.  I don't know if you guys want to talk about OpenID, but I think it is  it is an interesting movement.  But it's you know, it's so hard to predict what the next thing  is going to be on the net and what's going to fly and what's not going to fly.  You could see stuff get traction.  But you never know. And plastics. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. One word for you, Ben.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do think we need something like OpenID that validates  who you are on the net as you go around on the net.  But the problem, there's all these privacy issues and so forth.  And there's also an adoption issue.  I mean, people who use OpenID are big fat geeks like me.  I don't know if that's going to I don't know if that's going to translate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've got a PGP key, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's I have all of that crap.  You have CSS in your signature.  No, no. Hey, Merlin, I took it out.  Did you remove your CSS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you embarrassed me into doing it.  I went to put some JavaScript in there so I can do some Dom model stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I can hide and show you.  You know what I did? Actually, I write my emails in COBOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just send you code and you can understand it.  Bully for you.  No, I actually went back to plain text Merlin.  I don't even sign in.  I also eliminated, you know, I just put my name Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you know class move report, I'm glad you did.  It's very tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me a lesson. But I'm in print.  I am awesome. I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to 10, go to 10.  I'm not losing the linen background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care what you say.  I just think it looks better that way.  Rolex Oyster. Nice name.  What's your real name? Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Rolex Oyster. Yeah.  Hello. Hi. Hi, sweet fuel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi. What's your name and where you come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My name is James. I'm calling from London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And lovely to meet you, Leo.  Big funny podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you for calling in, James.  What can you have a question for this fantastic  panel here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been on hold for four hours and you still don't have a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I just love listening to it.  That's great.  I have so many questions.  OK, first question.  I got caught in the trap of an impulse spy.  I have a HP Pavilion laptop with Vista,  and I was wondering if I made the right choice.  This is it. This is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is it. Who said no?  Was that you, James? Me, Craig.  Craig says he's a Mac guy all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're all on Macs, aren't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there anybody here using Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I prefer to use a real thing.  Is this a first, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A first?  First, in terms of all the folks on the show using Macs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, only because Dvorak still kind of holding out.  Ah, but but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have my Commodore 128 out right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you made a mistake, James.  I think it's fine. I think Vista is a big improvement.  But it's interesting how now.  Now, maybe this is self-selecting.  This is the whole because it's iTunes, because it's podcasts,  because it's Apple, maybe that's self-selecting.  But I do notice a lot of the people who are in this content creation space  are Mac fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it comes free with the Mac.  I mean, you open up a Macintosh and you've got iMovie built right in.  So, I mean, you've got QuickTime built into the software.  You can literally start podcasting and blogging out of the box in five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that might be one of the things is we talked when you were in Vancouver.  Actually, I don't know if you were there,  Kevin, but Jeff and I talked about this kind of glass ceiling  that podcasting seems to have hit.  And I'm wondering if some of it has to do, you know, the number of people  listening has to do with the fact that it's so Mac centric  that we're not crossing over into the Windows side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, I don't know.  iTunes is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every podcast I've talked to, and including the biggest,  we all agree that there seems to be some ceiling between three  hundred and four hundred thousand downloads where you just cannot cross that number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  That is that seems to be the audience right now.  They're just is that everybody who's listening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we're still I think it is.  We're still this new fringe sort of medium, new space.  And like the guys who are doing it are the early adopter.  That's why shows like Dignation are so popular because it's just tech stories.  And we're all nerds.  You have the text to bet the text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The tech podcasts do the best, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think that's the final cut.  Are you guys using Final Cut Pro as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think that has a big impact also as to why the,  you know, the podcast and video podcast creators are on Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Certainly video people are on man.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to point out that this is a global phenomenon.  And that's the other thing that's very interesting.  Maybe three hundred fifty thousand people.  But it's many of them are like James all over the world.  And I think that's remarkable.  Do you notice that too, Tiki? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I just got our map is just across the whole planet.  Yeah. It's just awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I got it.  I got an email from a guy in, oh, is it Morocco?  Where the fez was invented, I think,  talking about how he and his friends are so amused that you have one of our hats.  But with this animal on animal print, you know, it didn't occur to me  that, you know, they're like, look what they've done with the hat.  That's ridiculous.  But at least they're not offended.  No. And then I. Yeah.  And I just got some from Oman.  I don't know. But I got I got a oh, here he is.  Yeah. For a while, there was getting a lot of guys,  a lot of American servicemen as well.  We get that too in Iraq. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lala is the Betty Hutton of the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw her picture of Pace on the side of a Humvee.  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's on the nuclear bomb. What are you talking about?  Little smiling little Lala.  So I know I know nobody's going to be everybody's too much of a gentleman  to ask that, but but as Lala is as wonderful and adorable as she seems on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She is as radiant in person as she is on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.  You would not you'd not be disappointed.  Yeah, she's very, very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She seems like a very sweet, fun person.  Yeah, kind of gal you'd like to get to know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why, you know, when Kevin and I were doing that first episode,  we thought, OK, well, you know, let's have a female presence.  You know, this is one of the things that we don't often see in podcasts.  Well, much more now, but certainly it's it's leaning heavily towards men.  And it'd be nice to have that presence.  And our immediate thought was, who do you want to have at the bar  with the perfect person? And it's our friend Lala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was a friend, just an acquaintance, somebody you knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, everybody on the show has been a friend or, you know, somebody we know.  I mean, yeah. Mostly improv actors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's their background?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. The Duke of Earl is a  acupuncturist doctor, a traditional Chinese medicine.  Yeah. And how did you how did you know?  Rock. Well, he lives on my floor.  Wow. He's a neighbor.  Yeah. Yeah. He had his British accent.  And he and he also said that he had this really nice tuxedo.  And I said, OK, well, why don't you come over Friday night  on the show and be on the show?  And he was like, I'm not an actor, you know, but I could tell.  Are we?  He'd like to hem it up.  And that's a lot of the fun.  The fact that he just breaks out laughing when sort of in his opening line.  You know, I can't remember.  He says it's uterus and he bursts out laughing.  And somebody asked me, I said, actually, a friend of mine who is an actor said,  you know, you need to get some actors on that show.  You know, could you find a take where the guy didn't burst out laughing?  Oh, yeah, I think I think we did it twice.  And we did have a take where he didn't laugh.  But the first and I left it to him to.  I'm like, yeah, what?  The whole point of the show is that it's unusual and weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't the best part of every Smokey and the Bandit movie,  the part where Burt Reynolds loses it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did. They had this.  Is that in the outtakes at the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the outtakes at the end of every movie.  And you stay through the lame movie because you can't wait.  I'm all run. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to see the outtakes.  Can of all run is it's a classic.  I used to love that show. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Sammy Davis, Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when you watch when you watch people shows like the Carol Burnett show,  that was half the fun of it is that they couldn't do the skits watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tim Conway trying to keep a straight face.  That's what you hope for.  That's kind of the fun.  I mean, like we can absolutely break rules doing this new media, this podcasting stuff.  We can do stuff that you can't do on regular television.  That's what that's what makes it so interesting.  I have so many. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you're all listen. I'll talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just have so many calls. I want to get through a couple more.  This we're going to this is going to be our first two hour tweet,  but I just can't stop.  But we have to because everybody's got to pee.  Madhouse in Madhouse radio.  Hello, Madhouse radio.  What's your first name and where you come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. How you doing, buddy?  Hey, this is Carlos.  And I say hi to you and all the Tiki Bar guys.  I love Tiki Bar and we have been following you for like five, six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Carlos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And as I I have the I've been doing internet radio for two years.  And I was just wondering what this whole legislature that's coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is awful stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I my expenses down for streaming or, you know, and I'm I'm I'm hosted.  I'm kind of like simulcast on several different stations out there.  What's the name of your show?  I do Madhouse radio.  Like, you know, we play a little music.  Mostly we're just comedy and talking.  We do no crank calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel bad for people who play music because you're not going to be able to do it anymore.  Although, fortunately, NPR has decided to fight this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really concerned.  The fact that it had to take all the music out of my show to be strictly a talk comedy show.  And it's kind of dull.  We kind of like to break things up.  It's stupid. It's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the radio and the music industry not getting their business misunderstanding  entirely what their business is.  It's just stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I listen to a radio channel.  I hear a good song. I look at the name.  I go to the iTunes store by the album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, how do you not make that connection?  Yeah, exactly. It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's you know, when I when I don't know who was it, Viacom that was ordering,  you know, another swing. Yeah, but they were ordering, you know,  a three minute clip of a of a tonight show monologue being taken down.  I'm thinking, in what way is that removing business from that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's so funny, because these are the guys who go to conferences  saying we're totally embracing the web.  We're all about new media.  And then the other other hand is saying, oh, wait a minute,  that can't give up a 30 second clip of a daily show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I can say to that story about the whole the the whole  we're not YouTube can, you know, group that's trying to put together.  We talked about the top of the show about five hours ago about together.  It's like basically everybody who's not Google.  And so, A, I think Google is probably just rubbing their hands and going,  oh, by all means, go have fun in the briar patch, you guys making a mess of,  you know, because, you know, you try and get more than one company together  to agree on anything. It's going to be crazy.  But you're absolutely right.  And so to just see all of these companies,  especially the music industry at this point, burning cycles  when they could be out there trying to be two years ahead instead of five years  behind. And it's, you know, you understand why they're doing this  because they want to make their dough day to day.  But at the same time, they're just the burning cycles like crazy right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the MSF, it's a roomful of lawyers who are bored.  Like today we're going to go after Internet radio.  Yeah. They high five and go launch a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you heard the Cory Doctorow?  Do you know? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cory's been on the show many times. He's great.
