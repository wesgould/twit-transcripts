I don't know. You're playing rugby or something. I don't know what it is. It's very British. Rugby is the beautiful game.  It is the beautiful game, but it's a beautiful game. Unless unless your knees. If you're a pair of knees, rugby is not the beautiful game or teeth or collarbone.  Any other body part you might mention Harry McCracken, the technologizers also here. Harry is technology editor at fast company.  We've got some big names in here. Hi, Harry. Good to see you. Great to be here. Always a pleasure to have you on.  And from right to left, I guess the next would be Denise Howell from this week in law. Hello, Denise.  Hi, Leo. Hi, Harry. Hi, Ian. Good to see you all.  We bring our legal counsel in because we're going to be talking about the law. Stop us all getting sued.  I look lousy and orange. So we've been we've been talking beforehand and there's really three big stories.  We'll cover a number of them, but the three big stories are going to be Facebook slash Cambridge Analytica.  That really heated up. It broke last week, but it really heated up this most recent week.  In fact, today, full page article in the New York Times in the UK was in the Observer, which is where the story broke.  Mark Zuckerberg apologizing. He didn't apologize. Not apologizing. He's not good at apologizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said he was sorry, but that's not exactly the same thing. Oh, I thought that was an apology.  I don't know the way he said it. I think it's hard to apologize without using the words I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's more like I'm sorry this happened to me. Yeah. Yeah.  Sorry we got found out. Sorry we got discovered.  We'll also talk about and I'm glad to have some legal support on this one.  Congress, our do nothing Congress got very active last week and snuck some stuff in.  They passed a bill that ostensibly is against sex trafficking. Who's in favor of that?  But it has a much larger impact on blogs, on Craigslist, on Reddit, FOSTA and SESTA.  And they snuck in at the last minute to the budget appropriations bill.  Page 2000, what was it? 2,201 out of a 2,232 page bill.  They snuck in the Cloud Act, which they've been trying to get passed through Congress.  And oddly enough, Microsoft and Google and Facebook have been trying to get passed through Congress all this time.  Because it lets them off the hook. So we'll talk about that. Exactly.  We talked last week about Uber's self-driving vehicle, sadly killing a pedestrian.  Well now it looks like there may be evidence it's Uber's fault.  We'll get into that as well. Let's start with Facebook though and Mark Zuckerberg's pseudo apology.  I tried to do the timeline in this Cambridge Analytica thing, but this is a really fast changing story.  I'll paint general pictures and you can correct me if I get it wrong.  This Mother Jones article implies that Cambridge Analytica overstated its capabilities in order to fleece candidates for money.  Including Ted Cruz, who was one of the first candidates to use Cambridge Analytica.  The story is this was a company created out of another British company called SLC.  What is SLC's job? They're still around.

Transcript:  I wouldn't surprise me if they were Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians as well.  They were already being investigated by the UK Parliament over fears that they'd involve themselves in the Brexit vote.  Indeed one of their staffers put out a press release saying we are going to be working with a leave campaign for Brexit.  And schedule a press conference and then it got pulled very quickly.  And it was like no, that was someone being over enthusiastic. We haven't actually done any business with them.  But as we've seen in the investigations over the week, they're on video as saying, oh yes we can not invoice you as from ourselves.  We can find another dummy company, we can invoice you from that and that way you get plausible deniability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were doing something that really has been going on for decades.  The idea of trying to understand the public and their interests and their weak spots, their pressure points.  For the purpose of marketing by observing behaviour.  The problem is that over the last decade computers and big databases and information treasure troves like Google and Facebook have become such rich sources of this information.  That these companies have, or maybe not, the contention is these companies have in effect weaponised, this is what Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web said, have weaponised these surveillance mechanisms to really take advantage of them.  And I think from SLC's point of view, Christopher Wiley the whistleblower who outed Cambridge Analytica started at SLC and went along with Andrew Nix and others to work at Cambridge Analytica.  I think where Cambridge Analytica's genesis came from is this study that showed up in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the US of A in February 2013.  This is a five year old study.  What happened was they took 58,000 volunteers, they got from their volunteers their Facebook likes, detailed demographic profiles and then gave them a bunch of psychometric tests.  And were able to come up with some kind of surprising correlations.  And this gave marketers a little chill down their spine. Oh my god!

Transcript:  Facebook likes are pretty widely available and it turns out can be fairly predictive of lots of things.  Race, gender, politics, intelligence. Here are some of the things that according to this article your Facebook likes can tell you with very high accuracy.  The best predictors of high intelligence include likes for these categories.  Thunderstorms, the Colbert Report, that's how old this is, science and curly fries.  Curly fries, these are high but not just predictors, highly correlated like 80% correlation.  Good predictors of low intelligence, Sephora, I love being a mom, Harley-Date, I'm sorry Denise but actually somebody when we did, I mentioned this on Monday,  this week on Google and Stacey said boy that's very sexist on both of those.  But also Harley-Davidson and the country group Lady Antebellum.  But you can do it to predict sexual orientation with an 88% accuracy.  It turns out if you like Mac Cosmetics and Wicked the Musical, you're probably gay. I like both, I use both.  Is that something you'd like to tell us?  But the point is it's not perfect. And in fact people lie to Facebook, there's other reasons why it's not perfect.

Transcript:  And I'm not sure why.  They may though not be completely forthright with you, right, because they also don't want people to know how much information can be deduced from your Facebook likes.

Transcript:  I think it comes down to how you use social media. I mean if you're just going on social media to report exactly what's happening to you every day of your life, then it might be fairly accurate.  But most people I think who use it are only putting up a very small section of their life that they just want other people to know about.  So I don't think it's entirely...

Transcript:  Shaq? Never said.  How about being confused after waking up from naps? Did you ever like that group?  That means you're straight.  That's a strong predictor of male heterosexuality if you like waking up confused from naps.  I don't know why, and that's the point of this. And that's why big data is interesting because it's not intuitive. It's correlations. It's just correlations.  If you like Hello Kitty, do you like Hello Kitty, anybody? If you like Hello Kitty...

Start time: 661.74
End time: 860.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but if you actually press the like button on Hello Kitty, that's the key.  Yeah, you're right. This isn't just like I like Hello Kitty. Who doesn't?  If you actively liked Hello Kitty on Facebook, you tend to be high on openness, but low on conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability.  Now, I don't know... I mean, anyway, that's the way it is.  I believe Christopher Wiley and the folks at Cambridge Analytica saw this study and said, hmm, because marketers are always looking for ways to find soft spots in people to target.  And they actually created their own psychological test. A guy named Alexander Kogan, who, Cambridge University is very anxious to point out,  yes, he was a teacher here, but no, we did not approve this study. We rejected it. And he went over to the Soviet Union, to former Soviet Union, Russia, and some Russian university and got them to approve it.  But he made a psychological, similar to this study, a psychological test, advertised it on Facebook, got people to take it. He said, well, pay you. They got a token that paid you.  But he also, because the test somehow was linked to Facebook, was able to get, and this was in the days when Facebook not only gave you, gave your information to these quizzes,  and this was an off Facebook quiz, but somehow he got access to that. And this was when Friends of Friends were still in act. Facebook turned that off a few years ago.  But he ended up, after getting, I think, I can't remember, 70,000 questionnaires, he got a quarter, no, it was 270,000 questionnaires, but he got 50 million people out of that because of the Friends of Friends.  That database, which normally Facebook holds on tight to, because after all, this is their business model, it's not that they don't want that information, it's they want to keep it to themselves so they can sell it.  But Cambridge Analytica, because it was an academic study, they claimed, was able to get it out of Facebook, and apparently kept it for a long time, even though they swore to Mark Zuckerberg, I promise we deleted that.  And Mark said, well, it was a legal document, they must have. Nevertheless, used that information on 50 million voters. And here's, and by the way, that's exactly Facebook's business model. That's how Facebook works.  That's how it works today. The only thing that they did wrong from Facebook's point of view is kept the data instead of having to buy it from Facebook.  But here's maybe something that you and I should be more considerate about, considerate more of a problem, is that they then apparently maybe gave it to the Internet Research Agency, the Russian arm of Trollfarm, and that information was used by them to create, and I don't, you know, I see this again and again, somebody just said it in the chat room,  Oh, Obama did the same thing. It's just because it's Trump that did it. That's not the problem so much. Every campaign does this. In fact, the first Cambridge Analytica customer was Ted Cruz.  But the Russians might have used it to sow dissent and discord in the United States by creating opposing groups, all sorts of fake stuff. And that's, I think, of interest, if a foreign interest tried to create polarization in this country using this information.  In any event, the chickens have come home to roost. Mark Zuckerberg did interviews. He doesn't like doing interviews on CNN. Recode with the New York Times. Did he ever say, did he ever say I apologize?

Start time: 861.00
End time: 876.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As far as I know, he has not used that word. He's certainly expressed regret and said they messed up and that they're taking actions to prevent it from happening again. But I think he said that we failed you and if we can't keep your trust, then we don't deserve to.

Transcript:  Alex Stamos, Facebook's, I think, widely regarded, highly regarded security chief. He was at Yahoo. I think people like him. He's left Facebook saying, I tried to explain to the executives.  He's on his way out apparently. Yeah, August will be his. And that's mostly a transitional thing. He had a team of 120 people now reduced to three. So he's not really...  He hasn't really been doing anything for a while. But he says, I tried to convince Facebook's executives that Russian trolls were using this information and they didn't listen.  I think they listened. They just didn't care.  Yeah, well that's kind of my question. Isn't, Denise, isn't this Facebook's business model? This is what they do. Why is anybody surprised? What's wrong with this picture?

Start time: 919.10
End time: 1039.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think we have to go to the... We have to back the timeline up a little further back than you even went. In fact, we could back the timeline up all the way back to the inception of Facebook when they first unleashed themselves from the universities where they were helping people hook up, right?  And opened to the general public and their business model then was, we want as many users as possible. We don't know how we're going to make money off of this yet.  But we know that if we create a great service where people like to come use our service, they like to come back, they trust us, they are willingly handing over all this information, then we can build a business model on that.  So over the course of the history of the company, its priorities have changed. It used to look after the interests of its users because that's what it needed at the time when it started, right? It really, really wanted to build that huge millions and millions of customer base.  And then it flipped, right? Once it decided its business model was to sell all that information to advertisers in ways that hadn't been done before, then the advertisers began to take precedence as to whose interests were going to be put first.  And that's where we find ourselves now. So as we've watched that progression over the years, privacy watchdogs like, for example, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, another mark to throw into the mix here, Mark Rotenberg, not Zuckerberg, heads Epic.  And he is so ticked off at the FTC right now. If you haven't seen his piece in Techonomy that was published this week, it is well worth checking out.

Start time: 1040.26
End time: 1047.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mark's one of the good guys. And Epic is a really important group that protects our interests online. So what did Mark say?

Start time: 1048.36
End time: 1187.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He details there how, you know, we started to sound the alarm about this shift in priorities back in 2009.  Well, we all, but haven't we all been doing this?  Right. And they were, but it was the complaint that Epic filed that ultimately led to the consent decree, the settlement on Facebook's part with the FTC.  As part of that settlement, the FTC states, Facebook represented that third party apps that users installed would have access only to user information that they needed to operate.  In fact, the apps could access nearly all of users' personal data, data the apps didn't need.  That was that was all going back to the original Epic complaint in 2009.  So Epic continued to, you know, bang the drum as the years went on, went back in in 2012 and said, you know, FTC, you really need to be holding these companies' feet to the fire for these settlements that we reached.  And the FTC didn't do all that it could. And we find ourselves here now.  So, but what I come back to is, you initially asked about the business model.  I think if Facebook's going to dig itself out of this, if it's going to get to the point where Tim Berners-Lee wants them to get, where they fix this, they have to rethink that business model.  And it was somewhat disappointing to hear Sheryl Sandberg this week say, oh no, you know, our business model is just fine.  Well, maybe it is, but at minimum they have to shift the priorities around again so that user data is something that they respect and they understand that people aren't waiting, waiting, waiting into their privacy policies and data policies.  And figuring out, oh gee, I guess if I clicked that I did let Cambridge Analytica do all this stuff that I wouldn't have wanted them to do.  I mean, clearly the users who were affected by this would have liked some actually comprehensible disclosure as to what was happening.  And many of them, if not the majority of them, probably would have said no.  So I think we have to get to the point where people understand what's going on here.

Start time: 1188.36
End time: 1200.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the only reason I brought up all those Hello Kitty Facebook Live things is to point out that you may be leaking all sorts of information just by using Facebook that you're not really aware of.  And Facebook certainly is not in their interest to disclose this.

Start time: 1201.18
End time: 1208.68

Transcript:  And taking a quiz on Facebook is just fun.  The quiz thing really irritates the bejesus out of me because yes, I mean, they build to you as like, oh, it's fun.  Find out which Star Trek captain you would be or whatever.  And people didn't realize that in taking that quiz, not only were they handing over their own personal information, but up until 2014, they were handling over handing over all their friends personal information as well.  And I've got relatives and friends on Facebook who take these quizzes generally and invite you to kind of, you have no control over that.

Start time: 1273.93
End time: 1301.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, definitely.  And it's not just I mean, it's it's down to the the way in which consent is extracted from us, the graphical way.  Consider whenever you're asked to release information, how you get a big blue button that says, yes, I'd like to comply.  And then maybe there's some gray text down underneath that is opting you out.  You know, I mean, they're they're manipulating people at very fundamental levels.

Transcript:  I really feel like on Facebook when they give you a yes or no, they should be in the same typeface, same amount of emphasis.  They should not try to steer you in one direction or another.  There shouldn't be a little frowny face next to they.  I don't want to do that.

Transcript:  It's dictator, a strong man in the Philippines.  He did it with the help of Facebook.  And then when he won, Facebook came in and gave them so-called white glove service to help Duterte stay in power.  They shut down the free press in the Philippines and used Facebook Live to stream his speeches.  Facebook would say, well, we don't want to pick sides in a political battle.  What is what?  And I don't even just want to blame Facebook because I think Facebook, although well, as long as we're piling on, let's just let's pile on a little bit more.  Sandy Parakilis, who was for a couple of years platform operations manager at Facebook, has stepped forward.  He was responsible for policing data breaches by 30 third party developers between 2011 and 2012.  He said he is to this is a Guardian story.  Warren, senior executives of the company, its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.  He said he believes hundreds of millions of Americans have been affected by this.  Cambridge Analytica is just the tip of the iceberg.  I would just say I'm not at all surprised.  This is what Facebook does.  What do you expect Facebook to do?  This is what this is the business of Facebook.  How could Facebook create a business model that doesn't involve selling our information to the highest bidder?  Facebook says we're going to do a forensic analysis of every app ever written.

Transcript:  I mean, it could be far more anonymized than it is.  Zuckerberg explained, which is true, that a lot of this goes back to when Facebook decided to be a platform  and opened up the ability for third parties to integrate themselves with the Facebook platform.  If that aspect of Facebook didn't exist, less of this would happen.  Does it even matter?

On Facebook it says Lisa LaPorte is married, but it doesn't say to whom because I don't exist on Facebook.  And that made me feel so bad, sweetie.  I logged back in and reactivated my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I kind of feel like it's counterproductive if what we want them to do is to fix this  and to realize the potential of what Zuckerberg talks about,  connecting everyone and having this amazing experience,  then maybe quitting isn't the right protest step.  Maybe we should take a page from these youngsters that we've seen this weekend making their voices heard  and really have people make their voices heard.  What would happen to Facebook if the web rallied around this the way they did about opposing SOPA and PIPA a few years back  and had a day where people didn't use Facebook or even, you know, they didn't interact.  They didn't like or love or laugh or on any of the posts.  They checked in, they got their news, but they didn't react.  That would have a huge impact, I would think.  It would send a message to Facebook.  Yeah, it might.

Transcript:  And I mean, despite everything, I don't agree with the folks who say that Facebook inherently makes you miserable  and is inherently pernicious and should go away.  I think Facebook, along with this infinite number of problems, also has an infinite number of ways  in which it has potential to make the world a better place.  I don't think Zuckerberg is insincere when he talks about that.  That is also true.

But I think when Facebook began tinkering around with all this, we all thought maybe they're really going to figure this out.  Maybe they're going to give me ads I want to see and that are useful and that are not trying to manipulate my political opinions  and in ways that are underhanded.  I mean, when we see political ads on TV, which we do all the time, we know what we're getting into there.

Transcript:  Yeah. And if you saw Zuckerberg's interview on CNN, and I assume he said this elsewhere, when he was sort of referencing,  maybe we should be regulated more. It seemed like that was the direction he was going in, that there is an ad transparency bill that's been sort of sitting around Congress for a while that hasn't been enacted.

Transcript:  Yes. And John McCain, I believe, is the only Republican who's bought into it.  But it seems to me when I hear that, and I hear him, you know, inviting regulation of that kind, but then putting money into opposing, for example,  the California proposition that we may see on the ballot, the California Consumer Privacy Act.  It seems like that could be a really nice opportunity for California to once again lead the way in privacy law, be the tail that wags the dog,  and get a lot of other, get compliance that affects a lot of people that don't live in California.

Start time: 1686.02
End time: 1766.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're, you know, if they don't want to just punt and lose their business model altogether,  I think they're going to have to pay attention to this because they're either going to be regulated or I do think that the users have sort of said times up on this.  That there's a lot of concern, especially I would think among young people who are not happy about where net neutrality is gone in the last year or so.  And if they become educated and informed enough to know that they are being manipulated by these companies when they don't have to,  when there are ways in which you can do an ad system that is very lucrative, that's not violating people's expectations and consent,  that they're going to take action. And maybe this bill in California is the first move toward that kind of step.  I almost feel like Zuckerberg's embracing of the ad transparency bill in Congress is sort of an entree to be able to go to advertisers and say,  gee, you know, we've been accommodating you guys for so long, but now we're getting regulated and I'm sorry, we're going to have to scale back.  And it's really not our fault. Congress is making us do it. So maybe that's a step in the right direction, too.

Transcript:  It's a gesture. It's not effective. I'm not so sure. I'm starting to think, you know, traditionally social networks have done that thing where they grow, grow, grow,  and then something better comes along and they die on the vine. And it happens to Friendster, it happens to MySpace.  And we always thought it wouldn't probably wouldn't happen to Facebook because they got scale. You know, they've got over a billion users.  It's going to be very hard to dislodge that. But something like this. And, you know, they were very keen throughout the entire week to make it about this is not a data breach.

Start time: 1821.36
End time: 1843.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not a data breach and not they don't like the word breach. Yeah. But really, they should embrace it because breach implies that they didn't want it to happen.  But then they did eventually say it was a breach of trust. Yes, very carefully put, which was sort of a breach in the sense that somebody hacked Facebook and stole the data.  They hacked the Social Engineering Act. It's such a legal distinction.

Start time: 1844.06
End time: 1880.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if it's a data breach, you know, California, among other states require you to advise users, send out letters and say, oh, gee, sorry, we've not do that.  So if you're a data has been subject to a breach and here are the steps you can take and there's a whole lot of transparency that's required around a breach.  So if we're not going to call it a breach that has legal significance and there's at least one professor out there, Ido Kilvati, who published at TechCrunch on this, that thinks we should amend those data breach laws to encompass something like this.

It's like what can we had Cory Doctorow on the new screensaver yesterday and Cory always cheers me up a little bit.  So there's a number of things we can do. One, there are little small leveraged things you can do in Congress that would help in a lot of this.  For instance, Congress has made it so that it's difficult or impossible. Correct me on this, Denise, to sue over these kinds of things.  They require it's possible for a company like Equifax to require binding arbitration instead of a lawsuit over a data breach.  And they always do pretty much.  And he said if we could change that law just to allow us to sue these companies, that would go a long way.  You know, hit them in the pocketbook. That would go a long way to making a difference. Is that the case, Denise?

Start time: 1945.90
End time: 1968.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Completely agree. Yeah, that Cory's right on about that.  And the reason that binding arbitration is in so many of these terms of service that we have with various companies that we do business with is that litigation is so much more expensive.  So if you're if you're taking that cost savings off the table for them, I think it definitely makes a difference.

Start time: 1968.74

And there's no way they're Romanian, because I threw some Romanian slang at them.  They weren't going for it. They didn't understand what I was talking about. So it doesn't surprise me that it was coming from the GRU.  It also doesn't surprise me they didn't use the VR VPN, because everybody slips up sooner or later.  We saw it with Robert Roberts. We saw it with everyone else. Everyone mucks up. But all the same, oh, we were talking to Guccifer.  We've now discovered their Russian military intelligence, but we didn't work with the Russians. I'm having problems reconciling those those facts.  It's clear now that the Russians were playing a part. How influential it was and who knew about it at the time.

And they went in on Friday, at which point all they're going to find is a bunch of wiped servers and a slightly shredded memo saying, remember, chaps, everybody obey the law.

Transcript:  I should credit to Harvard academic Shoshana Zuboff for the term surveillance capitalism.  Not the first use according to Wikipedia.  John Bellamy Foster and Robert McChesney wrote an article using that term in Monthly Review.  But Zuboff is writing a book called Surveillance Capitalism.  Here's how she defines it.  She says surveillance capitalism emerged due to the coupling of the vast powers of the digital, which we've all talked about, with the...  I love this.  The radical indifference and intrinsic narcissism of the financial capitalism and its neoliberal vision that have dominated commerce for at least three decades, especially in the Anglo economies.  And I think the Russians might have looked at us and said, oh, we found your weak spot.  You all made fun of us for communism.  But capitalism has its own problems.

Transcript:  Google's chief economist Hal Varian identified the four key features in the logic of surveillance capitalism.  One, the drive toward more and more data extraction and analysis.  Two, the development of new contractual forms using computer monitoring and automation.  Three, the desire to personalize and customize the services offered to users of digital platforms.  And finally, the use of technological infrastructure to carry out continual experiments on its users and consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How fortunate that was for them.  But I mean we know this stuff works.  We know that you can alter people's perceptions by altering the news feed.  What I do find somewhat of a stretch is whether or not you could actually change someone's political opinion using these kind of techniques because that seems to be something fairly deep rooted.  I don't even think that's as much of a problem.

Start time: 2601.12
End time: 2653.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think that really we talk a lot about fake news and how it, but I think it was embraced by people who already believed it.  It was just a self-reinforcing mechanism.  That's not what bothers me so much as the way it can be used and it has apparently been used by Russia to see discord and dissent and polarization.  And if there's anything that really has kind of frustrated the Republican experiment, lowercase R experiment that the United States is, it's this polarization that we've all observed over the last 10 years where the two sides don't even talk to one another.  And that seems particularly pernicious if a foreign entity which doesn't like the liberal West decides, hey we can really screw with them.  That's the ultimate, I mean literally the word trolling, that's the ultimate trolling.  We don't care what the result is, we just want to throw chaos into the mix.

Last time I was over there, everyone's tremendously polarized around are you a Brexiteer or are you a Remainer?  And over here, the level of tribalism in politics is just damning.  I mean there are people who won't even have friends who are of a different school of persuasion and that's how you come around it.  We need to get over that. Absolutely.

Anyway, to me again, I feel like a lab rat. I feel like...  And I think this is really the potential negative of this. Look, we love technology. That's why this network exists, that's why I do what I do.  I love the potential for technology, I love playing with it, I think it's great in so many ways.  And so I don't want it to become this tool to abuse us. I don't want it to become used against us.  And so we need to find ways to make it so that it isn't used against us and can be used for good.  And frankly, I think you made the point. Facebook can be used for good. It's not inherently evil.  It's just that it's so sad when it's used in this terrible way.

Transcript:  I saw a post on Twitter. Dave Morin, the guy who created Path, said, you know, maybe we should get the old gang back together.  He sold it to a Chinese, Japanese, Korean company.  Maybe we should get the old gang. Would there be an interest in?  And by the way, that's why I joined Path. It was limited to 50 people. It didn't seem to have the same kind of intense surveillance behind it.  He said, maybe we should get the old gang back. I hope, Dave, anything we can do to support and help that.  And Mastodon Gargron, the guy who created Mastodon, wrote a medium post saying, don't forget there are social networks out there that aren't trying to.  Yeah. Now, it's funny because Twitter, which I don't think really is very good at surveillance capitalism and certainly doesn't have as much information,  but it has other problems that make it less, you know, not the utopia we thought it would be.  It's it's painful to go there, too. It can be it can be ugly. And at the same time, huge value. Right. Yeah.  Huge value. Google. Go ahead and try to live without Google. Yeah, you can.

YouTube, which you haven't really mentioned, has all kinds of all sorts of.  Oh, yeah. Huge. Google. I mean, Google.

Because I think the world is ready for that. And I think that people would jump on that.  And Mark Zuckerberg, that is the real existential threat to Facebook. And you could do it too, Mark.  You know, you could save Facebook. There are ways to do this. If anything good comes out of this, it'll be that.

End time: 3116.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that puts you in a death spiral, right? Because if your share price plummets, which you did Facebook last fifty billion dollars in market value,  then you can't attract the best talent because you don't have shares that are worth anything.  And then there's a death spiral because then you can't get good people and it gets worse and worse and worse.  I don't know if they're at that. I doubt they're at that point. I think their stock price has recovered somewhat.  I imagine it will continue to do so.  I don't feel equipped to cover these stories, to be honest with you.  I just...

Transcript:  Well, do you remember the Hacker Manifesto back in the mid-90s?  The internet was going to bring all these diverse groups together. We'd all talk. We'd understand each other.  I was rereading it last week when all this broke.  And it was just like, I wish it had worked out that way. But instead we've got polarized.  We've got crammed into narrower and narrower silos.

Start time: 3156.06
End time: 3242.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the tenets of the Hacker Manifesto was information wants to be free.  And in fact, that's to me the most important thing.  And that means not siloed, not owned by any company, not gathered to be used against you.  It wants to be free. And that's the real promise of the internet.  And you know, it's still hugely valuable.  I think now every day five or six times of premises, of things that I would have in the past had to go to a library and research,  which meant I could do maybe one every six months.  Now I can in several times a day go out, find out something, do some research on something. And that's amazing.  It's an enormously valuable tool.  Huge. I remember my father-in-law, who was a science professor.  We gave him for the first time, he's passed away since, but an iPad with the elements program on it and some other science programs on it.  He was a science teacher. And he said if Copernicus had had this, Copernicus spent most of his life grinding lenses  so that he could observe the heavens, so that he could come up with the theory that the earth revolves around the sun.  If he had something like this, he wouldn't have had to grind all those lenses.  He could get the data and then spend his energy coming up with theses.  And that's the world we live in today. The data is now freely available. It is not a huge cost.  And I think kids growing up today have a huge opportunity, if they will use it, to become great synthesizers.

Transcript:  But you've got to be able to handle data critically. This is the thing.  That's right. Absolutely.  We used to have a class at school called Media Studies when I was growing up where you've seen as an easy option,  but it's actually quite tough when you work into it where you watch TV programs and talk about newspaper articles  and you work out why it's written the way it's written.  And I think if we could have some kind of social media education, either coming from parents or, God help us from the schools,  I'm not quite sure that would work, but I mean some kind of parents can educate their kids about,  this is what social media is about, this is what they take from you, this is what they expect in return, and these are the benefits.  Absolutely. It's an education issue.

When the blogging movement first took off, one of its tenants were, we can fact check your ass.  Yes.  It becomes really hard to fact check and get your fact checking seen and vetted and taken as, oh yeah, you really took that down  when algorithms are fighting you in getting your information out there.  And I think that's one of Facebook's challenges.  And when you throw it back to why Google is successful all these years later, it's because their algorithms in their original search product  were providing you with the actual relevant information you were looking for.  They were not providing you with what was promoted or paid for or otherwise.  Absolutely right.

Transcript:  And that segues right into our first ad of the show, an hour and a half in.  And guess who it's from? Google.  Our episode this week brought to you by Google Cloud, the Google Cloud Platform, which, hey, really is amazing.  For anybody who wants to create the next social network, create the next great thing, when you're building an application,  you know the Google Cloud Platform is the place to be.  And this particular episode brought to you by the Kubernetes Engine on Google Cloud Platform.  Fast, secure, always evolving with the Kubernetes Engine, developers can easily deploy containerized apps on a fully managed service  from Google Cloud Platform.  Nobody does it better than Google.  They scale.  They've been running production workloads in containers for more than 10 years.  Oh, sure.  You just heard about it, but they've been doing it for more than 10 years and they have built the best of what they learn into Kubernetes Engine.  Kubernetes Engine combines automatic scaling, updates, reliable self-healing infrastructure.  That's all the kind of thing you really need.  But it also has open source flexibility.  So you cut down your development cycles.  You can move from idea to production quickly and reliably.  I remember when my friend Kevin Rose started Digg.  He had to get a co-location, buy a server, put it in the cage, set the whole thing up.  The next great application is out there and Kubernetes Engine is ready to handle it with scheduling deployment for your workloads to maximize resource optimization.  You can focus on your apps.  It auto scales.  So when you succeed, no problem.  Those increased demands go up.  And by the way, quiet periods.  It scales down.  You save money.  That is really nice.  Google is the only hyperscale cloud provider to offer an SLA for clusters running on Kubernetes.  It's also backed by experts on Google's security and reliability engineering team, HIPAA compliant, PCI compliant.  And of course, it's open.  So you're never going to get locked in with Kubernetes Engine.  You're free to take your workloads out, run them anywhere Kubernetes is supported.  Learn more about the great implementation of the Kubernetes Engine at g.co.  slash get G.K.E.  today.  That's G.co.  slash G.E.T.  G.K.E.  Get Google Kubernetes Engine.  G.co.  slash G.E.T.  Get G.K.E.  That's the short URL.  Google Cloud Platform.  That's a really good example of the really empowering capabilities of these companies.  They can really empower people to do some amazing things.  It's why everybody, well, not everybody, but learn to code, learn to code.  I think, you know, great media literacy.  It's good.  But if you have any interest in coding, learn to code.  The sky's the limit.  We need people who are aware and alert and smart and media literate and are thinking about this stuff to go out there and write the next great app and do it ethically.  I love that.  All right.  Moving along.  Thank you, Denise, for being here.  We brought you here actually to talk about another issue which is very hot.  All of a sudden Congress, which hasn't been able to do anything, is getting ready for, I want to say, siesta.  They're getting ready for the session to end.  And so they thought, well, we better get to work and do a few things.  Obviously they didn't want the government shut down.  So they passed a, what was it, a 1.3, 1.6 trillion dollar budget.  And on page, what was it, 2,024 of this massive omnibus bill, they stuck in a rider that put through the Cloud Act.  So first of all, maybe I better get the lawyer here.  Explain to us, this thing has been hanging around, the Cloud Act's been hanging around for at least a year.  What is the Cloud Act?

Start time: 3580.98
End time: 3647.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been hanging around and it's been sort of put on the fast track because of a case before the Supreme Court right now involving Microsoft.  Is this the Irish server case?  Yes.  So this is the Irish server case where Microsoft is saying that they don't have to turn over information to law enforcement related to a drug crime investigation because the information resides on a server that is completely under Microsoft's control but is in Ireland.  So they have taken that case all the way up to the Supreme Court.  So the Cloud Act was argued, yeah, I think just last month, we should have a decision on it soon.  But right there in the chambers, as it was being argued, were lawmakers who are proponents of the Cloud Act as though to emphasize to the Supreme Court members that, you know, we may enact something that makes this completely moot for you.  Well, guess what?  They did.

Start time: 3649.24
End time: 3756.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By sneaking it into the budget, getting it passed and signed, it is the law.  Right.  Let me tell you, this cloud stands for, I love it.  It's a retronym.  The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data Act.  What it does, it creates an explicit provision for, and by the way, thanks to Orrin Hatch, Lindsay Graham, Coons and Whitehouse, the four senators who created the Cloud Act.  It creates an explicit provision for US law enforcement, whether it's the chief of police down the road in Butboy, Utah, or, you know, the National Security, well, I guess it's the FBI, to access or ICE, to access the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information about a person, regardless of where they live or where that information is.  The information is located on the globe.  Let's say an Irish national and their email is on a Microsoft server in Ireland, for instance.  Furthermore, they don't need a warrant.  US police could compel a service provider, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, to hand over a user's content and metadata, even if it's stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country's privacy law.  Furthermore, the president can enter into, quote, executive agreements, in other words, no oversight, with foreign governments that would allow those governments to acquire users' data stored in the other country without following each other's privacy laws.  So China could come to Google and say, our Chinese national, maybe a dissenter, had a conversation with Leo that's on your servers.  We would like that.

Start time: 3794.30
End time: 3819.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it really strikes me as a strange thing for Congress to enact in the first instance.  It really feels more like a treaty.  Right. We're getting some accommodations from other countries in exchange for the ability to empower U.S.  police to go to their countries and grab data regardless if it's a U.S.  persons or not, no matter where it's stored.  So how how is that really something that we get to legislate?

Start time: 3819.50

They instructed the court to find them in contempt because they weren't prepared to play along with this.  And it was basically because this they knew this would throw an enormous curveball into their into their cloud business.  And now Congress has acted on it and they can say, well, you know, we tried and such is life.  But I guess we're just going to have to obey what Congress says.  Here's the letterhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Getting back to Harry's question, I mean, there are some practical realities here that this bill recognizes that, you know, it really makes no difference to Microsoft where its servers are.  It has control over all of that data.  Yeah. And and I think that's what frustrated the lawmakers here or the prosecutors in the drug case that well.  Well, yeah, let me put myself in Microsoft shoes.

We don't want to have to figure out interlocking data protections, data rules of all these different countries is impossible for us.  So we just want need some simple rule that cuts through all of this.  Yeah, I understand that.  I mean, I do understand, especially if you can just, by the way, just add some language that lets us off the hook.  That would be nice.  It's good. Done deal.

I mean, if the executive decides to conduct one of these deals with another country, the only way you'd find out about it is if somebody leaks about it.  I don't believe as in and you can correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I don't believe the legislation requires the government to say who has these agreements with.  And that's tremendously worrying.  And if you're a foreign activist who's based over here.

End time: 4264.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Widely agreed to be a genius.  Maybe not so much in this respect.  In fact, he and others like him have agreed with the FBI and the Justice Department because, of course, the FBI and the Justice Department don't like it that there's stuff on phones they can't get to.  Although I have to say we know we've seen this report from the Harvard Berkman Center going dark that in fact they have more ways of spying on us than ever before.  They don't.  I mean, the problem is that your phone has everything has your life in here.  And I think needs some specialized protection over and above, you know, just your computer.  I mean, this is you put everything in this phone.  So the Justice Department says, here's what we how about this?  What if there were a mechanism to access the data on your phone that could be engineered without weakening the devices security against hacking some sort of secure enclave that contains the encryption key that would only be accessible to law enforcement?  With the help of a company.  And then we could then you know, we could just go to Apple and say, OK, look, it's a special case.  Could you unlock that phone?  What an amazing idea.

Start time: 4264.00
End time: 4299.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm amazed no one's thoughts of that one.  I mean, seriously, we're going to let we're going to set this up and then trust that the government will look after this encryption key and ask the Office of Personnel Management how good they are at that kind of stuff.  Ask the NSA how good it is at keeping its private secrets private.  Or we're going to trust companies like Apple and Google.  I mean, people.  Yes, an encryption backdoor is a fantastic is a great idea in some circumstances, but you can't build a backdoor into a system that no one else can find.  And if you tell people it's there, they will move heaven and earth to find it.

Start time: 4299.41
End time: 4355.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I agree.  And math says this is the case.  But there are people like Ray Ozzie who he said, quote, This issue is not going away.  And we think that we need to have some constructive dialogue rather than saying it can't be done.  And I understand that people like Ozzie, Stephen Savage, who's a computer science professor at UCSD, Ernie Burkel, former chief security officer at Intel.  These three have been meeting at MIT to try to find a solution.  I understand that they they're probably patriots.  They want to protect the nation.  They feel like the terrorists can use these technologies to operate unimpeded and that law enforcement should have.  And I agree with all of that.  But I do think that there's a really substantive question.  Is it possible to crack this stuff in a way that doesn't give bad guys access to my stuff as well?

Start time: 4356.20
End time: 4379.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as I read this, you guys correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the distinction that they're working toward here is maybe having a unique key for each device that doesn't unlock the entire operating system for every other device.  Right. And that's what would be subpoenaed.  So does that make you feel any more comfortable?

Start time: 4380.69
End time: 4399.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it lives on the device.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a little bit like how Apple Pay works where there's a secure enclave that nobody can get at except for Apple Pay.  This would be a secure enclave that nobody could get at except Apple.  Right. And a government would go to Apple to get at it.

Start time: 4400.42
End time: 4439.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although, as we can see with the Cloud Act, the standards for what the government has to do to get Apple to agree have shifted dramatically.  Yeah.  And if they could just say, hey, by the way, what's that key again?  Now, I agree with you, Denise.  There's a real benefit to the fact that it's done on a per foam basis.  I think that's a good protection.  And actually, you know, Steve Gibson suggested exactly this solution.  And he said, I think this is a reasonable compromise.  I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth, Steve.  But he said this was some months ago.  This would be a solution that would, you know, at least be limited in its risks.

Transcript:  Right.  Symphony, which is an encrypted messaging system for banks, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers.  That arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.  Christopher Ray, the FBI director, former FBI director, said at the end, the data is he's former.  I can't remember. It's changed so fast.  I think so. At the end, is he still the director?  OK. At the end, the data and Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs.  So OK, so can we so maybe this is a solution that's OK.

Transcript:  That's a reminder of death, isn't it?  Our show today brought to you by somebody I can celebrate that I use, we use at work, and we're really happy.  I've been trying to get these guys as a sponsor literally since Tweet started LastPass.  LastPass keeps your everybody loves LastPass.  If you're not using it, you better get there and use it.  Keeps your passwords organized, secure, right at your fingertips.  It solves the fundamental problem that passwords present.  You've got to remember a bunch of them.  You've got to keep them secure.  But the problem is, if you've got to remember a bunch of them, you're going to keep them secure.  You're going to pick passwords you can remember.  You're going to use bad passwords.  Your niece's name, the name of your dog and the birthday of your child.  That's a terrible password.  With LastPass, you let it generate long, obscure, unmemorable passwords.  Store them securely, fully encrypted.  All you have to remember is one password, your master password.  LastPass does the rest.  You don't want to reuse passwords.  You want long.  I make my passwords.  I'm not going to tell you the length because part of my security through obscurity is not using the standard lengths.  I make them like 17 or 23.  I like prime numbers.  And then, so long, 58, long.  Then LastPass automatically remembers and fills in your passwords anytime, anywhere.  Not just on your computer, on your browser, but on your mobile device too.  In fact, with the new Android 8.1, LastPass is so great now.  It just fills it in so easily.  And then you've got a LastPass vault.  That's encrypted on LastPass servers.  They don't have the key.  Only you have the key.  Strong encryption using some really sophisticated techniques.  I don't know if you remember, but Steve Gibson actually got a deep dive from the creator of LastPass, Joe Segrist, and was so impressed.  He started using it.  So impressed by the technologies that LastPass is using to protect you.  And we use LastPass Enterprise.  And I got to tell you, this is great.  In fact, we like LastPass so much.  As a benefit to people who work at Twitter, and we've done this for the last few years, they get a free LastPass account in addition to the LastPass Enterprise.  And they can merge, they can keep the two together.  That's what I do.  So I have access to all the company passwords and all of my personal passwords.  It doesn't merge them.  It's separate.  But I log into one vault and I have it all.  Eighty-one percent of breaches are caused by weak passwords.  Gotta use LastPass.  It protects every password in your business without slowing down your employees.  AES 256-bit encryption to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.  They use PBKDDF, whatever the heck that is.  Anyway, I can go on and on.  You should actually listen.  Steve Gibson did a really good segment on LastPass where he explains what they do.  They've got products for homes, for individuals, for families.  We use LastPass for families.  This is, by the way, I love this feature.  There's a death benefit.  We were talking about death a second ago.  I can designate and I have my wife.  If something happens to me, I hear about this all the time when geeks die and their family doesn't know how to get into any of their stuff.  She will have access to my LastPass.  So the way it works is she requests it of LastPass.  She says, I'm the designated survivor.  She sends them a message.  They send me an email to the email address I specified with LastPass.  And then I can say, if I don't respond after a week, I'm dead.  I actually made it two days.  If I don't respond after two days, I'm dead.  Give her the password.  That is huge.  It really gave me peace of mind.  LastPass premium for personal use.  LastPass families for your whole family.  We use that all the time.  Family sharing is fabulous.  LastPass teams for teams are 50 or less.  There's a solution for you.  Very affordable.  You got to try it.  At work and at home.  Fix your password woes with LastPass.  It is the number one most preferred password manager.  It's what I use.  It's what we use at Twitter.  Learn more at lastpass.com slash twit.  There it is.  It is literally the first program I install on any new device or computer.  But you know why that is?  Because then I can log into all the rest.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  I actually put passwords in there, driver's license, all the documents that I want to keep track of,  but I don't want anybody else to have access to because they're important privacy documents.  I keep them in LastPass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the liability is for sex trafficking.

Start time: 5156.10
End time: 5159.00

Transcript:  So it's as if Craigslist was the sex trafficker.

Start time: 5159.65
End time: 5229.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  So Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is instrumental to how the web as we know it works, how people can have interactions with one another on the web.  Some totally legal, some not, but the sites where they're having those interactions are by and large not responsible unless it's a criminal, a federal criminal law that's being violated.  Or of course, what's carved out of Section 230 as well is intellectual property violations.  So to the extent any of this...  What we're concerned about are things that were federal crimes already.  Section 230 already was drafted perfectly comfortably to accommodate that.  It didn't provide any shelter to sites for people who were engaging in federal crimes on their platforms.  And they were thus incentivized to prevent that kind of activity.  But now...  By the way, sex trafficking, is that prostitution?  Well, that's a good...  I mean, there's a lot of...

Start time: 5230.65
End time: 5232.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not in favor of sex slaves, but...  Right.

Start time: 5234.11
End time: 5249.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's different, right?  Sex trafficking is what you just described.  I think people engaged in, being forced to engage in sexual activities without their consent and being dragooned into things they don't want to do.

Start time: 5250.08
End time: 5259.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you're saying Section 230 did not protect a blog comment section or Reddit or...  It didn't protect them.  What's that?

Start time: 5260.08
End time: 5263.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Federal crimes were already carved out.  Now, state crimes were not.  So...

Start time: 5264.95
End time: 5268.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's state sex trafficking this protects.  Right, right, right.

Start time: 5269.14
End time: 5285.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what this winds up doing is, yes, potentially putting...  It gives a very broad definition of what constitutes things that are going to be prevented and enforceable and prosecutable here.

Start time: 5287.20
End time: 5327.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Craigslist was worried enough that they said, well, we're not even going to take the chance.  So that's one problem, is you're going to see people just say, well, we're not going to take the chance.  In fact, I think some Reddit subreddits were closed as well for the same reason.  But there's also the issue, and we were talking about how somebody should come along and disintermediate Facebook by making a better privacy-focused Facebook.  Facebook has the resources, perhaps, to moderate and to search for and to get rid of anything that would violate SESTA-FOSTA.  Yes.  STA.  STA.  But if you're the new Facebook, if you're the little guy, you may not.  And so this...  Mike Godwin said this actually kills innovation too.  It keeps you from getting a next Facebook.

Start time: 5328.00
End time: 5354.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Senator Ron Wyden said exactly the same thing on the Senate floor.  I mean, he actually wrote Section 230, so he knows what he's talking about.  And he was saying it was shameful that the tech companies are supporting this because they know they've got the armies of lawyers needed and moderators that they can actually protect themselves with.  But if you're a startup, your liability bill has just gone through the ceiling if you're having any kind of public forums on there.  So the big tech companies like this because it's an anticompetitive move.

Start time: 5356.41
End time: 5357.37

Transcript:  Here's a quote.  Right.

Start time: 5358.00
End time: 5377.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inflation is incredibly expensive.  And the problem is, as you pointed out, Leo, there is a difference between sex trafficking and sexual discourse.  And the one will get curtailed in service of protecting liability from the other.

Start time: 5378.34
End time: 5388.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there is a legitimate concern for sex workers who have been using things like Craigslist.  I mean, that certainly goes on there to get off the streets and to get out of being pimped.

Start time: 5388.12
End time: 5420.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Study after study has shown it's actually safer for sex workers to go online rather than to get business online rather than actually having to go out into the street.  Because you're not, as you say, you're not out there.  You're much more capable of running your own business yourself.  And you're not putting yourself in physical risk.  There's even a sort of a group of sex workers who combine into a database of people who they know are weirdos and can be blocked based on their email address.  So, I mean, this does undoubtedly make people safer if you're a sex worker is going online.

Start time: 5421.24
End time: 5429.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it becomes less if they're not on Craigslist the whole thing, it becomes more shadowy.  Harder to find the people who do need to be in trouble for what they're doing.

Start time: 5430.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  Alex Levy is a professor at Notre Dame.  He's quoted in Gizmodo.  He teaches.  I mean, this guy teaches a class in human trafficking and human markets.  He wrote the war on Internet platforms is pageantry, a kind of theater designed to satisfy people's need to identify and fight bad guys without regard to nuance or long term outcome.  But from a tactical standpoint, it's more than a distraction.  Censoring these platforms means forfeiting a resource that naturally facilitates the recovery of victims.  Section 230 doesn't cause lawlessness.  It creates a space in which many things, including lawless behavior, come to light.  And it's in that light that multitudes of organizations and people have taken proactive steps to usher victims to safety and apprehend their abusers.  It pushes that into the shadows.

Start time: 5484.44
End time: 5497.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they go onto the dark web now and there's no and there's no way to track them.  If they're actually on this on Craigslist or on other open sites, that would give the police and a wealth of information as to how to track these people down.  And it's just made the situation worse.

Start time: 5498.02
End time: 5513.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's bad for dangerous for sex workers.  It pushes bad behavior out of the light, pushes victims out of the light.  It has a chilling effect on legitimate enterprises like Craigslist and Reddit.  So clearly it's a bad law.  Right.

Start time: 5514.12
End time: 5525.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a harbinger of maybe bad law to come because Section 230 has been really unpopular among our current lawmakers and prosecutors.

Start time: 5525.30
End time: 5531.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they don't like the fact that it protects them against what they think is defamatory speech.  Yes, exactly.

Start time: 5534.04
End time: 5556.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All manner of bad things can go on between people under Section 230 and have a site like Facebook or Google or smaller sites be protected as long as it's not a federal crime or IP infringement.  So defamation would be one thing.  So this could be used to chill speech.  Definitely.

Transcript:  It's very interesting that they've used exactly the same excuse in various states.  States have introduced laws where tech companies are mandated to put porn filters onto their devices.  And if you want it taken out, you have to pay a $20 fee per year.  Australia does this.  There's like five or six states in the US that have just introduced laws.  It's terrible.  It's all, every single one of them has used the same excuse.  It's to combat sex traffickers.  And this seems to be the excuse to Jordan.  I'm wondering who's coming up with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, child abuse is working for a while, but now we've got another one.  So we got to go.  But I also OK, I'm going to argue on their side here.  On the other hand, I mean, we need tools to fight sex trafficking and child abuse.  And you've got to give us credit.  We're not going to overstep our bounds here.  Because that never happens.  Well, OK, I couldn't even say it with a straight face.  So everybody has said the courts will weigh in on this.  Denise, will the courts protect Section 230?

Start time: 5625.63
End time: 5664.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they might.  There might be parts of this that are, again, deemed unconstitutional  or beyond Congress's scope of authority in one way or another.  And again, EFF and others will probably be leading the charge on  picking at the viability of this law and the Cloud Act.  And in both instances, right, it's like we're just going to grant ourselves  this authority in service of a noble goal.  And as you say, Leo, there's sort of this tacit implication.  We would never abuse that authority, but it's really broad authority.

Start time: 5664.06
End time: 5683.88

Transcript:  Well, so now we just hope that the court that there will certainly be actions,  although it's interesting that Craigslist didn't fight it.  They just said, yeah, OK, fine.  Well, I think they were making a stand more than...  Oh, you think so?  But I'm sure they make a lot of money on those persons, right?  It's an important part of their business.  Are they free?

Transcript:  and that sort of thing.  That's going to have to come into play sooner or later.  They've got to be aware of this.  We've been contacting them for comment on it since this came up,  and they're being very, very quiet about it.  But I suspect their legal department is quietly having kittens  over the prospect of being sued.

Transcript:  So I think the other thing we probably should point out is it probably  won't do anything to fight sex traffic.  Because honestly, that's not going to have that effect.  Do you think that they were cynically, the lawmakers were cynically saying,  well, what we really want is a bill that will keep those people from saying  bad things about us and we'll just put it in the guise of sex trafficking?

Transcript:  I wouldn't go that far, but I do think only two senators voted against this bill.  It was a 1972 vote with Rand Paul and Ron Wyden being the only two no votes.  I just think it's really hard for a senator to say, yeah,  I voted against this bill that was designed to curb sex trafficking.  How do you go back to your constituents, justify that,  unless you're good at explaining why and who really is that good  or wants to take that time?

Start time: 5769.48
End time: 5798.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's why the bill was named in its way.  So if somebody trying to get it through could say,  well, you want to go back to your constituents and say,  no, I voted against a law that would go against sex traffickers.  It's blatantly cynical.  I think, to be honest, most of them, if Congress,  if we've seen anything from Congress's level of tech-savvyness,  most of them probably didn't really realize the implications of what they were voting for,  but that seems to be very much the run of course in Congress these days.

Transcript:  I think there is, and really this is, you can attribute a lot of what's going on in Congress right now  to the power of these attack ads that members of Congress know they're going to go home,  they're going to face opponents in their primary who are going to run attack ads that say,  Senator is in favor of sex trafficking, and those will work.  And so it always comes down to, frankly, an electorate that's willing to fall for that.

I think you did. Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't it great? I love it.  Yeah. And still subscribe.  We get it. We have Blue Apron in our fridge. I might go home tonight.  I can't remember what it is, but it's guaranteed to be something delicious.  Blue Apron is the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country.  Here's how it works. You go to blueapron.com slash twit.  By the way, if you do that, you're going to get $30 off your first order and free shipping.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Take a look at what's on the menu. They have lots of different items.  You pick, well, two, three, or four recipes, depending on what you want, what fits your schedule.  There's 12 to pick from. Things like quick bucatini with broccoli and pecorino cheese.  I want that now, right now. Pan fried chicken breast with sweet and tangy zucchini.  Italian style shrimp and sweet peppers over fregola sarda pasta.  Parmesan crusted steaks with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  You choose the one you want. They have two plans, one for a couple, one for a family of four.  The family of four version has kind of more kid-friendly ingredients.  By the way, what you're not going to get is a precooked meal that you steam or you microwave.  You're going to get exactly the ingredients fresh, beautiful.  They pick produce better than anybody. It's going to be beautiful.  Everything you need, right down to the clove of garlic, the rib of celery, the little tiny bottle of soy sauce.  Whatever it is, it's in the recipe.  And then you cook it. And kids love this. You go, oh, we got everything. Let's cook.  And it takes you just, you know, 45 minutes.  The house fills with these amazing, beautiful scents of things like ginger.  I noticed that Blue Apron, I think they do this on purpose, has beautiful aromatic ingredients that really make your nose go,  I can't wait. Dinner's coming. They're so good.  Kids get excited about it.  And, you know, I have to say, it's so easy. We live such busy lives. We're so swamped.  I think a lot of times you go home, you get something to go or you go to the fast food.  Look, with Blue Apron, you're not just having burgers for dinner.  You're making short rib burgers with a hoppy cheddar sauce on a pretzel bun  or seared steaks and thyme pan sauce with mashed potatoes, green beans and crispy shallots.  Oh my God. Blue Apron, look at you. You got to try this.  Incredible ingredients, chef designed recipes.  Always something new.  Fresh ingredients. A meal you make yourself from scratch.

So I, you know, when Lisa told me about this Uber car, a very sad story.  Tempe, Arizona, Uber self-driving vehicle with a safety driver at the helm,  but in autonomous mode, 10 p.m., homeless pedestrian walking her bicycle,  steps out into a four-lane, and they have these in Arizona, really.  These are city streets, but they're four lanes and the cars are whizzing down,  steps out and gets hit and killed. Very sad.  She had her bicycle and she had bags on the bicycle. She gets hit and killed.  But my first reaction was, oh, well, clearly the pedestrian walked out from between a car  or was in some way invisible because, no, even my car, not in autonomous mode,  would see and jam on the brakes if something like that happened  because almost all cars now have collision avoidance and they would jam on the brakes.  There was no evidence that the brakes had slowed down.  The safety driver said, I didn't see anything until a crash happened.  Then we saw the video and the Tempe police initially said, yeah, this is unavoidable.  There's no way anybody could avoid this.  But as you saw, Sam Abouelsameed and others, Brad Templeton, who I highly respect,  is a big advocate of autonomous vehicles.  He's talked about how this is going to change the world and it's a great thing.  He said he was skeptical. Sam was skeptical.  We looked at the video. A few things came to mind.  First of all, maybe the least important, the car was traveling five miles above the speed limit.  Now, we all do that.

Start time: 6285.28
End time: 6291.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's actually been altered now. It was on a 45-mile-an-hour road and it was going 40.  Oh, it was going slower than the speed limit.  It was going slightly slower.

Start time: 6292.26
End time: 6342.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As it should in the dark with visibility's bad.  Exactly.  That's one thing a self-driving vehicle should do.  The safety driver in the video was not watching.  She was looking down at her phone.  And laughing.  But, and this is what Brad pointed out, and this is a big deal,  you can clearly see in the video five seconds before the car strikes the pedestrian,  the lights off the pedestrian sneakers, he said a LIDAR system can see in the dark.  It should have seen this.  This is clearly a failure of Uber's autonomous vehicle.  And I have to say, I agree now seeing more of this,  because even my Tesla, not in auto driving mode,  and many modern cars, would have at least braked if it had five seconds.

Start time: 6343.49
End time: 6376.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is the thing, autonomous vehicles are being sold to us  as this will make life so much simpler, safer, and we'll have less traffic.  And in fact, the reason people are struggling,  and the reason Uber is rushing to develop this technology  is because its business model doesn't make sense without it.  So I think this kind of gives light to the whole autonomous driving is going to be safer,  because these cars have done a pathetic amount of time on the roads,  and they're already killing people.  Or somebody has died in it.  So I don't think the technology could have worked.  I mean, most LIDAR systems would have picked that up.

Start time: 6377.18
End time: 6440.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some, we will know, because the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.  The Tempe police have now referred it for criminal investigation,  so they're obviously taking this more seriously.  The family members of the pedestrian have now retained counsel and are expected to sue.  So this will come out.  And at least one thing about autonomous vehicles, there's lots of recording.  But one thing Brad speculated, maybe the LIDAR was turned off.  It's not unusual in testing for LIDAR to be turned off in testing.  And what he said is this is not appropriate.  Maybe it should be, the input of the LIDAR should be somehow disabled.  That's bizarre.  And maybe Uber has less of a record for all of this.  According to the New York Times, Waymo, the self-driving car project at Google,  its cars went on average of 5,600 miles before the driver had to take control, the safety driver.  As of March, Uber was struggling to meet its target of 13 miles.  5,600 for Waymo, 13 for Google.

Start time: 6444.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6451.64
End time: 6481.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, of course, and one of the things I worry about,  I don't want autonomous vehicles to be slammed inappropriately.  I mean, at some point, people are, this is going to happen because there are unavoidable circumstances.  Even a very fast autonomous system can't stop a car in zero feet  because it's physics.  And we know autonomous vehicles will ultimately save lives.  But if there is any evidence that Uber, and who wouldn't be surprised to find this out,  did not do everything right, then they...

Transcript:  Yeah, but it's interesting that under California law,  all the self-driving car companies who have their cars on the roads  have to file a report if there's any kind of accident.  Now, under the Arizona law, they don't have to do that.  Yeah, Arizona really wanted this to happen.

Start time: 6509.58
End time: 6512.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the reasons why they're testing in Arizona, because it's a little bit more loosey-goosey.

Start time: 6513.36
End time: 6531.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I'm working on a piece, so I can't say too much about it,  but there are other self-driving car companies who are going to be falling afoul of this as well.  I mean, it was always going to happen that an autonomous vehicle kills somebody.  I mean, it's the way of it.  You know, was it 30,000 people get killed in cars every year in the US?

Start time: 6532.52
End time: 6538.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you cut that in half, if autonomous vehicles only killed 15,000 people a year,  that would be a plus, but it would surely look bad.

Start time: 6539.46
End time: 6545.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But again, I think there were people at Waymo who were just like,  we dodged a bullet, it wasn't us that did the first one.  Maybe.  Right.

Start time: 6546.54
End time: 6560.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the way in which Uber may have dodged a bullet here is there seems to have been some sort of fault  on the part of Elaine Hertzberg, who was tragically killed here.  But when you watch the video, she does seem to have, you know, jaywalked.

Start time: 6560.74
End time: 6580.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's not at the crosswalk. It's a dark night.  She's walking into the middle of four lanes of traffic in a 45-mile-an-hour zone.  You know, that's not the best behavior.  And yet, it seems to me now, and apparently many experts in this,  that this is the kind of thing in an autonomous vehicle that just should not happen to us.

Start time: 6596.02
End time: 6624.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And as Brad pointed out,  she was carrying a big metal black...  If you lighten up the picture so that you can actually see what's going on,  he says his line is, it certainly looks bad for Uber.  They had five seconds.  Yeah.  It's kind of hard to see because it's a dim video, but they had time.  And they should have seen it.  The lidar should have seen it.  And so, there's big questions.  We'll watch with that.

Start time: 6625.40
End time: 6632.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it seems to open up questions about what the safety drivers should be doing.  Not looking at her phone.  If in fact safety is why they're in there.

Start time: 6633.37

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I white-knuckle it.  When I Tesla, which, you know, it has autopilot, it's not autonomous.  It has autopilot. It's just a fancy cruise control.  But I got my hands on the wheel.  Tesla makes you keep your hands on the wheel.  I pay attention because one of the problems is when you're letting a car drive,  is you're not paying attention.  It takes you a few seconds just to figure out what's going on.  What's going on.  Not enough time to stop the vehicle.  So you need to be watching.

Start time: 6657.53
End time: 6676.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, this is it.  I mean, if you've got...  This is kind of what freaked people out when Google started testing their driverless cars  with no pedals or steering wheels.  And that's been kind of scaled back a bit.  But yeah, if you're going to have a safety driver in there,  they've got to be doing their job and making sure that it's as safe as it can be.  And that means sitting there with your hands on the wheel,  with your feet near or on the pedals.

Start time: 6677.84
End time: 6726.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I have to say, there's no reason why a car should not be driving a little slower  than a car with a human at the wheel.  I can get there 30 seconds later.  The Uber...  Brad says the Uber was traveling at what he calls the upper range of speeds  at which it's safe to drive non-freeway with just the LIDAR.  He calls it the valley of danger.  Uber knows it.  It's about as fast as you should go.  You can do it.  Even so, some cars like to go a bit slower approaching crosswalks, marked or not.  Using the LIDAR, their perception system should have a pretty good impression of her.  By 50 meters, 2.7 seconds.  And by then it should have at least hit the brakes.  It didn't.  Yeah.  Right.  So there's something going on.  There's more to this.  He says Uber needs to say why this did not happen.  Was the LIDAR turned off?

Start time: 6727.06
End time: 6744.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You do feel for the new CEO, Uber, because he's been faced with endless,  you know, with three or four big, big things that have come up.  Yeah, before you actually got here, we kind of did this thing.  It's a wee bit on the illegal side or it's a wee bit on the distasteful side.  And by all accounts, Daira Khosrow Shahi is a really good guy.

Start time: 6746.00
End time: 6764.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, solid bloke.  Yeah.  And in fact, according to the New York Times, he considered killing the self-driving program at Uber  when he became CEO and was convinced not to because, frankly,  it's the only way Uber makes any sense at all is if they don't have to pay drivers.  Because otherwise, there's just no way to make money.  Their business model doesn't work.

Start time: 6766.07
End time: 6783.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At the moment, I think it's something like 40 percent of the cost of an Uber ride  is covered by the venture capitalist who's funding the company.  And you can't burn through cash like that forever.  So they're desperate to make self-driving cars work.  And that does kind of, given Uber's record,  beg the question as to whether or not they cut corners at just the wrong time.

Transcript:  You've talked a lot about this on I Know This Week in Law and the issues with self-driving vehicles.  Who's responsible if an accident happens?  Is there a consensus?  Do we understand this well enough or is this still in flux?

Start time: 6794.41
End time: 6856.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's still in flux.  And I think this case is a really good example of how our negligence laws.  I've always kind of thought, oh, it might change everything, that it's a self-driving car.  But I think our negligence laws as they exist today are probably very well capable of handling this kind of incident.  Arizona is a comparative fault state.  So if this case were to be tried, the lawyers who represent Ms. Hertzberg have said they expect it to settle.  But if this case were to be tried, there would be evidence put in about the degree of fault that she had for having stepped out at that particular place and time.  And there would be an extensive investigation, just like there would be in any car accident,  as to the fault of the person or entity piloting the car.  So I think the evidence would look a little bit different.  But the liability equation would probably be something that our courts are used to dealing with.

End time: 6887.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that the negligence law at all has been, you know, modified to accommodate so that, oh, you have higher responsibilities.  If you're testing self-driving cars, that might be something that states think about in the wake of this.  And certainly if we had an example where it seemed like the victim was not at fault at all, where they're crossing in a crosswalk at a green light and they get smacked into.

Start time: 6888.26
End time: 6894.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 6894.10
End time: 6915.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would think so. Yeah. If there's no fault at all on the part of the pedestrian.  Does the safety driver, does that person have any?  The safety driver is protected, I think, by the virtue of their being an employee.  But if they're doing something they're not supposed to do.

And also just on a personal note, freeway driving over here is terrifying for a grip.  Because if you leave everybody's on the right, I don't understand that. What's going on?  There's that. But also if you leave a decent stopping distance in front of you with the car in front, two people try and cram themselves in.

They rehab real estate.  He's the CEO of a company formerly called Cloud Kitchens.  Of course, Travis has a little bit of money from the Uber thing.  And so he has sunk $150 million into it and buys out all the other investors.  And I think he's renaming it to City Storage Systems, which is not nearly as impressive as Cloud Kitchens.  But they focus on, I don't even know what this means, repurposing distressed real estate assets like parking lots or abandoned strip malls  and turning them into spaces suited for new industries such as food delivery or online retail.

What I didn't know is that there are 1600 files stored in that blockchain.  People have figured out a way to stick something in there. Of the files, at least eight were of sexual content, according to Aachen University, Germany, RWTH Aachen University.  One thought to be an image of child abuse and two that contain links to child abuse content.

Or I guess it's gone back down to $20 to do a Bitcoin transaction.  It's slow because, you know, it's a slow process. The proof of work is now using more power than the country of Poland.

Just search for the Twit channel on YouTube and you can watch us live on your big screen TV.  There are, of course, Twit apps for all the phones and devices. Lots of them out there.  Get one of those or come to our website, twit.tv slash live. Watch there.  You can also join us in the chat room. Nice people. Did I say Saturday? It's Sunday.  Did I say Saturday? It's Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time. I apologize. I hope I didn't confuse you.  Saturday we do the screensavers. Sunday we do Twit. Chat room is at irc.twit.tv.  And that's their job, is to keep me from saying the wrong day, among many others.  If you can't and if you want to be in studio, we love having in-studio visitors.  We've got Marie and we got Mike and we got Matt from Phoenix. Nice to have you. Please come say hi.  All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv. There's no charge. We'd love to have you.  If you can't be here in studio, if you can't watch live, don't worry. On demand.  It's a podcast, folks. On demand, always available audio and yes, video at twit.tv or wherever you get your podcast.  Just subscribe and that way you'll get each and every week.  Thank you, everybody, for being here and we'll see you next time. Another Twit is in the can.
