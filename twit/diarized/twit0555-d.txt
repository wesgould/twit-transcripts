Transcript:  It's time for twiT This Week in Tech.  Easter edition, I'm wearing bunny ears as you can tell.  Very distinguished bunny ears.  The blue sequined bunny ears.  We're joined today by Jason Snell,  who has taken time from his family,  much to their dismay, and I'm sorry, thank you.

Start time: 126.56
End time: 133.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I didn't say they were dismayed  that I couldn't be with them.  They said we had plans.  Just they had a thing and I'm not there.  See ya.  Yeah, that's more like it.  That's more like it.

Yes, absolutely.  So we will get some details on the new iPad Pro,  the new iPhone, also with us from Engadget,  Devendra Hardwar.  Good to see you, Devendra.  Thanks for joining us.  Hey, always cool to have you here, Leo.  Love having you on.  Devendra is also the podcast,  Filmcast podcast host, and we were talking earlier on,  because both you and Jason talk about movies  on your various podcasts about Superman versus Batman,  and you were quick to say, don't go see it.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, $170 million opening weekend.  $170 million, so I guess nobody's listening to you.

End time: 257.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I was actually, I decided to go down to Riverside.  We split the duties,  so some of my colleagues went to the event,  and then I opted to go down to the courthouse  in anticipation of the big Apple versus DOJ hearing  that I'm sure we'll talk about later.

Start time: 264.00
End time: 315.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh dear, oh dear.  Actually, I've been reading with great interest  your coverage of the Apple encryption debate  in the New York Times.  You've been doing a great job keeping us up  on what's going on.  In fact, you had an interesting dialogue  about what might happen on Wednesday,  none of which happened because at the last minute,  five o'clock on, I guess it was Monday, Tuesday,  five o'clock on Monday,  the Department of Justice said,  Hold on, wait a minute, hold on, your honor.  And I guess we'll find out April 5th  if the technique they think they've learned  to break the iPhone 5C owned by the terrorist  in the San Bernardino shootings will work.  Somebody came, what happened, Katie?  Somebody came forward and said, I think I can help?

Start time: 315.96
End time: 339.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so the timeline is that on Sunday,  somebody approached the FBI  and gave them a demonstration of a method.  And the FBI thought it was promising enough  that on Monday, they called the DOJ  and they spent all morning  having these phone calls and meetings.  And then they alerted Apple.  And then they filed to the court saying,  we'd like to postpone the hearing  and got on the phone with the judge and with Apple  and explained what was going on.

Start time: 340.28
End time: 352.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So some have said that the company that came to them  on Sunday was an Israeli firm called Celebrite.  Is that credible? Yes, that's the rumor.  That's the rumor.

Start time: 353.48
End time: 415.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the reason why I am not quite sure  that I would jump onto that wholeheartedly  is that if you look through all of the court filings  in this case, the DOJ actually filed a brief  from one of the FBI's own technology specialists  saying that they'd already tried using tools  made by Celebrite and that they didn't work.  So unless Celebrite has come out  with something completely new,  I just don't see it happening.  And Celebrite is used often by the government.  They're used by the DEA all of the time.  There was a filing that actually came out last February  showing that the DEA was using Celebrite  to open up several phones.  So it would be really, really strange  if Celebrite's just now coming into this months after  they've attempted to open the phone.  The shooting happened in December  and they started trying to open up that phone basically.  And so that Celebrite wouldn't enter the picture  until March seems really odd  given the fact that the DEA contracted  to have them open phones in February.

Start time: 416.52
End time: 422.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Celebrite on its website says,  "'We can crack iOS 8 phones,'  but this was an iOS 9 updated 5C."

Start time: 423.66
End time: 442.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, this has been great advertising for Celebrite.  It sure has.  It's just like, did they leak this themselves  to the Israeli media?  Because I'm sure that one of the stories,  because nobody in the US has confirmed it, I think.  I'm pretty sure that everybody has only been citing  this Israeli newspaper report again and again and again,  saying that that's Celebrite.

Start time: 442.72
End time: 468.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Celebrite made, if I'm not mistaken,  I seem to remember they made a device,  a physical hardware device,  that was widely used by law enforcement for years.  If you got pulled over by a police officer  with probable cause, he could request your phone,  plug it into the Celebrite device,  it would draw all the data off the phone in a minute  and give it back to you.  So this is something they've been doing  for some, since the late 90s.

Start time: 470.56
End time: 474.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so it seems strange again,  that they just remember they have this company.

Start time: 474.22
End time: 491.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you could imagine that maybe they've said,  well, we didn't have a way to do it in iOS 9,  let's get our team working on it.  And maybe they discovered something on Saturday.  I mean, that's not an impossible scenario.  It's hard for me to talk about this with bunny ears on.  I mean, it's a little bit more serious than that.

Start time: 491.78
End time: 493.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like the Easter-Rodan thing.  It's man to be taken seriously.

Start time: 495.02
End time: 509.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wrote an article in the Times, Katie,  suggesting that it's Apple's policy on bugs  that explains why instead of going to Apple,  a company like Celebrite might go to the FBI.  Apple doesn't pay for bugs.

Start time: 510.52
End time: 558.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, they don't pay at all.  So it's tricky, I don't wanna overstate that  because even the top bounty offered right now,  and I think it's by Google, is only $100,000,  which is not very much money in the grand scheme of things,  given how much people will pay on the black market for bugs.  But because there's so many people always looking  for possible exploits in Android and other systems,  there are just more eyeballs on the problem.  And so the value of the exploits are lower,  supply and demand.  So there aren't as many people always.  So because Apple wasn't encouraging people with money  to come out and say,  find whatever it is you can in our operating system  and we'll pay you and we'll reward you  and we'll feature you, et cetera, et cetera.  A really robust black market  sort of sprung up around Apple.  So that's great.

Start time: 559.06
End time: 580.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Apple, I understand Apple's point of view,  which is, it's like, you don't negotiate with terrorists,  you don't pay hackers for bugs,  but Google and Facebook do it  and they opened up their pocketbook quite wide.  On the other hand, as you pointed out in your article,  last fall, Zerodium offered a million dollars,  a million dollar bounty for an iOS 9 exploit.  So-

Start time: 581.14
End time: 586.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's almost like Apple can't even compete at this point.  Well, they could.  What are they going to do, offer a million?  They could.  They could, they could.

Start time: 586.32
End time: 594.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got more money than Bill Gates,  but I can see why they don't wanna get  in this kind of escalating marketplace of bugs  because a million bucks is a lot of money.

Start time: 595.12
End time: 607.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Whereas the FBI, I mean,  whereas the government will pay for bugs  and the head of the NSA has talked about the fact  that the government does buy these exploits  and that they don't have to reveal all of them  after they've purchased them.

Start time: 607.28
End time: 619.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's the problem, right?  If Apple finds out, they'll fix it.  If the NSA finds out, they'll make sure  it's best they can that Apple never fixes it  because that's a great tool.  So what happens April 5th?

Start time: 621.76
End time: 675.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they have until the DOJ has until April 5th  to say whether or not the FBI has been able  to open up the phone.  And if they have been able to open up the phone,  everyone's pretty certain the government's going to move  to somehow classify what they did  so that we can never know how it happened  and they will drop this order.  They'll say, no need to order Apple to do anything for us.  We don't need them anymore.  So it's a great outcome if you want the phone open  and it's a great outcome if you don't want Apple  to be forced to build something against its will  to help weaken its own security system.  It's a terrible outcome if you wanna know  what the flaw was and it's a terrible outcome also  because it delays a fight that's inevitably  going to happen between the government  and some large technology company over what the government  can force a private corporation to do  in order to help with an investigation.

Start time: 676.16
End time: 696.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Devendra, does the Department of Justice kind of taking,  putting this on the back burner,  give lie to the notion that this wasn't really  about that phone at all but was about establishing  a precedent that they could go to Apple  or some other company and demand revised firmware?  Because that's what I thought.  I thought, they handpicked this case for a precedent.

Start time: 696.84
End time: 725.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, I mean, it's a big case.  It's a very high profile case just seeing  what happened with everything.  But there are conspiracy theories going around that,  yeah, maybe the FBI could have delayed this  or announced this potential fix a long time ago,  maybe not wait till the last minute  because there's a lot of value if they were able  to force Apple to kind of do what they wanted.  But we don't have anything to prove that basically.  It's just right now there's so much we don't know.  There's so much like, yeah,  there's a lot of subterfuge going on here.

Start time: 725.48
End time: 757.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And those holes lend themselves to conspiracy theories.  I can think of new scenarios where perhaps the DOJ  realized their case was weak,  that Kalia would cause the judge Sherry Pym to say,  well, there's a law against Apple writing  its custom firmware for you, so no,  I'm gonna deny your case.  Maybe she hinted to the DOJ,  I'm gonna rule against you tomorrow,  so guys, maybe you don't want this ruling.  That's another, and I should say that's conspiracy theory  because we have no information at all.

Start time: 757.82
End time: 774.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is, but yeah, speaking of conspiracy theories,  like Snowden did talk about,  it's funny, a couple of weeks before this happened,  Edward Snowden mentioned that, yeah,  there is probably other ways that the FBI could do this  and they're just not being very truthful about it right now.  So it's funny to see him being proven right  on Twitter for once.

Start time: 774.76
End time: 813.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you saw the letter to the editor  that James Comey, the director of the FBI,  wrote to the Wall Street Journal.  He was pissed at the notion that we,  you are simply wrong to assert that the FBI  and the Justice Department lied about our ability  to access the San Bernardino killer's phone.  I would have thought that you,  as advocates of market forces,  would realize the impact of the San Bernardino litigation.  This is the funniest thing I've ever read.  It stimulated creative people around the world  to see what they might be able to do to unlock the phone.  And I'm not embarrassed to admit  that all technical creativity  does not reside in government.  Lots of folks came to us with ideas, including John McAfee.

Start time: 813.82
End time: 823.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love that line.  I love that line because it's like,  anybody did assume that all of the creative,  technological talent existed within government.  Like, what is he talking about?

Start time: 823.64
End time: 824.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one assumed that.

Start time: 824.64
End time: 832.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, he wasn't wrong though.  He wasn't wrong that,  so usually these cases are filed under seal  and we don't even know they're happening.

Start time: 832.90
End time: 837.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple wanted it to be filed under seal.  There was some reason the DOJ said,  no, no, we're doing this in public.

Start time: 840.19
End time: 870.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and often these cases are filed under seal.  And we don't, we like, the ACLU has a FOIA request out  looking for all, asking for all the docket numbers  where the government has under seal.  Some could say that's synonymous with secretly,  but under seal asked a technology company  to do something for it  so that we can figure out what's going on.  And I think that if this had been filed under seal,  yeah, there's, we wouldn't have known  and these companies wouldn't have come out the,  out of the woodwork to help the FBI.  Oh, really?  Because we wouldn't know.

Start time: 870.52
End time: 871.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we just wouldn't know.

Start time: 871.52
End time: 876.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We would have no idea.  These are almost, like these are almost always under seal.  You just don't know about them.

Start time: 876.36
End time: 896.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right, well enough about that.  We'll find out April 5th, whether,  and by the way, the FBI kind of said, no, no,  it wasn't celebrate.  So we don't know who helped them.  Could have been for all we know,  could have been John McAfee.  Maybe he was lying about lying.  Maybe he was telling the truth all along.  That would be the double bluff.  The double bluff, the bluff within the bluff.

Start time: 897.21
End time: 924.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's crazy like a fox.  He was also crazy.  And like crazy and crazy.  I ran into him at CES this year and that was crazy.  Really, did you?  I did, yeah.  He's a-  Was he wearing a shirt?  He was wearing a shirt, yes.  No booze, no guns from what I could see.  But yeah, he's backing this startup  that has like a little key dongle  that'll like unlock your phone or computer  if it's like near it.  And it's the dumbest idea because it's super insecure,  but McAfee is backing it, so.

Start time: 925.06
End time: 933.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just wave your phone at the, if you're a bad guy,  just wave your phone at the guy you steal the phone from.  Exactly.  Before you run away.  There you go.  That's a nice picture.

Start time: 933.26
End time: 950.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's such a great photo.  Yeah.  But I got to do a video interview with John McAfee  and that was kind of terrifying  because I just saw him get increasingly angry  as I kind of pushed him about,  because he has crazy libertarian beliefs.  He was running for president also,  which yeah, nobody will take seriously.  So yeah, it's just funny.

Start time: 951.52
End time: 977.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think he's pulling the double McAfee.  That's what I-  That's, but this, actually there's a point in saying that,  which is that conspiracies theories,  this is the nature of them, that they fill the gaps.  When you know nothing, you can say almost anything  and none of it is provable or disprovable.  So really there's nothing we should,  the smartest thing to do would be  just say nothing and wait and see.  But I do like-  So that's our show for today.  Thank you.

Tim Cook, master of ceremonies, didn't do a lot of,  he did, as we expected, make a statement  about the Apple DOJ case.  I thought quite a good statement.  He said, we didn't expect to be in a position  of fighting our government, but we think for our nation,  note the difference, this is the best thing  for our customers and our nation.  And it would be, it's our responsibility to fight this  and I can't disagree with him.

Start time: 1125.82
End time: 1144.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they could have tossed it off a little bit.  They could have made a jokey aside about privacy  and security and the audience would laugh  and they could move on and they decided,  no, no, we're not gonna do that.  That's not Tim. We're gonna do it head on.  Yeah, exactly, I think maybe that might have been  a Steve Jobs move to just sort of do that head fake  and then move on, but Tim Cook, he laid it out there.

Start time: 1144.48
End time: 1158.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, yeah, I think you really see Tim Cook  in this event.  I mean, it started with that, then they immediately talk  about HealthKit and, actually before that,  they had recycling, right?  They got a woman executive on the stage.

Transcript:  That's cool, I mean, I wonder what your job interview  is at Apple when they say, we'd like you to work at Apple  and build hardware and you're like, all right,  I finally made it.  Well, we actually want you to build a robot  that disassembles phones.

Start time: 1188.04

Start time: 1191.58
End time: 1215.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, I think that's some of the speculation  that I've heard is that there's always the question,  like, what is Apple doing?  We know things like Apple builds its own chips  for designs and builds its own chips  or has them built for them,  but they don't take something off the shelf.  Is it that far to speculate that they might at some point  build machinery to build their products  and control that part of their business too?  It's not unreasonable.

End time: 1238.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true, well, I mean, it would create new issues  just in the same way that the robots in the auto industry  created new issues where it changed what the jobs were  and there were fewer of them,  but it could certainly change the nature of factory jobs  in China if there were more automated assembly  of the products.

Transcript:  I haven't been there, but I think all of these things  are less robotic, I think, than you think they're gonna be.  There's more hand-crafting, hand-tooling of tech products  when they're being assembled than you might think.  I think we all imagine, I always imagine  that it's just all robots and it's extruded  and put in a box, and that's not the case.  Even in the US factories, I think that's not the case.

Transcript:  Iron ore in one end of the factory  and iPhones come out the other end of the factory.  That was actually Henry Ford's dream.  And he built a plant, the Rouge plant,  the whole idea was box cars would arrive with lumber  and iron ingots, and then Model T  would come out the other end.  I don't think we're anywhere near that  with these kinds of products.  So after that, they talked about HealthKit  and the new CareKit, which is an interesting,  again, I feel like these are marginal products  for the iPhone, but they're Tim Cook Cares products.

Transcript:  Well, they're more about what Apple wants you to see  as their corporate values than they are about selling,  directly selling products.  I mean, in the end, it's all PR.  In the end, it's a PR event.  But at the same time, I also do believe  that these are things Apple considers to be important  and part of its corporate values.  So they want to take the time every so often,  maybe once a year at an event like this  to highlight some of this stuff,  like what they did last year with ResearchKit  and what they're doing this year with CareKit.  And it's great stuff.

Start time: 1321.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CareKit's interesting because it is a way  for your physician to supervise your care  or use the iPhone to kind of monitor your condition.  I would love to see more of that.  But again, a lot of this stuff isn't gonna happen  for right away.  The FDA's gotta approve it.  It's gotta get into the market.  There's other companies making these things, not Apple.  Apple's just providing a hub for them, right?

Transcript:  Right, but it is, I think, as a platform owner,  it's sort of on Apple and on Google  and any platform owner to do some of this groundwork  because otherwise, maybe it'll never happen.  And so, you know, good for them  to take the reins here and do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  So there were lots of rumors about it  maybe having sort of iPhone 6 style curved glass on the front.  And the most recent rumors right before the event  were that it was gonna be a dead ringer for the iPhone 5S.  So I brought my iPhone 5S with me to the event  and I took some pictures.  And was it?  They are identical.  No kidding.  So if you look at the black homes of technology,  you can look at the little chamfered edges,  which are those little sort of like side carved out things  and they're matte on the SE  and they're shiny on the iPhone 5S.  And then the silk screen on the back that says iPhone,  says iPhone SE on the new one.  But otherwise, it's just the same.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I could make the argument  that the iPhone 5 is a pretty nice design  and why create some kind of like half one,  half another kind of phone if the iPhone 5 design is nice.  I do wonder, for me, the big question is,  was this a decision made because somebody said,  actually the iPhone 5S is pretty, let's just leave it there.  Or was it more like it's cheap?  Let's just do it this way.

Transcript:  It is no different than the iPhone 5S.  Other than those little tiny touches on the outside.  6S guts.  On the inside, it is almost entirely an iPhone 6S.  It's not like, not even the 6.  It is what is currently the top of the line.  The processor is top of the line.  The camera is top of the line.  The rear facing camera.  Yeah, I think we all thought  that maybe it would be a step back.  And ultimately it will.  They probably won't update this phone for a couple of years.  But for the moment, if you get this,  with the exception of slightly,  the first generation Touch ID sensor,  and the fact that it doesn't have any 3D Touch.  But otherwise, it's basically an iPhone 6S  in that little case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it you, were we talking about the,  I can't remember if it was you or it was Renee Ritchie  who said it almost certainly would have to have 3D Touch.  That's part of the user interface going forward.  And yet it's not there.  It's not there.

End time: 1513.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, I had a good conversation at the event  with a couple of people  and we were talking about 3D Touch  and the feeling like nobody uses it enough.  And that almost what Apple needs to do  is make it a more central part.  Like commit to the fact that a long press  and a 3D Touch are exactly the same.  So that, because right now you can't make things  count on 3D Touch because so many iOS devices

End time: 1554.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's more kind of out of,  these kind of out of the field applications  instead of it being central to the product.  Yeah, that's too bad.  It also probably would have been tough for them  to fit in the 3D Touch hardware into that case too.  Cause we saw what happened with the iPhone success.  It got a little bit thicker.  It got a little bit heavier  because of all the stuff they had to put in there.  And this is like an upgrade  with the least amount of effort and work put in.  We got the cases, we got the hardware.  It's just put it together.  We got the screens.  Yeah, and if that's a deal breaker, I think,  that if you really are gonna need to do more work  in order to get 3D Touch in there,  well, let's not do it.  Because we really wanna fit it in this old hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's basically the same screen as the 5S.  Is it?  Oh, interesting.  I think that's one of the things  that hasn't changed about it.  It's the old screen, so it's not as bright  and it doesn't have as much color range as the 6S.

Start time: 1568.42
End time: 1601.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's old parts on the outside  and mostly new parts on the inside.  But if you think about it,  Apple always wanted to have a four inch phone  in their lineup and the 5S is too old now.  So now you've got one that does Apple Pay.  I think that's a big one.  It has NFC in the back.  And it's not being priced higher than the 5S was.  It actually is taking the spot in the product line  of the iPhone 5S and it has the same price.  So this is not a brand new iPhone at a premium price.  This is a brand new guts in a product  that is essentially priced like  the two year old phone was priced.

Transcript:  They said that in the last year, I did the math,  it's something between 10 and 15% of all the iPhones  they sold in the last year were the four inch phones,  were essentially like the 5S.  It was over 30 million.  30 million was the number.  But if you think about it that way,  if almost 15% of the phones they sold  was a two and a half year old phone,  or a two year old phone,  what are they gonna do with that in the next year?  Probably it's 15 or 20% of the iPhones they sell  will be this phone.  And it's not gonna be their biggest selling phone,  but that's a big market.  And I think in some more price sensitive countries,  they've talked about this being a good phone for China,  a good phone for India.  But I think throughout the world,  there is a segment of people who want an iPhone,  but don't wanna spend on the super high end.  And there are people who want a smaller phone  because they just don't like the size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I definitely hear from a lot of people that,  yeah, they're never gonna upgrade to an iPhone 6 or 6S  because it's so much bigger than the 5S and 5W.  And honestly, after using a 6 and 6S  for the past couple of years,  I miss that feeling of the 5S.  It just feels really good in your hand.  It's so small.  And to me, the idea of having technology that's powerful,  that's smaller, that's where cell phones were going  before the iPhone and the Galaxy Note  and everything made screens bigger.  I remember I had Sony Ericsons  that were getting smaller and smaller  and I was amazed by that.  So there's definitely a segment of the population  who'd be into this.  And tech nerds are really, have locked onto this idea  that bigger is always better for smartphones.  And I think that a lot of the general population  doesn't think that way.

Transcript:  Oh, that's very funny.  The whole story is fantastic,  but I think a lot of the general population  hasn't even left the iPhone 5S.  They're still using it.  And we see that in Apple's phone numbers  when they report that there are a lot of people  still using the 5S.  So I don't think that,  I mean, for me, I'm using the iPhone 6  that I've been borrowing from Apple  and then they're going to take back  the minute I stop covering.  Uh-oh.  So there's that.  Which is fine because they wanted me to learn  how to use 3D Touch.  So thank you, Apple.  That was very nice of you.  The loaner will return.  So that's a 6S.  This is a 6S and it's fantastic,  but I still have the 5S.  That's my personal phone.  It's so funny because I sent my son,

So the first day, and he was so embarrassed,  he called me up, he said he got rolled by some gypsies.  But then I found out the truth was he was dancing  and it fell out of his pocket.  So I sent him a new one, a 6S,  and he doesn't want to use it.  He says, I think I have a 4S in the house,  can you find it and send it to me?  He wants the little old phone.

And it's also the only phone in that size,  like a four-inch phone with premium hardware, right?  Exactly.  The newest hardware.  Sony has an Android phone from last year, I think,  a small version of their Z6  or one of their most recent models.  It's nice, it's all right,  but that was your only option up until this point.  So phones are getting too big.  I'm tired of giant phones.  I don't like phablets.  The iPhone, I'd like to go up to maybe five inches  and just stay there if they can refine the case.  But yeah, we gotta get smaller phones better.  That's kind of where we need to go at this point.

I don't know if this is something you've experienced,  but once I got the larger phone,  I could watch TV and stuff really comfortably,  things that I didn't do with my old phone,  but that I would have wanted to do with an iPad.

Transcript:  Or if you read Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8.  Oh yeah.  We'll talk about that rumor in a little bit too,  but first I wanna talk about my ding-dong doorbell.  Everybody oughta have a good doorbell.  Usually you don't.  You notice that?  You get a new house.  Everything's been replaced except the old doorbell,  which is practically hanging off two wires on the door jam.  It's yellowed with age.  You press it.  Maybe this is just me.  And then the chime in the house goes bonk  and you can barely hear it.  I can never hear my doorbell.  So when Ring came along with this, I jumped on it.  I was really happy to get my Ring Video doorbell.  By the way, they also sell a chime  that ties into the doorbell via WiFi  and can plug in anywhere.  You could have multiple chimes in the house.  But the thing to me that was great about the Ring  is it not only rings the, you know,  you replace your old doorbell  and it not only rings the official chime in your house,  but it rings your phone and your tablet,  whatever else you install the Ring software on.  Even better than that, it does that wherever you are,  across the world even.  In fact, I always have to remember  when I get to the studio to turn off my phone  because the ring chime goes off  as people go in and out of my house.  It isn't just ringing the doorbell.  But when people do ring the doorbell,  there's a microphone and a speaker in here  and a camera, an HD camera.  So you can see, here it is,  you can see the person at your door  and you can talk to them.  And you know, you can say, hey, I'm in the bathtub.  Could you just leave the package there or whatever?  It also has a motion detector  and you can completely control its sensitivity  and where it's aimed.  So you can see when somebody comes up on your step,  whether they ring your doorbell or not,  you can talk to them.  It's kind of a great home security system.  Turns out 95% of all home robberies  happen during the day.  When you're at work, burglars come,  they ring the doorbell.  If you don't answer, they go around back and break in.  Now you'll answer, even if you are at work.  And even if you don't answer,  you got a nice crystal clear video of them.  It's lovely.  With the Ring Video Doorbell,  you could talk to delivery people.  You can keep an eye on your package  when they leave it there.  If someone tries to mess with it,  you get an instant alert and HD video of the whole thing.  I love my Ring Video Doorbell.  And by the way, if you've got teenagers,  there's nothing like,  hey, I see you came home at three in the morning.  No, no, what are you talking about?  No, I didn't.  I've got the video to prove it.  It's easy to install.  I'm no handyman, but the Ring Kit  comes with everything you need.  Drill bit, screwdriver.  You probably won't need the drill bit.  In most cases, you just take off the old doorbell  and attach it.  It even has a level.  They come in a variety of finishes to match your house.  And this has a battery in it.  So even if you don't have a wired doorbell,  you can use the Ring Video Doorbell.  Or put it in places where you'd like a doorbell,  but none exists.  Like your bedroom door.  That's my next project.  You never knock.  Now you have to ring the doorbell.  Ring.com slash twit.  You'll get free expedited FedEx shipping.  Try the doorbell, the Time Magazine, and USA Today  named one of their top 10 gadgets of the year.  Ring.com slash twit.  With Ring, you're always home.

Start time: 2248.80
End time: 2268.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think what they're doing is they're moving to something  that's a more laptop-like naming system for the iPad.  So just like you've got a 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro  and a 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro,  I think we are going to, from now on, have the-  iPad Pros.  I wish the numbers were better.  I wish you could call them like the 10 and the 13 iPad,  because that's essentially what these are.

Transcript:  I assume that at some point,  the cheaper models of iPad are going to either just be  iPad Air and iPad Mini, or they'll just call them iPad.  Big, medium, small.  And have a small iPad and a medium iPad.  And maybe the Mini will be the small.  Exactly, right.  Maybe the Mini and the Air will just become the iPads,  and then these will be the iPad Pros.  I kind of don't see the point of the Air line anymore,  though, right?  If this is, it's pretty much the same weight,  same width and everything.  It's not physically any more, like more of an iPad.  So it's all about the hardware.  So I don't see how they can do an iPad Air 3 at some point.

Start time: 2309.46
End time: 2310.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what would be the difference?

Start time: 2311.30
End time: 2348.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the difference is it'll be a couple hundred dollars  less than the iPad Pro.  This is a hundred bucks more than the Air.  So the way Apple differentiates iPhones on price  is they roll down the old models, right?  Although now we've got the SE that's also down there.  On Macs, they don't do that.  On Macs, they differentiate on different specs.  So I feel like that's where they're going with the iPad,  is that eventually there's gonna be a cheaper iPad line,  and it's gonna be the older hardware,  and it's going to be updated less frequently,  but it's gonna be cheaper.  And then the iPad Pro line is where all  the cutting edge stuff is gonna be.  That's, I think, where they're going with this,  but they're in transition right now.  We haven't seen what happens next  for the cheaper old iPads.

Transcript:  This is the sweet spot.  This is the classic iPad size.  The original iPad was 9.7.  All the iPad Air models were 9.7 inches diagonal.  And this picks up all of those,  well, almost all of the features of the 12.9 inch iPad Pro,  and actually has at least one,  actually two features, I think,  that are not in the iPad Pro, which is kind of weird.  If you imagine Rich Uncle Moneybags  walking into an Apple store and saying,  give me your finest iPad with all of the finest features,  they wouldn't be able to do it,  because some of the-  So what's new in the little one?  So the little one, it's got pencil support.  It's got support for the smart connector,  so it's got its own little cover  that comes with its own fold-out keyboard,  although it can't be full-sized, like on the 13 inch model.

Transcript:  Did you try the new keyboard?  Yeah. Does it feel okay?

Start time: 2404.02
End time: 2419.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels just like the other one,  except all the keys are a little bit smaller.  A little cramped?  So if you're a super finicky touch typist,  you'll have some problems, probably,  because all the keys are smaller.  But for most people, it's probably fine,  and it's a lot less bulky, because it's smaller.  It's a lot less bulky than on the 13 inch iPad Pro.

Start time: 2422.70
End time: 2432.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better camera, and it's got the True Tone feature  that has not been in any iOS device before,  which dynamically changes the color of your screen  based on the lighting in your room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked Alex Lindsay, who's a pro,  as he uses good quality screens for photography and video,  if that was a selling point.  He liked it, but I wonder.  I mean, I feel like pros are as much concerned  about color accuracy and about the lighting in the room.  That's more important to them than a screen  that might change its color,  depending on the lighting in the room.  That's kind of unpredictable.

Start time: 2459.42
End time: 2471.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want color stability, you turn off the feature.  It's a switch in the settings.  But if you're sitting and reading-  Who's this for, then?  Well, I mean, the Pro comes in different styles,  and you're not always using it for pro video editing,  let's say.

Transcript:  Well, if you're sitting, I've experienced this.  It's late at night, I'm sitting reading on my iPad  in incandescent light room.  Everything is really warmly lit,  and the white point on my iPad screen  is this super blue bright screen.  And instead, the white point would match the white point  in my room and in my vision,  and it would actually feel a lot more natural.  I think this is a bigger feature  than the Night Shift feature.  Night Shift does somewhat of the same thing.  Which does a similar thing,  but it just sort of shifts all the color automatically.  This is gonna shift the color temperature  based on where you are and what the light is like.  All right, you convinced me.

Start time: 2507.12
End time: 2510.24

Start time: 2523.92
End time: 2541.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I hate it.  I mean, people holding up at concerts,  God, it's just really annoying.  You're watching a concert,  and somebody's taking a picture with their freaking iPad.  But at the same time, you understand why.  It's a great viewfinder.  You see the picture, it's real size.  And for video, and it can do 4K now.

Start time: 2543.46
End time: 2571.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the color gamut on the screen is amazing.  I do think, I was talking to somebody  who is a video kind of hobbyist,  and they said that they can imagine  the iPad Pro being used on camera rigs,  because it shoots 4K video,  and it's a huge, right there, you can see it.  You don't need a separate viewfinder.  Nice and big and bright, yeah.  What it doesn't have is more,  it doesn't have the four gigs of RAM  that the big iPad Pro has,  and the processor's not quite as fast.  So it's got some issues.  This bothers me.

Start time: 2571.44
End time: 2573.80

Transcript:  Well, it may be that they looked at the, they looked,  yeah, it could be the cost.  It could be that the size of the screen,  there's less oomph that it needs  in terms of its graphics power and all that.  I don't know, it is disappointing.  I wish that it had four.

Start time: 2595.90
End time: 2604.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has shared graphics memory.  So I think so.  So the display would use some RAM.  So you're freeing up a little bit, not a huge amount.  It's a few million pixels worth of space.

Start time: 2605.70
End time: 2618.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, it is, I mean, keeping in mind,  the iPad Air 2, when it came out with two gigs of RAM,  was the first, I believe, iOS device to have two  instead of one.  It, two helps a lot.  So it's not a deal breaker, but a four is awfully nice.

Start time: 2619.24

Start time: 2623.94

Start time: 2625.66
End time: 2633.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and then the big Pro model has four.  But it's a little disappointing.  There's no doubt about it.  Again, that's one of those top of the line features  that you can't get on the 9.7 inch iPad Pro.

Start time: 2634.16
End time: 2645.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much just a couple of gigs of memory cost?  It's not a huge amount.  And you're charging a hundred bucks more for this iPad.  Yeah.  It just bothers me that they did that.  Almost was a deal breaker for me.  I think the killer feature is the pencil.

Start time: 2646.64
End time: 2656.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Just because it's a smaller thing.  Not everybody wants a huge thing,  but a lot of people I talk to wanted a new iPad  that would use the pencil.  And so this will do it,  and you don't have to get the 13 inch iPad to get it.

Start time: 2656.48
End time: 2670.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're spending 600 bucks minimum for,  what is it, 32 gig.  You're probably gonna want 120 or 256.  Plus a hundred bucks for the pencil.  Plus a hundred sixty bucks,  a hundred fifty bucks for the keyboard.

Transcript:  If you want that keyboard cover, yeah, sure.  The Apple store is ready to flash, Leo.  I like the SMH.  SMH.  SMH.  SMH.  But I think you said it right before Leo,  like about the lighting feature,  but really this iPad, who is it for?  I don't quite know.  Like somebody who just wants to have a light iPad  that they can take around and type occasionally on.  They can get an iPad Air 2 now for what, 400 bucks.  Get a keyboard.  Logitech makes some great keyboards  for far less than Apple does.  And then, you know, a real pro user  would want maybe that bigger screen  and that faster processor.  So they're gonna go to the bigger model.  I don't quite know who would really want the smaller one.  Yeah.

Start time: 2710.54
End time: 2735.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's people- Have you guys seen  any apps come out yet that would,  so this is the way I always thought of it.  Like they're waiting for app makers  to make this a really usable business product.  So they want this to be a product for hospitals  or for architects or whatnot.  And Apple's not going to make that software.  It's going to be the app community.  Have we seen any apps come out  that make this iPad so essential?  Or is it, you know, I guess that's the question.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's lots of little niches.  I mean, the art stuff on the iPad Pro with a pencil  has already sort of gotten a boost.  And I would imagine this is a much more,  because it's cheaper and more portable  and more familiar in terms of size.  I think that it's going to be very popular  with anyone who wants to draw on, you know,  draw on their iPad or take notes on their iPad.  It's a much more realistic size  than the big iPad Pro for a lot of people.  You can actually hold it in one hand  and draw with the other,  which you can't with the big iPad Pro.

Start time: 2767.58
End time: 2779.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the size and weight of the Pro made it  so that it wasn't really a laptop replacement.  If you had a MacBook,  you'd be better off just using the MacBook  than bundling a big keyboard and pencil  and your iPad Pro and your MacBook.

Start time: 2812.02
End time: 2857.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good question.  I think they'll get a little bit of a boost  because I think one of the reasons iPad sales  have been flat to down is they last,  like you don't need to replace them every year or two.  They're fine.  They last a long time.  So I think there's a group of people  who have been waiting for, and I've heard from them,  waiting for a new regular-sized iPad,  and there hasn't been one since the fall of 2014.  So now there is.  So those people, I think, will be happy  and they'll sell a lot of this.  I think this will be the best-selling iPad  of all the models in the price list, but I don't know-  It's more expensive than the last big iPad.  It's $100 more expensive.  But I think it'll do okay,  but I don't think it's going to change the fortunes  of the iPad as a whole.  I think it's a real mystery  about where average iPad sales are going to end up.  So you, unlike Phil Schiller,

Start time: 2896.34

Transcript:  You're never too old to wear the blue jeans, man.  In the untucked shirt.  He actually looks kind of sad in that picture, actually.  The point is the old PCs can be replaced,  and then most people,  or a lot of people who bought a computer  are not needing it for super technical or powerful things.  They just want web and email.  And my mom gave up her laptop and went to an iPad  because that's all she really wanted to do  was web and email,  and she didn't need a whole big computer for that.  I get where this comes from,  but it comes across as being,  Apple egging people on to just, yes, buy, buy more things.  Buy more things.  It's sad if you don't buy more computers,  and it's not cool.

Is that you touted the shopping list  of now I bought the keyboard cover,  and I bought this and I bought that,  and I upgraded the RAM and all the,  I upgraded the storage, all of those things.  That is a perception of Apple that is true.  That they don't sell cheap products  and they sell lots of accessories  and you end up spending a lot of money with them.  But when you have that perception,  it's a lot harder to stand on stage and say,  oh, it's so sad that people buy a computer  and then hold onto it for five whole years.  It's not good.

What they're doing with Windows 10  is actually pretty interesting,  and even though it looks a lot like older Windows,  like the idea of the unified apps is finally happening,  maybe they'll have a mobile platform,  but at least Windows on tablets,  like using the Surface devices, that's really interesting.  It's weird to me, like looking at OS X right now,  it doesn't look that much different  than it did 15 years ago.  I know the features are better,  I know certain things are better,  but you look at it and you don't see that progress,

And the Mac comes along for the ride  and they do some things there,  but is there gonna be a replacement for OS X?  Well, yeah, there is, it's iOS,  and they're gonna keep developing it and iterating there,  but it seems unlikely that they would do a new project  to do the third generation of fundamental OS X interface  or Mac OS interface.  It just seems unlikely to me.

Amazon did an interesting thing.  They've released the Echo software.  I think they put it on GitHub.  And so you can take a Raspberry Pi  and turn it into an Echo, just add a microphone.  The only thing you can't do is it doesn't have  the always on thing.  But that wouldn't be so hard to create  a trigger system of some kind.  Very interesting.  What that shows is Amazon isn't really intending  to make the Echo be a product.  This is a platform, if you ask me.  A global, universal interface.

His wife Jessica Lesson does the information.  I think she worked at the Wall Street Journal  for a long time.  He's got a new startup called Fin, F-I-N dot com.  And it's about a voice interface primarily for the Echo.

Transcript:  The idea is to use something like the Echo  to create the operating system  that we saw in the movie Her.  Yes, exactly.  And this is where we're going,  so it's not just the end of the desktop operating system  as we know it.  It's this idea of using bots  to create a more naturalistic way to interact with machines.  And if you think about all the things that you do  on your laptop or on your computer, or even on your phone,  if you could just talk to your phone,  and I think we can agree Siri's not really there yet,  if you could just talk to your phone  and say naturalistically, which is what Sam's trying to do,  hey, could you schedule me a lunch on Thursday with Sarah  and remind me to pick up milk tonight after work?  And can you send me a quick text message  with all the things I need to do in the next three hours?  You wouldn't even, the typing goes away.  The typing goes away for almost everything.  They're just tiny instances where you need it.  So Amazon, and I know it's shocking  that they created this hardware  because all of their hardware has been so terrible,  but they have so much consumer behavior data.  They know everything from,  because I use Amazon Prime for so many things,  so I'll just use myself as an example.  They know when I need paper towels,  and they know the sorts of things that I shop for.  They can already make all the connections  that my brain has made.  If I'm surfing for X product  that I jump to the next three things,  they've made all those connections.  They kind of have a profile of me already.  And so then if the last thing they need  to really understand me is my voice interaction  and voice command for the music I want  or the podcasts or the recipes  or the times that I'm in the kitchen using the timer,  they have a more complete picture of me  than in many ways, or as a complete picture of me  as Apple does.  And they just happen to have that bigger vision right  for how we're going to interact with machines in the future.  And they got the voice technology right.  Right.

Transcript:  Scary time.  Hide your bunny ears.  17 charts that show you just how scary  Amazon's $275 billion business really is.  And once you see these charts, you kind of say,  oh, oh, oh my God, Amazon.  So first of all, when they went public in 97,  their stock was $18 a share, $675 a share.  That's Apple-like multiples, right?  Not quite, but close.  But what's really interesting,  and the stock market I think has grasped this,  is their income is basically as close to zero  as you can get.  It's like, Jeff, if you look at this graph,  the orange line is revenue, is not revenue, is net.  It's the money they take home, they put in their pocket.  And Jeff just turns a knob and keeps it close to that.  As the revenue has skyrocketed.  Last year, $107 billion in revenue.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Multi-billion dollar business.  We'll get to that.  So Amazon is now bigger than Walmart.  Did you know that?  Amazon is the purple line on this,  if you're watching video.  Walmart's the green.  Walmart has gone down in the last year.  But that's probably coinciding with Amazon's growth,  which has been very steady.  Amazon is the most popular e-commerce destination  for everyday products.  So people do their shopping now increasingly at Amazon.  More than double Walmart, triple Target,  and Safeway, Kroger, Supervalue,  Albertsons just trailing off there.  I mean, that's groceries.  That's staples.  Also for personal care and beauty products,  completely dominant.  In the holiday shopping season, totally dominant.  More than half of US consumers plan to do most  of their online shopping on Amazon.  But the really amazing thing is, as dominant as they are  in e-commerce, e-commerce is only 6% of total retail sales  now.  So the growth potential in e-commerce is massive.  If Amazon maintains this share.

Transcript:  I do wonder about Amazon's long-term plan  for international.  Because here in the US, we talk a lot about a lot  of these products.  But I think the Echo does not work outside of the US.  And a lot of their digital products  are in one or two countries.  We can trade the Echo's better.  It's an interesting different strategy,  because Siri and OK Google do a lot of languages  and are in a lot of countries.  And the Echo is English in the United States.  And that's what it does.  And maybe that's their strategy, is  we're going to work on getting this really, really great fear  rather than being sort of OK everywhere.  But unlike Google and Apple, Amazon  chooses a lot of the times to turn their back  on the rest of the world.  And that provides opportunities for competitors  to succeed in the rest of the world.

So you talk about the five horsemen of the internet,  Apple, and Google, and Microsoft, and Facebook,  and Amazon.  But I think Amazon's the one to watch.  And I think when you talk about operating systems,  15 years in, that's how we started this conversation.  OS 10 is just going to coast along.  Windows is just going to coast along.

You can order physical goods.

And then I really feel like the potential privacy trade-off  is enough for that utility.  Whereas with Nest, I was like, I can push that button  on my own.  I'm good.  Thanks.  Yeah.

And it was like, oh, play Abbey Road.  Turn up the volume.  Can you set a timer for 10 minutes?  And then we were playing a game.  And nobody could remember who the seventh president was.  So it was just like sort of, it felt  like having just a very helpful person in the room.  Which, again, I understand how creepy that sounds.  No.  But it was also really great and helpful.  So I thought, OK, this would be fantastic to have  in my kitchen.  This is exactly where I would use it.  I'd listen to a podcast, and I would cook,  and I would clean up, and I would need it for recipes.  And I would be able to depend on it,  like having a helper in the kitchen.

Transcript:  Right.  And you're talking to the air.  I try to explain to people who say, well,  you can just use Siri to do that, because it's always on.  It's like, no, Siri's in my pocket,  or it's being charged somewhere.  And with Echo, you're talking to the air in your house.  You can be sort of anywhere, not even  pointed in the right direction.  And it's funny.  I think Amazon's failure with its phones  has actually turned into this great success, because Google  and Apple keep sticking their assistants into their phones.  And it works better with this little tower.

Start time: 3947.98
End time: 3988.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the answer, is I talk to the air,  and it's much better.  And I think when we're talking about the future of computer  interfaces, I think there's something to that.  And if you imagine a time when people  are sticking a little thing in their ear  and talking to their smart assistant, like in her,  that makes it like Apple's lack of progress with Siri  a little more questionable and concerning.  And Google, the rumor is, there was a report this week  that they are working on an Echo version.  And Apple needs to do that too, because the Echo really  showed us all there is great value in having  that little friend, like you said,  that friend who's just hanging around in the background, who  you can ask questions to and ask for favors.  Be interesting.

I wasn't able to ask it for stuff.  And I guess it's not like Amazon has a huge store appended  to it, so you can ask it for groceries or for paper towels  or for whatever.  But I was surprised they didn't do something better  to integrate.  Even like Wikipedia, so you could have that like,  oh, set a timer, or oh, who was the seventh president?  You know what I mean?  You could ask it questions and interact.

Start time: 4019.76
End time: 4042.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's stuck on the TV too.  That's the problem is you've got to turn on your TV  in order to ask your friend a question.  I mean, that's the great thing about the Echo  is that it's just always hanging out there.  It's not in my pocket with my phone.  It's also not on my TV, which is turned off at the moment.  And that's the problem with, I think  that's the problem with Apple strategy  is they've embedded Siri into the remote on the Apple TV  and they've embedded it into your phone,  but it doesn't get it in the air.  It doesn't get it in your house.

Transcript:  I do have to say though, to be able to talk to your TV  and say, skip back 30 seconds, or what did he just say,  is phenomenal.  It is a great feature.  But I just feel like, Katie, you nailed it.  The ability to kind of interact with your environment  while you're doing stuff is huge.  And that is really so much better  than what a phone or a desktop can do.  It's just there listening to you.  And I love that.  I really do.  All right, let's take a little break.  We'll come back with more.  Katie Benner is here from the New York Times,  Jason Snell, SixColors.com.  Devendra Hardwar from Engadget.  It's always really great conversation.  We had a good week.  I wasn't here this week.  I went to New York City to see Hamilton.  By the way, you can ask the Echo to play Hamilton,  and it will.  It will.  It's in Prime Music.  I love it about that.  But we did have a good week, even in my absence.  Maybe I should be watching what you're about to see.  A little movie about this week on Twitter.

I am a Kickstarter Oculus Rift owner,  so I think we might get our Oculus Rift soon.  I'm hoping.  Palmer Lucky flew to Alaska to deliver  the first Oculus Rift.  Irony is, the guy who got it  didn't have enough computer to use it.  So he put it on and looked around,  and that was it.  We are not going to have that problem.  We're building a $5,000 ultimate  virtual reality gaming machine.  And we're almost done on the new screensavers.  We just put the hard drive in.  I think we gotta put the water cooling system in,  keyboard, mouse.  We're almost ready.  So if the Rift comes, we could hurry things along  a little bit.  I'm excited.  We'll talk about that, VR, and lots more,  the Build Conference in just a little bit  as we continue with this week in tech.  First, a word from stamps.com.  You don't want to go to the post office.  You don't need to go to the post office.  If you're in a business where you're mailing stuff a lot,  if you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon,  if you send out brochures or bills,  you need to know about stamps.com.  It eliminates the need to visit the post office  because you can do everything you would do  at the post office right from your desk,  including buy and print real US postage  from your computer with your printer  for any kind of letter or package or anything.  In fact, they'll even make suggestions.  If they say, are you mailing a book?  Well, you should do this media mail.  You could save a lot of money.  And then the mail carrier comes and picks it up.  No more time wasted driving to the post office,  finding parking.  Instead, spend that time on growing your business.  And by the way, looking more professional  because one of the things,  I love buying stuff on Etsy and from eBay,  but some of the packaging, sometimes the brown paper  with the twine and hand-licked stamps  going all the way around the edge,  it doesn't convey professionalism.  This does.  Stamps.com, you print your logo right on the mailing label.  The address, he comes right from the website  or from your address book.  It understands all the address books and QuickBooks.  They'll calculate the postage using that USB scale.  So there's always the right postage,  not penny more or less.  You even get discounts.  You can't get at the post office.  On insurance, it will automatically send out an email  to your recipient if you're doing certified mail.  The free USPS address verification,  it'll fill out your forms for your customs  or certified mail just automatically.  I can go on and on, but what I want you to do is try it.  We've got a special offer.  Go right to the top of the page at stamps.com  and click that microphone and use our offer code TWIT.  You're gonna get $110 bonus offer.  It includes $55 in free postage.  You get the USB scale.  You get a four-week trial.  It's a great deal.  Stamps.com.  If you're doing mailing right now,  if you're going to the post office ever,  get off that treadmill and get to stamps.com.  Click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner  and use the offer code TWIT for our special offer.  Stamps.com.  People say we should do an Echo Show.

Let me just tell you guys, the geekiest thing,  this is like, I've had many geek milestones,  but having VR just sitting here in my office  and being able to jack in every day  and do whatever is tremendous.  So yeah, the Vive is interesting.  The PlayStation, just because it's using console hardware,  older hardware, even though it comes  with a little breakout box,  that's not gonna really push the hardware much forward.

This is gonna be the biggest challenge, of course,  and by the way, I should reload the article  because it was so awesome.  It starts off with a video of you putting on the VR  and suddenly you're in this virtual world.  To communicate in a way that's different.  This is gonna be the problem,  because you can't communicate the experience at all.  You just have to do it.  Not everybody will have access to this hardware  that you need to do it.  It does take a significant amount of hardware to do it.  And some portion of the audience is gonna get nauseous  or nauseated.  They'll get sick.  So all in all, I think that this may be a hard sell.  I'm as bullish as you are, Devendra,  but it may be a hard sell.

And that's, it's better than Cardboard.  It's not as good as the Vive or the Oculus,  but it is Oculus hardware.  So it's-  At least gives you some experience.

Start time: 4720.30
End time: 4760.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  It is, cause what Vive does is it's room scale VR.  You have two sensors that you put up  in different corners of your room.  So it knows like the mapping of your floor.  You can get up, it comes with two motion controllers.  You can move around, you can interact with things.  There's a virtual mini golf game that kind of,  it sounds like the dumbest thing, but you put it on  and you're just in this weird, like the craziest  like mini golf environment you've ever seen.  The motion controlling for the stick is like perfect.  And these are just like the early demos.  So I'm really interested in seeing  where a lot of these things go.  I've tried the Oculus, you know, the latest hardware too.  You'll be hearing a lot about that stuff this week for sure.

Transcript:  We have a heck of a week.  So we're going to do the Ozo on Tuesday  for MacBreak Weekly.  Tomorrow on Monday,  I wanted to talk to this guy for some time,  Craig Richardson will join us.  He's written a great book,  Learning to Program with Minecraft.  We'll talk about getting your Minecraft up and running  with Python.  What a great way to get your kids programming.  Learning to Program with Python tomorrow on triangulation.  All right, let's talk about Tay,  which was really stupid, I must say.  Microsoft got a bit of a black eye.  They released a chat bot.  And I think it's very generous to say  this was artificial intelligence.  This was artificial stupidity maybe.  They said, well, hey, we did this in China  and we never had a problem.  Tay was a chat bot that was supposed to simulate  a millennial.  You could tweet at it, at Tay and you.  And within 24 hours,  it became a hate-spewing, racist anti-Semite.  Just like everyone on the internet.  Do I want to show this?  You can show it.  It's terrible.  Everybody's probably seen it by now.  The thing is, like I said,  I think Microsoft just didn't get that it was a little,  Twitter's a little different than whatever they were,  I don't know if it was Weibo or whatever  they were putting on it in China.  The Chinese were well-behaved and it was,  Microsoft said, we were stunned.  Everybody enjoyed listening to stories  and talking to the bot.  We just never thought this would happen, obviously.  They'd never been on Twitter.  Or Reddit or anything.  Or Reddit or 4chan or et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  In any event, one of the mistakes they made  was they put in a command, Tay, repeat after me.  So most of the really awful stuff is just people saying,  hey, repeat after me and saying something terrible.  Not clear, and it's been taken down,  it was taken down almost immediately.  It's not clear whether Tay was then learning  something from that or if all of those tweets  were just Tay parroting something somebody else said.

Transcript:  You know what it is?  I think they were feeling a little scoped.  In fact, Microsoft has always had this,  not always, but in the last 10 years has had this,  you know, everybody's, we're micro, why is everybody,  they're so, we gotta, so it's always catch up.  Always like, and they're rushing stuff.  And this is an example, this is just,  I think they felt scoped by.

Transcript:  There's probably an Eliza online.  Oh yes.  It was very dumb, but it was,  I didn't seem like it was any less dumb than Tay.  Oh God, they're all over the place.  Here's one from,  They're pretty dumb.  Yeah. They're pretty dumb.  Talk to Eliza, the Rogerian therapist.  Hello, I'm Eliza.  Hello, Eliza.  Are you having a nice day?  You can do this at psych.fullerton.edu.  Would you prefer if I were not having a nice day?  No, not at all.  I was just inquiring.  I'm trying to give it a lot of words to work with, right?  Cause if you just say no, it doesn't,  it gets kind of dopey.  And then she says, why not?  Oh dear, she really is Rogerian.  Because I like you.  Let's see what happens.  When the original Eliza first appeared in the sixties,  it says, some people actually mistook her for human.  Not for very long.  We were discussing you, not me.  That's a classic Eliza.  Just turn it right around.  That's Eliza in JavaScript.  Not much, really frankly,  much more primitive than Tay, if you ask me.  Microsoft did lose a significant court case.  Actually it wasn't even in court.  It was an inter-partes appeal,  a review of a patent that Microsoft  paid millions of dollars for.  It's one of the oldest and most profitable patent trolls,  Uniloc, claimed he owned the concept  of product activation on software.  And of course, if you own such a thing,  you go around asking people for big money to license it,  and if you don't get it, you sue them.  Sega of America, Ubisoft, Cambium Learning Group,  and Perfect World Entertainment decided,  this is enough is enough,  and they pursued what's called an inter-partes review.  They went to the patent office.  Actually, this was the same technique used  to overturn the podcast patent.  Instead of going to court, fighting in court,  we had counsel from our,  when the podcast patent was going around,  they asked us for two and a half million dollars,  we sought legal counsel.  And we had a very good attorney  who had a lot of practice in this, in Tyler, Texas.  And she said, the risk of going to the patent office  with the inter-partes review is if you lose,  it just bolsters their case in court.  So it's a risky play, but Sega said,  no, we're gonna take a chance.  And yeah, they overturned the patent.  Uniloc has sued 75 companies,  one third of them just said, okay, here, take some money.  In Uniloc's case against Microsoft,  they said they lost, they won, I'm sorry, $388 million.  And in fact, the appeals court upheld the win.  Microsoft settled for an undisclosed amount,  but that patent has now been overturned.  It was used to sue Minecraft, Mojang as well.

I think that's really the lesson in this  is as expensive as it is,  the more people stand up to patent trolls, the better.  And Adam, we thank very much Adam Corolla,  who did fight the podcast patent troll  and raised a lot of money, spent a lot of money.  But it was ultimately the EFF  who got that podcast patent overturned  by going to the USPTO and doing an inter partes.

Transcript:  You wrote about on Six College, speaking of podcasting,  that this new adapter that Apple's doing for the iPad Pro,  the Lightning USB 3 adapter, 39 bucks,  it's a camera adapter, but it will help podcasting.

Start time: 5379.46
End time: 5428.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They still call it the camera adapter,  which is funny because Phil Schiller stood on stage  and said, oh, you can also use this  to connect to your corporate ethernet network  and podcasters can use it with microphones.  And it's true, it's powered.  So this new adapter for iOS devices  has a Lightning port on the outside for power  and then a USB plug.  It used to be you could maybe find a powered USB hub  and attach it and all that,  but now it's sort of an approved feature.  And the other nice thing about it is  you can do this for a while  because it'll also power your iPad.  So it used to be if you wanted to use this adapter,  you had to make sure you had enough battery  to get through whatever you wanted to do  because it was draining power from your device.  And this one will actually charge your iPad  while it's attaching you to anything via USB,  a microphone or an ethernet adapter or whatever, a camera.

Start time: 5431.12
End time: 5451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want though them to go move to type C  because this is the kind of thing type C does so well.  And it would be an easy thing.  But what this adapter does,  it plugs into the Lightning port on your iPad,  it adds a Lightning port so you can charge  and then a USB port so you could connect ethernet  if you wanted or, which is kind of funny.  I guess there's drivers for ethernet now.

End time: 5492.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like the Blue Yeti is a good example  of a common microphone that draws too much power  and the iPad alone could never support it.  But iPhones and iPads using this adapter can use that.  It doesn't solve all the podcasting  using an iOS device problems,  but it does solve one of them,  which is that it was hard to even attach a device  because it wanted bus power that wasn't available.

Transcript:  Well, I was in New York,  I actually recorded commercials on my iPhone  using Sure Makes a Lightning based microphone.  I got in bed and put the covers over my head  to get a nice soundproof room and I recorded commercials.  And then I transferred them to Dropbox  because there was no really easy way to do this.  And then from Dropbox, I sent them to the station.  And then what I did, I realized,  oh, I could do this for audio blogging.  And so I created an If This Then That  that would watch my Dropbox folder.  And then as soon as I uploaded a new audio track  to the Motive Dropbox folder,  which is built into the recorder,  would then send it to SoundCloud and then it's a podcast.

Transcript:  For sure.  We started a little bit on this, Katie,  but we were talking about platforms and the Echo.  But really, I think a lot of what we're seeing  is people using messaging as a platform.  And I wonder if that's, in a way, the same platform,  the idea of kind of an interactive back and forth,  whether it's by voice or by typing  in your messaging platform.  Facebook is now gonna do,  aren't they doing like a messaging app store for bots?  Very interesting what's happening here.  I think this is, in some ways,  the future of platforms is not tied to an operating system.  It's something you can do while you're walking around.  As long as Tay's not there, it's okay.

They didn't say exactly,  we're talking to the Wall Street Journal,  they didn't say exactly whether this was something  that AT&T Verizon had demanded.  They did say, we don't have to do it for the others,  Sprint and T-Mobile,  because they treat customers better.  Ooh, ow.  Sing.  This is an issue, of course, is of data caps.  And we've been talking a lot about net neutrality.  We're talking about Bin John from T-Mobile,  which it turns out does something similar,  although they only throttle it down to one and a half  megabits, which is much better quality than this,  what was it, 600 kilobits that Netflix was offering  AT&T and Verizon customers.  Has anybody complained about how bad Netflix looks  on Verizon and AT&T?  I think people don't even notice.

Start time: 5668.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, on phones, it's, 600K is not much,  so it may be just hard for people to notice.  It's not crystal clear 1080p HD, maybe.  But it's, I guess it makes sense for Netflix to do this,  because yeah, if people can stream more things,  that's better for them overall.  It's just a shame, like,  this is the world we live in right now, right?  They have to work around the limitations  of the cellular companies.  It's kind of a shame.

Transcript:  Andy Grove passed away this week at the age of 79.  Really amazing fellow who powered Intel.  He was a Hungarian refugee, came to the United States  after the Hungarian revolt of 1956  was crushed by Soviet tanks.  I remember him telling me the story of crawling on his belly  through a minefield and barbed wire in Hungary  to get to Austria, to get over the border into Austria.  He was probably around 20 at the time, young man.  Came to the United States, studied chemical engineering,  and got a job at a little company called Fairchild  Semiconductor, where he worked with Charles Moore  and then later CEO and chairman of Intel,  and really had a lot to do with the success of Intel  in the 1980s and 90s.  And I really liked the guy.  He was a tough competitor, but a brilliant engineer,  and more importantly, a great leader,  famous for not having an office.  He had a cubicle.

Transcript:  So all right, so I'll do a little Hamilton.  I wasn't gonna do this, but it was the greatest show  I've ever seen.  It was incredible.  I saw it on Thursday night.  But what's interesting, I've seen many, many  Broadway shows, including huge hits,  including seeing Rent when it first came to Broadway.  But seeing this, it was unique.  First of all, no empty seats,  10 minutes before the show begins.  The house is full, which is unusual, and it's buzzing.  There is electricity.  People are very excited to be at the show.  It's impossible to get a ticket.  It's sold out through the rest of the year.  And when the show begins, they introduce Alexander Hamilton,  Lin-Manuel Miranda, and he makes his appearance  on the stage, and it's like The Beatles.  The screams.  And the whole show just stops.  And I think it wasn't just girls screaming.  I was screaming.  People are screaming.  I haven't seen anything like this.  It was like Elvis.  It was like The Beatles.  And it's a really wonderful show.  Have you seen it, Devinder?

What is the secret of Uber?  What is so great about Uber?  Because when the ride's over, you get out of the car  and it's done, you've paid for it.  That's Braintree, making mobile payments fast, easy, seamless.  You can add it to your app with 10 lines of code  and boom, you are ready to accept  whatever payment form your customers want.  Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Venmo, credit cards,  even Bitcoin.  And if another way to pay comes along,  but you're gonna be able to do that  with a check of the box, then your control panel,  Braintree will support that too.  I spoke with my good buddy, Harper Reed.  His company, Modest, was all about  kind of seamless transactions.  Braintree acquired him not so long ago.  And I asked about how Braintree's powering  this new PayPal commerce tool  and why it's important when it comes to contextual commerce.  Listen.

Transcript:  Yeah, as a developer, we built a lot of these tools  to be easy to use for developers.  So thinking about APIs,  really it's just about building blocks.  So if you look at huge companies like Facebook and Uber,  they're able to use these building blocks  to do really neat integrations  for their transportation services.  But at the same time, the small business developer  is able to use these to bring retail customers  of their own businesses  into this contextual commerce world.

Always great stuff on Hacker News.  It's called VNC Rowlet.  Somebody wrote a little script to go out  and look at unsecured VNC connections.  And as you go through them,  what surprises you is occasionally you run into things  like hydro power installations, the grid.  It's kind of an interesting revelation here.  This is a whole category of tools that are great  that allow you to search for flaws, exploits.

Transcript:  What is that?  There's a search that Steve Gibson uses all the time  that will find all sorts of flaws and holes and exploits.  I can't remember.  He often refers to it.  It's a great way to find issues out there.  Anyway, VNCRowlet.com.  If you want just a little fun browsing.  Showdan, that's it.  Showdan is kind of amazing.  It's the world's first search engine  for internet connected devices.  That's how they bill themselves.  But of course, as soon as you heard about an exploit,  you just go to Showdan and you can find it.  Turns out that music business isn't doing so hot.  Here's a surprise.  In a shift to streaming, they've lost billions of dollars.  US music sales in this graph going from 19,  2006 to 2015, the big drop right about 2008,  just boom and then flat as physical media disappeared  and digital media increased.  This is the music industry sales report  which came out this week.  Streaming is up.  Vinyl sells a little bit, still increasing.  But record sales in general way down.  The number has hovered around $7 billion a year since 2010.  Very little growth.

Start time: 6275.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This article says that according to this report,  it's about half a cent per play per song on streaming.  And I did the math.  And that means, so if you take an average length album,  because you think when you buy the CD, you get it forever,  or you do the download on iTunes,  you get it forever, as many listens as you want.  How many listens would it take  for it to be equivalent revenue on streaming?  And it's like hundreds or thousands of listens to an album.  And even my favorites, I don't listen to as much.  So it's just, yeah, the money is, it doesn't work.  It's not comparable.

And when they would be sad about,  oh, what they're getting paid now,  I'd be like, guys, I used to write blog posts for $5 a pop.  Yeah, I would never see that sort of world.  So you've got independent music production now.  You've got all sorts of different ways  for people to get their stuff out there.  It is gonna be interesting to see  what this means for like Spotify and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think that once musicians,  so if musicians stop working through record companies  and start going to streaming services direct, for example,  not that it's gonna happen tomorrow or anytime soon.  I think the problem with streaming services  is that the payments don't make sense.  I mean, you're still an artist,  you're still producing something, whether you're a huge,  you love The Weeknd, you love Taylor Swift,  or you love somebody who's not as well known,  those people should get paid for the work they do.  And right now we are in a system  where it's still really easy to find  all the other stuff for free, which is not fair.  I mean, as journalists,  even though we don't make people pay per story,  the stories are going out because of advertising backing it.  So it's not free.  It's not free.  There's no free journalism.  There's advertising everywhere.  So I do think that there will have to be something  that makes those economics work  where the money that Spotify has to pay per stream  is more than half of a cent.  And again, does that mean that only Apple  can subsidize music or only YouTube can subsidize music?  Maybe, but I mean, half a cent's not enough.  I think most people would have.

Start time: 6461.50
End time: 6493.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess, I mean, that's historically been  the story of the record industry.  It's not like the artists really ever  got the blind share of money.  But part of the pitch of these streaming services  was to the record companies,  well, wouldn't you rather get $10 a month,  every month from a user?  That's like the equivalent of buying a CD a month.  Isn't that better than the alternative?  Even if they were buying CDs, do they buy a CD a month?  You pay, don't you, Jason?  I pay.  I have two Google and iTunes accounts.

Start time: 6493.24
End time: 6514.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if the average subscriber now pays  the equivalent of one CD a month,  and they're a music fan or they wouldn't be subscribing,  and they probably bought two or three albums a month before,  there you go, you've lost half or two thirds  of your revenue, just right there.  Regardless of how badly the artists are getting  taken in by the middle men,  the pool of money is way down at that point.

Start time: 6514.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think it's a little decimate, the middle men.  I mean, in a perfect world, this would just sort of  either force the record companies  to get some sort of religion and understand  that they have to redo their business  and start distributing the cash more equally.  Or it just decimates them and they get taken out  altogether, which is what is happening.  That's the thing that's happening.  Those numbers show that these guys,  most of these companies are run by marketing people,  not by businessmen, any.  That these guys don't understand what's happening to them  and they don't understand that they're going to be  pushed into extinction.  And eventually somebody would be able to,  I mean, Spotify's already trying to do this,  like, okay, well, we're going to do video  and we're going to do music  and we're going to have people come play  at our headquarters and record music just for us.  And soon, wouldn't it be better if you can work your way out  of your 10-year contract with Sony  to then just work directly with Spotify?
