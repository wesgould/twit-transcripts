Transcript:  You know where I'm gonna start here. I have to I don't want to  But I have to Elon Musk says I am NOT buying Twitter. Oh my god. Oh  my god to which Twitter responds in the in the form of  Chairman of the board Brett Taylor  The Twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with mr  Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We will cut we are confident  We will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is a little medieval but  Now I have Williams one of the founders of Twitter tweeted. Oh, come on bread  I know you feel like you have to say that but can't we just let this all go?  Amy it seems to me and I've seen some other people say this that is a kind of  One billionaire to another statement sort of like oh don't worry about the little people whose stock price has been depressed by this  These shenanigans.

Transcript:  Right, so I will remind everybody  People who have listened to me before know this but for those of you who I haven't met yet  I dropped out of law school right before starting so I'm not a lawyer  But you didn't actually go to law school so that's like made a last-minute decision not smart woman  Anyway, so here's my my two cents on what's happening. Um  There is absolutely a lawsuit  And that is because you can't jack around another, you know, if you're gonna kill a company you have to kill it dead  Yes, you know, that's what they say if you're gonna kill the king you better not miss  Right, so this is not a mostly dead princess bride situation  And and there are repercussions the this is a publicly traded company board members have fiduciary responsibility  The leadership of that company has a responsibility to its shareholders and its employees  And if an outsider comes in  And files paperwork, which he had to do  And he's going to have to go to the court and he's going to have to go to the court and he's going to have to go to the  Which he had to do  Saying that there was an intent a good faith intent to buy  You know that is legal paperwork  And to renege on that at this point that there there should and will be repercussions without a doubt  uh, yeah, can we also just say that like  Let's just like call it for what it is. Elon musk likes the drama. He's a troll. This is happening. He's a troll  All of this is happening around the same time that it's come to light that he's got twins  Oh, yeah, that's a good one of his employees  so like you know and and then got into a crazy ridiculous argument on twitter with uh,  somebody about  Oh, it was nick cannon the two of them are growing out about under population  On the planet and that's why they're spreading their seeds.

Yeah that there's this like compulsive need to spread their seed  Yeah, um and and and part of the justification for that is under population. This is a a crazy ego driven

Start time: 635.26
End time: 678.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I tell you what the real uh, what's really the subtext of this and it's kind of like replacement theory  That the dumb people are reproducing at a fast rate  So we who are smarter than them?  Must keep up otherwise all that's left is dumb people and so it comes from I guarantee you because I know people like  It comes from this point this sense that I am a superior race and so it is my obligation  To spread my seed far and wide  Uh, so it has nothing to do with a fertility slump. I guarantee you it has no but I mean that's what they're that's what they're saying  It's crypto racist is what it is crypto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say there's a billion dollar breakup fee  Uh at stake here as well  And I think I don't know what others feel but the beginning of this whole elon musk wants to buy twitter  If you were taking odds from  Folks who follow elon musk we all knew that that deal wasn't going to go through especially when the stock prices  For tesla took a hit and his wealth was affected and  You know, you can say whatever you want about what you want to do and what your feelings about it are  But at the end of the day to amy's point you have to put down some  Legal commitments and you have to put down some money and then if you feel that you want to  You know, um jerk around the sec which is what some people thought musk was doing and jerk around twitter  That's all well and good in twitter and it plays to the drama and you like to be part of the drama, but there is  Shareholder accountability and there's money. There's a billion dollars breakup fee at stake that  Elon musk, you know doesn't want to pay so that's you know, it's all about money at this point

Start time: 764.48
End time: 854.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter's not twitter's saying not it's not a billion. We want 44 billion  You said you were going to give us 44 billion and by god you will although  You know these things take time. It's got to go to court. There will be lawsuits back and forth  The delaware court of chance re does move a little bit faster apparently in issues like this  To protect in particular, uh, the corporation's registered there like twitter  So I suspect there may be an outcome quickly, but there there there's been a lot of interesting speculation  Especially about this billion dollar breakup fee  He could  Make a lot more than the billion dollar breakup fee  Uh just by a pump and dump scam on twitter. He bought remember he bought nine and a quarter percent of twitter stock  without revealing it  Breaking sec regulations at the time. Uh, still no punishment on that. Although they're investigating and then announced  Even after he bought nine point two five percent at a reduced amount  Then announced he was going to buy it  Thinking perhaps the stock price now would go straight up and he could sell all that stock  Uh did not happen. In fact, you're not alone connie very not only did  Pundits not believe he meant to buy it the market didn't because at no time did twitter's stock price go anywhere near what elon was offering  In fact right now. It's 36 dollars elon's offering 54 dollars and 20 cents. That's exactly  The market saying yeah, no, that's not going to happen. Otherwise the price would go close to 54 20 wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely right. Yeah, nobody believed it nobody believed it and so  You know, we're just left with  the mess  Basically, I mean I I know people who work at twitter  I feel so bad for twitter twitter has been struggling trying to expand its membership. They have their challenges and issues and  You really don't need it. You know a boy billionaire with you know, uh, you know an ego about what he wants to say  Screwing things up and so now it is put up or set up time will will he ultimately buy twitter?  Obviously that's not going to happen  So it's really a question of how much does he have to pay for screwing around with a publicly traded company and also  Remember he's been in trouble with sec many times  He's done this to tesla shareholders, right saying that he would take  A buyout bid and then the sec slapped him with a fine and then all of his tweets had to be reviewed  By the sec so he's had a lot of pent-up anger at the sec and at the beginning when this was all announced  People thought he was just trolling the sec some more so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had a knockdown drag out arguing about this and he is an elon apologist no matter what see there are those asking questions  He's a stan  He's a total stan and and no matter what I said it was but he disrupted the auto industry  But and without him there wouldn't be electric cars and he disrupted look at you know, he disrupted space  um, and it was like no no measure of just practical facts applied and then I I said well  You know, let's think about this in terms of like jeff bezos who gets no passes everybody like there's nobody to defend bezos  And I would argue that bezos has actually been more influential in changing  global  economic structures among other things  um, and every like like bezos makes mistakes  He has no slack  uh elon keeps  Doing ridiculous things and there's just legions of people ready to defend him including my husband and I I like can't grok  Why it it I don't maybe it's because i'm a woman. I don't know  There is no way for me to get into the headspace where I see  The net positives, you know that this guy is is wielding at this point. It's the state of the world today, isn't it that uh,

Transcript:  Half the world goes  What's the deal? Why do you like this guy and the other half says he's god?  Uh, and it's not it's just not not just elon. I might add there's other people with orange or hair  And and it's it's like those of us who are in the skeptic camp just I don't understand it. I don't get it

Start time: 1031.16
End time: 1134.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  elon elon has kind of  In the past has relied on his instincts as to what needs to be done and has had successes with it  SpaceX is a success. He has disrupted space  Uh electric cars, that's a success and all of them kind of were the result of him going, you know  I think this is the way it should be done and I have the resource to do it and we're going to push for it  But he that's kind of the same thing he did with twitter  His experience on twitter is not what your experience and my experience is on twitter  It's one of the reasons why he's so obsessed with spam bots  You know, we occasionally see spam bots on twitter and we block them and move on  But he's got millions and millions of followers and it's a completely different universe for him and he's obsessed with them  so his  What he had what he did with space x and what he did with tesla  He was trying to do the same thing. It was his instinct. I'm going to buy this company. I'm going to make it the  open-ended town hall for the world  Which was actually one of the things that that twitter talked about  In some of its founders talked about the pulse of the planet early on and he says i'm going to do that  I'm going to save this  but but when it turned out to not be  What as easy as he thought it was and it's a completely different beast  And I like what matt levine said in his bloomberg piece that he started it out kind of tongue in cheek  Believed in it but got bored and now he's walked away from it  I think I think the same instinct that brought him to tesla and space x brought him to twitter, but it failed him

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I should point out and you might want to give brian the book ludicrous by edward niedermeyer, which is about  Elon musk and tesla niedermeyer had an opinion piece in the new york times  Early in june when elon musk dreams his employees have nightmares. He interviewed a hundred  tesla employees to do the book and really points out that as much as elon  You know took credit for space x and took credit for tesla. He was a pain in the butt  for the employees mr musk  Uh reported that he had slept in this is niedermeyer writing slept in tesla's factories during the this period  Which he called production hell what he left out of his self-aggrandizing was the reality for his employees  His presence brought no real manufacturing expertise to bear just the overbearing pressure of a boss whose public shaming  Was punctuated by declarations like quote. I could be on my own private island with naked supermodels drinking my ties, but i'm not  And I have to say say, you know  You hear the same stories about elon sitting in on all night sessions discussing the nozzles on space x falcon heavy  But he's not a space engineer and i'm sure his presence at those meetings was more of a burden than it was an asset  His money is welcome

Transcript:  Let me let me put in a uh sort of supportive plug for an outside in perspective on things because you know  Most of the time i'm in boardrooms with executives or their c-suites  and  Even very successful companies become very myopic over time  So it can be useful to have even a senior executive who's just an incredible leader  Um who doesn't have domain expertise in that industry?  Lead because it because you get a valuable outside in perspective, but I think there's a maturity issue here  And there's a vast difference between an outside in perspective where you may lack domain expertise, but you're an incredible executive  You're just an incredible chief executive  um, and and what we're witnessing which is just like  You know billionaire boy  immaturity hubris stuff and  You know  I don't think we should be celebrating somebody who got a hair up their end and decided they'd you know  take over  a company and then uh, and then like change their mind and in the process, you know created all kinds of chaos  in the wake of that that's very  Unamerican if you think about the the structures that hold up our economic functions in in our society  Like we should not be celebrating that

Transcript:  I just watched two great tv shows  Uh one about adam newman at we work called we crashed on apple tv  Yeah, it was super good and then the dropout which is all about elizabeth holmes and the failure of theranos  And both of them shared the same and I suspect elon and and both of them probably looking back to steve jobs  Who did turn this kind of?  Out of the box thinking and and and driving personality into a real success at apple  Um, and I think I think there is this kind of culture in silicon valley that it's  That the unruly ceo is an advantage not a disadvantage just as you said  Amy but but there's a line you steve jobs kind of stuck to his knitting  although  I remember when they were making the fremont factory for the macintosh. He insisted all the machines be painted in a particular  Color  Shade of what was it red?  He really he really liked that color elon  This is an article from three or four years ago and the intelligence or tesla factory workers are in danger because elon musk hates the color yellow  He refused he had kind of gray lines on the assembly line that were hard to see instead of the traditional  You know yellow stripes caution stripes  Because he doesn't like the color yellow  Lane lines in the factory floor are painted in shades of gray tesla denies it  He also is into not having too many signs and doesn't like the beeping sounds forklifts make when they go in reverse  And as a result, it's very dangerous according to the intelligence sir  Uh, it was very dangerous to work in the tesla factory. I shouldn't laugh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I I want to go back to what amy just said about why people  admire  Why and why they admire?  Personalities and that's really what it's about right we live in a society now with a cult of personality  and people are entertained by someone who's different and outrageous and  You know, we'll we love a crazy things, right? Yeah, some people definitely love it  But there's a difference between being a celebrity and being a business leader who has you know  thousands of employees  Lives and livelihoods, you know under his thumb, you know are under his color and choices  If you will and being somebody who's a visionary  So we can say that elon musk had a definite vision about space and about electric cars and was able to follow through  Not easily, right? Uh  tesla was in the slam dunk success that people  You know thought it would be and so he had to invest and he he had to see through some of that vision  But not all of his  I wouldn't call him the most business savvy certainly not the most ethical business leader or even the most forward-thinking one  We know saw that he wants to cut or is in the process of cutting a lot of his staff and he's asked everyone  you know post or  Mid-pandemic or post-pandemic wherever you think we are to go back to work five days a week or turn in your  Insisting insisted they come back. So so there's a difference between what a personality is from an entertainment value  And we we definitely see that with him and others in the political realm and outside of it  And then there's the okay, let's talk real now and there is no real talk  When you get to that point about what are you doing that makes sense? Why isn't sensible? Why should we follow you?  Why why should you get a pass?  Certainly, so it's just we live in a world where people and maybe your husband is one of them  Just wants to put his blinders on about well, he did these good things and you know  It's it's like, you know somebody who's convicted of a crime the neighbors. Oh, but he was so nice. He's such a nice quiet

Start time: 1514.40
End time: 1589.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that the point that you're making about personality is absolutely on and I think a facet of that is  Speaking up in a way that some people feel like they can't  um being able to jostle the status quo in a way that people feel like they can't I mean  And people compare him to to to tony stark  And I think that there's a certain amount of reverence for tony stark, you know for  Not having any superpowers but through the sheer might of his own ideas and the will to carry through  um, you know that however he's sort of iron man is not real  No, but I can but I what I what i'll tell you who I don't hear defending musk. I I never hear  Or let me put it this way the group that tends to defend him tends to be pretty homogeneous, right?  It is white men tech bros  I don't I well so but that's my my husband's not a tech bro, but but he he's a white man  um, and I just when I hear him talk about it, it sounds like it's almost a yearning for  It's a character. It's a it's a character personality that I think people it's looked up up to because they're doing things that people feel like

Transcript:  They can't on their own. It's the great man. I agree with you and that's why trump of course  Uh has his adherence it's the great man hypothesis too, which we really believe  Which is that napoleon or alexander the great or thomas edison or henry ford these great men stand up above  the crowd to lead us into the future and it's through their  Force of personality that they are able to do great things that the rest of us can only admire  I think that right and it's hard to bring the bunk hasn't it the great man hypothesis

He was hated. There's some similarities here  He was his kill driving stock prices way up. Yeah total cult and in the aftermath of all of that, you know  He's been vilified like not a good guy, you know, but and and um  There's a book about him called the man who broke  Capitalism, it's a by david gales.

Yeah, and you know connie talked about this but i'm curious about this  Why would twitter make the statement, you know, basically elon says i'm dropping the deal and twitter says no you  No, you aren't we'll see you in court  Why not just say all right, give us the billion dollars and go away and let us let us go about our business why  Why did the I mean it's probably gonna end up with a settlement. I'll tell you why 36 dollars and 81 cents

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So connie you're not a you agree yeah, I was also going to say I think that's just all legal chatter too  They have to show that they have a good faith effort to want to continue the deal  And they believe that he has not acted in good faith by walking away from the deal complaining about bots and so forth  And so I think that's just legal maneuvering. I'm not a lawyer either  I did apply to law school as well and decided to be a journalist. So I have that coming with you amy  um, but from what I understand is that you know, you have to you have to  This is all about good faith efforts, right? So there's a good faith effort  Uh to close the deal. That's what twitter is doing now. They're insisting you're right  the billion dollar doesn't cover the  The harm that they've felt but also  Elon musk doesn't want to pay even the billion dollars. No, this is why he's terminated the agreement interestingly though connie his

Transcript:  Public and by the way, I always have to remind myself. It's legal to lie  To the press to the public on twitter his public stance is there's more than five percent of bots  That's unacceptable  In the letter from his lawyers and i'm going to say the name because I love saying it's scadden arp slate meager and flam  In the lawyer from his letter from his lawyers  Did I mention their scadden arp slate meager and flam?  They uh didn't mention the spam bots. They just said twitter has been non-cooperative and has not given us  The information we've asked for in order to assess this problem  They are in fact not giving any evidence that it's not five percent. They're not saying it's it's more than five percent  They're just saying twitter is not being cooperative. That's a different grounds. And by the way a grounds. I don't think he's going to win on  because  Remember this deal was as is he waived  The right to all the due diligence that would normally accompany this kind of merger. He waived it  So and twitter I think has been  I and I think a judge will say has been performative. They gave him the the firehose  They gave him every single tweet half a billion tweets a day  What more could you give him?  Than every bit of traffic on twitter  I think they have been cooperative. So I don't I think he's not going to prevail. This is going to be a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fascinating. Do you think it's possible also that we're underestimating elon that he  uh  Was being smart about this. There's one theory. Uh, this is uh from yahoo finance erin prater  How elon's bizarre twitter takeover?  Saga could just have been a cover for him to sell eight and a half billion in tesla  stock  Maybe he's maybe he's sly as a fox. Maybe this was all a clever ruse  Nobody believes that

Well, elon, will you come and save us and save free?  Uh speech and whatever and by twitter and he's like yes, I will do that for you  But then you know the rubber hits the road and it's like wait a minute like yeah  Yeah, there's money.

Transcript:  I think it's worth zooming out and asking what the next order implications of all of this will be  um  You know we I do some work with government and I I hear often people saying that statesmanship is gone  so the way that  you know  Government and politics is about politicking now unless about policy the politicking is easier. The policy is hard  And people just don't behave the way they used to  I think there's something analogous to what we're seeing in the world of the newer world of business  Um, you know, there's disrupting industries that have been reluctant to respond to emerging technologies, you know and forces  but then there's also disrupting  um  sort of the  the diplomacy of businessers how you know how we've operated and another way to look at this is  You know, do do do other people start to have ideas about manipulating or influencing?  How companies operate?  Um, if elon comes from for you know, elon, let's not forget there was dogecoin  um  We've seen patterns before  You know, what if others emerge and start to do the same thing that the chaos that this ensues that that ensues as a result  You know changes the landscape in a way that I don't think is positive  I think there's positive disruption and I think there's just like disruptive in a bad way disruption, right?

Transcript:  And it has no right and tony planning. I think connie is sort of opening salvo and all of this is right  You know, we're living in this age of sort of high drama all around. Yeah  and um, and that's you know, the again like the  The next order impacts of that aren't purposeful or thoughtful  And I worry a little bit about the positioning  What's left, right?

Start time: 2118.04
End time: 2187.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regardless of the the place where it's happening. Well, I hope I hope to your point that what's left is  people who want to disrupt things get away with the disruption if  Sometimes it does have a positive impact and we can change laws and whatever  But if you're disrupting things and it doesn't work  You have the sec which remember forced him to step down as the chairman  Of a twitter because of his tweets he paid a 20 million dollar fine, which to him is probably the spare change in his pocket  But nonetheless, there are enforcement vehicles and so people will push  uh  And we allow them to get away with it unless there's a recourse and I mean this is what the january 6th hearings are all about  Right, you can do you can say whatever you want  But at the end of the day do some people go to jail for insurrection or manipulation? So will there be repercussions against?  Musk beyond he might have to negotiate with twitter on a larger or smaller billion dollar breakup fee  That's where the that's where the change is going to  you know have  Some impact but only if the institutions are willing to go through the trouble to pursue well, and that's the grave risk because

Start time: 2189.28
End time: 2239.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're teetering right now. And if  There is no consequence to behavior like this  People will lose faith they'll lose faith in the rule of law. They'll lose faith  In our institutions in norms and then all bets are off  And and by pushing it to the brink to see what's going to happen  Yeah, I hope there are consequences  but if they're not the consequence is far greater and I think that the  Serious risk that there will be no consequences for any of this behavior whether it's january 6th elon musk  Or anything else and if there are no the sec is feels pretty toothless  And uh, I think musk thinks he's going to get away with it for sure, right?  And that's bad. I think accountability you lose faith then then the american people will lose faith in our institutions  And that's when it's all over

Start time: 2240.84

Transcript:  And stepped down as the chairman and insisting that he have a lawyer look at all his tweets  Which is obviously not happening. And what is their response?  I think we better investigate that they're under financed and they're and they they are undermanned  Yes, but but and this is the bigger problem  Our institutions are not prepared to handle norm breakers to this degree  We didn't expect anybody like donald trump. We weren't prepared for that  We weren't prepared for elon. The sec is not prepared for somebody who doesn't care  What you or I or the sec thinks?  We expect some level of norms and when it when somebody goes that far  I think  Like mark meadows we freeze  We don't know what we

Transcript:  I don't you know, i'm not willing to write off the sec just yet. I hope um,  I think it will be real interesting in the next few days to see what kind of  Words come out of there. You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of criticism right now  about merrick garland and uh and him not moving fast enough in the doj  in the january 6 investigations  And I think that he like a lot of lawyers is very careful  And you don't you don't mount that case until you know, you can win it and I think that the  I want my sec to be like that. I want them when they when they step forward they've got it  Um, that's fine if they're being uh, if that's what they're doing. Yeah, that's fine  But they need to give some sign that that's that that's what's coming. Well, they don't even need to do that

Start time: 2352.22
End time: 2380.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they they need to at some point act  Remember the point of the sec the whole reason the sec exists is so that people have faith  In the stock market that there is an insider trading going on that the information you as a as a individual investor  Are given is the same as everybody else that it's an equal playing field and as soon as people don't believe that  Forget it  The whole financial system relies upon that trust  So the sec has a very important mandate

Yep  And I I loved using it up until probably two years ago when I think things or when things changed  Um, but the business model never quite worked. It was never going to make sense for this to be ad supported  they did some mna activity, but then  You know when they they acquired nuzzle for example and rather than monetizing that which they should have done because it was a terrific  It could have been a terrific product to work alongside it. They killed it integrated some of it and made it worse. So  um  You know the amount the the price was already inflated  I think the stock price was already inflated and and what was the twitter has a fraction of the number of  maus compared to others in its category, so  You know, there's that

They need a new ceo and they need to  Be somehow funded in such a way that they can be a public benefit  Corporation and not a new mission as well mission. Yeah  Yeah, because they do I mean there's I have to say since the elon thing  I spent a lot more time on twitter and it's there's so much valuable information there  There's a lot of garbage but there's a lot of a lot of valuable information and you kind of are in control of it  And I think since their acquisition of nuzzle, I mean to that point amy they've actually done a good job with the with the topics

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

But anyway, um  I think that's a value that recognizes the  Importance of twitter is kind of a news feed as the dial tone of the this is a product that that basically has not evolved

Start time: 2814.68
End time: 2843.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not not seriously since its launch. So there's a certain also. I mean I um  I uh  Had some conversations with them about why they weren't evolving and the answer I always got was well  The the dna of the place was let's just build it and see what happens. There was no real planning  And you know that may be true in the beginning, but if you're trying to grow and scale a company at some point you have to do  Longer term planning and you have to be able to execute against that plan

In fact, I still can use twitter as I  Use nuzzle which is essentially to see what's going on for the shows  And to bookmark important stories for the shows and it's it's still a good feed of news if you follow the right people and all that  So I hope twitter survives this fracasse

All the journalists that i'm friends with have  You know moved on and you've got discord. You've got keybase. You've got all of these other places now  um and vehicles  Like media has consolidated  Uh, the channels for distribution have changed  You know, um, and so I think it's a little harder to find those important pockets of what's happening and the people who are talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In great numbers. So twitter to both points being made is a great place to find out what's going on  If you follow certain people, but then you first of all create your own filter bubble, right?  So that's an aside, but there is no one place to go to find out, you know everything that's happening  and the advantage of a place like twitter at least at the beginning was that it  It allowed people to know what was going on as quickly as insiders did right?  I worked for bloomberg for many years and they had the headline service, which was basically twitter right before but you had a very expensive  Bloomberg terminal to watch correct you had to pay for that information and then you it was all about making money, right?  Knowing they made money on it because people needed it. They wanted it ahead of the market, right? And so the potential for  twitter to tell you what's happening in the world quickly and to have that information disseminated  You know equally to anybody who subscribes is there but  Obviously that business model and also the use of social media has been so corrupted  That you almost have to hit a reset button  I think on what it needs to be and I agreed that if there was a moment in time where it could have been a utility  for new services to be that  wire service to the world free that people could  Find out what's happening and they would see  Quickly that might have changed some of the way public discourse has gone on in this country

Transcript:  I mean it it is to people who are setting up  Trades and want to act instantly on news because in the world of the stock market and others can speak to this as well  It's about you know having a you know microsecond  Advantage and when you're buying something if it's going up and if it's going down  So there's a lot of automated trades in that system set up to react on news. So  You know  In terms of what's happening generally in the world  I think you can find out that you know the former prime prime minister of japan was assassinated on twitter  You don't need a bloomberg or voyager's terminal anymore to do that  But from a financial perspective where seconds or milliseconds or fractions of a second  Matter with these automated trades there is an advantage, which is why people still buy 2000 a month 24 000 a year

It makes great headlines. It attracts it drives traffic, right connie

Transcript:  No, not gonna happen never gonna happen, uh, i'm sorry to say  Uh, we amy was in portofino when the dobbs decision came down and and i've apologized for harassing you in in italy  Amy because I really wanted to get some women on to talk about that. Yeah, um, there is of course  uh a lot of  Consequences in the in the tech world to this google has now said  They are going to stop tracking  Location tracking when you go somewhere  Sensitive like say an abortion clinic  That is a real problem because that information is is is being sold  And fairly easy to get by third party data brokers and I can just imagine in fact the the president biden  Uh, the white house put out a warning to women saying if you're in one of the states where abortion is illegal  Stop using period tracker apps  Is that really the way to solve this or maybe we need some better privacy protections  The eu uh at least is doing something about it  Uh, the eu has passed now two new  uh regulations the dsa the digital services act and uh, the is it the dma  Digital, I don't know. I've I've lost track of the two different regulations. Uh, yeah the dma  These are not they're related but did cover different things the digital markets act  The dma  Is uh going to require companies like google to stop stop self-dealing  for instance  It's going to affect apple and google's app store  for instance the dsa is a little bit and at least among geeks a little bit more, uh,  controversial because although  It seems to mostly be aimed at interoperability letting making messaging apps for instance  interoperate  um  If you and only if you have 45 million monthly active users, so you have to be a big guy  So it's it's about whatsapp apple companies like that, but there's some concern that the dsa  Oh, no, i'm sorry. The dma is gatekeepers the d so confusing  Um  There's some concern that this interoperability solution will impact end-to-end encryption  Amy, I know you're a fan because you mentioned once again keybase  Which was all about end-to-end encryption and you're using it as a messaging system. It is end-to-end encrypted messaging, right?

Transcript:  Right, so here's what I  you know  China and the united states are  Very far ahead of the rest of the world  in certain areas of tech for example artificial intelligence and  I like to say that the eu's primary contribution in terms of innovation is like policy and regulation  Um, so this is this has been coming for a while. But as with other  especially privacy related regs  You know in enforcement and compliance has always been a real challenge and we already saw that with gdpr  um, what would it actually take for the dma portion of this to be  Enforced. Um, I think the european commission has set up  Some type of task force with a couple dozen people  Um, but you know, they don't just have organizations within europe  And businesses it's anybody who's dealing in any type of information  Anywhere around the world and in that territory and so while it's certainly laudable to make  everything interoperable  The question really becomes like how do they actually enforce this?  um  Will they have the people to do that? I think they're also setting up some type of  commission on or special transport, uh, some type of special group on algorithmic, uh

Start time: 3676.98
End time: 3682.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Transparency, yeah, so again, which is crazy, you know  They somehow want to know what's the algorithm?

Start time: 3683.78
End time: 3737.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, right and you know, that's from I think I think this is going to result in um  You know lots of lawsuits  Uh, the you know, certainly the big tech companies challenging this or or trying to mitigate some of the damage  There's also an advertising piece of this  um, I think the dsa is now banning  Um any type of content that could be considered advertising to miners. Yep  as well as dark patterns  Dark patterns and also pii's so any type of identifiable information that might be used to target you  Let's say in a facebook ad or an instagram ad based on your agenda your gender or your location or things like that  Um, and that's not even an opt-in. I think it's just an outright ban and it also includes politics  So i'm not sure what the fate of political advertising now looks like in europe

Start time: 3738.78
End time: 3802.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh going forward so it's a pretty big game changer. Yeah a monkey wrench in the business model for so many companies  Um, and even though it's only eu as eu goes so goes we've learned from gdpr. So I mean  How many cookie banners did you see this week?  Um, you know, that's not a law in the united states  But because of gdpr and european regulations every site that has european visitors has to adhere to this law  Uh, so this is dramatic and by the way the fines for the dsa  Are six percent of your worldwide revenue  Up to six percent. It could be significant  And more if you fail to double that if you fail to comply  The dma is a mere four percent of global revenue  Um, so cnet let me ask about cnet connie. I I know you're on the news side, but still  Uh, you're you're global, right? You're not gonna say you're not gonna put up a banner that somebody coming in from the eu  Oh, sorry, you can't read our stuff. That would be bad for  a lot of reasons

Start time: 3803.04
End time: 3853.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean we like everyone else has to put up a disclaimer asking people to approve  Cookies or how their information is collected or shared so that you know, uh, that's gdpr right there  That's gdpr and that's an extension  These these two knew the dma and dsa  I think of them slightly differently the dma is about competition and protecting competition from  uh  Protecting companies who want to compete in digital marketplaces in the dsa to me is more about consumer protection and um  Some of the negative effects of you know data collection there  But nonetheless, uh, you know amy spot on you can do whatever you want  And I I get I applaud the eu for taking the lead. These are complicated issues  And if it takes years to levy fines or litigate you're not going to change behavior right away, right?  People are not going to stand up and do the right thing

Start time: 3853.84
End time: 3871.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But gdpr did I mean people even though there hasn't been a while though. It took a while but yet  Well, it's only a few years  And and there haven't been a lot of big fines. So some people are saying well, they're not going to force it or who cares  But it has an effect people pay it good good actors anyway on the internet pay attention

Start time: 3872.78
End time: 3916.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now i'm glad that this these issues are being discussed because you started this question talking about the implications of  The you know the us throwing out roe v. Wade and what effect that has on data collection and we're seeing that  What a mess. Yeah, basically  Has ensued and who's interpreting it and what information and should  Is your is your phone is that data you or now?  Is that a weapon that can be used against you if you're looking for health information?  You know the most personal health information that you can possibly look for so  It's just we're at the beginning of an absolute another mess  in terms of  how these  Regulations and laws come into play in I the who's the winners in all of this the lawyers because there's going to be a lot

Start time: 3916.60
End time: 3951.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of lawsuits lawyers. See you guys you should have gone to law school  The lawyers always win. Actually the only the happiest lawyers I know are former lawyers. So  I'll just throw that out there  Uh, yeah president biden. I don't know how effective it will be but put out an executive order as I mentioned  uh urging the ftc  And other executive entities to examine and reinforce data protection policies  I mean, it's an executive order. It's not an act of congress  um  And it could it could be more performative political  poppycock

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's definitely an issue  And maybe congress needs to act but again legislation and we have this conversation a lot we have people on all  Areas of the spectrum on this subject including some who say that nothing government could do will be of value  uh, i'm kind of more look  maybe government's not perfect, but this the society's chief way of expressing its  Need from these tech companies and letting the tech companies decide is the worst idea  So we got to do something

Start time: 3990.12
End time: 4061.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well, there's an interesting paradox that's gonna have to get resolved because up until roe  tech companies were very much on the side of uh,  you know not controlling not uh  Not allowing a lot of transparency into the flow of data and information  um, and and suddenly this is  You know, this is like covet  In a way because it's it's forcing them into a sea change overnight  Um, there there are states including I think the state of indiana and south carolina  That are actively now working to create laws that will punish anybody for traveling out of state for an abortion  um, you know  Trying to use some of the the human trafficking. I think  Um laws as a backbone for that and part of how they're going to do that is by using license plate scanning technology and then  To the extent they can purchase or get a hold of those third party data  um to to track people using mobile phones  so  I think this is going to force companies finally to come to terms with who exactly you know, are they custodians of of data?  Who gets access to the data? How transparent are they going to be about who's sharing data?

Start time: 4062.60
End time: 4104.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, here's an example. This is from um  tech crunch uh writing about the presidential uh, devin coldway writing about the presidential  uh proclamation or executive order  HIPAA  Is a is a perfect example of the health insurance  portability and  something act  Uh, which protects your privacy of medical records. So that's a federal non-disclosure law  Comes in direct conflict with state forced disclosure laws  States are saying no, no, no, we need to know  You know who went to that abortion clinic?  That's a federal versus state thing. I don't know this is going to go on in the courts for years

Transcript:  Um except so except these state legislatures  So we'll see what the and I guess it you know, this isn't this is one  I guess it's going to be decided in court and far too much of this is decided in court at this point

Start time: 4125.58
End time: 4190.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo I live in I happen to live in one of those  red states that uh  Where a lot of this is going on and in fact, there's that there's a law here in texas that  Anybody can sue anyone else for helping someone else get an abortion  Which was the uh, you know essentially taking  uh  Taking that and putting it in the hands of civil courts  And uh, and it's been it was fairly effective even before roe versus wade and major chilling effect and the legislature  legislators that that uh  Put that bill forward and voted on it are kind of salivating at what they're going to be able to do when the texas legislature meets  In january they meet on odd numbered years  and uh, and there is talk about going after companies like google and apple who want to pay  the travel expenses for their employees to go out of state to get abortions and  And obviously in order to find out about some of that they're looking at data  And it's uh, it's going to be quite the fight in january. Wow

Start time: 4193.00
End time: 4289.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And meanwhile, I don't know if I I can just say one quick thing please. Yes, amy politics aside  This this will have dire economic consequences for every single state that is pursuing  The the edge cases of of enforcing or even expanding on this law or the the change in in  law change in policy  You know  What what are the what are the knock-on impacts? You're going to have businesses  You're going to have changes in workforce. There may be people who decide to stay in the state  But you're definitely going to have people who will look to go elsewhere. Google has said you may relocate for any reason and we won't deny it  You don't have you'll have people who don't like think of the state of texas. You've got some pretty terrific universities  You know if you have a choice to go to rice  For medical school or to go anywhere else, you know  because this isn't  There are other there are research related consequences to this as well  Like I just I don't think people have fully thought through the long-term economic impacts. This is going to bring on their states and communities  So there's a like in addition to everything else  There was a there was a business case and an economic case to be made for why this was such a stupid stupid idea and and  Pursuing it the way  Now that that the states of indiana and some other states are just tells me that the people who are in charge are  Incapable of playing out what the future might look like forward  You know, I would I would do it. I would do it. I would put it another way. I would say

Start time: 4289.94
End time: 4343.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, obviously  I am in favor of i'm very much pro-choice  And if I weren't my wife would kill me  Uh  I would say  There's a mismatch. It's an impedance mismatch. You're asking for long-term strategic planning  the the legislatures  Who are passing these bills?  are not thinking about  And I think actively not thinking about long-term economic consequences  They are trying to save the lives of these unborn children and from their point of view  Unless they're very cynical and i'm going to give them credit for not being cynical. This is merely  a way of stopping this murderous practice of abortion  And so it's it's a mismatch. You're not you're asking to think strategically  But even if you say that well, what about the economic consequences senator? They'll say well, it doesn't matter  We're saving the lives of children

Start time: 4344.28
End time: 4354.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is the result of strategy a very very effective long-term strategy that was master  So so that's that's like the weird paradox here, but i'm gonna get

Start time: 4354.62
End time: 4374.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very same should I give them credit though still for yes, they look at the republicans of atlantis  For 30 years since alito was was put up  You know in the supreme court. It's clearly a very successful long-term strategy  But I still say I don't want to say they're cynical in this  I'm going to say they're doing this because they deeply believe in their heart of hearts that abortion is wrong

Start time: 4376.82
End time: 4429.46

Transcript:  But if they're going to come into one of the big conflicts they're going to come into particularly in states  Like texas and north carolina where they have actively recruited  California based technology companies, you know, there's a huge  Apple presence in austin. There's a huge google presence in austin and in dallas and houston  And they have been recruiting them here  hpe moved to houston they their headquarters are now here and  And they're all saying, you know  We will will pay this and it was a major effort on the part of multiple governors to get them here  And now suddenly you're going to be saying well if you're here, you can't do this action humane action for your employees  And it's you know, you talk about economic consequences  Yeah, you're right because you are going to start having people leave

Start time: 4431.62
End time: 4438.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's what i'm saying is they're not thinking about that  Or maybe they are I mean at tabby they don't care, you know, they don't care and I think

Start time: 4440.02
End time: 4455.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think  I kind of agree that that at the base  Of what you're saying leo that they they they're saving babies  But I also think at this point it's become sport and uh, and they're enjoying the strategy of playing whack-a-mole

Start time: 4457.26
End time: 4513.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know I just want I just want to say there's a  All good points for my columnist and I agree with all of you  But let's remember HIPAA  Is your privacy it protects your privacy when it comes to medical procedures?  and when what we know is when laws are passed people look for loopholes, right and ways to  um, you know change the way that law  was meant to be to suit their own purposes and so there's going to be repercussions there because  Uh, it's your personal, uh, you know health decisions. We've seen that thrown out under the guise of  Uh, some people want to protect some life and discard the life of others. I don't  I don't think it's about saving babies. I think it's about  Supposedly saving babies but at the expense of if you're not going to make exemptions for the life of the mother rape or incest  Then you're ranking life and you're yeah, you're deciding which life that you want to choose. That is not pro-life

Start time: 4514.00
End time: 4517.30

Start time: 4518.14
End time: 4539.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but there's there's definitely now a movement where some of these regulations are being  And in vitro, yeah, whatever. Yeah, so you have the privacy issues around  HIPAA which is is established law and these states are going to start to  Mess with that because they can or they want to or they they're on some sort of because we have a supreme court

Start time: 4539.46
End time: 4541.96

Start time: 4542.86

Transcript:  Right, and then you do have these issues about  Data collection if this device can now be used as a weapon against you that has far-reaching implications  Yeah, not just on businesses and where they want to relocate but how you might want to use  this thing in the future and suddenly purging all of your apps and walking away and maybe it will lead to  Uh terms of service that we can actually all understand right which is  You know coinciding with what the eu is doing and trying to raise awareness about privacy, right?  so it's a messy path that we're on with lots of  Implications and it's just it started in the wrong place  I'm a I was a constitutional law major before I decided I had to go to law school and the throwing away of 50 years of precedent and  Taking back a constitutional right is already unprecedented. And so it wasn't well thought through  Um

Transcript:  Well, they're gonna say oh no, wait a minute. What about brown versus board education? We we have overturned  judicial precedent in the past  Look on a constitutional right that was granted. Yeah, I don't I don't want to get in that  I don't want to be on the other side of that argument  but I also  I think it's important to  Just bring up these arguments against it so that we you know

Transcript:  Here's the here's the rub for  Companies, so it's you know, sometimes these events happen that are so disruptive they force us to confront  The status quo in a way that can be very productive. So if you think about covet which was horrible  COVID forced us to confront things like the use of messenger RNA which had existed for a long time  But didn't have a business case and you know global supply chain volatility and all different types of things like that  You know in a way  one of the  You know, this is a horrific change in america. However, not just like like  abortion aside  This just undermines people's beliefs and institutions even more and it it in a way  Takes away from what the supreme court is and does  The court can't seem can't can't waffle like this especially and if you read like clarence thomas's opinion, it's it's even like worse  however, when positive outcome might be  that  um  We're forced to confront in a very visceral way what data are being collected and safeguarded and this could be something that  winds up helping apple in a weird way  um people may i've you know, i'm actually considering going back to an apple device really differential privacy, yeah  Yeah, and and it could change it could force a change in browser usage, you know, maybe people will switch over to brave  Um if they can figure out how to use it, you know, or they'll switch over to safari and they'll I think

Transcript:  At least with our tech savvy audience that transition has already occurred  I mean we our audience is very privacy aware and I would say this audience is but i'm talking about like my sister  Yeah, you know. Yeah  Well, that's where it starts right because your sister then asks you  Well, gosh, I want to protect my privacy. How do I do that?  And so it starts with the tech, you know the techno savvy who are you know, very privacy focused I think there's a  A general move towards privacy. I was honestly I was  A little bit on the fence saying well, what's the harm if you're just targeting advertising?  The only harm I foresaw is if you had a malicious government that would use the information  Uh big tech had gathered about you against you and now it's happening  So I think now you have a pretty good argument for keeping your stuff private  Uh, it's not just about advertising

Transcript:  one other quick thing so right now a lot of  Digital privacy it is is decided on by the states. So one of the most restrictive states in the country is illinois  Um, which they have a biometric, uh restriction, right?  They do so again if I start thinking through let's set aside abortion for a moment  But the knock-on effects of data and tracing  You know if i'm a business  Um, this is just going to make it very challenging to do business across state lines

Start time: 4826.92

Um, but  But but I think this is this is an opportunity to sort of  Shape the future in a good way. I agree and I agree, you know, yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, it's an inflection point and it's uncomfortable  And it's difficult but it's an opportunity too and that's the right way to look at it. I think  Uh, you know who doesn't want to talk about it the chinese government  Uh, apparently, uh the shang is it the shanghai police force left  their uh personal information of a billion chinese citizens  Online unprotected for a year and a hacker says I got them and i'll sell them  Just a few bitcoin  The news of this has been suppressed all over  China which makes me think it's a real deal, right?  23 terabytes  Of data for 10 bitcoin  the shanghai national police database  leaked  Uh because it was stored, uh  It was it was secured but the interface was not  And somebody discovered it and I guess over the last year has been exfiltrating  All those terabytes of 23 terabytes of information  Any reports about this  In china have been are being suppressed  Post  Probably this podcast will now be suppressed in china. I remember being in china watching cnn  And uh, there was a story about weagers  Well, at least I think there was because cnn just went black for three minutes and then came back as if nothing had happened  So maybe if this podcast goes dark for three minutes, you'll know why you lived in china for a long time.

Transcript:  We got ours about eight months ago and just like you i'm i'm like we're i'm dreading going on this cruise because I won't  I hate sleep  uh good sleep  obviously so important and maybe  Maybe you're lucky you're young you sleep like a baby. You don't know yet  But but there will come a time in your life where sleep is hard to come by and it is rotten  It ruins your life  in fact  Lots of studies say that sleep reduces good sleep reduces the likelihood of serious health issues  It decreases your risk of heart disease it lowers your blood pressure it can even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's  And so many of us 30 it's estimated 30 percent of americans struggle with sleep. You know what the number one issue is  It's too hot or it's too cold temperature  That's why we love the eight sleep pod pro cover. Yes. They sell a mattress  We happen to have a lovely mattress that we don't want to change. So we got the cover  You put it on any mattress and it controls the temperature from as low as 55 degrees, which is pretty chilly  Or as high as 110 degrees, which is pretty warm  And it changes it through the night  The eight sleep cover actually watches your sleep and based on your sleep stages on your biometrics  On the bedroom temperature it actually reacts intelligently to create an optimal sleep environment clinical data shows that eight sleep users  experience up to 19 increase in recovery  And 32 improvement in sleep quality 34 more deep sleep for me deep sleep is the holy grail  I you know if I can get  More than half an hour deep sleep every night and you could find that out by the way  From the eight sleep app because it's going to tell you I know I will have a great day and if I get less I will not  That's because that deep sleep is where your brain is  Recovering is it's the garbage clear out on your brain getting rid of all those prions and and expelling them is so important  The eight sleep I everybody's different, but I I I have this complete made-up theory  Of evolutionary science that I made up that in history  We've always gone to bed, you know the fires we stoked the fire you go to bed. It's still warm. Maybe you even have one of those  Colonial times they had those bed warmers they put some coals in and they put in the so you go to bed  You're in a nice warm cozy bed. You fall asleep  And then over the night it gets chillier and chillier, which is fine  That's when you go into your deep sleep cycle and then in the morning  If you're lucky you get a nice cup of coffee and you wake up  This is in a way to to duplicate that experience what I think we're biologically programmed  To so I have it warm when I get in bed  And then I have the temperature slowly decline as I go into deep sleep  It helps me deep sleep and then it goes back up again to wake me up  There's even a little vibration that you can put in there to so you gently wake up, which I love  Eight sleep is amazing  And we're going to get you a very good fourth of july savings, but it's only oh gosh  You got to go today through july 10th.

Transcript:  Crypto currents well, you know, there's a difference between the underlying technology and distribute a distributed technology  as a counter to closed networks, which I think underpins  uh blockchain and nfts and then there's  crypto and nfts as a source of scams and concerns and hype so those are two different  two different things, um, obviously there's a lot of  Hype and a lot of distrust of people hyping  cryptocurrencies and nfts and i'm sorry if you bought an nft for  $50,000 and now it's only worth a thousand. I don't know what to tell you but uh  Underlying all of that is a new way of looking at technology in the world that I think a lot of people say is

Maybe if you're black you feel disenfranchised  You don't feel like the scent, you know, red lining's been a huge problem central banking system  Not your friend.

There's a lot of hype  There is distrust of government, which is what was driving the whole interest in bitcoin in the first place  but I think also  there is some  bad marketing and pr celebrities hawking things and  Folks saying I don't know what it's about, but I missed everything else. So I just want to get in on this, right?  So that that plays  To part of it as well. Yeah  Unfortunately

Transcript:  We'll say that financial institutions because we work with a lot of them are trying are are thinking creatively right now about value creation and  you know what what might the future look like where  Many things generate value and you can use that value in different ways  What if there was an exchange where there were different types of value that you know?  so  I I think this is like the big the opening sort of beginning  experimentation phase but if you talk to a lot of people especially people in tech about blockchains  You know oftentimes this the the use case that people are coming up with for blockchains  Is like way overly complicated and existing technology will do just fine  But beyond that they're you know

Who says he's a senior staff researcher at the international computer science institute lecture in the uc berkeley computer science department  Uh is a has been studying cryptocurrency for years and he says all cryptocurrencies should die in a fire  He says cryptocurrencies although a seemingly interesting idea are simply not fit for purpose. They do not work as currencies  They are grossly inefficient. They are not meaningfully distributed in terms of trust risks involving cryptocurrencies  occur in four major areas  And and by the way, he wrote this in may but this has all come true technical risks to participants  economic risks to participants  systemic risks to the cryptocurrency system and societal risks when we're just starting to see the societal risks  Uh, he said in a lecture this year. This is a virus its harms are substantial  It has enabled billion dollar criminal enterprises for instance  I I don't think ransomware would be the business it is if it weren't for the easy way  to to anonymously collect bitcoin  Uh going on with his quote. It has enabled venture capitalists to do securities fraud as their business  It has sucked people in  So either avoid it or help me make it die in a fire  So I I have also said that argument. Oh, there's the underlying technology that is of interest block chains of interest  Decentralized ledgers of an interest maybe a stable coin a digital currency for a governmental currency  Maybe that's of interest but his he says, you know, there's nothing good to come out of this  Bitcoin uses the energy of a small to mid-size country  Um anyway  Do you want to defend it anybody  Is he wrong should we all be paying attention I think that the the um

Transcript:  Um, no, I don't think that's going to happen. Uh  I mean I can't  Get into too much detail, but we  work with  banks and  Key players in the financial ecosystem  Um, we're too deeply entrenched to totally disenfranchise our current banking structure  You could argue though does a credit card need to exist in the future if there are other means of transferring and storing value  um, so  I again, I think this is we're just  In process on an evolution  Yeah, um  and uh, you know 10 years from now  You could I could see distributed computing systems in our kitchens where our  The unused compute from our connected refrigerators are earning fractions of a penny  um, and maybe our  Comcast or you know some third party has come in and built a system  Where we earn credits back and um, you know, everybody's creating value  I think that there are platforms like roblox that have current roblox second life

He's a super interesting guy, but he had an interesting take on web 3 hype  You know, he said web 3 is a lot like web 1 which is to say infrastructure layer  Um, it's web 4 so the thing that comes afterwards that is in a way more compelling or as jack dorsie would call it  web 5  Layer comes in.

That was the original name of it killed it. But yeah  They killed it. Um, they killed it shortly after that. But um, you know, there was a lot of argument in the room  um  About what they were trying to build I was in a session after that  With the head of singapore singapore was moving ahead on its own cbdc  so  I I think a lot of  Governments have been dancing around this but their interpretation of what's being built and I think the sort of conversation on reddit  It's a pretty big chasm  Yeah

I don't know initially the idea of starlink was you had to have a fixed address  But they always promised that at some point, uh, they would be able to do it in mobile environments. Let me look starlink  for rvs  Let's see how much it costs right now by the dollars for the hardware  And then 135 bucks a month. So it's a little more expensive  Than uh land-based non-mobile non-mobile starlink, which by the way whose price has gone up  It is now 110 a month, but for an extra 25  You could be uh, you could be driving around in your rv.
