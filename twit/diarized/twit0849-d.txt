Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've heard people listen to tweet. I've heard that  Anyway, I'm thrilled to have both of you here. I  Don't know exactly where to start this week. It's it's kind of a grab bag  Let's start with Twitter because they launched their first maybe no not their first paid product  But their first widely available paid product the Twitter blue  subscription  Service and of course being the Twitter  Flunky that I am I immediately paid even though I have no idea what I'm getting Paris. I did too you did too. I

Start time: 322.98
End time: 367.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember reading about it in Casey Newton's newsletter platformer and I pause  got up  Don't know why and then  Subscribe to Twitter blue. I don't know  I just I use Twitter so much that frankly I should be paying a little bit  That's kind of what I felt like like they I oh, but also I really enjoy the functionality of nuzzle  which is a app company that Twitter ended up buying that allows you kind of to  See what your friends and people in your network on Twitter  What links they are tweeting or commenting on and they have put that feature in Twitter blue  We're on the browser. You can see the top articles in your network  And frankly that to me alone is worth 2.99 in a month. I that was

Start time: 369.46
End time: 380.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did it's not nuzzle  But it's funny to say that because Paris because it's exactly the thing that got me to subscribe  I was so mad when Twitter bought nuzzle and within unceremoniously within a week just pulled the plug

Start time: 380.98
End time: 382.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely ridiculous. Yeah

Start time: 383.50
End time: 474.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jonathan Abrams who founded nuzzle and I think is friends to him  He was also one of the most brilliant guys out there in tech  He's just like slightly too early on a lot of different things. So yeah, he was friendster pre myspace pre, you know Facebook  he had launched nuzzle and  originally what it was an intelligence tool and  again, I think it was just slightly too early and Twitter should have seen the this functionality and and  They should they should have done something with it much earlier  They just they didn't and the way that I used it was that I created a whole bunch  I had like hundreds of Twitter lists that I had made that are all private. Mm-hmm. I didn't want to follow those accounts  Instead I used it as an intelligence gathering tool  And so I had one that was just like very like one just having to do with robots and I had another one that was  specifically about an area of drones  And I had nuzzle set up to ping me because you used to be able to set a threshold so you could set it as  Like five three or two  For how many people shared that same article or were talking about the same thing? So basically what I got was a curated view  Across individual topics all day long on the app and it was like the most amazing thing  Then yeah, it got bought by scroll got bought by which then got bought by Twitter. They shut it down. It's back  But I don't I don't find it super useful now because you know if you follow a lot of people  You basically wind up with the sim with an echo chamber. You don't have all the settings that we had

Start time: 475.38
End time: 483.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the new Twitter page. There's a new little flame icon  It says top articles and this is their version of nuzzle. The one thing I do like

Start time: 484.52
End time: 486.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Available in browser too. Yeah

Start time: 487.88
End time: 491.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nope, it's available on the app. You can't but it's nice in the iOS

Start time: 491.70
End time: 496.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not it is on Android I think it's no no, it's I think it's on Android but not iOS. Oh

Start time: 498.29
End time: 529.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me look at my iOS  so the one thing I do like which is a  It's a little bit better functionality than nuzzle nuzzle would have a list of all the people who tweeted it and you could click their  Names now when you click on the article, you'll see on the right the conversation all the tweets about it  I think I do like that a little bit better, but it you know, Amy if you have one forte, it's it's a  Advanced usage of online tools because I never did any of that tweaking to nuzzle. I liked it well enough  Twitter tweaking the Twitter tweaking

Start time: 530.80
End time: 586.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is my this is my second job in my very very very long ago career when I was starting out  I was a journalist and  My feeling was I needed to automate as much as I could  Because there's only so many hours in the day to do recording and I was looking for stuff that nobody else had so  Over you know, I've I've figured out ways to cobble together automated systems and I do now as well  But but that feature on nuzzle  You know, listen, I would have happily paid Twitter years ago and I'm paying them now  But I think that they really  Multiple times have missed opportunities to monetize in a thoughtful way to  Improve tools because the other thing that comes with blue is technically you can edit but you there's an a window  So if you like drunk tweet and you recognize what's happening or you you know, you can see the tweet  You can pull the plug on it. I think that you have like a minute. Yeah, it's just

Start time: 586.20
End time: 592.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like the undo send feature in Google  It's not really a good it just gives you a minute to think yeah

Start time: 593.16
End time: 601.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it also doesn't show it doesn't reveal to you the tweet immediately. So you kind of there's a couple of steps involved  Again, it just seems like take a breath

Start time: 602.04
End time: 622.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feature yeah, like before you tweak so you're right here. So I'm looking at iOS version of Twitter blue and  I see that I have Twitter blue turned on but there is no  Corresponding top articles. So I guess it's only on on Android right now this rolled out  Initially, I think like in Australia in a couple of countries not the US it just rolled out this week in the US

Start time: 623.62
End time: 673.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see if they can make money is that yeah, basically like I don't know if you guys got this option  Also when you signed up when I set up for Twitter blue it asked me to do some survey  Specifically selecting what features about Twitter blue were you most interested in?  What you know, would you like to see more development in and I specifically selected the top articles feature?  But I hope that survey and the whole existence of Twitter blue generally means that there's maybe going to be more  Energy and kind of development focus on  Products like this because Twitter historically had not really been the app that would I don't know  How is much leeway in regards to developing stuff?  They generally kind of kept things the same but I'm hoping that you know  The advent of spaces and now Twitter blue means that maybe at some point we could get some of our nozzle features back

Start time: 673.50
End time: 685.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think part of the issue so Biz Stone and I are know each other were both fellows at an Oxford University program  And we were both on this thing a couple of weeks ago and he was

Start time: 687.12
End time: 695.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The way that Twitter sort of got by the way the creator of Twitter but no longer associated with it, right?  He's probably still got a lot of stock is or Jack or of Jack

Start time: 697.48
End time: 749.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And biz are kind of off. Yeah, so I've brought biz on when they were at  Before blogger, right? I guess audio or they were blogger than they went to audio anyhow  You know in those early days of the continual fail-will  They I don't think they had a really long-term roadmap and they were kind of just building as they went and so  You know it was kind of a clue together system to begin with and people started using it in ways  They really hadn't imagined and the problem is you get soup, you know so far down the road  And you wind up with a system that?  It's it's it's challenging to do pre testing and to sort out what you know to sort out product features  And I think they just don't have a culture of longer term mapping  So it doesn't surprise me that they acquired  tried to roll out some features and you know

Start time: 750.72
End time: 802.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not sure what I think that that's a really good description of Twitter even today. It's completely ad hoc  Whatever the hell let's try something Jack Dorsey who's running it these days has talked about  some sort of federated  Open source version of Twitter. I think they're spending money on that. They just hired somebody to run Twitter's  Bitcoin initiative whatever that is. I still feel like it coin to it. No, they better not call it that but I think  They can call it anything they want but twit coin, but I but I think that  In a way, that's the charm of Twitter  I also have to say that probably 90% of the people listening to this show even  Couldn't care less what happens to Twitter and then the general public even less  So Twitter is very much kind of an inside Silicon Valley thing. I think am I wrong?

Start time: 802.92
End time: 861.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, I would say Silicon Valley and media. Yeah. Yeah, and politics. Yeah, but but it does matter because  you know  so so so Facebook could go away tomorrow and  I would argue that it wouldn't matter to most people that I know  But there are small businesses that now use those tools  And and rely on them in some cases and then there's the rest of the ecosystem, right?  Twitter doesn't really operate that way and if Twitter went away tomorrow  It would be sad for those of us who use it still but it's not an essential technology  So I think they're gonna have to make a decision at some point about how they become essential now outside of a political cycle  There's this concentrated there's like a concentration of attention which then has a spillover effect and what winds up on Twitter  You know eventually winds up as part of the the looping that happens in the political cycles  And so there is a certain amount of power there

Start time: 861.44
End time: 866.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because of the media connection though, right because the media picks up and it really was the case during President Trump's

Start time: 867.82
End time: 877.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Incumbency because right which is why if this nuzzle feature had existed during that cycle  I would not have used it would have been a maddening because it just would have been everybody staring

Start time: 878.62
End time: 901.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It still is by the way, let me see here top articles memo from Trump attorney  emails reveal new details of Trump White House  Yeah, what's on the top of your news feed  Top of my feet is you're right. This is this is kind of

Start time: 902.84
End time: 916.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm showing I'm a little bit of a peek behind the same issue. I've got the memo from Trump. Yeah, I've got the Biden  Polls I got that I've got Trump. I've got polls. I've got and I did not know this but Petra Mayer

Start time: 916.60

Start time: 954.04
End time: 957.64

End time: 961.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are your top five articles and are you are you a Moderna or are you a yeah?

Start time: 963.18
End time: 983.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moderna or biotech? Yes  And what's your maiden name? Yeah, I'm leading off with a story that I have just said nobody cares about but you're right  It has some importance in media and politics  There are some you know, there's some areas  That it matters and I guess it's the big tech story of the week so there I

Start time: 985.38
End time: 1017.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't know. I do think it matters brought more broadly speaking because you know, I think it's my observation that  You've got the enormous companies that are potentially dealing with regulatory action or at least  Calls for regulatory action Twitter's been largely absent from a lot of that  Yeah, they're gonna have problems on the street at some point that you know  They're they're public and  You know are people throwing ad dollars at Twitter are they finding other ways to engage digital audiences?  Well, that kind of thing I think from a business standpoint

Start time: 1018.26
End time: 1035.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of think it does matter it could be it could be a measure of how little Twitter matters that they are not  Scooped up with this big anti, you know the tech lash. I guess we should call it  Microsoft and Twitter seem to be mostly unscathed  Meanwhile Google Amazon Facebook and Apple

Start time: 1036.48
End time: 1049.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft had already been scared. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, they're unscathed only because you know their period of  Scrutiny has passed once scathed twice shy I guess. Yeah

Start time: 1051.44
End time: 1159.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, so actually we should maybe mention  Google and  the  State Attorneys General we've talked a lot about this. There is more information in this antitrust  Complaint against Google including the revelation that Google had something called project Bernanke  Which is a strange name wasn't he the chairman of the Fed at this time? I don't understand  What this had to do with them they had it was a according to the  The lawsuit and again, this is Google hasn't responded. This is a lawsuit by  The state of Texas and I think about 20 other states the lawsuit highlights Google's use of a secret program  Dubbed project Bernanke in 2013  They used bidding data to give its own ad buying an advantage  And this is kind of the central of the claim is that Google both was the house and the gambler in this ad in its in  its online ad sales  For example, according to Reuters in 2015  Google allegedly dropped the second highest bids from publishers auctions  Dropped them accumulated money into a pool then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging to advertisers who use Google Ads  They otherwise would have lost the auctions. So that's a clear example of self-dealing  Alphabet has not responded  To this Google also this week lost an appeal in the European Union  Which sued it saying it favored its own Google shopping results in the search results they have to pay now  2.8 billion dollars to the EU which you know, is this now we're talking some real money  It's not maybe enough to chase in Google, but it's a significant amount of money. I

Start time: 1161.88
End time: 1203.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean the thing that I think sticks out to me when we're looking at these specific cases is the resemblance clearly to the cases that  Are currently being talked about or brought in the US against Amazon in that they are also at their core about  The owner and controller of a powerful platform or marketplace  Also being a participant in that and giving themselves an unfair advantage  which I feel like is clearly kind of the through line in  this  Techlash that we're seeing that it seems like there's no way to  Ethically be both the  Dealer and the person, you know

Start time: 1204.06
End time: 1223.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Putting their cards in Amy you wrote you wrote the big nine two years ago  How the tech Titans and their thinking machines could warp humanity  This was more about AI  But does this fit in with your thesis on the book the way that these companies are right manipulating the markets?

Start time: 1224.40
End time: 1251.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does so the book was about AI but it was also about the business implications and governing implications and regulatory implications  related to AI and  the the  Idea is that there are six companies in the US three in China  The Chinese companies are obvious by do Alibaba Tencent in the US. It's it's Google Amazon Apple  Microsoft Facebook IBM and  Who am I forgetting?

Start time: 1254.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should Amazon Amazon

Start time: 1257.36
End time: 1311.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and and  You know the listen the problem is that  We didn't have any regulatory  the the Sherman Act which gets brought up all the time is  probably not applicable because at least in the case of Amazon and you would have to bring a very very narrow case and  As it relates to e-commerce and Amazon  So it's just as Paris mentioned right you've got  You've got a company that has all the data and has a sense of what people are searching for  algorithms that can  Determine what probability people will purchase based on where the proximity of where they see the item at what time and at what price point  So I get all of that except that there are grocery stores who do the exact same thing in the physical world and it's not  Automated right but I

Start time: 1312.82
End time: 1318.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact the the argument that Amazon has always brought right and I'm not trying to be an apologist for Amazon

Start time: 1318.70
End time: 1344.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to be pragmatic here, but you know I I bought this this I bought the Buddha's hand at Wegmans today and  At Wegmans, which is a grocery store on the on the East Coast. It's a grocery store chain  You know they have a habit of selling a wide away of array of products  Looking to see what's doing well, and then they will  You know completely copy the products that are best-selling

Start time: 1344.74
End time: 1348.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My guess is you're not gonna see a house label Buddha's hand at Wegmans

Start time: 1348.78
End time: 1379.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but no, but but my friend Kara Goldin started a company called Hintwater and  She you know she  Sweat equity like built this business and did a amazing amazing job of it and has a tremendous product  It was cool after she launched to see Hintwater in Wegmans, you know stores and  You know it was super popular and within a year Wegmans was now selling the exact same product the same  Weird shaped bottle with the labeling and everything. That's hysterical

Start time: 1379.92
End time: 1384.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's gone on since you know since time and memorials exactly

Start time: 1385.06
End time: 1401.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the question is the question is why do we come down on Amazon for this practice, which should be fair  There's data that you can you can automate more but we do not make the same legal arguments at  Some of the grocery stores that are doing the same thing. It's fine. I just read Amazon Unbound

Start time: 1401.68
End time: 1449.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is the Brad stones follow-up terrific Brad is such a good  Yeah, we all agree  And he talks about this specifically and it's interesting because Amazon must have suspected that there was a problem because they had  Supposedly lots of controls to keep the data that was being gathered  By these third-party sellers on Amazon from being used by the people on Amazon or figuring out what products Amazon should make  It might have been a pretty porous wall because there seems to be a lot of you know, it's not correspondence magically  But they knew they must have known there was some reason not to do this. Nevertheless, the defense is well  We're not doing anything different than every grocery store has done from time and memorial. What is the difference?  Is there a difference and why don't my stores get in trouble?  I mean your friend who made hint. Yeah, probably pity pretty pissed off about the whole thing

Start time: 1450.90
End time: 1497.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably I also know that they white label  Domino sugar and so their Wegmans brand sugar is made the same facility. That's often the case of these house brands. Yeah  Right. So, I mean, I'm sure that that that the these originator dominoes is just getting slightly less margin on the product  So everybody's making money  But what does that so like think about it from a consumer's point of view ultimately you then have less choice because  You've now gone from an array of products and brands to basically one brand  You're gonna be hard-pressed to find competition on the shelves and from a again just a practical point of view  I don't see the difference so much between what we what we accept in the physical realm and what we rail against in the digital  realm I

Start time: 1498.20
End time: 1539.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think the only difference really is that the digital realm has made it so that  It is a lot easier to see this happening at a lot larger scale  versus, you know once everybody's  like the eastern coast grocery store or publics down south or something like that, it's not as  immediately visible of an issue  For people to get mad about them  And I mean I think that this is ultimately going to lead to some hard thinking perhaps from  US or EU regulatory bodies about whether or not this practice online or offline is  something that you know, they want to legislate I think it also comes down to

Start time: 1542.14
End time: 1550.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The perception that Amazon is  Completely dominant which they're demonstrably not in online commerce. That's the other defense

Start time: 1551.10
End time: 1557.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not in any area where they are area that's their constant defense. Yeah, but I think if you thought

Start time: 1558.55
End time: 1579.88

I think I think he is eccentric  Right, but my point is like nobody nobody gets very few people who are probably listening to the show are angry at Elon Musk for  Forcing the auto market to change right to accept and start innovating around batteries and right  Bezos you could argue Jeff has done the same thing  It's just much more distributed and it's in the fields of artificial intelligence and pharmaceuticals like all these other places, right?  And and everybody gets pissed off at Bezos, right and everybody gets pissed off at Amazon, you know  Elon Musk doesn't own a majority of the auto market  But he's had an outsized influence in dictating what the future look like just like that's analogous to Jeff  But everybody so I think this has more to do with personality and and look netnet on the wealth side of things  They are analogous  I think it comes down to likeability as it always does and liking the brand and everybody likes to you know select your

Transcript:  Yeah, Amazon is often at the top of kind of consumer sentiment surveys  But I think that it is also has to do with the fact that Amazon's dominance in a number of categories has really  Skyrocketed at a rate that Tesla could never hope to match him. That's kind of my position is that there I mean  For 83% of all sales of books music or video that's too much  Commerce that is and 50% of computer or consumer electronics and it's dominance is increasing in a variety of like  other categories that make sense for e-commerce, which is I think where the  You know looking at the 40% of overall e-commerce  Perhaps isn't the right number because one place where Amazon's probably never gonna dominate is clothing because it's really difficult to  You know  Not that they're not trying  Trying quite a bit, but I think that I mean another aspect of this is the Jeff Bezos equation which I  recently just published this article on Friday about  Going into the recent history of Amazon's  Communications and PR team and kind of one thing that I learned through this is that starting in you know, 2015  2017 as Jeff Bezos was inching closer and closer to being the richest person in the world his PR team  Started to think about it as a serious PR problem and they  His Twitter account they launched his Instagram  They're like, how do we turn soften Bezos into kind of a you know  Humanized him turn him into kind of a swashbuckling fun guy that he's not gonna be the target of all these tacks  I mean it seems like whether or not they've been successful on that.

It was that dot.io  Filesharing thing that he was doing it was so cool  anyway  Good to have both of you Paris Martino from the information Amy Webb futurist and  Buddha's hand lover  We're gonna get more into this and in fact  I want to talk about the great resignation because that also ties into this a little bit  What there is it seems to be in the wake of kovat?  There is something going on something disruptive something almost  Like an earthquake to the United States to its economy to its medical system  I'm very curious what you all think about that, but we'll get to that in a second our show today brought to you by  IT pro  TV whether you're a seasoned IT professional or somebody who wants to break into IT  I know anybody who listens to our shows we know you you love technology. Maybe you'd like to make that your career  This is the best way to do it IT pro TV  It's the community you need and I've known Tim and Don the founders since before it began  They created IT pro TV because it was the training they wanted for themselves  they'd been doing classroom training and they and they said, you know be really good if we could do this on the internet and  And and boy have they grown seven studios now in their Gainesville, Florida headquarters filming every day Monday through Friday  Why so much? Well, because this stuff is a constantly moving target the tests for the certifications change and you have to constantly update  You also of course, there's new software new versions  Courses go from their studios to their course library in 24 hours  It's of course information but they make it entertaining because they hire people who are not only experts in the field  But who can really communicate people like Tracy and Adam right there  They're edutainers and they also are on staff all of their trainers, which means you can get assistance from them at any time.

Transcript:  Well, it depends on what you mean by worry, um  You were kind of defending them  Yeah, I listen I I  Don't like I  We have we have a crisis and the crisis in the United States is that you know, we're living through this grand experiment  because you know outside of Kovac there are other things that are happening and  We for a very long time took a lot of money outs out of science and technology research and development  We're sitting on the precipice of some core technologies that will fundamentally alter how we relate to each other how business is done  how governing is done and  We've we've sort of farmed out basic research to the to the private sector  so if if everybody wants Amazon to stop doing stuff and you know  Change then we're gonna have to funnel billions of dollars into  Public R&D efforts and  Establish moonshots and actually go after them because if we don't do that, we're gonna have geopolitical problems going forward  It's as simple as that

Transcript:  Government has always been super important. I mean the internet was created by the government  It's been super important in all of this kind of fundamental R&D because government could spend a lot more money  But there's always been private industry like, you know Bell Labs

Start time: 2306.30
End time: 2331.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but they're doing it in a different way. So the original Bell Labs there was more public-private  Intersections, you know these companies were blue sky  It was more blue sky. It was also, you know, they were building entirely  They were building new ideas, right? The problem is that outside of DARPA and IARPA which are focused on  Military posture like we don't have those systems in place

Start time: 2331.94
End time: 2355.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I would say that's a good thing because in fact almost always it was with a military eye. It was an eye towards  defense or  Offense it was the war machine. And so all of these technologies came out of the war machine  I would submit maybe that this is a better thing if it's coming out of other  Look how space has taken off when it became a public and private partnership

That's a dumb  Process that's a stupid way to operate instead there need to be there needs to be a way to  bridge the divide between government tech and  Finance, I mean this is like a three-sided prisoners dilemma situation where they each one feels as though they're operating on their own and they're powerful and  They don't have anything to gain from collaborating  not really  when we all know that if there was a way to get them to incent them to collaborate on and to start doing some of  This work so that it was more defined by public good and long-term values and we'd all benefit

Transcript:  I know you look at the future, but let me and I don't but  So I don't have I don't have a crystal ball, but it looks to me and you correct me if this is a completely  crazy analysis it looks to me like the  Government in the United States has become increasingly dysfunctional  and as a result  Nothing is controlling the growth of big tech the directions big tech research takes  Big tech is in effect. It happened during kovat  In effect, but they even just a tech problem big business big business. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right  It's not just tech you're right Paris, but business has stepped up and said look we'll take it from here  But there is definitely in that in that Silicon Valley has that mentality of we're we're technocrats  We understand this much better than government government's dysfunctional.

That's how we got to surveillance capitalism out of control. Yeah, correct, and these are these are publicly traded companies  They are designed to earn revenue  And they should and I'm saying that people should be you know people and companies should be able to earn money  But we need to do this in a way that doesn't damage us in some ways in the future  And I think you can strike a balance, but from an outs like outside of this country  I you know every time I'm in a room with with people from other countries looking at us  Especially when it comes to the internet and digital systems. We we don't we don't look great  You know I think anybody would argue with our ingenuity and creativity  But at what cost is the question that I think they ask oftentimes who was it said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so if you dive in so they are the ones who are tracking the employment data and if you dive in  To how they've categorized jobs and you look at journalists. No  Modern journalism jobs are listed. There are jobs for like I don't even know like I'm a suit. There's a type setters  Disc jockey literally the words disc jockey are there. Yeah, but  Podcaster is not there. No, and as we all know if you have bad data in you're gonna get bad data out on the other end  So I think you know, it's one thing to say everybody's quitting their jobs. All of these jobs are open  You know WTF the economy but it's another thing to get actual data out there and if and you know the economists  My academic backgrounds in in economics and game theory and I I don't think a single economist would have predicted that we'd hit  $80 oil barrel prices that we would have this topsy-turvy situation  With the workforce, you know and part of the problem is that we're not counting people in their jobs correctly  Especially in the tech sector. Oh my god, like like the tech like tech sector jobs are completely misrepresented in those data sets  I just that's why I just that's an interesting about the BLS

Transcript:  Wonder so French Revolution aside. I wonder if there's another story and that's that's on the  Employer side so like I've got a close friend who's an avid listener to twit  Who's a brilliant?  Chief technology officer and as are all our listeners yes, I mean he's he's amazing  Yeah, and he got laid off because the company is going through all these changes. He's having a heart  He's in his 40s. He's having a hard time finding a job  I've got another friend who's another pen like penetration tester all up on his certifications and things and  There are jobs, but the you know  He's there are new criteria in the post  You know in this current co vid world, so I'm wondering how much of this outside of the usual suspects like the like  restaurants I wonder how much of this is employers digging in their heels and  Mandating that work is like it used to be but we're all living in this we don't want it  Right where yeah, or maybe it's not we don't want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think this is also what you're seeing in the logistics industry  We're currently having you know the supply chain crisis and all supply chain  Crises and that's in some way in a lot  I mean half of it is extra bit is made worse by the fact that there are not are not enough truck drivers  There are not enough warehouse employees to unload the trucks if they could get there  There are not enough people to crew the ships that will take the thing to be put in the truck all  aspects of the labor equation are kind of falling apart because  Employers are having a hard time in track  attracting employees well

Start time: 3584.06
End time: 3609.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many employers went down the uber route  This is I read it  There was a great medium post by a truck driver saying part of this is a lot of companies are hiring truck drivers as  Contractors and they're paying them per job  But if you have to wait 12 15 20 hours to get a container at the container port  You don't get paid you don't get paid for that so people are just saying it's not it's not worth it to drive a truck

Start time: 3610.50
End time: 3658.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the thing is that the trucking industry has long said oh, we have a labor shortage  They've been saying that since like the 80s and it probably goes back to you know right around 70s 80s  There was a great  deregulation of the trucking industry in the US in particular and since then  Truckers are paid. You know only a cup a handful of cents per mile  They don't really have benefits they have jobs they have to be out  You know away from their family for weeks many of them have to purchase their own vehicles and handle off their own  Licensing so they end up in a lot of debt to the companies. It's not a good job and people  Shockingly don't want to do it when the labor market is tight. They are like why would I do that when I could do anything else?

Start time: 3659.10
End time: 3738.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would add one other problem, and it's it's the it's not automation which is the story we hear all the time  It's the threat of automation so in a lot of these positions like trucking  Or the trades you have to go through  Extensive training you have to get special licenses you have to in some cases join unions and the trades have been having similar  problems that that predate kovat, but people are not willing to go into these fields anymore in part because  America has told everybody that if they don't go to a four-year college then like they're not welcome  And that trade schools are pointless which is a stupid message to be sending  But if you're constantly talking about AI and the robots coming to take your jobs  Just before the robots come to kill us on our sleep  You know then you're sending a message that shortages or no shortages  We don't need we you know like why would I why would I go through the process that that Paris just described to get this job?  And trucking if like my if I'm not gonna need to do this anymore in five years because the robots are gonna dry  Yeah, we've been told that right we've been told that which is not true, and it's on a longer trajectory  But we haven't effect like we should be figuring out ways to encourage people  And to make it more equitable reasonable for them to work these jobs in in chess

End time: 3820.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well fear tends to drive a lot of our decision-making unfortunately  We we aren't as motivated by the promise of something different because that implies change so in my field  We're constantly contending with do we motivate people using  You know more dystopian scenarios to get them to see  Opportunity on the other side or what is it that we do and people just respond more to fear than than they do to  You know possible opportunities for change. Yeah, that's you know  Well, you're the futurist get on it. Yeah, I'll get right on that. Can I ask?  Actually, could I ask Paris a question related to Amazon's you might love it?  So Paris it relates to trucking by any chance  Have you been following Amazon's weird very quiet project around coal mining and trucking and coal mines coal mining?  specifically

Transcript:  Unsure about the trucking I'm unsure about the mining aspect but Amazon over the last couple of years has made considerable investments into  Its trucking network, but not in the point of  Amazon's actual  Direct paid truck drivers. It specifically has created kind of this uber like app  Called Amazon relay that then they can use to get independent contractors to either use  Amazon's trucks or their own trucks to haul Amazon loads  But part of that requires them using the navigation software built in which they hate right  The truckers hate because they it often gets things totally wrong and I mean there's a lot of funny side effects  I found were like there'll be some dead-end street in West Virginia  that every day gets dozens of Amazon tractor trailers stuck in it and  Has accidentally knocked over, you know gravestone story about?

Transcript:  So your stuff arrives on time Amazon understands that logistics is a big part of its business  But this is exact this to me is exactly what scares people about Amazon is they go  Oh, they have a finger in that pie. Oh, they have a finger in that pie  They they're the fear that eventually we're gonna be living in in in Amazon land and they're gonna have a finger in every pie

Transcript:  well, they have they we could have literally been living in Amazon land for  For a hot minute Amazon had partnered with Lenar, which is America's largest home builder  That's right. They were building echo house. Yeah, right  So they were building houses that had that were outfitted completely with Amazon products and came with on-site tech support  And if you wanted such an Amazon smart home  Completely outfitted with all of these different products and a smart home system that to some degree was interoperable  You could actually go to Amazon calm and look for one of those houses. So for a while they had a partnership with  Sotheby's some of the big readers, right?  And it was called turnkey and you went to that page you typed in your wherever you were looking and it would spit out  It would automatically connect you with a retailer who could sell you an Amazon home  So the thing to me I actually went with all of this to the Fed and I said we work with the Federal Reserve  Sometimes and I said listen, I don't think Amazon's permanently in the housing business. However, what does it mean that?  Theoretically a third party could have better and more real-time like the real-time piece of this is key  real-time  accurate housing market data then the government you  government and they could potentially correlate those data points with like  Where are people shopping in what neighborhood? How much people you know, like are you eating?  Microwave popcorn and once it got delivered to your house on a Tuesday in the middle of afternoon  Are you using your spoken interface your Alexa powered?  $59 Amazon basics microwave, you know to pop the popcorn  Your entire life becomes this one enormous data stream and if you go to if you go to throw away the empty bag  There's a little scanner attachment this exists by the way  That's Alexa powered that you can clip onto your garbage can and scan everything you throw away  It goes back to Amazon it'll reorder for you.

Transcript:  It's a line I think by Ben Thompson. He'd written this in one of his sin first for tech  Erie however, you pronounce it is that Amazon's goal is to take a cut of all economic activities  Which you know a little bit out there as far as statements go  but I think that it kind of speaks to the way if the company maybe sees the world is that  Sensibly their customer obsessed they want to be able to make every thing that you their customer does  Better in some way or provide a solution that would be useful to you  In the most generous sense the world  But what that means is that they want to be a part of every single aspect of your life and collecting data on all  Of that so that they can turn that into more money.

Transcript:  Well, I think the key is  It's all about these pockets of learning  To me, you know, is it plausible that at some point Amazon might launch its own housing related something?  Absolutely, you know, maybe they're not gonna be selling  Constructing and selling smart homes anymore  but maybe they're going to create a affordable housing option that's subsidized as long as you're  Using all Amazon products and you're you open up a pipeline for your data  You know, I I was in a meeting. I  Guess I was in a meeting with this was weff a couple years ago  The partnership with Lenar had just ended and the head of that organization and I were in the small meeting room together  And he was he wasn't the head. He was somebody who was higher up at Lenar  And he was kind of disparaging the the partnership and all you know didn't work out all this was you know  Silly to begin with and I'm like dude, you're totally missing the point. This was never intended to be a long-term deal  This was about this was an experiment where you were the guinea pig on this. Yes, right, you know and  so

Maybe it's just you know, we'll just bounce along and you know  Democracy will continue and we'll kind of muddle our way through or maybe not and I just really wonder and I suppose it's not really the  Portfolio of the show to figure that out  But since I have Amy Webb and Paris Martino here, I think it's a worthwhile question one thing

Start time: 4374.34
End time: 4406.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm incredibly interested in which is obviously a question we can never answer but what would this great resignation look like if  People in the US had  Health care that was very different employers be very I know  Anecdotally, yeah a lot of people who would have quit their jobs over the last year if they weren't going to lose health care  Yeah, and I think that the fact that we're seeing this much of a kind of you know, even with  Yeah with that yeah speaks to perhaps what is going on underneath the surface

Start time: 4407.20

He's like, oh, you know, I'm really unhappy at work  I know I could make some good money freelancing, but he looked into it and he was like, you know  for me a person who actually does use health care services the  Options available in the open marketplace really don't work right now. That's right  But I think that goes back to speaking to kind of the governmental dysfunction  You know, I mean there have been a lot of cuts to that program since it was put together our Canadian friend

Start time: 4473.42
End time: 4488.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's I wonder if the people who are resigning are those people where my hunch?  I haven't seen the data but my hunch is that there's probably a correlation between  people who are resigning and  People who did not have health care meaning they were able to leave. I think you're exactly right. Yeah, I think you're exactly right

Everything's increasingly requires internet connections and you can use a system like boink  And if you ever use this leo might have like in the 90s you could donate your unused computer to Berkeley  I used to donate my I say donate my parents say  Use a different word because back then we were still paying on time-based internet connections.

It's almost a way of  Reimagining a UBI universal basic income yeah  Right yeah at any rate, but that would be potentially fodder for every time you're on a people I learn about new stuff

This is not hate to see it hate to see it that happen  This is the article from Brian Krebs hoax email blast abused poor coding in FBI website  The FBI has a number of email servers. This is the so-called leap  Leep server that's used for public  Emails is the law enforcement enterprise portal  It's a the bureau describes it as a gateway  providing law enforcement agencies intelligence groups and criminal justice entities access to  Beneficial resources in this case may be not so beneficial because they  It was hacked wasn't that well secured there is by the way  There are other servers the FBI uses internally for you know stuff  They want to keep secure so doesn't excuse it, but this was the public portal  This is the I saw this on Twitter tweet from spam house, which is a  spam monitoring system  this is the email that went out from  FBI gov  our intelligence monitoring  indicates  exfiltration of several of your virtualized clusters  I love the use by the way of the buzzwords in this in a sophisticated chain attack  We tried to black hole the transit nodes used by this advanced persistent threat actor  However, there is a huge chance. He will modify his tack with fast flux technologies  Which he proxies through multiple global accelerators. Oh  Then then the then the payload on this email because it isn't it isn't you know a fishing scam  It's not it's not doesn't have any attachments, but this is the payload  We identified the threat actor to be Vinny Troia  Who is actually a real person he's a security researcher  Whom is believed now I have to ask you writers  I think this is a misuse of the objective whom is believed to be affiliated with the extortion gang the dark overlord  We so maybe there's one little grammatical error that might make you think suspect suspect this actually the name Vinny  Troy is what made me suspect it we this is an FBI bulletin warning you about Vinny  We highly recommend you to check your systems and IDs monitoring beware  This threat actor is currently working under inspection of the NCC IC as we are dependent on some of his  Intelligence research we cannot interfere physically within four hours  Which could be enough time to cause severe damage to your infrastructure in other words. He's one of our informants

Transcript:  I'm an affiliate. I'm an affiliate  I  Apple  Kind of lost in court  Apple of course in the Apple versus epic battle  One almost in every count except the the judge who I think is pretty sharp  Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple has to add allow  Developers to add links and buttons to external payment options  So that you could if you're on the Kindle app for instance, which historically you couldn't buy a book on  iOS on the Kindle app because  Amazon didn't want to give 30% to Apple for buying a book  So they said look you can read it in the Kindle  But you've got to go to Amazon comm to buy the book and come back  But they weren't allowed to say that in the app  Apple's rules prevented that they weren't allowed to put a button or anything now  Amazon or whoever else could put a button saying buy a book and it will redirect you to the Amazon page  Apple lost in court, but they asked for an injunction  saying  Your honor  It's gonna be so hard to do this  They said let me see if I can find the Apple  Excuse  We believe says Apple if these changes are if we're forced to implement them will upset the platform  It'll harm consumers. It'll harm developers. That is a fact. It's gonna happen your honor  Epoch's attorney said Apple will do nothing unless it's forced to do so. Well, the judge has forced them to do so  The judge kind of saw through their  Request you haven't asked for additional time. She said you've asked for an injunction which would effectively take years  You asked for an across-the-board stay which could take three four five years  No, you got to do it and you got to do it by December 9th  So for the first time ever Apple is going to have to put in a link or actually they don't have to do anything  That's the other I run on. I don't run any of this. This is nothing on Apple. They just have to allow it

This is from Apple attorney Mark Perry  Now you really got to imagine. I don't know. This is a Saturday Night Live character  Maybe he's the guy with the  moist lip in the cigarette Martin short  This will be the first time Apple has ever allowed live links in an app for digital content  It's going to take months to figure out the engineering  Economic business and other issues it is exceedingly complicated. There have to be guardrails and guidelines to  protect  To protect developers to protect consumers to protect Apple  And they have to be written the guidelines that are going to be explained and enforced and applied the judge. Thank God said no  No, you got to do this and you're gonna do it next month  so  Hallelujah, the disdain has been declined and Apple poor Tim Cook now your take on this  Miss Amy Webb

I got to the line about the children and I'm like, all right  Maybe we've taken this a little too far  But but but from a practical standpoint if you look at and I know I don't mean to dog  Microsoft or Windows, but if you look at the Microsoft the Windows ecosystem and you look at the whatever Apple's new  Operating what is it? Just iOS or Mac OS wherever the hell they're calling it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but there is something to be said and I I use you know, you know this I use I'm agnostic  So I use everything and I have the least amount of problems with Apple software  Out of everything that I use and I think part of the reason for that is it's a totally locked down ecosystem  Now is it also very unfair and is it anti competitive? Of course it is

Start time: 6831.18
End time: 6842.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 6862.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  side yeah, and it mean it's you know, we all know that that there is more to it than just like adding a link, right?  there's there's much more to it than that and  you know, it'll be interesting to see if  They have to change what the payment systems look like and if that introduces new bugs or new problems or new

That is a hack. I  Think they got like a hundred thousand dollars for it because bone down is a pretty rich competition our show today brought to you by mint  mobile I  I'm a big fan. I'm my mobile phone in the other room  I just mind-blowing that I'm getting unlimited talk and text plus data on the nation's largest 5g network for  $15 a month that is like a quarter a  Quarter of what I'm paying for pretty much the same thing from one of the big telco providers  I have to say after years of getting ripped off by big wireless providers with their fine print contracts if I've learned anything  It's always that you know, there's a catch. There's a catch in here somewhere  So I wouldn't blame you if you heard me say mint mobile premium wireless service $15 a month if you thought what's the catch?  But you know, I gotta say I've been using it for more than a year now. There isn't a catch  Mint mobile secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service online only they save a lot of money  By cutting out the retail stores a lot of overhead and and that means they can pass those savings on to you  And I gotta say there's nothing like mint mobile if you're looking for extra savings you get premium wireless starting at 15 bucks a month  That's for four gigs a month most of us for silly for me  That's plenty but you can buy more they even have an unlimited data plan for 30 bucks a month  That's still a third what I'm paying T mobile and it's  Even less a smaller fraction what I'm paying for rise and all plans come with unlimited talk text high-speed data  Delivered on the nation's largest 5g network. It's it's a it's T mobile  So if if you get good T mobile coverage where you are mint mobile will be just the same. It'll be awesome  You can bring your phone if you want they'll send you a sim  They don't charge you for the sim if you want to port your number over keep the same number. No problem  And of course if you're not 100% satisfied mint mobile has you covered a seven-day money back guarantee  So there's no risk at all.

It's great  In fact, I got a iPhone SE from them for 15 bucks  So for a total of 30 bucks a month brand new phone great phone service.

How do you do a login in?  Angular they find it on stack exchange they copy and they paste it and they're done and so so  Microsoft and github thought well, what if we had an artificial intelligence technology?  Let's call it clippy. We'll call it clippy for programmers. They call it your  This is actually in it tongue-in-cheek. It feels like but it's not your AI pair programmer  So what you do is in a set in a in essence is say well, I just want to do this and then it will find code  From github.
