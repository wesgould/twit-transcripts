I mean somebody's new show. Some guy. It looks a little like you.  It looks like your brother. I know you went to Berkeley and so he probably, you know,  he's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very typical of a Berkeley student. Back in the day. Nowadays it's all  kids from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And also here in studio and I'm really thrilled to welcome in the studio today  because he is our newest TWIT.  Actually he will be because you don't start yet. Mr. Tom Merritt.  Hello Leo. Hey Tom, we're trying to find a name for a title for Tom. I like  Viceroy. Viceroy.  I'm Chief Twitty's Viceroy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No? You don't like it John? I think I get that kind of someone that's, it should be  alliterative and it should have the word Tom in it. Governor General.  Major Tom. That's why Tom Twitt would be good. Tom Twitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because he's got it. We could all be, I could be Leo Twitt, you could be John Twitt,  you could be Tom Twitt, you could just all have the last name Twitt. Be like Ken Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Be like the Ramones. Yeah, Ken. No, you're thinking of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other guy. Joe Foreman. George Foreman.  Oh right, with all his silver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Tom, you told CNET, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The press release goes out tomorrow. I was so busy Friday.  No, I'm really thrilled that we could get you as part of the TWIT family.  What's he going to do here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four hours of daily programming. Monday through Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's the next anchor, basically. Eventually we want to go 24-7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you expect to move him, not that I'm not noticing you sitting right here,  but do you expect to move him to New York? You going to do the New York thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't want to go to New York. You could if you wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll stay here for now. Well, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eileen, his lovely wife, is in the studio with us as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  About the New York thing? She would love to go to New York, but not yet.  Well, maybe, you know. Yeah, she's given the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of museums in New York.  The New York thing... They've got restaurants there.  They do. London, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When we start a London office, you're number one on the runway.  That'll be the end.  So, Tom, of course everybody knows from Buzz Out Loud,  he's been on the show many times. He does shows on the TWIT network already.  He's been doing East Meets West here.  Your new one, Current Geek Weekly, is great.  Yeah, it's been doing great. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Having a lot of fun with Scott. We had Jonathan Colton on this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I saw that. I walked in and I said, wait a minute, that's Joko.  Yeah. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And not as a musical guest, but as a geek guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to have to get you to really...  Now that you're on TWIT, you've got to talk into the mic, not across it.  The mic keeps running around.  That mic is a barrel.  Point it down at your... Here, I'll help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were trying to do it before, yeah.  Now you can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now you have that rich, refulgent sound.  We don't want to see you, we want to hear you.  That's true.  It's actually the heritage of TWIT as a audio network,  which is really kind of not true anymore, is it?  So I guess we ought to get smaller mics or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get a view to talk across mics.  You know, Bob Heil...  This mic is such a great sounding mic.  I just love the sound, though. I don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's such a great sound.  Bob Heil, the guy who makes these mics, and he's a really great guy,  made us a smaller one.  He said, I can make a small one for you.  Colleen has it up in her studio.  The same mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With the same diaphragm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the same parts, yeah.  The same diaphragm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Dane, would you...  Or Jammer B, would you run upstairs and get that mic at Colleen's office?  I can show everybody.  And he also says you don't need the spider mount.  So maybe we could make these smaller.  But I kind of like...  It's part of the set.  It is kind of cool.  John's choosing a wine now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you've got something to check out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dane Golden on Sommelier.  Oh, it's ink grade.  Sommelier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To ink grade? What does that mean?  That means nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should... I should make clear that I'm still at CNET until May 14th.  Well, that's forever.  And then after that, I'm off a couple weeks, and then I start here full-time June 1st.  Right. So June 1st, your first day.  But we'll see.  You won't expect me tomorrow to suddenly be gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think one of the first things we're going to do is a daily news show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Today in tech.  Oh, wait. Unfortunate acronym.  Yeah. I don't know about that.  We'll have to work on the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But we'll do a daily news show.  Some agenda.  Tech 9.  A partial agenda.  Partial agenda.  Yeah. Tech 9.5.  Tech 9.5.  No, and I'll help you with that.  But we're also looking for a host for you.  We did, I admit, we tried to get Molly to join us as well, but she didn't want to.  It's OK. She got a good offer.  That's my little mic. What do you think?  That's the Bob Hile Mini.  Michaelito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Show the camera.  Who's got me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michaelito.  Here's the... This is the same basic mic of these two.  It's just much more compact.  And it's light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is a good mic to sell.  I know.  Except I don't know how you'd mount it.  You mount it the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just, you know...  Well, you said you don't need this.  You don't need a spider.  No, you wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a glamorous little mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Don't you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bob Hile is so incredible.  You know, he was a rock and roll sound guy.  He did the quadraphonic sound for Quadrophenia for the Who.  He invented for Peter Frampton.  Peter Frampton's wife Penny said,  I want to buy pizza or something for Christmas.  And Bob invented the thing.  They go...  Wah-hoy-hoy.  Wah-hoy-hoy.  Yeah. You know what it is?  I thought it's some elaborate thing.  It's a tube.  It goes into your mouth.  And the sound goes into your mouth.  And then you put it in front of a microphone  and it comes out of your mouth.  So the sound from the guitar is pumped  into a hollow plastic tube.  And then you just...  And you hear a such like blowing the sound out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's not fancy.  No, but that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Bob said to me, Peter loved it.  He fell in love with it.  Used it, of course made Frampton Comes Alive,  which was a huge hit.  He said, but nobody used it better than Joe Walsh.  Joe Walsh is the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's too bad.  Life's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bob Hile from in Fairview Heights, Illinois.  Right.  Near where I grew up.  Your home area.  The square, the mall in Fairview Heights,  where we always shopped.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They didn't sell Hile mics then.  So Bob then is a ham and he bemoaned the lack  after being a sound guy for years  that there was no good ham microphones.  And these PR 40s that we use were made as ham microphones.  What do they mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have the big...  It's the big balls.  They're the big...  Yeah.  That's what they call them.  QSL, QSL.  I never heard of a ham's carrying.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go.  That has nothing to do with tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Well, it actually does.  This does have something to do with tech,  but it's pretty vague.  Obscure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you going to Europe soon?  When are you going to Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going for the IFA press event this weekend.  What's IFA?  IFA.  IFA is the German CES.  Ooh, fun.  And they have it every September.  And then they do a press event in the spring.  So Tom's going to IFA.  I'm sitting on a panel talking about blogs and podcasts.  IFA panel.  But how can you get there?  If the ash cloud doesn't stop me.  We go, well, Spain right now is below the ash cloud.  Barcelona is not.  Spain is south.  But Madrid is.  Did Barcelona get covered today?  Yeah, I was looking at a map.  All right, well, we're screwed then  because we're flying into Barcelona.  Oh no, you can't get into Barcelona.  Because I looked at a map on BBC  and it didn't cover Barcelona yet.  But maybe it'll dissipate by Wednesday.  If not, we'll just go to Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what I do.  They are flying planes under the cloud,  but they're not putting passengers in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the airlines are losing so much money  that they're testing out planes  to prove that it's safe to carry passengers  so that the European agencies will allow them to fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  200 million a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  200 million dollars a day.  A day.  The equivalent of, I don't know how many euros.  That's like five euros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five, six euros.  No, it's the other way around.  Yeah, yeah.  More euros?  No, you're right, no, it's five euros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not a fool.  I'm not the fool you take me for.  Here's the interesting thing.  Would it be a good time to invest  in transatlantic ocean service?  I'm thinking it might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Depends on how long that cloud's gonna be around.  We don't know.  The last time, this is the little volcano,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and the last time the little one went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The big one goes.  Yeah.  And apparently the only thing keeping the big one  from blowing is the fact that there's a huge glacier  sitting on top of it, and the little one melts the glacier,  then the big one goes,  and it's like five times bigger than this thing.  Oh dear.  That would be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what's gonna happen after I get to Spain.  You'll be stuck there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have a French kid here staying with us.  We have a French kid staying with us, an exchange student,  and she was the last plane out of France,  and she's never going home.  She's moving in with us.  Oh wow.  She's supposed to go home next week, I don't think so.  Well, how long is this gonna last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They keep saying, oh, it's gonna dissipate  in another 48 hours, but it doesn't.  48 hours a day.  Yeah, exactly, it doesn't seem to stop.  It seems to get worse.  It seems to expand, and more ash is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what the hashtag for the ash cloud is?  No. Ash tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, of course it is.  What am I thinking?  I knew that, I knew that without knowing that.  You knew it.  You know, the Royal Navy is getting in on it as well.  They're planning to go rescue British citizens stranded  by having them go to the coast,  and the Royal Navy will come and pick them up.  It's like Dunkirk all over.  It's reverse Dunkirk.  Well, not reverse, it's Dunkirk with a war.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bloomberg.  Bloomberg.  Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  You said Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bloomberg.  Says that the loss from the ash to the airlines  is 200 million a day, but there's also a big loss  to the tech industry.  Revenue losses could reach a billion dollars  because you can't fly stuff in, you're gonna have to ship it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Parachubles are already suffering right now  because you can't bring in fruit and all this stuff.  And what a terrible time for this to happen  to the airlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how much fruit has flown in.  But the kick in the whole thing.  But there's a lot of food that is.  Is that the French train workers were on strike.  Yeah, they're still on strike, aren't they?  I don't know, are they?  Are they always on strike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read today somebody, kind of a personal story  about getting to France and the trains were on strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I told a friend of mine was stranded in Paris  and we told her, well, just take the train  to the Dunkirk ferry, take the ferry back to England.  She had to go back to England.  And then we said they can't because the trains  were on strike, everyone's stuck.  And I said, oh, stuck in Paris, that's terrible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The railway strikers were like,  this is the best thing ever.  Look at all the leverage we have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you see the president of Norway running the country  from JFK with an iPad?  Why does he go to the embassy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a consulate in New York for Norway.  Why doesn't he just go there?  I don't think he really is running Norway  with an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's bull crap.  Well, it's just a great story, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, how often do you get in the headlines  if you're running Norway?  Right.  You gotta do what you can to get some press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know anyone was running Norway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, like thousands of others,  stranded by the volcanic cloud hanging over Europe,  governing Norway from his iPad.  There's an app for that.  That would be good.  I have it, actually, I am actually, I have an iPad.  You've been governing from your iPad?  It's called Godfinger.  Oh yeah, I heard I'm in there.  You are, that's not you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh?  Yeah, yeah, no, it's me.  You're playing Godfinger, right?  You named one of your people after me, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you can do that in Godfinger.  Right.  It's called a Godfinger game, right?  I mean, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  It's a little app, a little gamey app.  Called gamey app?  Yeah.  Godfinger, here, I'll let you play.  This is a little gamey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've got my people.  Little pheasant.  I got my people, and I run them with my finger.  That's what I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like Katamari Damacy meets We Rule.  I don't even know what those things are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't even see anything.  Okay, see, play.  Okay, so here's my planet.  This is really good for the folks listening at home.  I'll describe what you're about to see.  Oh boy.  Look at all that gold!  I gotta harvest some gold,  so all my people that have been working without me,  they need some rain, though,  so let me get a cloud over here.  What's the black cloud I've got today?  That's a thunder cloud.  Oh, that's a thunder cloud.  No, that's the Iceland cloud.  That's the ash cloud.  That's the volcanic ash.  So I'm raining on him,  so he can go back to work on his farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that you rain on people to make them work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, oh, well, watch this.  This black cloud, that's lightning,  and this little barn needs lightning,  so I'm gonna hold it and then,  poosh!  And she goes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ah, ah, ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, I'm gonna pick him up.  See, he's tired.  He's tired, so I'm gonna drag him over to the tavern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, here's a well.  This is, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,  this is the prelude to the nervous breakdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that iTunes doesn't publicly release  is the DSM-4 classification for most players,  and I think narcissists lead in this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think it's narcissistic  just because I'm called a god?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could be a god complex.  I don't know if those are a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It could be.  Oh, look, I just leveled up to,  I'm level 20 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what keeps you going, right?  You wanna keep leveling.  There's a great article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm gonna read you this article  because it's talking about Farmville  and really the pernicious nature of games like Farmville.  And you'll like this because it's for intellectuals.  Let me find this.  It's in our Delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you talking to me or John?  He's just talking to you, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's talking to himself, actually.  No, I'm talking to the audience.  We have a brilliant- You'll like this, Leo.  I will, I will, I will like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, you will like this because you are so smart.  Cultivated plays for Media Commons,  the secret to Farmville's success.  This is a speech, actually,  that A.J. Patrick Liskowitz gave at SUNY Buffalo Amherst,  I don't know what that means, on March 9th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He gave a speech at SUNY Buffalo Amherst.  But Amherst is different from Buffalo, I thought.  Anyway.  Oh, well, I think it's one of those schools  that has little campuses everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He says, why is it that we like Farmville?  He talks, you're such an intellectual, John.  You probably heard of Roger Calois' book,  Man, Play, and Games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I'm sure my son has read it  because he read every book on games in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is an interesting book.  He says, play is an occasion of pure waste,  waste of time, energy, ingenuity, skill,  and often of money.  However, games are a source of joy  as well as a healthy means of escape  from responsibility and routine.  And he kind of codified what makes a game a good game.  Farmville is not a good game.  He says, games that offers a break  from responsibility and routine are good games.  Farmville is defined by responsibility and routine.  Users advance to the game by harvesting crops  at scheduled intervals.  If you plant a field of pumpkins at noon,  you have to return at eight o'clock  or risk losing the crop.  Each pumpkin costs 30 coins,  occupies one square of your farm.  So if you own a 14 by 14 farm,  a field of pumpkins costs 6,000 coins to plant.  You have to click on each square three times,  once to harvest the previous crop,  once to replow the square of land,  once to plant the new seeds.  That means 600 mouse clicks to farm  and an obligation to return in a few hours to do it again.  That doesn't sound like much fun.  Why would anyone do this?  And they say the reason is social obligation.  And the key that Zynga,  company's making hundreds of millions of dollars a year  on this, figured out is  Farmville's popular because it entangles users  in a web of social obligations.  When users log into Facebook,  they're reminded that their neighbors have sent them gifts,  posted bonuses on their walls  and helped with each other's farms.  In turn, they're obligated to return the courtesies.  We play Farmville because we're trying to be good  to one another.  We are polite, cultivated people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Being suckered.  Suckered, it's troubling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By social engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's exactly the point.  We are being social engineered into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talked on Thursday on Buzz Out Loud  about the guy, Jeffrey Miller,  whose hypothesis is that the reason we haven't heard  from aliens is that they're all playing games.  And he's serious.  He says, as the evolved mind pays attention  to indirect cues of biological fitness,  the result is we don't seek  reproductive success directly anymore.  We seek tasty foods that have tended to promote survival  and luscious mates who have tended  to produce bright, healthy babies.  The modern result, fast food and pornography.  Once they turn inwards to chase their quote,  shiny pennies of pleasure, they lose the cosmic plot.  And so they just, they turn inward and play games  and never bother trying to contact anybody.  That is hysterical.  They don't have SETI at home.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The show is officially over.  What?  No, nothing.  Why do you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys are talking about aliens now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you seen, did you see the Facebook on the South Park?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got more friends than Kyle.  I've got more friends than Kyle.  How the hell do you have more friends than me?  Cause people think I'm cool, dude.  How many friends do you have Kenny?  Foo, foo, foo.  What?  How the hell do I only have 37 friends?  Are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?  Stupid Facebook stuff.  Why are you guys in here wasting your time?  We're supposed to be out playing video games.  Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become.  You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends,  even start your own virtual farm  and have your friends visit it.  Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?  Stan, we know it's hard to get started,  but we have a little surprise for you.  Yeah, dude.  We made you your own Facebook page.  Surprise.  No, I told you guys I don't want to be on Facebook.  Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us.  I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms.  I don't want to get sucked into this.  All right, fine, dude.  You don't have to add any friends.  You can just be like Kip Geordie.  Who?  Kip Geordie, the third grader.  He's got no Facebook friends  and he's had a profile for more than six months.  Aw, gee.  All the updates are for me.  So sad.  Everyone should have one Facebook friend.  You guys are retarded.  I'm playing Xbox.  There's really people out there  without a Facebook friend in the world?  That's so wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's what this guy's talking about, right?  Is the social responsibility.  You've got to satisfy your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So he ends up, Kyle ends up joining Facebook,  getting sucked into Facebook and feeling so sorry  for this third grader has zero friends.  He becomes friends with Kip Geordie.  And Kip tells his parents, I've made a friend.  They're so excited.  He says, I'm going to go visit my friend's farm.  He has a farm.  And he takes him to the movies.  I mean, I have to say, I'm not a big South Park fan  because it's kind of a little lewd.  But this is the best.  It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they focus on a social issue like this, they kill.  They nailed this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the page we're looking at is actually  the Kip Geordie fan page on Facebook.  Like a talent Facebook that they made.  Yeah, facebook.com slash K-I-P-D-R-R-O-R-D-Y.  And Kip has 143,000 fans.  But the updates are all from the show.  And I have to admit, when I was watching the show,  I immediately updated my Facebook status  to ate a pork chop for dinner and had nice applesauce too,  which is straight out of the show.  If you haven't seen it, it was not this week.  I think it was last week's South Park.  Available online everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everywhere.  You know, I've never played Farmville, not a once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you're playing We Rule,  which is pretty much the same thing.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really similar.  But it seems like there's less social obligation.  We Rule's more fun.  It's a better game.  You don't get that push to, you know, like,  hey, so and so left you a gift.  Let's just take a look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just take a look at,  we used to talk about computers.  These are all running on computers.  This is technology, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what?  This is what's happening.  And I think this is actually relevant.  Is that when we started, John and I started,  we would talk about processors, you know,  how much RAM, you know,  how to turn a telnet account into a slip account  so you could use Mosaic to surf the net.  And what's happened is it's no longer important.  What's important is what you do with it.  We don't care about what process.  Nobody cares anymore, right?  That's what I said.  It's become about content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the iPad is the emblem of that.  It is all about content.  Because all of the criticisms of it are that it is not open  and it can't do all of those things  that you want to do to modify it.  And I think David Pogue pretty much nailed it  when he said, look, you know, there's two groups.  There's the group that's going to hate this  because they're geeks and they can't open it up  and do what they want with it.  And there's the other group that aren't geeks  and they don't care.  And it's a toy for them.  And they can do what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Tom, by the way, I meant to say  about your WeRule farm, you really got to work on it.  It's kind of a little disordered and disheveled.  You mean the organization of it?  Yeah, you know, it's kind of, it's not as nice as it could.  You need to put a little, some old bodies in water.  A little more work on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just a little bit of a new tell you.  You guys keep talking, I'll start.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll start working on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  There is tech news, believe it or not.  By the way, I just got a out of memory on my iPad,  which I've never seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get that on the WeRule.  It's a WeRule bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a WeRule bug.  Oh, okay.  So it's not the iPad.  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You dodged a bullet, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  John, you know, you haven't touched it, right?  This is your, you're new to the iPad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've touched hers.  That's just, that was your first iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you for clarifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You touched Eileen's first time, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think?  It's fine, it's a giant iPod touch.  Yeah, it is, but that.  Although I'm going to, I have the nano version of this,  which isn't the iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The pad nano.  I have not used my laptop in a long time,  and it's interesting, because Apple just this week  announced new laptops, which normally  I would have jumped to buy.  That's you.  And I didn't, because it's like,  I haven't used my laptop, I can't really justify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also didn't do a lot to, you know,  they didn't change the look of it.  They didn't, they added the better graphics processor  and the i5 and i7 processors, which are nice,  and it's good performance update,  but they didn't change how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nevertheless, knowing me, I would have bought one  had I not found that the iPad was enough.  It's, I don't use a laptop anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, with me, I only use a laptop  when I travel and I'm in a hotel.  Right.  Or here, when I borrow a laptop.  So you use a desktop most of the time.  I'm a desktop user.  I like a bunch of big screens,  I like to be in mission control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's what's going to happen,  is that those people who use something for portability  will go with something that's like this,  much more portable. A lot of people believe that's true.  And then, if you really need power.  He's a good example.  Is that what he would do?  He's crazy about this thing.  I am too, I have to say.  Oh, there's Tom fixing his We Rule.  I just had to harvest some beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.  Oh, brother.  You know what, this is to me,  and I got to take some flack from this,  from some folks who work in medicine,  who are like, no, this is not a toy,  but for me, this is a toy.  It's a toy.  I read comics on it. It's totally a toy.  I play games on it. I watch videos on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then, you know what, there'll be people doing work  in vertical markets like medicine, but it's a toy.  We're going to take a break, come back,  talk more about the tech stories of the week.  John C. Dvorak is here from a channeldvorak.com.  He's got a new show we got to talk about.  Or his brother has a new show we got to talk about,  the Tech Hippie.  In just a little bit, also our newest Twit, Tom Merritt.  He'll be joining the Twit family on June 1st,  doing new shows.  He's already doing quite a few shows on.  What's with Sword and Laser?  Can we get Sword and Laser,  or is that Revision 3 is going to have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's possible.  We'll have to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want that.  Yeah.  I love that show.  Anyway, it's great to have you aboard.  Thank you.  We're going to be back in just a second,  but I got to tell you about a brand new product  from an old friend.  Citrix is back with something called GoToTraining.  I know you know about Citrix's product.  They invented remote access.  They were really the guys who pioneered it.  Citrix is still widely used in enterprise.  Their GoToMyPC makes remote access simple.  GoToMeeting makes meetings simple.  And now GoToTraining improved learning, participation,  and access to training programs  and save a bunch with GoToTraining.  It's a web-based tool which enables up to 200 people  to connect to a training session right from their desktops.  This is the latest in e-learning,  and it's real-time or on demand.  You can record a session and they can go and visit.  This is really mostly for companies or consultants  who need to train employees or customers.  GoToTraining, the Citrix folks said,  I bet you maybe not a lot of them are listening to a tweet,  but I bet you there's quite a few people  who've been in really crappy corporate training  who might say, can we please use GoToTraining?  It really is a great way to bring training sessions online  easily, affordably, eliminate travel,  save money on materials.  You can upload any document type or link to any website  to create your own content library  so you have your own curriculum.  You can create and customize tests.  You can send out email invites.  There's scoring.  I mean, it's just really a remarkable tool.  We played with it a little bit,  and I was very, very impressed.  Screen sharing, you can pass presenter control  from one PC to another.  Built-in voiceover IP, by the way,  we did a GoToMeeting with the folks to learn about this.  On my iPad, it has the VoIP built in, the iPad.  I just went in there and this microphone on the iPad,  I'm talking, I've got the whole meeting on here.  It's amazing what they're doing.  You can present the session yourself  or include experts from anywhere in the world  through screen sharing.  You can get feedback from your attendees while you present.  There's an integrated chat window.  There's a polling feature.  I can go on and on.  Look, just try it free.  Or get your corporate trainer to try it free.  30 days, go to training.com.  And if you've attended a training session in person recently  and it's not been up to snuff,  send a quick note to the trainer, say,  you might wanna try and go to training.  If you're an IT manager,  mention GoToTraining at your next staff meeting.  GoToTraining.com.  Free for 30 days, we thank Citrix so much  for their support of all of our shows  and really want you to try GoToTraining.  I was very impressed.  Brand new from Citrix.  Back to the show we go with John C. Dvorak and Tom Merritt.  So you think the Apple laptops are less than inspiring, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I'd be excited  if I was definitely in the market to buy a new laptop.  Good graphics card and good processor,  but they're not the thing that's gonna make me say,  oh, I'm looking at my laptop now and I've gotta dump it.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because this is working fine.  It's actually true.  Although 10 hour battery life on a 13 inch,  this is the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't the previous 13?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not 10, it was nine, I think.  That was pretty close though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it wasn't like a two and a half or anything.  But was it really nine?  I don't think people were really close.  My son has one of those and it lasts forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing about Apple that I've found is that  their acclaimed battery life,  usually that's one of the few things they don't lie about.  Their acclaimed battery life usually ends up to be around  the actual battery life instead of spiking the tech.  I have to say, I am extraordinarily tempted

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  by a 10 hour 13 inch.  That's just, I think the iPad has changed my expectation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you just keep the iPad and stop using it a lot?  Okay, thank you.  Because the iPad battery life is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just got an email from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got the, effectively the email is like  an intervention from Apple.  Will you stop talking about us?  No, no, no, no, that too.  But I don't think Apple cares about that.  Let's see.  Come on, tell us.  I'm gonna read it to you.  Here it is.  Thank you for your recent Apple order.  To ensure that all customers are given equal opportunity  to acquire this product,  we have limited the amount available per customer.  Therefore, this order has been canceled.  What?  You got what canceled?  I bought another iPad and they said I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You couldn't have it?  They said you can't.  But you could walk down to the store and buy it.  They won't let me buy anymore.  It's the only power you could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't fall over.  You could have one on each hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was trying to make an iPad vest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they bumped you?  They would-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They canceled my order.  I mean, let's throw out-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For no good reason?  Yeah, that's the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need another one possibly,  but why do they care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, apparently there's a shortage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if you drive down to Emeryville and buy one,  they're not gonna deny it.  I guess that's what I'm gonna have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They'll take your money.  I think there's a limit of four per account  because I've already four.  Oh, this is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe there's a real shortage.  You're gonna bite on one while you're working on the other.  I mean, what do you need more than one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, I only need one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm giving them to people.  If there were that much of a shortage,  you couldn't walk into a store and buy one,  which I did on Friday.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You were able to walk in.  All right, well, that's what I'll do.  I wanted a 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the 3Gs aren't in yet.  Right.  That's what I ordered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they said, no, we canceled your order.  You can't have the 3G.  They canceled my order?  They've also announced that the European deliveries  are gonna be much delayed.  And I think this is, again, shortages.  I think these things are selling better than Apple.  Well, let's put it this way.  Apple can't keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the myth they want you to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but the same thing happened, remember,  with the Nintendo Wii.  And I had this argument many times with people.  No company wants to create artificial shortages.  There's no advantage to that.  If you've got people saying, we wanna buy it,  they wanna sell it, don't they, John?  Isn't it to their advantage to sell it  rather than to create this imperative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nintendo is the last people to play with this.  Then they gave everybody a run for their money  and there became a huge demand, a pent-up demand.  So you think they faked it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apple?  No, no, Nintendo.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  You think they artificially limited Wii availability?  Absolutely.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the Japanese can flip a switch  and have 10 million products made overnight.  I mean, it's not like, yeah, it had to be.  And there are people in marketing.  They have a marketing department  with probably 50 people in it.  They project it, they know exactly  how many they're gonna sell.  So they created the scam.  I only partially agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they were taken by surprise  with how many people wanted to buy them,  but I think you're right that they sat on it.  Instead of turning up the production,  they squeezed it a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't take much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More social engineering like that crazy game you're talking  about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think it is, but wouldn't you prefer  to sell everyone you could?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me, but I'm not a social engineer.  I don't have the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you think you'd sell more in the long run  if you created this false impression that there's scarcity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a theory and I think it works  because the Nintendo just went crazy with their...  It can work if it's done properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know why it probably works?  Because the truth...  Oh, and I'm gonna get the email when I say this  and I've said it before.  The truth is the Nintendo Wii isn't that compelling  of a product.  You play with it and after...  I mean, come on, it's on the shelf, right?  That seems to be the common...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not true with kids.  The machine's being used all the time.  Yours is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually in the same class as the iPad,  which is the non-hex continue to play with it.  That's what I'm wondering.  But the folks who are used to an Xbox or a PS3,  they get bored with it really quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I have to say the kids tend to use the DS  more than they do the Wii.  I'm thinking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They love that.  No, the DS is real as real and the new DS is nice  and it's real.  The 3DS?  Yeah, the 3DS.  I think the Wii...  The why?  I think the Wii isn't that compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so maybe this...  And now you get Netflix through the Wii.  Yeah, I think maybe this is...  With a disc.  This theory that...  By the way, the whole thing is a fiasco.  I got the press kit.  So they sent me the disc.  And so I tried it out.  It says, oh, now you can't...  Nothing happens till April 14th or something like that.  So I wait and it gives me a code.  It says go to netflix.com slash Wii.  And there's no place to put the code.  And does it work?  The whole thing is somebody dropped the ball  on the promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have it on the PS3.  It works fine.  You register.  It's just like the Roku except you have to leave the disc  in the PS3, which is so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It gives you that experience of playing a DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Darth Emma, Terry in our chat room says  she was able to activate her Wii yesterday  and it works fine, John.  Once again, John, admit it.  You have trouble with technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, this was the specific program for the press.  It wasn't a normal Wii.  Yeah, you can go on there right now  and type in that with Wii.  And you can do a sign up  and you can go through a rigmarole  and it'll be working fine.  But I'm saying the press kit,  which had this special program, didn't work.  Didn't allow you to preview it.  And unless you ran through that,  I don't think the criticism's valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently the Wii will turn you into a nympho.  Did you know that?  This is a story from the register.  A Manchester woman who took a tumble from her Wii Fit board  Oh, I heard of this.  is suffering an earth moving side effect  of the Nintendo related mishap.  She is now a nymphomaniac.  Randy Amanda Flowers, age 24,  was diagnosed with quote,  persistent sexual arousal syndrome due to a damaged nerve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a nymphomaniac.  But not a nymphomaniac.  She has a vagus nerve.  The vagus nerve.  Arousal syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's susceptible to the slightest of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of those great tech stories.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry I started this.  You have to read it now.  She's susceptible.  I should do it in the Viennese accent.  She is susceptible to.  Why is it Viennese?  The answer is Viennese.  Oh, it's Freudian.  Dr. Freud says she is susceptible  to the slightest of vibrations.  Thank you, you like that?  With anything from mobile phones to a food processor,  guaranteed to give her a buzz.  Dr. Ruth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She says, it began as a twinge down below  before surging through my body.  Sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh please.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's a catering worker who now requires 10.  Sessions a day.  10 men?  10 men a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would venture to say that this is not widely applicable.  I don't think most users of the Wii will.  That happened to me.  Will encounter this issue.  That's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know, I'm sorry I brought that up.  Can we edit that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  So far it's the best thing in the show.  Well let's get to your column then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak, what are you up, is this Market Watch?  What are you up to now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Market Watch column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What are you up to now, Dvorak?  Did you read it?  No, let me read it right now.  Should I read it in a Viennese accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a German accent.  German accent.  Your accent is the same as German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis speaks German,  he does our This Week in Google show,  which is moving to Wednesdays by the way.  Wednesdays.  Wednesdays on the internet everywhere.  The Twitch network.  He pointed out that the word for a hole in German  is Arschlok.  Arschlok?  Arschlok.  So he's calling it the Ashlok, get it?  It's a little German pun.  You won't hear those very often on the show.  No, for good reason.  What is your marketplace?  I'm trying to find your marketplace.  Oh, that's why I type marketplace.  Market Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well essentially you say that Net Neutrality.  Time to short Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I didn't say what you're gonna say.  How do you know what I'm gonna say?  What I said, because you started off  with the sentence structure  that is going to lead in one direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I gotta read this one,  because I got it by accident.  Net Neutrality within free speech.  Is that not right?  This is writing June 7th, 2007,  when Apple computers,  oh well, you might be right,  was it 247?  Time to short Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's an old one.  That's when it was shortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was, because it went down quite a bit.  Yeah.  But it's now back up, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't stay on your short forever.  That was a good move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's in the Google Doc,  if you wanna link to it.  Net Neutrality threatens free speech,  says John C. Dvorak.  That's your headline.  Berkeley, California.  That was the sentence structure.  I love it that they dateline it,  Berkeley, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that everyone knows I'm nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a proposal afoot developed by Senator John Kerry  that could undermine free speech on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the voice we need, okay?  Yeah, it's in Newsreel.  Winchell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Winchell.  It's tricky, so let me explain.  If you've not been following the Net Neutrality debate,  then you are missing out on the most contentious argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  concerning online services out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most recently, the courts ruled  that the Federal Communications Commission  has no real jurisdiction over the major.  This is the Comcast thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the District of Columbia Court of Appeals  ruled that,  now see, I had a big long email exchange  with a telecommunications expert,  and he said, you know, you got it wrong last week.  It wasn't that the court said that the FCC couldn't do it.  They just did it wrong in that case.  So the FCC, this is, by the way,  the DC Court of Appeals apparently is famous  for being anti-regulatory.  So it's not unusual for them  to overturn government regulations.  So they said, not that you can't do it,  but that's not in this case.  You say that this decision is meant to...  No, no, no.  Taken to mean a rebuke of the ill-defined concept  of Net Neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it's taken to mean,  and it's quite good.  You say not so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  A group of online mavens believe  that if allowed to complete freedom,  the ISPs like Comcast, Time Warner, and AT&T

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  will manipulate the online experience  by allowing sites and services they control  to get better access and throughput than the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So far, so good.  That's what it means.  Or they may ask Google for money.  Whatever.  Which I've changed.  For access, which you say in the next paragraph.  I'm just summarizing, I'm paraphrasing,  because I can't read that voice very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only 600 words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is really, what?  Really, it's only 600 words?  Yeah, we do say that.  It seems longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks.  It makes 600 feel like 1500.  That's great, it feels like a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is really what Net Neutrality is all about.  You get Net Neutrality by making  these hypothetical practices illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The practices to limit.  Right.  And you make a good point.  The tiered internet.  Which is, it's hypothetical,  because nobody's done it in the US yet,  although they do it in Canada all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T said, we want to do it,  and we want to do it to Google.  Right.  Now that's still hypothetical, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The service providers all say they would never do this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and Net Neutrality them means they cannot do  tiered pricing schemes if there are restrictions developed  to promote Net Neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it would eliminate something they do want to do,  which is tiered.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, well they kind of do that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They do it anyway.  So here comes a great idea from John Kerry.  The idea which bloggers and various activist groups  are all heated and promotional about will,  if implemented, destroy, this is good John,  I like it when you say this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  destroy the internet as we know it.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kerry wrote an op-ed in the Daily Coast this weekend,  which was then picked up by The Post,  the Huff Poe, and then by bloggers.  Net Neutrality needs your help today.  He says, we need to reclassify broadband  as a, and I agree with this.  Ah, you make the same mistake if you read the right.  All right, well okay, so he says he wants to,  basically classify it as infrastructure,  telecommunication services rather than information services.  It's infrastructure, it's like a utility,  not a publisher, not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In other words, return it to what it used to be classified as  before Michael Powell opened it up  and at the request of the industry said,  okay, you're an information service.  And I go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, we go on.  All right, this was supposedly give the FCC supreme power  rather than vague power of the internet.  Okay, so far I agree.  This is the worst possible outcome

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as the FCC will eventually regulate the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  like it does all the other entities under its jurisdiction.  By the way, a lot of controversy in even on,  I remember John Perry Barlow saying even on the EFF board  over, well, do you want government regulation  or do you want free market?  Is there a free market?  Do we really want the government to start telling us  what to do with the internet?  That's what you're saying, right?  As we've recently witnessed with the FCC attacks  on free speech in the various Howard Stern actions,  that was an old FCC, that was a different FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What there is is to make it goes back and forth  and back and forth, you can't trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As well as the heavy fines  for showing a nipple on the Super Bowl.  A nipple on the Super Bowl.  We can only imagine what will happen  to free speech on the net.  I think I'm agreeing with you here.  See, now I found it a little fatuous

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because television is not classified  as a telecommunication service.  So it's not a fair comparison of an example.  And the internet used to be classified  as a telecommunication service  and we didn't have any of these problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what about John's point that we don't want government,  we don't want the FCC to regulate the internet really,  even if it's a telecommunication service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that.  I just don't agree with it necessarily for these reasons.  I think we wanna regulate it as little as possible.  You don't think it's a power grab?  I think what we need is more competition  and what the telecommunications industry wants  is whatever regulation benefits them most at the time.  So when being a telecommunications industry benefited them,  they wanted to do that  so they could collect the universal service fee  and bring in that money.  Then they said, hey, you know what?  That's not working for us anymore  because we're starting to fall  into these other jurisdictions.  So let's change it to an information service.  They got Michael Powell to do that.  But now they're looking at it and they're saying,  well, we want that USF, we want that service fee,  but we don't wanna be reclassified as telecommunications.  So allow us to collect the fee, just change that part.  Don't reclassify us as telecommunications  because then we'd have to open up our lines again  to competition and we don't wanna do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We had this argument last week on Twitter.  It was a really good argument between Brian Brushwood,  who was a libertarian and Baratunde Thurston,  who was a socialist.  And it really is, that's the fundamental question is,  who do you trust the market or do you trust the government?  And I don't trust either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, here's the problem that people have had  with this column.  I assume that I'm against net neutrality.  I'm not against, in fact-  You're against government regulation.  Here's the point is that this whole thing  that Kerry brings up and the discussion of net neutrality  is totally besides the point.  Changing the definition of information to telecommunication  it has zero to do with net neutrality.  All it is is just, it seems to me to be,  and I point this out in the column,  that I know for a fact that the Democrats and the FCC  and all these people have been irked about talk radio  and they moan about it incessantly  and they don't like all these right-wing nutcases  that are all over the internet.  And they would love to get a hold of some regulations  to shut people down and get rid of the porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I certainly hope that's not what's happening.  All that's happening in Australia as we speak,  it's happening all over the world.  Ireland is looking at doing it as well.  You got these awful act of three strikes laws  getting in both in France and-  Yeah, and that's what's ahead if we go in this direction.  But John, what's your answer to,  when we really don't have a free market  in terms of telecommunications at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that-  There's no competition.  I think we're far enough down the line  if Sprint's YMAX starts to blossom here and there  that you get some really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Foster competition is the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously that's always the answer.  Very good, foster competition.  And the way they fostered competition in Europe,  and I'm not sure what I think about this,  is to say you folks who make the pipes  have to open it up to other ISPs.  And so there's competition on the lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's funny, because the SEC did that with telcos  and didn't do that with cable.  Right.  And I agree, that's what you needed to do.  And now they've taken telcos out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and telcos don't have to open their lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a lot of ISPs are going out of business.  I'm not in complete agreement with this.  That's why I like to see some wireless stuff happen.  Because when the telcos were told to open up your lines  and we had people like North Point Communications,  which I was working with to have high speed back in the 90s,  there would be nothing but horror stories  about guys going into the local switch  and whoops, I tripped over your server.  Oh, I fell apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's coming from the telcos.  I had SonicNet.  No, that's not fair.  It's coming from the other guys.  I'll get Dane Jasper back in here again,  who runs SonicNet, who is former chairman  of the California Independent  Internet Service Providers Association.  They're being squeezed, they really are,  because the telcos want to keep them out of their COs.  Of course they do.  And they want a monopoly.  I think you're right though,  WiMAX, which doesn't use copper,  Dane, by the way, is pushing Sonic towards fiber.  Google is pushing towards fiber.  I mean, the problem is that these trenching solutions,  whether it's copper or fiber,  cost a heck of a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to think that wireless was our best way to go,  but the more I think about it,  the more I realize wireless always has its own problems  and wired is always more reliable.  It just always ends up being that way.  Maybe that'll change with WiMAX and LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to see wireless, especially WiMAX,  actually take off.  I mean, Intel's been doing nothing  dropping billions into it.  And the reason is because at some point,  and you should say, wow, you're right.  Wow, you're right.  Because at some point,  we'll be streaming internet content into our cars  as we're driving and you can listen to Twitter.  We're doing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you have the iPad app, you can do it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same thing, that's a little more  potentially than WiMAX. But I don't think  if they reclassify as telecommunications,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it makes one IO to a difference.  It ain't gonna be WiMAX, by the way.  Because if you talk on the telephone right now,  they don't stop you from saying dirty words.  They don't limit your free speech.  There's no fairness doctrine on telephone conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not broadcast.  If you, anything on the internet can ease-  I know, but at some point, I guarantee it.  Because if you think about the logic,  that phone calls me talking to you.  But when you're on the internet,  you're talking to potentially millions of people.  And some, it's not gonna take much,  but one crazy court case.  And the next thing you know,  wow, this is a form of broadcasting.  And it is a form of broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think being classified as an information service  as they are now is closer to that broadcasting  than classifying them as telecommunications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, apparently the courts didn't agree with that.  And that's why I think the FCC only has vague powers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  25 years from now, this will all be dissolved.  And this is what I'm gonna look like, just so you know.  Where'd you get that?  It's apparently an iPhone app.  Really?  That's not bad.  That will age you.  It looks pretty-  I think I look like that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you grow the mustache out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I grew that mustache,  I think that's exactly what I would look like.  What is the name of that app?  It's called Age Me.  Age Me.  Free or paid?  Jason Cartwright is here.  He does a podcast out of Australia called Tech AU.  TechAU.tv.  And he actually has a lot to say about this.  Should we bring him in?  Absolutely.  And just talk a little bit about  the three strikes issue in Australia.  Let's do that in just a second.  We're gonna get Jason miked up here.  And while we're talking, let me mention Squarespace.  Or while we're working, let me mention Squarespace.com.  Squarespace is a great place to go for your next website.  The fast and easy way to publish  a high quality website or blog.  We use it for our inside Twit blog.  And we're now working with them to redo the Tech Guy site  and a lot more because I just love it.  You've got to, in fact, I know you, Tom,  they support Buzz Out Loud, a great company.  Easy to use UI for managing and creating a website or a blog.  Optimized for both beginners and CSS experts.  Jason can use my, share my mic.  Just come around back here, Jason.  There's a blog module that includes  import, support, and export too for WordPress,  Blogger, Movable Type, and Type Pad.  So you're never stuck.  Forums, photo galleries, forum builders,  Google Maps and more.  I want you to try it free for a couple of weeks.  Just go to Squarespace.com slash Twit.  You don't even need a credit card.  You just set up a, don't even make it your site.  Just play with it just to get an idea  of the great templating, the statistics,  the iPhone app, incredible.  Can't wait till they do an iPad app.  That's going to be the ultimate blogging platform then.  Squarespace.com slash Twit.  And if you use the coupon code Twit,  and Tom, you were the one who explained this to me,  it's 10% off, not just for the first month  or the second month, but for the life of your account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, for good.  I didn't even know that.  Good and all.  Just use the coupon code Twit.  Wish I had done that when I started my forecast blog.  Think of all the money you've saved.  Yeah, 10%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of course, at eight bucks a month,  which is the starting cost, I mean, that's 80 cents,  but multiply it times years,  and that could be some dough.  Amortize that.  Amortize that.  Squarespace.com slash Twit.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  Jason Cartwright does a podcast out of Australia.  Actually, it's really a network very much like Twit.  T-E-C-H-A-U dot TV.  And he's here on a kind of tech tour of the US.  Hey, Jason, come sit over here  and share this mic with me.  How are you?  Hey, Leah, thanks.  So what's the status?  I mean, I know it's gone back and forth in Australia,  both with the internet filtering provision  and now the three strikes law.  What's the current status?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the internet filter is basically  gonna be presented to Parliament,  and it's all about the detail of what's in that.  So we've had a lot of rumor and speculation  as to what's gonna be included.  It's really down to the finer details as to  what we can oppose and what the opposition can oppose  and that sort of stuff.  There's been obviously a lot of campaigning  and uproar against it to try, you know.  Yeah, it's falling.  Yeah, like public protests and things like that.  But they haven't really seemed to make much of a difference.  It's gonna take this legislation to be in the courts  and in the Parliament and debate about it.  And then hopefully mass  proposal of the filter will occur.  So at the moment, I think a lot of Australians  just don't even know what's occurring.  People in the- Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because around the rest of the world,  we're all very aware of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people in the tech industry,  obviously, who pay attention, they know about it  and they feel very strongly about it.  But people who just go about their day-to-day lives,  it's just gonna be imposed on them.  And so, yeah, we'd prefer that not to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's really being railroaded too, right?  Because the ISPs did a test, one of them refused, right?  And then the others don't wanna do it.  The others failed.  And they still said, great, great test, everything failed.  Let's keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they'll try and basically the tests involved  specifying a list of websites  that they provide a blacklist to.  And of course, if you provide that to a router,  a switch, whatever, that's gonna not let those through.  So they claim that it's 100% successful.  The issue is where you get into new sites  popping up every single day  and that sort of content needs to be,  basically you need to use deep packet inspection  to detect the content and block it.  And so obviously we're conscious of the fact of overblocking  and blocking material that's not unsavory, if you like.  And that's where the real problem is.  What's the status of the Act of Three Strikes thing?  The Three Strikes thing, I'm not 100% up to speed.  I've been on vacation for a couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if it's currently an issue in Australia.  It was in New Zealand, I know.  That's why we did that black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe we're a party.  There's multiple countries involved in this.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but there's not a lot of detail that I'm aware of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They put out the draft finally for public viewing  after the New Zealand round.  The next round is in June in, I believe Switzerland?  Somewhere in Europe.  But it's all secret.  That's the sad thing.  Well, it's not secret anymore.  They finally put out a draft.  But what is still secret is the positions of the countries.  The US pretty much blocked anyone  from admitting who's in support of what parts of it  because the US is the ones being pushed by the industry  to put in provisions like a Three Strikes rule,  which is not actually in ACTA.  It's in a footnote.  There's a part of ACTA that says,  you should make every effort to deter copyright infringement.  And then in a footnote it says,  a great way to do this is a Three Strikes law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So will there be an opportunity now the draft's out?  Is that now our opportunity to have a,  I guess a place at that table to debate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now officials can actually publicly comment on it,  which they couldn't before because it was all confidential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, it's really nice to meet you, Jason.  Jason's blog is techau.tv.  He's kind of doing a tech tour of the US  and he picked up an iPad while he was in the States.  That was great that he was right there.  It just happens to be standing around.  I think we're gonna use Jason  as one of our Australian correspondents  because he does a great podcast  and it's great to, yeah, which is very convenient  that he happened to be around.  Web 2600 apparently is the author of Age Me.  So if you go to rfly.me slash age me,  you can, oh dear.  It's fun with the kids.  Make your relatives and friends look old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they say when you get old,  you start looking like a baby again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like Vicky Smothers there.  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Moving along to other stories in the tech world,  the tech news world.  Apple bans a Pulitzer Prize winning satirist for,  satire?  Editorial cartoonist Mark Fiore  won this year's Pulitzer Prize.  He's a local boy, you know.  Local boy, San Francisco Chronicle, right?  SF Gate.  SF Gate, I guess.  He has his own syndication business  and he applied to Apple for an app called NewTunes.  It features his work.  Apple rejected the app because it contains content  that quote, ridicules public figures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, that's what he does for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, which is protected speech.  You mean like an editorial cartoon?  You mean that's what you mean?  You can go after public figures.  That's the way the law allows it.  Thank you Justice Rehnquist  for the protection of editorial cartoons.  But now Apple has flip-flopped on this.  Apple has, as soon as this hit the press,  it was denied back in January  and as soon as the stories came out this week,  Apple said, oh no, no, we made a mistake.  Your app can come out.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well that was obviously gonna happen  because it was embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Call from Steve Jobs on line two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Fiore, could you please re-submit your app?  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you, this is bad, terrible press.  Credit to Wired's Epicenter blog for publishing it  and for getting Apple to back down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, is that the way you wanna have a store run?  Is that the platform you wanna develop for  where if you get enough press, you'll get accepted,  but otherwise you can be kicked out  for just irritating the approvers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazing that Opera Mini got approved by Apple.  The Opera browser got approved.  Yeah, that is kinda odd.  I did not expect that.  Anybody got a theory as to how that happened?  Well, in the past, they've turned down anything  that quote, duplicated functionality inside the iPhone  and the Opera Mini clearly duplicates the Safari browser.  I think this is an EU thing.  I think Apple.  Ah.  Opera's been very active in the EU.  They're the ones that got the EU to rule.  I think you're all over it.  You got it.  Microsoft had to have a browser ballot  giving Opera a huge market share.  It's worked again.  They're the number one free download  in all 22 app stores worldwide.  What the app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Opera Mini.  Really?  Opera says that Apple contacted them  and asked them to submit the Opera Mini browser  to the app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has to be totally EU related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if I believe that  because there was a countdown on the Opera site,  how long before Apple accepts us.  Yeah.  I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Opera's explanation is that  it doesn't duplicate the functionality of Safari  because it sends the request to Opera  where it goes through a proxy  and that compresses the pages  and supposedly gives you a faster browsing experience.  So that's different.  That's how they get off.  Which gives you a slower browsing experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and by the way,  I should mention this is a much less secure  browser experience on Opera  because they break all SSL certificates.  And if you go to your bank through Opera Mini,  you can see everything that you're doing  and you're banking because they have to do  a man in the middle.  So they won't do anything with it.  Yeah, do not use Opera Mini for anything secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They won't do anything with it,  but maybe the CIA will.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These are Norwegians.  You know, they can run the country via iPad now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently from an airport.  Yeah.  So it's not that complicated,  apparently, to run a country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, we're gonna take a break.  When we come back, John,  you may wanna just have another glass of wine  because it's all Twitter.  The Twitter Chirp Conference was this week.  All right.  And some big announcements for you.  I have some thoughts on Twitter.  Really?  Yeah.  I'll find that in the Tech Hippie,  I believe you mentioned somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the Tech Hippie.  One of them.  Yeah.  It was a brief thought.  I have new thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a very brief thought,  which we'll refer to.  You mean his brother.  His brother in the Tech Hippie had a brief thought.  But before we do that,  I do wanna mention audible.com, audible.com slash twit two.  Great place to go to get two,  not one, but two free books from Audible.  Audible's that great bookstore  that we love so much of audio books.  70,000 titles.  I know, Tom, you're a big Audible listener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's my favorite way to consume John Hodgman books.  Yeah, because John reads them.  Yeah, and he puts in extra stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's cool.  What should we pick?  There's so many choices.  I'm just finishing, by the way.  I really wanna thank you  for the Daniel Suarez recommendations.  Aren't they great?  Just coming to the end of freedom.  Yeah.  So good.  Political, that's what I liked about them.  It seems like at first it's just murder mystery,  sci-fi, and it actually is really about open internet  and freedom and corporate control and all that stuff.  John, you'd probably have a heart attack if you read it.  Definitely.  They are doing a great job with sci-fi.  Maybe we'll point this out.  The Audible Frontiers, Audible is basically bringing sci-fi  to your iPod or your iPhone or your Zune or your iPad  because for many years, I think the sci-fi publishers,  these guys were tabloid publishers.  They didn't have the wherewithal to record audio books.  So a lot of the greatest audio books were never recorded.  The greatest sci-fi books were never recorded in audio.  Now Audible has, thanks to their own initiative,  3,000 plus sci-fi titles.  When I joined Audible many moons ago,  like eight years ago, they had one or two.  So they've really improved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good for Sword and Laser actually.  Yeah.  Because the Wind Up Girl by Paolo Bacci Galupi  is the current one. Is that what we're reading right now?  And it is available on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I find, I think one of the reasons I like that  with Sword and Laser is because I like the idea  of participating in a book group,  but I just don't have time to read.  I'm always so tired when I get in bed.  I fall asleep. I wonder why.  Because I have to hold this heavy iPad up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to read on it.  Actually, I put it on a pillow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I read on it all the time.  I stick it on my knees.  See, I can just put the audio book on there  and I can listen, which I like.  You know what I want to recommend is Terry Pratchett.  I think almost all the Discworld books are on Audible.com.  Certainly a huge selection of them.  And it's really, Stephen Briggs does some of them.  Most of them, I think, and there are a few others,  but they just come alive.  If you've not read any Terry Pratchett novels,  you must have done some of the Discworld stuff for-  Not yet, not for certain laser.  We haven't.  You gotta do the, I guess you have to start at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  Series are always an issue when you're doing a book club.  And is this a series?  There's like 50 of them.  Well, it's not exactly a series.  It's a world, I guess.  It's a world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not how you look at it.  I'm trying to remember what the first one was.  I know they have it.  It's where you first meet Rincewind the Magician.  I just love this disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Terry Pratchett is really different.  If you've never read him,  it's the kind of sci-fi that you're not going to expect.  It's a little bit,  you think it's gonna be more like Douglas Adams,  but then it takes a turn where it's a lot more serious  than Douglas Adams, but still funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So serious, but yes.  And it's the same kind of wry humor.  Let me, this is the first one.  It's The Color of Magic.  Discworld number one.  Great way, Nigel Planer.  I'm gonna play a little bit of this so you can hear it,  but Nigel Planer does a great job narrating this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the far bank,  were bravely responding to the situation  by feverishly demolishing the bridges.  But already the ships in the more pork docks,  laden with grain, cotton and timber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't read these now.  I have to listen to them  because I've listened to so many now.  I don't even want to read the words.  And they're alive in your head.  And that's one of the things that's great about audio books.  Now that clip is low quality,  but they do have this available in two, three,  or four audio formats.  So you can get the much higher quality version.  And it's just the first of, I don't know, 50 of them.  Then there's a light fantastic and equal rights.  Get the first two, Color of Magic and Light Fantastic.  Terry Pratchett, Sir Terry Pratchett.  Great world he's created.  And I think you will love these books.  They just come alive.  Audible.com slash twit two.  Sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  Your first two books are free.  And yours to keep, you can cancel at any time  and you'll still have those books.  Audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them so much for their support.  And as long as we're talking,  what was the name of the book that you're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the windup girl by Paulo Bacigalupi.  And what's interesting about it on audible  is that it is narrated by a narrator and the author together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Veronica mentioned this last week  when she was on the show.  Yeah, yeah, I think she did.  Yeah.  So there's another good choice.  Sword and laser.com if you want to join that book club.  And the good way, I mean, I love it.  Do you actively say, let's find books that are on audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We try to find, we try to pick books  for a lot of different reasons.  We try to find them in ways that are as available  in as many different formats as possible.  And they tend to be available on audible more often  than on a Kindle actually, so it's easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, I love it.  Audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them for their support.  So Twitter had its first conference.  There've been a lot of Twitter conferences,  but Twitter's chirp constants  was the first thrown by Twitter.  And I've talked, you know, Gina Trapani was there  from our twig show and I've talked to other people there.  Gina kind of said, it's kind of funny to see Evan Biz  acting like the startup boys.  Oh, JG Shucks, we just have this little startup  called Twitter and you know,  we're just the kind of the young guy.  And she said, dudes, face up to it.  You're getting 50 million posts a day.  You're getting huge traffic  and it's a very important service  and stop pretending you're the aw shucks hippies.  They have announced finally a plan to monetize.  They're gonna make some money by putting ads on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, within the interstitial.  Oh no, search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Search.  Starting with search and then eventually  kind of very cautiously putting it  into your stream interstitial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They call it promoted tweets.  And you can, if you're on Twitter, you can try it.  I think this is about as benign as you can get.  Try it by doing a search for Starbucks,  for instance, on Twitter.  Is that working now?  And there you go, right at the top  under real time results for Starbucks.  You know, when I first heard about this, I did it  and they didn't have the promoted tweet.  And so the first like three tweets where Starbucks sucks,  I hate Starbucks.  So this is a way for a company to kind of control  the message a little bit better.  But you know what's interesting?  They said these are real tweets, right?  So you can see it says promoted by Starbucks, coffee.  But it was a tweet from April 9th.  It was a tweet from nine days ago.  It's not the most recent Starbucks tweet.  And it's a very clear ad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a different coloring behind it  and it says promoted by Starbucks.  Well, only when I hover, look at that.  Only when I hover.  Yeah, but you can kind of tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's very much like Google where they have kind of a  search result at the top.  Now they say they are gonna insert these  into the tweet stream and that I'm a little more nervous  about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and they're nervous about it too  because they're not doing it right away.  And they say they wanna make sure they do it in a way  that takes into account the kind of stuff you like  so that when you see it, it sort of blends in the way  a retweet does.  It's like, okay, that's the kind of stuff  I'd be interested in.  But that's the type to pull off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if I don't follow Starbucks,  will it show up in my timeline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're the kind of person who tweets about coffee a lot  or something, then yeah, good.  It would still show up.  Follow Starbucks.  That's a good question.  I know there are people out there who do, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't imagine anybody ever following,  wait a minute, I guess I'm following Starbucks.  Are you?  Are you really?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at that.  You're following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  I don't know why I'm following Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why they need promoted tweets  because nobody's gonna follow companies.  Well, wait a minute, let me see.  But that's a big fan.

Transcript:  Hey, 845,000 people are following Starbucks.  I said no one had ever done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you sure that they just made you follow?  Maybe they just follow them automatically.  Maybe the next thing you know, boom,  you're following them and you don't know it?  That would be bad.  And if Twitter did that, they would get in a lot of trouble.  But how are they gonna get caught?  First they take a look, they see how many people  you're following, if it's over 5,000 or 1,000  or something like that, they say, well, who's gonna know?  They'll never know.  You just throw it in, you'll never remember?  Can't remember that many?  And why is Starbucks following 82,000?  And how do they pick?  And how do they pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they could be following 20 million.  I mean, that's how many people use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That sounds like they used to follow everybody  who followed them and then at some point stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but there's no way that 845,000 people  actually are following Starbucks.  Sure there is.  Why not?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you follow them?  This is the stupidest thing you've heard humanity do?  You've heard of Farmville, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  I'll tell you why, I'll tell you why.  They put coupons up there, of course.  I know people who are big Starbucks fans,  who they live and die by Starbucks.  They can't wait to find another Starbucks.  When they see a Starbucks, they get excited.  I don't pretend to understand it, but I know they exist.  So, I mean, the number seems pretty big to me, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, they actually ask you to follow them.  Here's one.  Hey Bernard Falk, can you follow us?  I have a question, I'd like to DM you.  That's from Starbucks.  I think that, you know, April 15th,  they gave away free coffee,  so if you'd followed them, you knew that.  You want to know about specials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all right.  The next day they gave away two free cups.  Really?  Yeah, when it wasn't a special.  First prize is a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Second prize, two cups.  I get it, I get it.  And if you bring in a reusable mug on April 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well we've given them enough publicity,  although they could be a sponsor the way you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, it was Starbucks, I believe it was Starbucks  who suggested a morning show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, coffee, that makes sense, right?  Coffee, morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would go for it.  And do it out in New York City.  And when you get that place,  make sure there's a bedroom attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not going to matter, John.  The entire world is going to be covered with ash  and you won't be able to fly anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The promoted tweets got a lot of coverage  because it's their business plan.  But there's a lot of other stuff.  But then there's this API developer controversy  because Twitter has officially anointed a few apps  as their official clients.  They bought Tweety, they've created one for the Blackberry  and they say they're creating one for Android as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I would imagine, and I asked Gina this as well,  that developers might be up in arms.  And yet, there are people doing new Twitter clients.  And in fact, she mentioned one that was kind of clever  that had some filtration in it.  So you could say, I'd like to control a little bit more,  have more ways of controlling what I see.  I think there's opportunities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, what's this thing on Twitter?  It showed up, it's a little icon  that shows up in your generalized stream.  It's the retweet.  The retweeting, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like a recycled icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Half the people that I look at my regular,  I'm not following these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just the new way to do retweet  is to show who it came from originally  and then it'll say retweeted by X  and that's a person you are following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a little confusing, I admit.  I was baffled by it when I first saw it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it one bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like it at all.  I have a limited number of people I follow for good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in the old days,  you would have just seen the person who retweeted it.  So it is somebody you're following retweeting it.  It's just they're showing,  they're giving attribution to the original author,  if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bet you that if there were someone out there  who are kind of a hippie,  he might have something to say about it.  Someone's brother?  Someone's brother.  Or other?  Or other.  Might have something to say about Twitter.  As soon as I get through the ad.  What am I complaining about?  We got ads too.  This is an ad for, what is that an ad for?  Do not miss this film.  Oh, this is Kick-Ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently he's dying at the box office.  Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Boy, they were really at South By.  They were really interested in seeing Kick-Ass.  Long lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That comic is actually on the iPad, on Comixology.  Is it?  If you want to catch up.  So what's the best comic app on the iPad?  I like Comixology the best.  Better than Marvel.  Marvel gets all the attention.  Yeah, well the Marvel app is made by Comixology.  Oh, interesting.  Where's Comixology has Marvel and other publishers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's, let's see what the tech hippie has to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey man, what is this Twitter tweeting bull crap?  That's it.  That was it?  That's all he has to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who is this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Game Heavy Rain Man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a heavy rain in Berkeley, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What does your shirt, what does his shirt say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is, it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you checking me out?  Is that what it's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Checking me out, it's from, it was a Nintendo shirt.  Oh, MII.  MII, my me?  Yeah, and then of course he's wearing  a sheriff's department thing over a shirt over that.  The layers.  Layers.  And then of course the peace thing, which is.  Yeah.  The peace bling, we call it.  The peace bling.  It was like heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of like Woody Harrelson's character from 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey man, what's the story about virtual money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  John, you're a fertile, a fertile, fertile mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't get a job as an actor.  I can't understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Twitter also has added.  Your brother could, I think.  Added something new to the API called annotation,  which I think could be potentially very interesting  where you can annotate tweets with,  I think it's 500 bit bytes of pairs,  like weather equals, but they don't specify.  It could be nice, it could be sunny,  it could be rainy, it could be anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's like geo-tagging, except for other stuff.  Yeah.  Because you can geo-tag,  that's the only annotation you can do right now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's a standard, you know,  that's a longitude and latitude, or it's a city name.  This could be anything, weather equals hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then they don't specify that.  But the developer decides where it's gonna pull that.  You don't put that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the client, I guess, could use it somehow.  No, you don't, well, you could maybe have a client  that would let you put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  to say, add your weather right now,  and you could make it say, Fnord, or whatever you want.  Fnord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fnord.  Twitter has 105 million registered users,  22.3 million unique visitors in March.  They are adding 300,000 a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder what the, how they monetize each user,  it would be a minimum of 10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, according to Twitter, I'm sorry,  I said 22.3 million, that's the,  probably like a com score number.  Yeah, that's com score number.  Twitter's own number, 180 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that would be, that puts the company  at about two billion minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was that report that valued your followers  at $3.60 on average.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that would be the same  for monetizing it as a company for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And here's the deal on why you wanna have  a third party client.  75% of the traffic to twitter.com  doesn't come to twitter.com, it's from a client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, do you think the developers have a beef here  where they're like, hey, wait a minute,  we made all these clients for you,  and you fostered that and got us  to start businesses around this,  and now you've anointed one,  and we're left out in the cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, if you develop on top of somebody's platform,  whether it's Twitter or Facebook or Google,  you just, I think as a developer, you know this is life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've dealt with Microsoft, haven't you?  Yeah, or Apple.  Right, they set the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They seem to be shocked, these developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wonder if the people who are shocked  are actually third party client developers or just people.  Troublemakers.  Hacker dot, hacker news or slash dot readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could see the developers being upset  that they didn't get picked.  They're like, wait, you bought Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they still haven't picked an Android application,  so there's still, you know, there's some competition.  There's some competition going on.  And I think you're right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you can have an official Twitter client,  just like you have an official Facebook client,  and still have other apps that do other things.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's the key is that,  as always with a developer,  you've gotta find a unique niche.  Did you, you must have heard the 8-bit,  this has nothing to do with anything.  We talked about this on Current Geek Weekly.  I thought you might.  Yeah.  8-bit Dark Side of the Moon.  This is hysterical.  Yeah, somebody has taken.  Brad Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brad Smith, well done, Brad Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me just play you, I just, I don't know why.  I just have to play this.  This is, you'll recognize this little ditty  from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  What are you, squeaking your chair there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You loaded a bunch of gear back here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry, is it in your way?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you gonna do with all that junk?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.  ["Dark Side of the Moon Theme Song"]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  ["Dark Side of the Moon Theme Song"]  You recognize the song?  Yeah.  ["Dark Side of the Moon Theme Song"]  Ha ha!  ["Dark Side of the Moon Theme Song"]

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not bad, actually.  It's not far off. It's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then did you see the Nintendo version  of Dr. Horrible's musical box?  That was great, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I loved all this 8-bit stuff.  Now, of course, with this, somebody has to,  the obvious, you have to come up with an 8-bit version  of Wizard of Oz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, because you gotta play it next to.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's probably what the tech hippie listens to  when he's hanging out at home, as I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't it funny that the nostalgia for this Nintendo era,  it's people like you, Tom, who grew up  playing Nintendo, right?  Or Atari, yeah.  Or Atari, yeah.  I was in my 20s when this stuff came out.  John was in his 50s, but.  I was in my 60s, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember that very well.  60s, get it right.  John C. Dvorak is at channeldvorak.com!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've got a story that I think we should be discussing.  We're not done.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was wrapping it early.  Tell me, tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did anyone read this health alert?  Samsung releases safety disclaimer  regarding the health risks of 3D viewing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We actually talked about this on the radio show.  First of all, you buy a Samsung 3D TV.  It comes with the one Blu-ray 3D disc.  There is only one.  So nothing else is in 3D.  It comes with two pairs of glasses  if you want a third family member to watch 150 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and a lot of people would have maybe  a husband, wife, couple kids.  How would you watch a Super Bowl game with the boys?  You can't have a party.  You go broke.  And it gives you a headache!  Minimally.  Some people.  Maybe epilepsy.  May cause nausea.  May cause nausea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my favorite one.  So, excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oto-sensitive seizure warning and other health risks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That I understand they have to do  because in fact we got in trouble on the screensavers.  Remember, we played some sort of flashing thing.  It tells you not to watch while you're drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, drunks should not watch 3D TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm confused.  It looks, oh, I put my hand through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are a lot of people who can't see 3D TV.  There's a lot of people who does give headaches to.  So they're just being ultra cautious.  But pregnant women, didn't it say?  Shouldn't watch it?  And drunks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And drunks should be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One thing I did also want to mention, I forgot,  is what do you think of the new space policy?  Because I think a lot of us geeks  were a little perturbed that the budget,  the Obama budget kind of backed off space exploration.  Obviously, he heard that.  Neil Armstrong thinks so.  Well, and Neil and Buzz disagree, right?  Neil's pissed off.  Buzz thinks it's a great program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buzz is being invited to the White House for dinner.  He kind of likes the guy.  He's been on Dancing with the Stars.  Neil is like anti-social.  He never does anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But wait, because they revised it.  This week, President Obama gave a speech  at the Kennedy Space Center and said,  you know, we're going to do some stuff.  We're not, you know, look,  I think this is the right thing to do,  which is to say, look, we're in tough economic times.  We can't afford a Mars program and a moon program,  but we understand that it's important  to do space exploration.  So we're going to do what we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And privatize more, make more,  Jerry Cornell's got to love that.  Companies to take stuff into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what, we'll get Jerry on next week.  I should have gotten him on this week to talk about it,  because he has been pushing private space exploration  for some time.  I hate that idea.  Do you want corporations to put ads up on the moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they do too.  That's the first thing I do.  Of course that's what they do.  You look like the NASCAR moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says something on the moon.  You don't need to get up there to do that.  How much would PepsiCo pay to say, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  taste the taste of the new generation on the moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Y'all are nuts.  That's not what's going to happen.  It's not?  I think it's a good idea.  I think you have to, I mean,  to get to that 2001, a space Odyssey,  where Pan Am is flying into the space hotel,  Pan Am went broke already.  Yeah, I know.  It's just a bad prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the new plan is NASA's budget will go up,  six billion over the next five years,  most of it going into research.  Whatever that means.  They're going to develop,  they're going to replace the constellation,  which they've canceled with a new heavy lifting rocket.  That's good.  The Orion capsule based on the Apollo capsule  will still be built initially for space station.  As a lifeboat.  As an escape module,  but it could be adapted for crew space missions.  And NASA will plan missions to near earth asteroids.  I think something that's a very good idea  if you read any science fiction.  Yeah, sure.  By 2020 to Mars in the thirties,  but we aren't going to go to the moon.  And that's where Neil says,  we can go to the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I, the idea,  I thought it was a good idea to go back to the moon  as a way to train for going to Mars,  to build a way station,  to kind of try things out  and make sure that the constellation program worked.  So I feel like this is gutting that a little,  to say, you know what?  We spent all this money on Orion and constellation  and we still want to go to Mars,  but we're just going to go there direct without that.  Seems a little bit like he threw that in,  the president threw that in to mollify people.  Well, he mollified me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe he didn't mollify Neil, but he mollified me.  By the way, this, Justin,  Coke sponsored Rover finds evidence of Dasani on Mars.  The real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably a bunch of empty bottles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's called the real Rover.  And it found signs that cool, refreshing Dasani water  once drenched the surface of the red planet.  This discovery is so exciting, says Dr. Marvin Chen,  NASA space science administrator  and temporary liaison to Coca-Cola,  that it indicates that the red planet  may have once hosted a healthy,  active, fun-filled microscopic life.  The onion.  The onion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the real Rover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They allow the Rover,  we talked about this on current Geek Weekly Friday,  they allow the Rover to make decisions for itself now.  Well, like what?  Line it up, program it, and say, go.  It's the autonomous Rover.  That's gonna build an army and come back here.  That's what's gonna happen.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Clean things up.  John C. Dvorak, can I now wrap this sucker?  I think so.  This fish, put it to bed.  John C. Dvorak is at channeldvorak.com.  He has something to do with the tech hippie,  that new one, and the old one, the tech grouch,  although the hippie looks older than the grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grouch is making a comeback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, was it gone for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, the tech hippie tried to,  so it's a ratings battle.  Has it warred?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Create a little bit of.  I'm gonna kick your ass.  Oh dear, oh my gosh.  Oh, the battle.  Oh well, that's kick ass, nevermind.  I thought that was,  I thought that was tech hippie and tech grouch  fighting it out.  That would be good.  And Tom Merritt, who is still for the nonce  at cnet.com, he is the host of Buzz Out,  what's gonna happen to Buzz Out Loud without you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  That is yet to be announced,  so stay tuned to bol.cnet.com to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But through May 14th and then a couple of weeks off,  and then he joins the Twitter network on June 1st,  and we're gonna have lots to talk about at that time, sure.  I am very excited to get started.  Working on all sorts of stuff.  So glad to have you as part of the team, Tom.  Thanks, Leo.  It's been a long time, I've been doing this all by myself,  I need some help.  And John, I don't know if Adam's listening,  but if you ever get tired of that dude,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you give me a call.  Well, the No Agenda Show at noagendashow.com.  I like the show, excellent.  It's pretty hard to walk away from him.  And he's done a great job with that, yeah.
