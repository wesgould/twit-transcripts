Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Leo, shallow are us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want people, I like to lower expectations.  I don't want people to think, you know, they're going to get anything in profound here.  Just you know, chatter.  We'll do what we can.  We'll do what we can.  Dwight is going to be coming out to the big event, the Apple event on Wednesday.  So we'll see more of him on the Twitter network.  I'll tell you more about that in a little bit.  Also with us from his mansion in beautiful Brentwood, it's Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually at Mahalo working on a Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Working on a Sunday, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Barely working.  Barely.  If you think about being a CEO working, sure, I'm technically working.  He's working hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Mahalo.com, M-A-H-A-L-O.com.  But Jason also does some great podcasts, some really good stuff like this week in startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, going so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Going really well.  And I know you work with Kevin Pollack on his show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Pollack's chat show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What else you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to do, we just started another one called This Week in Android, just to focus  on the droid operating system.  You like it that much?  I think it deserves a show of its own.  I'm just experimenting.  I would like to see if one of these hyper niche shows can work.  I know you guys have the big ones.  Are you doing This Week in Photography or is that somebody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alex does it, but he does it out of our studio, so it's kind of a joint venture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's always big ones.  I wanted to see if a little niche one could work as a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's very smart.  I think that that probably will work really well.  Don't the super niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a weblog zinc model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Don't the super niche.  Of course, Engadget is the king, but there are Android sites, fan sites that I probably  do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just interested in the whole concept of disrupting the mobile ecosystem.  I think it's much bigger than the phone system.  I think it's what we're talking about a whole operating system here.  From tablets to refrigerators, I think Google has a bigger vision than just phones.  I mean, it's obvious they do.  They're going to talk about Netflix as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And cars.  Let's not forget cars.  I think that this Microsoft Auto is doomed in the long run because Android is going to  and say, hey, we'll give it to you for free or even better, do the less than free model.  We'll pay you to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The world has changed radically in the last 10 years in terms of charging for software,  charging for operating systems and open versus closed systems.  It's pretty stunning, but I think we've all come to the conclusion that more often than  not, open wins.  More often than not.  Not always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As you may know, I've switched off the iPhone and switched on the Nexus One and I am not  looking back.  Although, Dwight, you say you couldn't make that switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there are too many things about the...  I really love the Nexus One.  In fact, if I was a T-Mobile user or had, you know, was on a network where I could get  3G on it, I would probably consider switching to it.  Certainly, if I was going to use an Android phone, this would be the one I'd want to use.  But it doesn't do enough of the things that I needed to do.  I like having the choice of apps that I do on the iPhone.  I much prefer having just one email client because I use both Exchange and Gmail and  you have to have two separate email clients to do that on an Android phone.  As I showed you earlier, you can't copy and paste out of an email message, out of the  fixed text in an email message.  There's just enough things that irritate me about it that I wouldn't want to switch to  it at the moment.  But I could see myself over time being more interested in this phone.  Of course, we need to see what Apple is going to do with the next generation of the iPhone.  iPhone 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think, you know, what happened to me, yeah, there's a lot of things on both  sides.  I wouldn't be able to...  Now that I'm used to dictating instead of using the keyboard everywhere, it'd be hard  for me to go back to the iPhone.  But, you know, the biggest thing that makes it hard to go back is just simply the screen.  Once you get used to an OLED screen, the iPhone screen just looks washed out, low-res and  washed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely...  The screen is a killer application at this point.  It's amazing the difference.  You wouldn't think something that simple would make a difference.  Additionally, you're already starting to see early returns on the rapid iteration on applications.  The fact that you can just load any application from any site at any time and do whatever  you want with your operating system.  I know this is like a broken record for 17 twits we've been talking about it, but it  actually is here now.  And it's pretty compelling when you can just like, I'm going to go to yelp.com slash, you  know, the application name or whatever it is and load it.  And there's nobody between you and what you choose to do with your phone.  I have a BlackBerry, an iPhone and a Nexus One.  Right now I'm on the Droid and I'm moving to the Nexus One.  And I find I enjoy the Droid operating system better.  It's faster and the screens are better, obviously.  But there's one or two applications that I have on my iPhone that are critical that I  can't get yet on Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm curious.  I have a very specific one called Remote Patrol, which is, lets me look at the cameras around  my house.  That's good.  And the camera I have installed in the nursery.  And I have a pan tilt and zoom camera in my nursery so I can zoom in on the baby, if the  baby's with a nurse, if I'm out with my wife at dinner like I was last night.  You don't have any anxiety because I take literally take out my iPhone, pull up this  great program called Remote Patrol, costs 10 bucks, that goes into Security Spy, which  is a $300 program for IP based cameras on a Mac Mini in my closet.  You can zoom in on the nanny with the baby and you just sort of feel calm.  But there are some IP phones in the Droid store I just saw in the last two weeks.  So I think somebody's going to get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a Sonos application, which is only for the Apple.  But to me, these are very specialized and there's no reason why they can't easily make  an Android version of these things.  It's just a question of the market being big enough for Sonos or Patrol to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I have a thought that if we had full feature browsers on these phones as opposed  to handicapped browsers, this would be less of an issue because a lot of the applications  would actually run just inside the browser.  And maybe they can run at 80% or 90%, but maybe that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Apple's going that way.  I think HTML5 is the key on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  HTML5 is the key on it.  And I just don't, I think Apple may have overplayed their hand.  If you know that term from poker where you sort of think your hand is a little bit stronger  than it is, I think that the hubris is coming because the total cost of ownership of this  phone, I saw one study that said it's half of the iPhone.  And yeah, just in terms of the monthly bill over a couple of years and the onboarding  price.  So I think I have to take a little bit of a deeper look at it.  Somebody can tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's accurate because I'm a T-Mobile user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The data prices are the same.  The monthly data price is $30 on both phones.  So it's the same in terms of your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T-Mobile has that even more plus plan, which I think is 70 bucks.  But it's month to month, which I like.  So you don't have the commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then what about the onboarding price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the onboard?  You mean the hardware price?  Yeah.  Is it similar?  $529 unlocked, $179 locked with a two-year commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what can you get into an iPhone for now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if you want to get a cheaper iPhone.  Get the $100 3G.  Get the $100, the 3G, the older 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think there's maybe 20 bucks a month.  That's only 240 bucks in the life of the phone.  I don't think half is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  20 bucks a month over two years or something like that?  Yeah, 240 bucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, 480 bucks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe you save three.  I mean, I know this seems like a lot for a professional guy who does this for a living,  but for a college kid or for my mom who has a phone that's 11 years old now, I'm not  11 years old now, I'm embarrassed to say.  Wow, I'm impressed.  She literally has the next...  No, my mom came in to see the baby and we're out at...  I take her to lunch in Beverly Hills, like I'm trying to be a good son, and she takes  out this phone and pulls out the antenna.  I look at it and I'm like, that looks like a walkie talkie from the first desert storm.  I'm like, oh my God, what is that thing?  I was like, I got you that when I was the editor of Silicon Island Report.  That's so cute.  I got you.  You got this for me.  I never forgot it.  And it's very good phone and I'm not replacing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It probably has got four weeks battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't do text messaging.  It doesn't do anything.  I'm like, now I know why my mom's not getting my text.  Her phone doesn't do it.  I thought she was not ignoring my text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's the one thing.  It's really funny to watch movies, even a few years old, because the phones are so primitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They pull out the Star Trek.  I laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just cracks me up.  It just cracks me up.  And I think this is going to be a bigger and bigger problem with tech in movies.  If I were making a movie these days, I'd put as little tech in it as possible because it's  worse than hairstyles.  It's going to date you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see Caprica last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it great?  Oh, it's awesome.  It's so awesome.  It literally is awesome.  I'm like beside myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the relationship to Battlestar Galactica?  It's the pre-series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically, this is when Adama is a little kid.  And when the first generation of Cylons are made.  So like the first episode without giving anything away is basically the guy building the first  Cylon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  It explains how they became more human at the start of it.  And how they went to war.  But it's a great series.  How inspired is that?  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The scene I wanted to tell you about was they basically take out a piece of e-paper and  she's on the subway or the mag lift and she's basically doing a minority report type interface  on a piece of paper that she folds up and crumples and puts in her jacket.  That's not far off.  I think that'll happen.  That's not far off.  I think that's what Steve Jobs is announcing on Wednesday, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  We're going to talk about that.  I think this is all prequel to what happens on Wednesday.  I mean, everything changes on Wednesday.  We're going to talk about that in just a second.  In fact, before we get going, because I know that's going to be a heck of a conversation,  I want to just talk briefly about our friends at Citrix, the manufacturers of the fantastic  go to meetings software.  Citrix is really good at remote access.  That's what they made their bones to use a Brooklyn term on many, many moons ago.  In fact, Windows still uses in its remote desktop protocol the basic Citrix software.  If you're doing high-end enterprise remote access, many of you are using Citrix.  But that high-end stuff is also what makes the consumer stuff so easy to use, so powerful,  so effective.  Go to meeting is a really great example of this.  If you want online meeting software, you don't want to be jumping through hoops.  You don't want to have to get the IT department involved opening ports.  You don't want to have to DMZ your firewall or any of that stuff.  You just want it to work.  And this is where go to meeting just excels.  Not only because you want to make it easy for you, but let's face it, if you're using  it for sales presentations, you cannot make your client jump through hoops to see your  sales presentation.  That's just not going to fly.  That's why I use and recommend go to meeting.  Try it right now for free.  First of all, you're going to install this thing.  It's going to take you a minute.

They're seeing the PowerPoint.  It's very engaging, very dramatic, makes you look good, makes them happy because they're  seeing what they need to see, makes that conference call much more interesting, much less boring.  Great for product demos, for training.  Yes, even if they don't have the software, they can use it on your system after you show  them how.

You got a golden ticket, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did get a golden ticket.  They are letting me out of my cave and out of my spider hole and I'm coming out there  for the Apple event.  And as we were discussing, I do think this is probably Apple's most important announcement  since the iPhone.  And use the phrase, it'll change everything.  I don't know if it'll change everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nobody knows and I'm willing to be skeptical, but I have to say I am convinced Steve Jobs  and Apple hope and plan that it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still, you know, I'm not convinced that even a super cool, neato tablet that is sexy,  is thin, you know, very intuitive to use is something that necessarily people want.  And I think it's going to be a particularly hard sell if it's at the prices that Apple  traditionally sells at.  I think the Apple faithful will line up for it and buy it, you know, regardless of the  price.  I'm just not convinced.  And I know that, you know, according to reports, Steve Jobs has been skeptical about this himself.  He said he didn't want to do just something that people would say, oh, I can take this  to the restroom and read on it.  You know, I think that it would be, I think to assume that it's going to be a hit is a  mistake because I don't necessarily think that this is what the masses necessarily want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm with you.  I've said for a long time, I've been saying for a year.  I don't want a tablet and anything that we've seen that qualifies as tablet, including all  the crazy devices we saw at CES are whole hum.  But I think Apple knows that.  And I think Apple realizes that they have to do something dramatically different to  make this have a chance.  And I can imagine some things.  And I think, you know, John Gruber said this, we talked to John on MacBreak Weekly.  He's the daring fireball.net blogger and an Apple observer.  He said, and I think he was quite right, this has to be a category changer.  This has to be an inflection point because nobody there's no demand for something that's  somewhere between an iPhone and a laptop.  There's no need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So unless it was something that was not very expensive and you could keep it on your couch  and it wasn't a thousand dollar device like like the promise of the Crunchpad, basically,  if it was a three hundred dollar device, you don't think people would buy one or two of  them to watch these or on a plane?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what here's OK, I'm going to tell you what I think it is.  And I would love to hear what you think about this.  And I think that we will hear some stuff on Wednesday that we didn't expect.  I think there will be Gruber says there's going to be a aha moment where you just go,  oh, my God, all the pieces were there.  Why didn't we see this?  I think it's very clear they're making content deals.  I think there's content deals with HarperCollins.  We've heard that leaked.  Condi Nast, probably all first, probably The New York Times.  So that means it's it's going to be a book reader.  Now, the Kindle is a very competent book reader, but is not so competent, I think, when it  comes to magazines and newspapers, because it's not in color and it's very difficult  to skim and browse and jump around.  A faster color device would solve that problem, especially with a little Apple UI magic.  And I don't know what that magic will be.  But I think some UI magic could could actually be a breakthrough product for reading magazines.  There's nothing like that yet.  Very slim, very elegant.  I believe it will have an OLED screen.  We were talking before the break about how OLED is kind of the killer feature of the Nexus  One.  Once you use an OLED screen, you just don't want to go back to an LCD screen.  Now, that means it's expensive.  A 10 inch OLED part is 300 bucks in quantity.  So this isn't going to be a cheap device.  However, I'm going to add some features that might make it cheaper.  First of all, TV subscription.  Apple's been pushing this idea of getting a 15 or 30 dollar kind of network television  thing where you get the best of network television automatically.  Movies on an OLED 720p screen.  It will be a gorgeous screen.  Gorgeous.  Compete with your HDTV because it's in your lap and portable.  And this is the most important part.  I think it has to have always on wireless, a la the Kindle, whispernet style wireless.  I don't think you ever necessarily connect this to your computer.  And that wireless is subsidized and the cost is subsidized by the content creators.  So even though it's a thousand dollar device, I think you're right, Jason.  They've got to bring it and they're not going to bring it to 300, but I think they got it.  It's got to be 500, 600, 700.  700 is going to be what it is.  Maybe they'll do an LCD for 700 and OLED for eight or nine.  I don't know.  But I think subsidy is multiple models, multiple models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that way they can offer something that, you know, if you don't want to pay the subsidy  because a lot of people aren't going to want to pay yet another 20 or 30 dollars a month,  you can get it and it won't be overpriced.  But if you do, if you want to get the 3G and the OLED screen, you know, you're willing to  pay it.  There's been some discussion among the many rumors that have come out from the hardware  suppliers that they're looking at a seven inch and a 10 inch.  And I could see doing the smaller version as kind of an Uber iPod touch.  Jason, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, clearly based on the HarperCollins stuff in the New York Times, this thing is  going to have an e-reader functionality.  Oh, I left out gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I left out gaming, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this means that it has got e-reader functionality and it runs the iPhone applications if it  does games, which means we're probably talking about the iPhone operating system, not Mac  OS 10, which means it doesn't need to have the same hardware footprint.  So it could be more like a mobile phone processor, a memory footprint, which makes it cheaper,  obviously.  I heard rumors two or three years ago and I wrote about them and I may have talked about  them on here that Apple was going to go into the TV business.  Right.  I remember that.  And you were sure of it too.  Well, I got it pretty from like, where I got it from is, I'm not going to say because of  Apple's position and how they do stuff, but I got this from a really good place.  And I'll leave it at that.  And that they were working on TVs.  And it makes total sense because if you think about the Apple TV and the Mac Mini, those  things could easily, I mean, in fact, people Velcro those to the back of TVs.  And iMac, the new iMac is a television set, essentially.  You put it on your wall.  So what's the difference between making a 30-inch cinema display monitor and making  a 42-inch TV?  12 inches.  That's the only difference.  And you know that the gearheads and the Apple fanboys would absolutely love to have an Apple  television set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you could make a 10-inch diagonal, quarter inch thick OLED screen.  Now, if you hold a 10-inch screen in front of your face, that's kind of the same as a  50-inch 1080p across the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And I think what we've talked about on the show before, when you get on a plane today,  you see a dozen or two people with those little DVD players.  This is a definitive market, portable DVD players.  I don't know the size of it.  Somebody in the Twitter live chat room should go do a little research on it.  I don't know how many of those are sold a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's seven or eight inches.  Those are not super big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But you, I mean, how many of those do you see?  Everybody with kids has those.  And then you see another couple of dozen people or a dozen people on every flight with it.  You see kids with an iPod touch watching a Disney film, watching a Star Wars Clone Wars,  something like that.  So it's a natural evolution that there's a younger generation that would like, I agree  with you, your premise, that they would hold their television and watch it that way.  And if it had a stand in the back that made it stand as opposed to a third party stand,  that would be a very Steve Jobs-ish feature to add.  So I think the media player with a subscription and an e-reader is as close as we're going  to get without seeing it.  But yeah, it's somewhere in that kill zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that enough?  I mean, you're an expert on content.  Is that enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, anything Steve Jobs makes is going to be intriguing.  We know that.  It's going to be gorgeous, right?  It's going to be gorgeous.  The Kindle is a total success.  And they shipped more e-books than they did regular books on the couple of days in Christmas.  It's a little bit of a misleading stat, but I think that was sold through Amazon.com,  not in stores, obviously.  So e-books are a definitive trend.  Apple is a natural for the e-book category.  Why they're not in it already is peculiar.  And why there's no e-book reader on the iPhone that they produce is a little bit weird, don't  you think?  So obviously they're saving that for something.  It needs to be bigger.  It's an e-reader plus plus plus.  E-reader plus plus plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's where OLED I think really does well.  It is a lower power screen, particularly crisp, very legible, very readable.  Now it's not great in daylight.  Usable in daylight, but not great in daylight.  So you might keep the Kindle for your daylight e-ink reading.  But I do think that this is perhaps a compelling device, especially if you think of it as a  content device.  Now here's the interesting thing.  Do you put a browser on it?  Maybe.  I don't think you put email on it.  I don't think you put an on-screen keyboard, but just to be used as a Kindle keyboard is  used to find content.  I don't think it's a content creation.  I think it's a consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you can do email, why not put email?  If it's going to be the iPhone OS, which has a very nice email client, I think email is  a natural.  I think you definitely put a web browser on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, why wouldn't you put cut and paste on the iPhone?  Right.  I mean, it's quite possible he'll leave a browser out for now and then he'll get beat  up into doing it just like he got beat up into putting a second, you know, a button  on a mouse.  But why wouldn't he simply get go?  I don't see why.  Because he's Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wants to keep it simple.  I think you're selling this as a crossover device.  If you've got a laptop and you don't need this, if you've got an iPhone, you don't need  this.  This is a crossover device to be sold.  And now, by the way, I got laughed off of This Week in Google yesterday by Jeff Jarvis  I said this is to be sold to people who don't have computers.  He said, who would that be?  But I think it really is a it's it's not to replace your laptop or iPhone.  It's to replace your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And for people who want to read books and magazines on the on the train, you know, there  are a lot of people like that in New York City who maybe are not using their computers  to consume their media.  It's on your first shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the bathroom.  It's on your breakfast table.  It's on the it's on the subway.  It's on the train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People will use this device if it's the right price.  It's not going to be the right price out of the gate.  So I think actually that's where that's that's only part of your logic.  I don't go for Leo is respectfully is that you I think that they will go at a high price  like they always do get, you know, a suckers to buy because we have to have it.  And then you'll see it available at 99 whatever 299 next at Christmas time.  So it's going to come out at 699 and by Christmas will be 299 with a subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they can sell a compelling device.  I think that this is you're right.  These are this is this there's two sticking points that are huge.  You got to do the content deals.  And right now, you know, if you look at what TV shows or movies you can get on any of these  places, it's like who wants to watch that?  So that's problem number one.  They have to get you know, get Disney.  But he's got to get everybody to play on this.  And number two is how do you how do you make the price low enough and yet make the make  the hardware compelling enough?  It has to be gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if it has a PVR in it and a digital tuner where I can plug it into my TiVo or my satellite  dish and I can record stuff to it and then take it on the go?  I think it's too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're silent.  You're silent.  Dwight, if you can plug it unplug and plug it.  I think that I think that Steve's going to work really hard.  This is why I have this issue with email and browser.  I think Steve's going to work really hard to make this a super simple device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the HD over the airwaves?  Why not put an HD...  He might have Y-Di in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This wireless display technology that Intel's been talking about.  You could put that in it.  Actually, there you go.  I think that's important.  Let's put Y-Di in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it also has 802.11 in which means you could easily stream HD content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's basically you saw wireless.  Well, you weren't at CS, but Intel was showing this wireless display technology, which basically  that's what it is.  You get a receiver from D-Link that attaches to the TV and then the laptop and Dell's doing  this and HP's doing this.  The laptop will stream to that receiver.  It's just a simplified thing.  Steve does not like a bunch of stuff hanging off the side.  I think he wants a beautiful silver and black monolith.  Self-contained.  Self-contained.  I don't think he even wants to put a display port adapter on there, but if you could figure  out a wireless connection that just kind of worked, I could see Steve maybe doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe he'll come out with something where the new Mac Towers are coming out supposedly  and maybe there'll be some way to connect this to your computer if you want some of  that functionality.  Remember the MacBook Air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember he didn't have a DVD player, but he put it on every Mac, this kind of remote  DVD capability.  You could put a DVD in the iMac and you could see it on the MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use that to install stuff, so yeah, maybe that's the kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to be that transparent where you just go, oh, well, you just put the DVD in  the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, if you already have this ecosystem of applications and content for the iPod and  the iPod Touch, and I'm going back, Leo, to your saying that he'll keep it simple and  won't include some things, I think you have to have everything that's on the iPod Touch  and the iPhone in order to make it compelling and to make people go, oh, well, I'd rather  have an iPhone instead of that because I can do all this with it.  I mean, he's got to have a web browser on it.  I don't think you cannot put a web browser on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  I just think he wants to create a new category.  I don't think he wants to cannibalize iPhones or laptops.  I think he wants to make something that has never before been seen.  But a web browser at 10 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no phone.  No phone.  A web browser at 10 inches is a different experience than a web browser at three and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a half.  Especially in a 720p OLED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And particularly if you want to do e-commerce.  If you want to encourage e-commerce, you've got to have that browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know how Steve wants to control the channel, though, and a browser kind of opens it up  a little bit more than he might want.  Well, this is going to be very interesting.  I think everybody's agreed that something's going to happen Wednesday that will either  be huge or a big fat dud.  And if that's the case, that's a big story.  There's no question.  We're going to do a full day of coverage.  We start at 9 a.m. from outside the event.  Andy, Anatole, and I will be there.  We'll go into the event together.  We'll do our best job.  Alex Lindsay will be anchoring here at the Twit Cottage with as many people as we can  get in here.  And we'll do the best job we can during the event.  Steve never allows that to be streamed.  But usually there's somebody getting something out of there.  And if not, we'll at least follow the...  I'll be typing and we'll follow in Gadget and then GDGT and everybody typing.  And then when we come out of the event, I hope you'll come over, Dwight.  And Andy will be there.  We're going to...  talking in obsessive detail about what actually happened.  And then we're not going to stop.  We're going to keep going until four or five that afternoon.  So a full day of coverage of whatever Apple announces.  It's going to be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be a huge day.  And do you know anybody who actually claims to have seen anything on the QT?  No.  There's people in the Twitter circle who will say, like, I can't...  Off the air.  I did see something.  So none of those people, you don't have like a Kevin Rose whispering in your ear, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There has never been a tighter lid.  The only problem they've had is these partners.  And I think even the New York Times is being a little disingenuous when they say, oh, we're  going to do this next year.  I think this is one of the tightest lids ever.  And I think that's because Steve Jobs, the man who is the king of this...  Is back.  This is his, it may be his last.  I hate to say that, but this is very important to Steve.  We know they've been working on this for seven years since 2003.  I think Steve sees this as every bit as important as the Macintosh.  This is a big announcement for Steve.  And I think everybody at Apple knows, you're nuts are on the line here.  This isn't just your job.  You're going to lose a body part if you say word one.  You know, Kevin asked for all the rumors.  I don't know if you saw this.  He said, let's do a roundup all the rumors.  I haven't seen anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He didn't post.  There's no post.  And Gawker did the whole offering to pay people to break their NDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Break all of it.  Nothing.  You know, if this is a dud and it doesn't produce something, you know, you said it'll  be a big story.  What does that say for Steve Jobs if it doesn't score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what it says?  Well, what it says is Steve is willing to swing for the fences and he always has been.  He's a gutsy guy.  And I think Steve is not satisfied with anything less than excellence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the last dud?  Was it the cube?  I mean, when's the last time he would say he did something that was like embarrassing  or just bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just bad.  I think the first iBook was pretty bad.  I think the cube was not his fault.  That was pre-Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that he loved that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he did.  Maybe that was Jobs.  That was his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wanted to get rid of the fan.  Remember he was like, I can't stand the fan.  Nobody wants a fan.  Nobody wants a big computer.  Everybody wants an object of art on their desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can make the case that the next cube and the Apple cube were successful as  concepts just they didn't sell.  The iBooks sold well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Mac Mini is the cube just flattened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple TV is kind of a...  That's a flop.  That's a flop.  But they deprecated that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say Steve deprecated it saying, oh, it's a hobby.  I don't think Steve ever had his heart and soul in that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about mobile?  That was weird.  I mean, why did they come out with the Mac Mini and the Apple TV?  It makes no sense because I was talking to somebody yesterday who has the Apple TV and  he's like, yeah, I just can't pull up a browser.  I can't do this and I can't pull up Hulu.  And I'm like, I go on my Mac Mini now and I will load Hulu or Netflix in the browser.  Much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Much better.  Running on an Apple TV or XBMC or Plex running on an Apple rather on a Mac Mini is a great  experience.  It's just that the connectors are a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's more extendable.  You can upgrade your Mac Mini even though it's difficult.  But it's got all more ports and all that kind of stuff.  I just don't understand that product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not that Steve is perfect.  The iPod Hi-Fi, that was a...  In fact, this could be that...  I went to Cupertino for the big Steve Jobs announcement that was Apple's iPod Hi-Fi in  which he said, I wanted the perfect stereo system.  I've thrown out my stereo system for this.  And socks, iPod socks.  And this was the announcement and I went out shaking my head.  So it's clear that Steve could swing for the fences and whiff, but he hasn't done it often.  And you got to say, there's no one in the industry who has four major successes, the  Apple II, the Macintosh, the iPod and the iPhone.  There's no one with that kind of success and this could be his fifth.  And that's enough to rest your laurels on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think anybody could ever say he's not the greatest technology product producer  ever.  Maybe Sony and their heyday, Apple today are the two best producers of hardware on an innovation  level.  I mean, only the person with innovation would be like some of the labs that existed in the  60s and 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  Sure.  Bell Labs and Lucent and then of course, Xerox PARC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's a research facility.  I mean, I guess in some ways he has become the heir apparent to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look what happened.  He went to Xerox PARC, he saw what they were doing and he productized it.  He made, now he had the Lisa, which was a flop, but that was the precursor to the Macintosh,  which is anything but a flop.  He was the guy who productized that.  So Xerox PARC famously created a bunch of great stuff which they never were able to  ship.  Yeah.  I don't know.  On the one hand, I hope for a huge hit because it would revitalize the industry to have another  category, a new category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the ebook done right with multimedia functionality is a slam dunk because the only  reason I'm not buying a Kindle is because I can't check my email or watch a movie or  listen to audible on it.  If that device had a regular screen, I would have one right now.  And I think I'm not the only person who's not buying it because it doesn't do email,  right?  I mean, or surf the web.  I mean, the Kindle is this absurd device.  The people who really love to read books love it.  And then everybody else who would buy it is like, what?  I can't check my email or I can't check the website?  I mean, what?  And what?  It doesn't have a color screen.  It doesn't make sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, like the Kindle is so close and it's and you still love it despite all of that.  You still love it.  It's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sort of like, I don't know, it's like C3PO or something like that.  He's just, you know, it's like a Ford.  It's a droid that is flawed in some way, but it's got character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  One of the end one of the most fun things about this will be is, you know, at the end  of Apple events, they'll sometimes have the executives sit down and do a short Q&A with  the press and I'll ask it or I'm sure someone else will, will ask if they bank heavily on  content from books and magazines and newspapers to say to Steve Jobs, OK, Steve, I thought  people don't read anymore.  And see kind of how he said that, didn't he?  He did say that.  That's why they that's why Apple wasn't doing an e-reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do remember, though, that Steve Jobs also said, I can't imagine anybody watching video  on a little screen.  He is famous for deflection.  And it could very well be he's just merely deflected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and Google's getting pretty good at it, too, when they said they wouldn't do their  own phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We love that phone, by the way.  Now you don't I know, Dwight, you're not yet a convert, but Jason, I think soon you're  going to be a Nexus One convert and I cannot get over this phone.  I just love this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have it right here and I'm going to be switching from Droid to it and all I need is the IP based  cameras, maybe bejeweled to which is definitely going to put on.  Oh, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a good one.  That's a bejeweled clone that I really like called I have to play bejeweled now when I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  online for Starbucks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish it had.  I wish it had more games, although, you know, the number one category on Android is in the  Android marketplace is games jewel lust.  Take a look at that.  It's basically bejeweled, but I think it has it has a storyline.  It's very playable and it makes this nice plinking sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's bejeweled.  Yeah, that's that's that's bejeweled.  Satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a I can't stop playing it.  It's actually a little bit better than bejeweled.  And I want you to just be quiet for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, would you mind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just like to do for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This game, it's terrible that you actually showed bejeweled or we talked about it because  this game is is basically the crack of the of the well, it's like Tetris was it's like  Tetris.  Yeah, it's beyond Tetris.  And now they have one that on the iPhone connects to Facebook.  And so I play that one.  Yep.  I now I see on my leaderboard all my friends and I look at it and my.  Two sister in laws are like their mom.  What's your high score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the high score you got on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm up to like two ninety.  Wow.  A thousand on Blitz on the one minute blitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blitz is the one that's shared.  I play Blitz and a few of my friends like the co-characters like a two hundred fifty  thousand like every week when they start it new every week.  How do you how do you get that high?  I can get like eighty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very simple.  The most important technique in bejeweled.  I don't know if I should say this to screw up my scores, but it's to go fast.  And when you go fast, you get cascading multiplier.  Jules. So when you have multiple jewels break, it multiplies.  And then you get that that jewel that says two X, three X, four X.  Then what you do is at some point while you're going fast, you get one of those  mega cubes, which is a five in a row that blows things up.  Yep. And you only ignite that you leave like a grenade  and to hit like four or five or six X.  And it's four or five or six times more effective.  So the only thing you should be worried about is getting the percentage up.  And then at some point, you'll have an opportunity to hit that.  That's how you get good scores.  Eighty if it was if you were on triple score or quadruple score would be 240.  Right. You have to get to that.  That's the key element.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I accidentally I didn't know how I got to one hundred twenty thousand.  I thought, what did I do? I don't know what happened there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's the multiplier.  It's the multiplier. It shows why Zynga is doing so well,  because now I'm in a competition with my two sister in laws every week.  Yeah. You know, when I'm basically, you know, in a commercial break,  if I'm watching TV and live, you know, I've turned this.  I've been playing Blitz, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that. Yeah, it's bizarrely addictive.  But that's this is why I think a tablet with gaming, that kind of social gaming.  Yes. I mean, I just I think this is going to be that.  Look, Steve's got to look at all of this social.  What do you what do you call this social social gaming social crack?  Yes, addictive social gaming.  He's got to he's not stupid.  He's got to be looking at this and realize how powerful that is. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so basically, this is a Nintendo.  This is this taps into the Nintendo Wii effect,  which is your sister in law, your mom, my mom, you know, you get Farmville.  Oh, so Mark Pink.  Oh, can you imagine Farmville on a 10 inch tablet?  That is the killer.  I think we figured out that was keep jobs.  Right now, it's all got like a seven inch farm or a 10 inch farm.  And it's going to be subsidized by Farmville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we just hit it. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the virtual currency in that.  That would be pretty epic if people just be like, take out their farm  and get people on the subway, not reading the New York Times,  just planning a farm that is meaningless.  That's the end of civilization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the end of civilization.  It's the end of this network.  If you don't hear a tweet episode for a month or two,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you'll know why.  Maybe Leo and I are playing bejeweled.  On a 10 inch screen with a thousand gems, I think we've tried to beat  each other's scores and getting nothing accomplished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've had this is we're in an economic tesseract  and you need to not be this is the worst possible time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be Steve Jobs is he'd be like Oppenheimer.  Now I am death.  He will be like the guy who invented the atomic bomb.  And but it was an economic atomic bomb.  And in 20 years, when when we're just living in rubble,  and nobody's producing anything and everybody's just looking at their tablet  going, I need artichokes, we'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Pinkus and Steve Jobs collaborate to end the world.  It's the end of civilization.  Theocracy or Wally, you know, like in Wally, they're on those  those floating, you know, right?  That's exactly what it is.  He's doing nothing.  He saw Wally and he said, that's it.  That's it. The Pixar guys gave him the vision for the future.  In art imitating life or life imitating art.  You decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. I think, you know what?  That's the final the final jewel just clicked into place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social gaming on that tablet.  It would be pretty amazing, actually.  When you think about the effects that like Wi-Fi games,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're on the same network, you can play like there's an air hockey game  for the iPhone.  And but the problem is, is that you have to be on the same network.  If you could do something at that level, that fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if the tablet turns into a tennis paddle?  People be swinging their seven hundred dollar tablets.  That's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bad idea. Bad idea.  No, this is like surface. It stays there.  What about Steve Perlman's on live company?  Yeah. Where he you know, we've talked about this, my friend Ryan Schrapp,  by the way, he got a DMCA cease and desist.  I have to ask him about this from on live because he was a beta tester  and did all these reviews and really great videos and really was great.  And he's been told to take that down. You can't do that.  You can't report on it. I hear it's sick.  It's well, it's really interesting because the idea is you could do a low end device.  In fact, one of the devices they show looks a lot like an iPhone  attached to a TV or a better a good display.  And then over the Internet, it gets the game and the game is rendered  out there in the cloud where you have faster computers and sent to you.  Now, what if this what if something like that is built into this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be very interesting if the mainframe style computing  was done over the network or something like that.  But I don't know that it's necessary because he's got this huge library  of casual games, casual games that.  Yeah, the casual games don't require that much.  And you know that the processing power in the, you know,  the mobile processors are going to double and triple.  And, you know, it's sort of they're going to they're good enough now.  They're only going to get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about DRM? Will there be DRM in this copy protection?  Has to be. Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if he's doing the macro, if he's doing the iPhone application, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, it's built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and it's pretty clear.  Why would he go and put Mac OS 10 on it?  You know, it makes it more complicated.  Yeah, no, you don't put OS 10 on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, some of these these mockups have a dock.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I think it's simpler than an iPhone.  It's it's just boom, simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you would mention the idea of of going  going to the cloud for a lot of the computing for this.  You know, Apple is building that data center in North Carolina.  And so what if you, you know, what if that was kind of the farm  for a lot of the stuff that they were doing that was offline or online rather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're going to find out Wednesday.  I'm I think this could be huge, could be the biggest dud.  And we will talk about it next week.  And we'll talk about it.  I'm calling it our obsessive compulsory coverage all day Wednesday  from 830 or 9am till the till we can't talk anymore.  Right, right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So your voice is so hoarse that you cannot out of the words, Steve Jobs.  And I found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Farmville, it's so harsh.  Well, I can't stop playing.  It's so basic.  Jason's on a rant.  He's on a rampage. He's on a tear.  He is ready, ready to destroy  one of the key companies on the Internet.  And he's going to tell you why in just a little bit.  But before we do that, I want to mention our friends at Squarespace.com.  This is a company that I don't I think is a miraculous company started  as a as a kind of a blogging tool by two guys in college.  It's now become, I think, you know, one of the most amazing hosting sites.  So it's both hosting.  It's a hosted website with incredible software.  That's that's the combination we're talking.  I want you to go to Squarespace.com slash tweet.  You could take a look at it right now.  If I could try it free, it makes it very easy for you to take your existing site,  whether it's a blog with movable type or type pad or blogger or WordPress  and move it over. If you've got a photo site, it's all you'll love the galleries.  You'll love the templates.  You'll love the ease with which you can take these professionally built.  I think there's 50 professionally built templates and then  customize them so it's unique.  You know, it's always been this kind of.  Push and pull between having professional templates,  but then having every site look exactly the same.  Squarespace has totally solved this because they give you the great start,  the incredible templates, but then you go from there  to make, you know, make it your own, to customize it with this very easy  drag and drop Ajax customization.  And the hosting is great because it's the virtual hosting that they're doing  means that whenever your site gets hit, they can add bandwidth to your site.  You can add bandwidth easily.  You never run out of bandwidth.  You just it's it responds to being dug or slash dotted like nothing.  And SEO optimizations, automatic stats are brilliant.  Jason, you were going to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was. Yeah, you know, I've been I've been tracking this company for a while.  It's a New York company and I'm looking at the examples on their site.  If you go to the examples tab and look at this is really interesting for businesses.  You know, you used to hire a firm and pay what would you pay?  Twenty five hundred bucks.  Oh, thousands of thousands.  Yes. I mean, yeah.  But even if you're doing like a mom and pop store, you know,  maybe you get your uncle cousin to do it.  Your cousin knows somebody paid three grand or five grand.  And it's you can never edit it again.  And that person goes off and becomes a lawyer and you never hear from them again.  Like this is the sustainable solution for 50 bucks a month for a business  or 30 bucks a month for a business or for a band.  If he wants to have a professional site.  Absolutely. And you get support and all this kind of stuff.  They get social integration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the iPhone app is incredible.  I mean, I have to say that three years ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these guys applied for TechCrunch 40 back in the day.  And they had already had the product out.  So it sort of wasn't qualified for it because, you know, you have to launch  the product brand new. But I was very impressed about it three years ago.  And they've really it's it's really a high quality product.  I think anybody who's building a business site should very much consider it.  I mean, for 10 bucks a month or 20 bucks a month, whatever they're charging.  I mean, it's nothing for what the value you get.  So before you go spend the four or five thousand dollars  on the site, you should try doing it yourself for 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look at the topically, the Yale, a Haiti site,  imagine the traffic that this has sustained over the last two weeks  for the earthquake fund on Squarespace.  Never down for a moment.  You know, Mark Echo uses it.  I mean, just look at some of the examples.  And the thing is, they all look different.  They all look unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am old school. It's my email newsletter.  Yeah, I just email it to 90.  It's 19000 people now. It's kind of ridiculous.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's free. Is it still free?  Can people just sign up? Yeah, it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just you go to if you go to bit dot Lee slash Jason's List.  It's a form.  I put up a little Google Doc I imported every couple of weeks.  And, you know, like a thousand people seem to sign up a month.  I've been doing it for a year now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is what kind of replaced your blogging,  although occasionally you will do I know with something like this.  It's a big story. You'll put a put it in the blog as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to put it on the blog now.  So I send it to my email people first and then maybe a couple of hours later  when I, you know, get the time between changing diapers.  I'll I'll put it on the blog.  How is the baby, by the way?  It's I have to say, like it's of course, it's life changing.  But it's it's one of those things where people tell you this is amazing  and it's not overrated.  It's underrated. It is.  But people say all the time that this is the greatest thing ever.  You don't know. Yeah.  I just sat there this morning.  I had like that alert time for an hour with her.  And now she just the last week has started giggling, you know, or just smiling.  And I'm just sitting there for an hour staring at my daughter  and she's laughing and giggling.  And I'm just like, my life is complete.  My I didn't realize how  how much more there was to life until I spent time with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't know. And we're all dads here.  And we've all I'm sure, Dwight, you've had this experience.  You see somebody who's about to have a baby and you just you just kind of  shake your head. You cannot communicate what is about to happen.  You're about to walk through a door that will.  Everything's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes you a better person in ways you have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's coming. Yeah, it's really true.  So congratulations, Jason. I'm glad you're getting some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And everybody told me we take my I would take my edge away.  But I still have this thing where when I see somebody getting bullied,  you're still a son of a bitch.  I know.  I if I see a situation where people are being bullied,  that seems to be your new thing, isn't it?  Because you did that with the with the angel funds and now with the angel funds.  And I'm doing it again now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason's list, why we should boycott com score  and perhaps why traders should short their stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the incendiary thing at the it's pretty incendiary, except I go on to explain  like I do not own any stocks. I do not buy stocks.  I know nothing. I was surprised to see that you only have bonds and angel investing.  Well, I put this way bonds when I buy bonds,  I buy the California ones that are backed by revenue.  What that means is they get paid off by the money that comes in from the taxes  for the toll roads.  There's no way for them to go bankrupt.  You have to stop having revenue in the plus the double tax free in California,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is a very nice thing in a seven percent or eight percent or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, I can sleep all night.  I don't have any problem sleeping.  You're saying that I know my nuts not going anywhere. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And but then so now much more risky, the angel investing,  but much more fun, I imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of fun. I did four last year and I'm going to do 10 this year.  I typically put twenty five thousand dollars to work or fifty thousand dollars  to work. It's not a lot of money for for me at this point in my career,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it is huge for the company you're investing in, not just for the dollar,  but because they now say Jason or or Kevin Rose.  I know you do some stuff with Kevin.  They can say your name and that carries a lot of weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it does. It's kind of definitely does.  But I think that the bigger value is that I'm a product guy  and I've been got my my my butt kicked many times in business.  I've been through the I've been through the war.  You know, I've laid people off at two companies.  I just I've got a lot of knowledge.  Yeah, that I can just I basically give myself when I said, listen,  when you can't talk to your spouse, when you can't talk to your board  and you can't talk to your employees, right. Call me.  Been there, done that. Yep.  Because I have been there.  And it's the loneliest thing in the world to be an entrepreneur sometimes.  I can imagine. And you are now.  And so think about the times when, you know,  when the bills at Twitter or, you know, the money wasn't coming in  and your wife or your kids need stuff and you're like,  maybe this is going to work. Maybe it's not.  You know, we had great advertising for two months and now nobody's calling us back.  You know, these things happen in every business.  And it's it can be calling you when it does.  Jason, you have to have somebody to talk to.  So that's what I provide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Jason is always Jason's not in that we don't have investors.  But Jason has always been a wonderful sounding board.  You've taught me so much unwittingly, I think,  because sometimes it's just you being on Twitter talking.  But I've learned so much from you and the times that we have corresponded.  You are a wonderful, valued advisor.  You're really great at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way I look at my life is I'm I'm there's a term in poker called free rolling,  which is when you get basically put into a poker tournament for free.  So like full tail pager sponsor, you're free rolling.  No matter what happens, you're you're not going to lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't lose. You're using the house's money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have officially decided that I'm free rolling on life.  You know, like, congratulations, life is a goddamn free roll.  Good for you.  Therefore, I'm going to play it forward.  Companies and pay it forward and have a great time.  Yeah, good. And when I see somebody being a bully,  as was the case in Koretsu form and as was the case is the case in com score,  I'm going to step up and say something.  You know what? This this opened me up to tremendous attacks from people,  personal, professional, I can imagine.  And you know what? I just don't care at this point in my career.  If somebody is going to be a bully, I'm going to use my platform to call them out  on it. And if there's ramifications for it and people want to unsubscribe  from the list, they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You're in a position where you can do this.  And I think a lot of people don't feel safe doing this.  So let's talk about com score.  There are a couple of companies.  Quantcast is somebody I use.  Google Analytics.  I also use com score as a company like that that publishes traffic numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correct. But they publish traffic numbers.  And so in the early days of the Internet, we looked at our log files  and we're like, wow, we have log files. We can go look at this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you need somebody like this? I know exactly my numbers. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so what happened was the average they went to they created this company  com score. They they got two million people to download toolbars  and they made a sample.  What the sample is, is just like Nielsen.  So they went back to the old technology.  And you say, why would somebody go back to the old technology and do a sample?  It makes no sense. We have actual logs we can look at.  Well, they did this because now they once they reach scale,  everybody had to pay them.  And for years, when I had Weblogs, they would underreport my sites  and I would call them.  You mean, would they intentionally underreport them?  Well, they're doing a sample.  So their sample doesn't include people at work.  It's just not accurate.  And it's not big enough. It's inaccurate.  Like any other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same way Arbitron is on radio and Nielsen is in television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the bigger you are, the more accurate it becomes for two reasons.  Number one, it's a it's a sample.  So you have a greater chance of getting picked up.  So and then number two, from what I'm told by everybody  and there's many blog posts you can see,  there is some correlation between when you're a subscriber or previously,  there was some correlation between being a subscriber to Comquest  Comscore and their ability to your numbers to be correct.  Now, that was undercover.  Like people that was like always this rumor in the industry.  I begged them at Weblogs and please fix our numbers.  It's really impacting my ability to sell ads on Engadget, autoblog.  And they told me to pound salt.  And I had nothing I could do.  And I tried to say this is this is wrong and nobody listened to me.  Now I've got a bigger microphone.  And so they came out and said, you know what?  We're going to you know, for 10 years, we told you sample was the best.  We're changing to be like Quantcast and Google Analytics now.  And we're going to include that.  And everybody's like, what?  This is after a decade of telling everybody in the world  that tracking pixels are wrong.  And here's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the way Quantcast to Google Analytics and others, Chartbeat is another one  that you you told me about.  I know you're an investor in Charby.  Fantastic. You're not an investor yet.  Oh, you're not. OK, just a visor.  You put a little JavaScript or you could put a one by one pixel in there,  but you put something on the web page that then calls their server  and so they can monitor it.  The reason you have to do this, I mean, yeah, I have logs.  I know my logs are.  But but but an advertiser is not going to believe me when I say this is my traffic.  So you need a verification.  You need an independent third party that people trust like Nielsen or Arbitron.  But Nielsen Arbitron have always been kind of famous in broadcasting as being,  you know, it's the dirty little secret of broadcasting.  Broadcasters don't they know the samples are wrong,  but they're terrified of getting accurate numbers  because they're afraid of what they might find out.  But the web has always been accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've always known.  Yes. And so here's the punch line.  They come out with this new system that they're calling Media Metrics  360 methodology, which is basically using the tracking pixel  and using their two million sample, which has never worked well.  So they're basically saying that old system that we told you was the best system.  It's not actually the best system anymore.  I'm paraphrasing here. But you use this new system.  And by the way, at least this was the news last week.  It's ten thousand dollars a year.  Oh, and it's like, OK, well, what happens if I don't pay that?  And they said, well, we'll just produce your numbers like we've always done it.  And actually, basically, yes.  So basically, here's your choices.  It's pretty binary. One, you  pay us this money and we will produce correct statistics for you.  The same correct statistics you get for free at Quantcast.com  or Google Analytics. Pay us the money.  We fix it. Don't pay us.  We use our old system, which is sample based,  which we have just told you is inaccurate.  And we admit it's inaccurate now.  That's why we've added this pixel tracking.  You know what that sounds like to me?  What? A Sopranos episode.  It sounds like extortion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be a shame if something would have happened to your numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, Leo, you have numbers.  We have numbers.  We have a business to run.  You are making money.  You should make us some money.  You have to eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we have you know, this is where this is where it all  south is the complicity of media, because and I still see this all the time.  Media is always quoting compete.  They're always quoting another sample size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Compete sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're always quoting Alexa and Alexa based services,  and they're always quoting Comscore.  And we all know because we know what our numbers are,  that these don't relate to the actual numbers.  And yet the media reports these numbers, which is what I've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've begged people, please, journalists, bloggers out there,  do not use these numbers because it's self reinforcing.  But now we have Quantcast that's out there and Quantcast is crushing it.  And if you go there.  Good. I love Quantcast.  If you look at the top 100 sites, top 200 sites, you see this thing quantified.  So they do a sample and then they also do tracking pixel.  And you can start you starting to see that out of the top 500 sites.  Like, I think they've got a third of them or two thirds of them have now done it.  Right. Comscore is about to go away.  And this is where I was getting at.  I think that their their their stock and their company is going to go away  because you're charging for something that is now free.  It's the same thing with Google Analytics.  Who's going to pay for Omniture if Google Analytics is for free?  And so I basically unloaded on them and said, listen, I I'm going to  I'm going to do this the same way I did it with Koretsu.  We're going to do it the hard way or we can do it the easy way.  I basically laid out the demands and I said, I want you to stop charging companies  or go to a freemium model.  But you should be committed to giving everybody the same correct,  best methodology for statistics, regardless of if they're a customer of yours or not.  Yeah. And I think that's completely reasonable.  Absolutely. And so when you do it, you must quote

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  site numbers. Do you have any policy about which numbers you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the I think the case with with a lot of journalists is they get  who's who gives it to them?  They get press release and they get it right.  It's the easiest to get.  Yeah. The kind of things I write about, I don't generally do that unless I'm  and I stay away from sites like Alexa and those that use the tracking.  I mean, the sampling, because it generally means that you aren't getting  the accurate results. You want something, you know, where where it is based  primarily on your, you know, on the number of cookies and the actual hits.  We use Omniture at the Chronicle for our site.  And when I can get it from somebody like that, I do.  Interesting, Jason, that Linda Abraham has responded to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The CMO responded very.  What did she say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  She mad at you. Would she be mad at you?  What did she say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She went on a tilt a little bit.  I don't have it in front of me. I have to do.  You have it. It's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just looking at the traffic numbers I get from Quantcast.  I just have is it your experience, Jason, if you compare it to your logs  and it's accurate, it should be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quantcast is probably about  one to five percent less than Google Analytics.  And I think it's because we put Google Analytics at the top of the page  because we want to make sure those numbers are totally accurate.  And we put Quantcast at the bottom because we don't we want to save time  and make the experience faster for users.  So there is another issue that's going on here.  We have Google Analytics, Quantcast and Chartbeat.  And so I am going to work with those companies and ask them to make one  tracking pixel that they all share.  That would be nice.  I can't put four tracking pixels.  I already have way too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have way too much JavaScript on my page.  A lot of people who listen to Twit block JavaScript anyway,  because we keep telling them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the thing about the tracking pixel.  The goof of this all is the tracking pixels are five percent less,  10 percent less than reality because of people on phones,  people with JavaScript turned off, people who leave the page  or stop to hit the stop button, whatever.  You know, but who cares if it's if it's 90 percent correct or 95 percent correct.  That's great. But comp score has been off.  I mean, you just ask anybody to go look at their comp score numbers.  That's why comp score doesn't publicly put out their numbers because they're so bad.  That they are like a magnitude off, like 100 percent off, two times off, three times off.  When I went to beg them, I like you're showing a gadget with 100,000 people.  We have two million uniques or a million uniques.  And they wouldn't. And you know what?  This is what when you're a bully and you bully the little kid  and then the little kid grows up and he gets big.  Aha. You better be careful because you know what?  I had I didn't have any influence then, but I can tell you I have influence now.  Right. And I am not going to let this issue go until they capitulate.  You don't mess with a kid from Brooklyn.  That kid from Brooklyn.  I'm dead serious about this.  I'm not. And they can sue me or whatever they want to do.  Well, you know, just like the Kretsu foreign forum threatened to sue me.  And they didn't.  But we will we'll solve this one way or the other.  And the way we solved it with Kretsu forum was I launched the Open Angel Forum.  And now it's in four cities.  Oh, that's great. Oh, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and I think Quantcast is a solution.  So I would launch my own  metrics company or invest in one.  But I don't have to do that because Quantcast is already out there doing it.  And they're doing a bang up job.  So I think the market will solve this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so, too. I think it has to.  We're going to take a break and talk about Jason's favorite subject.  But before and when we come back, I do want to talk about a very controversial.  Well, maybe not, but a very scary column by Bruce Schneier,  who was one of the most respected security guys in the world,  who says you can blame our government for what happened to Google.  That is coming up in just a little bit.  But first, I do want to mention.  OK, go ahead, Jason. Audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you mentioning Audible? Audible.com.  Oh, you know what I love about Audible now?  What do you love about Audible?  I mean, there's so many. How much time do we have?  By the way, Audible loves Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audible says we'll buy two ads with Jason's on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They love you.  I am not even goofing.  No, this is sincere.  I did this long before. Everybody knows I love this company for a long time.  Since 2001.  I loved them before Amazon even bought them.  But now on Blippi, which you're a member of, I'm a member of.  I love Blippi, by the way.  I love Blippi. I'm an investor in it.  Full disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for doing that.  By the way, disclosure here also, as long as we're talking about that,  I don't invest in tech companies, as you know, Jason.  And I'm sure, Dwight, you don't either.  But it's just kind of what we have to do  so that people know that when we talk about something,  it's not because we're getting a deal out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You don't invest in anything.  Yeah. I've invested in four things.  You're not a journalist. Exactly.  And I always say right up front, I'm an investor in this.  You know, like I say, because I'm proud of it anyway.  But Blippi lets you import the Audible stuff.  So now I've been sharing my picks from Audible on there  and a whole discussion.  And, you know, it's kind of cool because I have the goal membership,  which is two credits a month, right,  which is the one I recommend because I can't listen to more than two.  And I am getting backed up now.  And the great thing is they let you,  if you don't use the credits that month, it's not a problem.  No, it's a misconception.  They add up.  So then let's say you finally take that vacation  or you've got that long flight or you're going on a road trip.  You might have you might have two or three credits left.  You can you can bank those.  And they have a list of all the top books of the year on there right now,  like editors picks.  They have some some audio book awards.  I don't know the name of it, but they had it on their site.  And so I literally went through all the oddities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're called the oddities. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I went on there and I'm looking at my my my Blippi dot com  slash Jason right now.  And I got bright sided how the relentless promotion of positive thinking.  What a great subject.  Because that was one of the best self help.  And then I did worldwide rave, creating triggers  that get millions of people to do stuff and then talent is overrated.  What really separates world class performers from other people?  And these this is the great  the great way to do it is you just find the award winning books  and you skim the cream and you're you're basically guaranteed to get a winner.  And even if you don't, you listen to the first two hours of it,  you get something out of it, you move on to the next one,  because you're going to have 24 audio books a year.  You're going to have a library.  And, you know, my wife now listens to the ones that I'm done with.  I can burn a CD.  You know, it's a it's a very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really glad you got audible to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It got them to add audible because that's that's the good part  about being an investor in the company.  I told them I said they're like, how what do you think?  What should we do? I was like, you got to get audible up there.  Yeah. And I they got it up in like two days.  And I can you give us our password, your password?  I'm like, absolutely. I'll give you my password to audible.  And they did all the back end work to to to data normalize.  But you can see all the people on Blippi who are that's a cool part.  Blippi is like on auto there.  And you see all the people who have audible subscriptions.  And it's a lot of intelligent people.  It's pretty much a known fact that if you have an audible subscription,  you increase your IQ by I think it's 12 to 15 points now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the at least 12 to 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's somewhere like because you know, when you're an adult,  I don't want to get too deep into this.  But as an adult, I mean, you don't want to last time.  Either of us were in school when the last time we learned anything.  This is when this is what audible is about.  It's the way to make yourself a better person, to learn more  and educate yourself after you don't go to school anymore.  And you got kids, you got a family now.  You're too busy.  Half an hour drive turns into a half hour lecture.  And you don't have time to read because you're on your computer screen all the time.  I can't say enough good things about it.  And if you are a fan of the show this week in tech,  which you do get for free, by the way, you should  you should really thank audible.  Absolutely. You should thank Squarespace and you should thank Citrix.  And I'm going to do something here.  This is a little freestyle here. I hope you don't mind.  I have a Nexus one.  I bought 10 of these because I gave them away to Mahalo users  and people follow me on Twitter like user appreciation.  But I saved this one for specifically this purpose.  Whoever thanks the sponsors right now.  And I think it's at audible underscore dot com at Squarespace and at Citrix.  Or just thank those three people.  Put pound twit on the end.  I'll hit the hashtag for pound twit and I think it's I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Citrix underscore go to meeting. Is that what it is?  I don't know. But you have to do it on Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Twitter, you just thank the three sponsors and I will give this to somebody randomly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're just going to go through those tags and find somebody and just and just pick somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My assistant is.  Let Tyler do it.  Well, I'll tell you what, I'm going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's good. I'm going to give you a $600 device, right?  Yeah, it's fantastic price.  Thank you so much for doing that, Jason.  I can't thank you enough. That's very kind of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a great phone.  And, you know, you've probably if you listen to it, you know,  you've heard me singing its praises like for the last two weeks because I just fell in love with it.  I actually wake up in the middle of the night and play with it.  Oh, are you talking about the phone?  Oh, yeah, right. Of course.  I'm sorry. That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, that's back to the audible.  Now, I want to make the show, by the way, I wake up and play with it.  I'm going to I'm going to give you a big.  Now, I do have to say this is and it's kind of ironic that you're doing this  because the the unfortunately the one thing that is missing on Android to me,  the biggest single thing missing on Android is an audible player.  But I have it from me.  I'm going to be made in the next 10 days.  No, I have it on good authority that they are working on it right now.  Generally, the way audible works is they give an SDK to the partners  and they ask that the partners develop it for the phone.  And I understand they're working with Google to do an audible player.  And that will be coming soon.  However, until then, it does work on your iPhone, your iPod, your Sanza, your Zune,  your Kindle, your GPS devices, hundreds of different devices.  You can also listen on your computer, download your books instantly.  High quality. They sound great.  My recommendation this week, I went into the audible frontiers section.  This is where they are digitizing  classic sci fi that was never recorded.  What? Well, a lot of times, sci fi, there's no money in sci fi audio books.  So a lot, you know, and a lot of these guys are shoestring publishers.  So, for instance, William Gibson's classic Mona Lisa  Overdrive has never been an audiobook.  So audible recorded it, released it last month.  This is a great audiobook.  Jonathan Davis reading.  Let me play a little bit of Mona Lisa Overdrive.  I'm a huge Gibson fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The ghost was her father's parting gift  presented by a black clad secretary in a departure lounge at Narita.  For the first two hours of the flight to London, it lay forgotten in her purse.  A smooth, dark oblong, one side impressed with the ubiquitous  mass neotech logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love William Gibson.  I just his stuff is my favorite.  The Neuromancer created the cyberpunk genre.  His books count zero.  Burning Chrome, All Tomorrow's Parties is great.  Isn't burning?  All tomorrow's parties.  Yep. They're now all on audible.  Thanks to audible frontiers.  Thank you, audible, for recording them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Big supporters of the of those sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they love you.  I'll tell you that, you know, when I went out there,  they Don Katz said, I love Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Don's a great guy.  I see him at some of the industry events and, you know, he had a real vision  for the company and people don't know this.  This company's been around a long time before it was owned by Amazon,  which is another one of my favorite companies.  And they struggled in the early days, man.  Did that company audible was struggling?  They had they couldn't get the they couldn't get the rights to the books.  You've got to get the publishers.  This is the same problem.  I was going to get them in the beginning.  It was really hard for them.  And you know what? Don Katz and his team, I give kudos to them.  And I didn't believe it.  When I was a journalist, I had I've written some pieces  a little negative about it, like because I didn't they experience wasn't perfect.  And they were doing this before the iPod.  They had their own MP3 player. That's right.  And that's how visionary Don Katz was.  That's how visionary audible is.  And now they're just hitting their stride.  I mean, every book's in there.  And to do things like take the old classics and actually have them read.  I mean, that's a mitzvah.  I mean, that's really just isn't it?  Right. It's it's like what Scorsese is like, you know, he's he's Scorsese.  He's so the man. And the other night, he's like,  he's accepting some lifetime achievement award or something at the Golden Globes.  And he's like, listen, the most important thing we can do is preserve these films.  And then he rattles off 16 names of films and they show the audience.  They have no idea what these films are.  They all these actors are like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they got to preserve them.  These are this is our heritage.  This is our cultural heritage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's doing it. And he's doing it.  And Don Katz is doing it. Great company.  And really, it's great that they support independent media  because where are you going to get this week in tech?  I mean, tech TV, you know, shot themselves in the foot.  Then they shot themselves in the other foot.  Then they shot themselves in the leg and they cut their leg off.  I mean, they had all this great programming and they just I know it's sad.  Destroyed it. And it's being reborn again by the people who have a passion for it.  That's what independent podcasting is about.  And I just I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm with you. I'm very grateful to these companies  because it's taken a chance to buy an ad on a podcast.  Now, they know they've been here.  These guys have all been with us more than two years.  And so they know that works.  But but that first buy must have been a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And obviously, the buzz is, you know, significant because when I go places,  I mean, I had people I told you this once where I went to Australia,  the guy came on the plane and the first thing he said to me was, oh, audible.  I love audible.  You're famous now for that.  I'm like, what is that?  I'm not even that should I be, you know, getting a favor?  Being a super I'm fine.  I like being a super fan of things.  No, yeah, we're fans of technology.  No, we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the that's the key to the whole thing.  So let me talk about Bruce Schneier, who is he's just I think right.  Dwight, I mean, he's just the guy when it comes to security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's he's so famous and so well known in terms of security that,  you know, the the Chuck Norris facts, the the joke about how what a tough guy  Chuck Norris is somebody on the web did a Bruce Schneier facts.  And it's very, very similar if you're in security geek humor.  Yeah. So if you become the subject of an Internet geek meme, you've  you're at the top of your game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CNN published an article.  Bruce's blog is Schneier, S.C.H.  N.E.I.  E.R. dot com and must reach Schneier on security.  But CNN published his essay on the China Google hack.  And I hope in their opinion section, I hope it gets a lot of attention.  The headline U.S.  enables Chinese hacking of Google.  Now, unfortunately, he kind of makes a statement in here, which, you know,  I don't there's no reference, no link, no backup.  So I don't know.  He's taking it as read that and I'll read it.  This is the quote.  In order to comply with government search warrants on user data.  Google created a backdoor  access system into Gmail accounts, and that is the feature  Chinese hackers used to gain access further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no source. There's no source for that.  He doesn't say where he got that and the information that both Microsoft  and Google, which hasn't really said anything definitive, have put out  that it had to do with vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That came from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think it came from Google?  They're back channeling because they don't they don't they want everybody to understand.  Look, this is here because the government makes us do this. Yes.  Yes, they'd rather know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'd rather people think that than think that they're using Internet Explorer six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or that or that they created this back door  because they want to look at their competitors' emails that are using Gmail  or startup companies or that they're doing something nefarious.  Like, why would you put a back door in?  You don't need a back door if you're an email provider.  You know, if somebody forgets their password, you reset it.  Why would you need a back door? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is his position.  He says Google's system isn't unique.  I'm quoting again.  Democratic governments around the world in Sweden, Canada and the UK, for example,  are rushing to pass laws giving their police new powers of Internet surveillance,  in many cases requiring communication systems providers to redesign  products and services they sell.  There's also data retention laws which require them to keep it.  And of course, as we well know,  the National Security Agency has been eavesdropping on all of us  with the help and compliance of AT&T and Verizon, who've been protected  by congressional acts, so they're not liable for this.  And the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act in 1994  required them to do so.  So so he says official misuses are bad enough,  but it's the unofficial uses that worry me war.  Any surveillance and control system must itself be secured.  And infrastructure conducive to surveillance and control invites  surveillance and control, both by the people you expect and the people you don't.  So I have to because Bruce is so well respected, I'm just going to have to  take his word when he says there's a back door.  I think you're probably right, Jason.  He must have gotten that from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's that's the writings there.  And interestingly, in the same article, he says NSA analysts  collected more data than they were authorized to.  This is talking about course they did NSA and and use the system  to spy on wives, girlfriends and notable such as President Clinton.  That we know that we know. Yes.  Any system that can be hacked will be hacked.  Any system that can be abused will be abused.  Therefore, you it's reliant on the people who build and manage these systems  to to really take this seriously and not build back doors into it.  I wonder what would happen if somebody provided a service  and this would be an incredible company, provided an email service  that was absolutely secure with no back doors in it.  And that didn't have any had a data retention policy of zero,  which basically meant we delete every email in the system after 10 days.  Hushmail. Oh, really?  Is that what Hushmail is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phil Zimmerman, the guy who created PGP, worked with these guys.  You know, who knows, though, because if the law requires  everybody have a back door, even Hushmail have a back door.  But it uses a PGP in the background for fully encrypted mail that no one can.  In theory, no one can read.  And I knowing Phil, I mean, look, Phil is not the kind of guy  that's going to put a back door in anything.  I guess the only way you'd know for sure, though,  is if it were completely open source, right?  Because then somebody could look at the source and say, well,  here's the back door or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if there is indeed a law, I mean, I'm not familiar with a law  that specifically says that you have to have a back door into email systems.  There is a requirement for wiretapping of communication systems.  But I think that has been interpreted to primarily mean telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think the question, you know, we've got these FISA courts,  we've got these, you know, black courts that no one knows what's going on inside them.  I understand we have to fight terror, but what the upshot of it is, though,  that all of this stuff can happen completely behind closed doors.  And no one will know.  We don't know. The press doesn't know. No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the back door exists.  And because it exists, people will walk through it.  And if if Schneier is correct,  it's possible the Chinese walk through it in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then then you got to ask the question, well, who's really to blame then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's pretty obvious who's to blame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yahoo, according to the journal, Yahoo was also targeted in the in the Chinese attacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they didn't step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did not step up.  They as Google did.  And Yahoo has really always been kind of complicit,  more complicit with the Chinese government than anybody.  They. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's part of the reason why they sort of got out and did the  they sold out. Yeah.  They sold out because, you know what, I think Jerry Yang, who is Taiwanese,  yeah, he couldn't live with himself. Yeah.  And it was pretty famous at the DeConference a number of years ago.  The Wall Street Journal is really excellent, like seed level, you know, event.  Terry Summer was on stage and they asked him famously, like, what would you do?  You know, and what would you do if this guy Shervin asked him,  what would you do if the Nazis, you know, came to you asking for,  you know, emails or something like that, you know, the same way the, you know,  communists, you know, trying to have. And he says, well, you know, we really  who knows what you would do in what situation?  There's a lot of factors. It was it was the worst answer you ever heard,  because the only thing you say when people ask you that Nazi question is,  like, I would fight to the death against the Nazis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if you wouldn't say it, right. Even if you're a coward, pay it lip service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. And, you know, knowing what you know now, of course, but,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but the fact that he didn't is almost it's, it's an, it's a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a admission of guilt. It's a tell. It's a tell. It's a tell. It's a huge tell.  And basically Yahoo.  I don't think Yahoo management is the same as Google management.  The founders, this is obviously Sergey is very much driving this and he's a,  both those guys, very principle guys. And Sergey has immigrant parents.  And I think they suffered a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, no spine, the Obama administration,  they were going to send a complaint to China and they backed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a, this is an incredibly complex issue now because of the geopolitics and  the intertwining of our economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could bankrupt our economy, but just stop by, by no longer buying our paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we could create a civil war in there as by not taking their imports.  Right.  You realize how many people have moved from the North to the South,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just to work factories, to work at Shenzhen and the other factories,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and those places. And if we stop buying and consuming their products,  they had a stimulus package that was, you know, 20, 30% of their economy.  We had a stimulus package of one or 2% of our economy, you know, and  they would, it's quite possible China could go into a complete civil war.  I know that sounds like something out of a William Gibson novel.  No, it's completely possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what's at stake right now.  They walk at the, they're walking the edge economically. They always have been.  They had a famine under Mao that killed, I can't remember what it was,  21 million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. When you have billions of people and an uncertain future economically,  and you don't have the sustainability to feed them,  to house them, you know,  it could turn into a really big problem. And they're not,  their economy is vibrant in some ways, but it's controlled in others. You know,  they regulate their currency, et cetera. So the interdependencies,  I don't think that people actually know what would happen if we disengage from  each other, you know, let alone what's war with each other.  And this is over, this is the mind blowing thing is this is over a couple of  dissidents email boxes. This is what shows you, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what the dissidents got what they wanted, which destabilizes the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wars have been started for less.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if, if,  and there's just one or two people who are responsible for holding the line,  two tremendous entrepreneurs in Larry and Sergey.  And you have to give them a lot of credit because there's not many billionaires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eric didn't want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eric didn't want to do it supposedly. You know,  and people have different philosophies, you know, engagement versus isolation,  but at some point you have to draw the line.  And I think that they picked a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that the Larry and Sergey have  announced they're going to sell off $5.5 billion worth of shares and give up  majority voting power?  Absolutely not.  They were going to do that already.  Okay.  Anybody who's not like saying, okay, I think I'm going to get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, anybody who has that amount of wealth in one stock,  they set a, they set a computer program to diversify them over years,  automatic trading. So they can't ever be, you know,  said to be trading on inside information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a tip for them. California bonds backed by the highway fund. It's,  I heard it from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's enough California highways for them to back.  No, oh well.  They have to buy some Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Leo, you mentioned Yahoo. What about Microsoft? Microsoft, you know,  Steve Ballmer said they would do, you know,  they would follow the law in order to do business in China and that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they kind of locked Google. He said, Google, these guys are dopes.  Right. Right. I mean, not exactly those words, but the, but, and then,  furthermore, when they, when asked if they're, they were hacked, they said,  well, no, we think everything's okay. Of course, internet explorer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are they using internet explorer six?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're using Firefox and so they feel safe. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well,  Google didn't have that much in terms of investment in there.  They were still building kind of what they were doing. They had,  of the companies that are, that exist, that had a foothold in there,  that could have been hurt.  They're the ones that had the least to lose in terms of pulling out.  Probably intentionally, probably intentionally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because in the past four years they've been very careful not to put servers  there, not to put any other assets in there to do as little as possible and  still have a foot in that market. I don't know what's going to happen. All right.  If that didn't make you angry enough, how about this one?  PayPal has frozen the assets of WikiLeaks.org.  Ugh.  WikiLeaks is an amazing, PayPal wake up,  an amazing site where a very valuable whistleblower site, they have published,  you know, hugely important documents. If, if, you know,  if it weren't for WikiLeaks, there's all sorts of stuff we wouldn't know is  happening. And now as of the 23rd, which was yesterday,  PayPal has frozen their assets.  PayPal does this from time to time with various sites. I live in fear.  That they're going to do it with our assets,  but that's why I transfer money out as quickly as I can.  Cause that's the donation system we use.  We're working to make it expanded to Google and other systems. But, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so.  Okay. What's crazy about this?  I just sent you a link in the chat room from the guardian, uh,  which has a picture of, um, the Chinese, uh,  a Chinese Google user putting flowers on the Google office logo.  Isn't that great?  The Chinese users now are backing the Chinese citizens.  And users of Google are backing them. Uh,  well of course they are right with this, but this says something now,  where they are, uh, trying to use our systems to enslave and,  you know, possibly murder and torture their own citizens,  their own citizens are protesting in favor of the American companies.  This gives you, this should give you, um, hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy's very brave though. I mean,  here he is pictured in the paper doing this. I, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that guy's probably in a secret prison right now, but you know,  I can't say enough about the two entrepreneurs who actually put their asses on  the line for what's right. I mean, it's.  Thank you Larry and Sergey.  It's so rare, you know, it's like just these people are such sellouts and,  and Steve bomber, you know, I don't even expect him to do the right thing.  eBay, you know what? I don't even expect eBay to do the right thing. Uh,  it's just so sad that the,  and WikiLeaks is a fantastic site and whistleblowing laws.  We give rewards a percentage of the, of the, um,  money recouped by the government because of IRS tax evasion and this kind of  stuff goes to whistleblowers. That's, that's,  that's a formal program that our government has. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, so we,  we are actually trying to get more people to whistleblow.  So why is eBay freezing their accounts? Makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Psh. Just thought I'd bring it up.  No, they haven't. They have not explained it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have to really. And they don't, I just thought I'd bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be a court order or something like that where they just said freeze it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you know, they did the simplest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have, don't expect spine.  Spine isn't a rare commodity in corporate in the corporate world. Yeah.  All right, we're going to wrap it up. This is a, boy, this is a great show.  There's a, there's a bunch of other stuff we could talk about,  like Italy saying they want to regulate online flash player installations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Italy or Italy? Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Silvio Berlusconi is pushing through measures that would give the state control  over online video content and force anyone who regularly uploads video to obtain  a license from the ministry of communications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this because they got pictures of him with his mistress or something?  Wasn't he the guy who,  yes, who was having the parties at his house with his strippers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, we'll not happen again. You don't understand. No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't do this. I got to tell you.  They stole it from my private collection. I can't have these on the web. No.  He's starting to sound like Mario. I mean, I want to have it on my computer.  I'm going to put it on my computer. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to rush this through. This is ridiculous. And it's,  and by the way, YouTube is one of the companies that would be heavily  infected by this. It would force YouTube to police and affect police content,  which is undoable and tenable on a site where they're uploading, you know,  20 hours of video every minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the right thing to do with these companies is to just extract themselves.  There's enough money to be made in democratic countries. Get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a great, I think that, I think you're going to start seeing that.  And, and, and,  because this undermines the fundamental premise that the internet is global.  And if you're going to do this, if you're going to,  if you're going to Balkanize the internet, well, okay, we not going to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Opt out. Opt out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. White house unveils an iPhone, iPod touch application.  Where's our Android version? White house. Oh, Riley, this is a good one.  O'Reilly drops ebook DRM sees 104% increase in sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah. No brainer. Yeah. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean David Pogue had, had done that with his books,  which is also O'Reilly and he noticed, you know,  he was very nervous about doing it.  And he noticed that after doing it, that his sales went up.  We just kind of keep saying every time this happens,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just keep reporting it so that people will finally get the message. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here's what it is. Like I, I, I buy the book. I'm done with it.  I want to give it to somebody else. Right. You know, or I'm at, I mean,  even if I'm at a company and I'm a small company and I buy one book for HTML,  I give it to seven people, you know what? I wasn't going to buy it anyway.  Or all you're making me do is buy the print book and then hand it around the  office or have somebody photocopy it. Right. You know, and, and, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as much as we love Audible, Audible is required by publishers to do the same  thing. I'm sure Amazon is required on the Kindle to do the same thing.  It's really the publishers who are going to have to say,  just as the music industry did, okay, it's not working. And, uh,  you know, kudos to O'Reilly for, for having the sense to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's, it has to be, it has to be content owner driven.  The companies who are the enablers, the technology companies,  they don't have a choice. So you can't go to say, oh, you know, it's,  it's this person's fault or that person's fault. I mean,  if you look at Apple,  they showed the labels that they could on DRM stuff.  It took how many years, right? But they showed them, it's not that big of a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't be too scared. Exactly. And so that's why I report this.  It's going to be okay guys. You can drop the DRM. It's not helping. Calm down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody knows what anybody know with the acceleration rate for sales in the  iTunes store was after they took the DRM off. That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much faster it went up? Remember EMI was the first to do that.  It was the big experiment. Everybody watched.  And I do believe EMI sales went up quite a bit when they dropped it.  So I think that was the impetus to finally drop it completely in the music  industry.  We're out of time. I really appreciate you're spending some time with us.  All of our listeners, Jason, you're the best. Jason Calacanis is at Mahalo.com.  He's got a Nexus one he's going to give away. You still have some time.  If you want to tweet,  thanks to our great sponsors and tell them you appreciate the support they give  us. And, and then Sergeant, Sergeant Riley there,  we'll we'll go through it and pick one for the Nexus one.  I don't even want to inquire on how he's going to do it.  We'll just assume it's random and above board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to pick whoever has the best avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. You should look at mine.  You've got one. You've all got one. We don't get to play the game.  I don't have a James Bond avatar. Oh, I do. I know you do. Thanks to Jackie Free.  You want, you want one? I can get Jackie to do one. Jackie's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who doesn't want to be James Bond. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jackie's a great designer up down here on the peninsula.  She brought us cookies and she's a great photographer. And I said,  and she said, well, can I do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Easy on the cookies. You got that weathing scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not eating. I know the white things. I know you got one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one. I'm, I'm, I'm, I took your line. I weigh in public.  What's your, what's your Twitter account for the scale?  I did the same format as you. I think I'm Jason's scale,  Jason's underscore scale.  Maybe it's Jason's underscore a fat bastard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a standard for this. Yeah.  And so Jason and I both have wifi enabled scales. And when we weigh,  look at you got the great weight loss.  That's great. That's great. I'm going to do this. Yeah.  We want to join the club of crazy people who live in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't be fat. Don't be fat. Get a scale. I'm telling you,  is it not terrifying every time you get on that scale every morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do it every morning and you know,  it hasn't gone down in about three to four days and I'm thinking, Oh shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to think weekly. You got to think weekly. Yeah, I know. But anyway,  you know what's really interesting about it?  Do you ever get on the scale and then you're thinking,  I don't actually know how much I weigh.  It sort of makes you like a contestant on the, on the,  on the biggest loser because it,  you can't like jump off the scale and not have it sent. Yeah, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear a drum roll every time I get on my scale. I hear a drum roll now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It calculates it and there is no way to stop it from uploading.  So if all of a sudden you're two pounds heavier,  too late, it's late. It's already on your Twitter account. Everybody knows you're fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the scale? What is the name of the scale?  It's called the Ythings, W-I-T-H-I-N-G-S.com. It's on Amazon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you can also get it directly from Ythings. It's 159 bucks. It's not a cheap scale.  It's beautiful. It does a BMI calculation and also does your fat.  My BMI is too high. I think it's 31. It's like 28 points. That's good. You're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which means everybody's just repeating everybody else.  Let me tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can complain all you want with TMZ and tech crunch are right more often than  they're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the, and you know, by the way, Mike does this all the time and half,  he's not right all the time. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but he got a lot of things, right? I mean, he's broken a lot of stories.  You have to give him credit. All right. I give him a little credit, but,  and it doesn't matter knowing that he, he, he'll post a lot.  He's going to be a little bit freer with what he posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the gawker of, you know, it's good. It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with it. They'll run with things and you know what?  They run with them and it's a tech.  It's a new technique that makes journalists crazy,  which is they run with the rumors to see if they can get confirmation.  Whereas a journalist picks up the phone and says, I heard a rumor.  Can I get confirmation?  These guys use the blog and the public channel to get the next thing,  which is why they beat journalists all the time.  Cause they're willing to put out the rumor. Exactly. It's a technique.  It's a, it works. Works for him. We invented it at an engagement. Oh, okay.
