Transcript:  Some people who've watched for a long time might remember we met Alex's fiance, Liza,  who is going to be a psychiatrist. So that's appropriate.  Yeah, it's actually kind of nice.  You're going to save a fortune.  You marry what you need.  You fill.  And she's a doll. She's wonderful. And lives in my childhood home.  Yes.  Which is bizarre, but true.

Start time: 210.50
End time: 218.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New Year's Eve.  Unbelievable.  It was great.  We did New Year's Eve on a rooftop overlooking Zocalo Square.  Oh, fun.  And it was just like fantastic.  It was great.

Start time: 218.50
End time: 242.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really, really good.  So jealous.  Anyway, we have gathered together to mourn the passing of Apple computers.  Again.  Again.  Man, there was a lot of schadenfreude.  Schadenfreude was thick in the air this week when Wednesday,  Apple's Tim Cook issued a letter saying,  I'm sorry, but we said we were going to have $92 billion in revenue.  It's only going to be $84 billion in revenue.

Start time: 244.50
End time: 248.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've gone from being a huge cash machine to a slightly smaller cash machine.

Start time: 248.50
End time: 282.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did hurt their stock price.  They were a trillion-dollar company in August.  Market cap, as of the last time I checked, $700 billion.  Which is a lot different.  Only the fourth largest company in the world.  You cover this stuff for Crunchbase.  Yeah.  I think that there's some, everybody, including, of course, John Gruber.  And it's funny, coming out of retirement because he couldn't resist it.  M.J. Siegler had to cover this.  And what the letter meant, they parsed it line by line.  But give us the overview, Alex.

Start time: 283.14
End time: 294.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, for a long time, Apple has done a fantastic job at maintaining  increased profitability despite seeing its kind of unit volume numbers stop to grow.  And they did that by pushing up ASPs or average selling prices across their device lines.

Start time: 294.86
End time: 296.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And expanding into new territories like China.  Exactly.

Start time: 297.74
End time: 335.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then all of that stopped working all of a sudden.  They had a problem with the Chinese market.  They didn't see as many upgrades as they thought they were going to.  So revenue will be far lower than expected.  Apple will still make a ton of money.  They still have almost a quarter trillion in cash.  So the company's not going anywhere.  But everyone's now quite concerned about growth.  And the bigger story here that kind of fits on top of the Apple bit is that in China  slowing down for Apple, what does that mean for other brands that sell into the market?  Luxury brands, other electronics brands.  And also, what does it mean for the global macroeconomic situation?  So there's an Apple story, a China story, and a broader economic story.  But Apple is now only worth, I just looked, 703.6 billion.  So they're definitely doomed.

Start time: 338.07
End time: 383.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No doubt.  There's an even bigger, bigger story, which is that since Apple has been driven by iPhones,  profits, sales, revenue, et cetera, there was always going to be a plateau and a decline  of some kind because there's only so many people, only so many people are going to pay for premium phones.  And a lot of people are snidely saying, oh, the whole reason is that phones are too expensive.  Just lower the price of the phones.  That's not going to do it either.  That's not going to help the revenue, certainly.  And so it's just, you know, I've been talking about this for a couple of years.  This was going to happen.  This is why I've been predicting big new businesses like the self-driving car.  Maybe they need to make Apple Pay cross-platform, something like that.  They have to do something because phones aren't going to take them into the future on the same trajectory.

Start time: 383.52
End time: 392.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Apple hasn't created a significant new product since the iPad.  I mean, there's been a watch, a pair of headphones.  The AirPods.  Oh, come on, the watch.

Start time: 393.07
End time: 402.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a toy.  How much of Apple's revenue is watch based?  Five percent, four percent, three percent?  Even less AirPods based.  Well, I bought two pairs.

Start time: 402.90
End time: 446.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I bought three because I keep losing them.  Partly that's because it's dwarfed by the success of the iPhone.  I mean, really, this is a problem every company would love to have, which is such a massively successful single product that it powers revenue for years, makes you a hugely valuable company.  And it's always a problem because then you need a successor, a follow-up.  And Apple actually has had a number of lives.  I mean, if you think about it, they've had the Apple II and then the Mac was a failure, but at least it was a failure.  But the Mac was a failure.  Then they managed to make the Mac a success.  Then the iPod in the early 2000s.  That was a huge success.  So they have managed year after year to come up with a hit.  But it has been a long time since they've come up with a hit.  And partly that's because there's been nothing ever in the world as successful as the iPhone.

Start time: 448.22
End time: 482.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the talk is they're going to move to services.  And then Apple's going to stop selling increased unit volume.  That's what Steve Cook said.  Yeah.  Well, Steve Cook is probably a good guy to ask about what Apple will do.  The question is how can they make that transition?  Because they're not going to win the productivity wars.  You've got Google and Microsoft.  They're really butting heads.  They're not going to win the cloud storage wars or the cloud computing wars.  So where are they going to find a home in services that they can really expect a lot of long term revenue growth, especially at a time in which App Store revenue cuts are under attack?  The Fortnite App Store is going to take 12 percent.  Apple wants 30.  If it was an arcade.  Microsoft has already said they're willing to go down to 85.

Start time: 482.50
End time: 484.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're willing to take 15 percent from some developers as well.

Start time: 486.03
End time: 490.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brilliant.  Microsoft makes money.  So I don't know what's going to happen with them in the short term.

Start time: 490.90
End time: 499.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It puts them in a little bit of a bind if they're going to rely on services and self-driving cars, augmented reality.  Some of the other things Apple's talked about aren't anywhere near ready.

Start time: 499.50
End time: 516.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are five year down the line projects that were not even close to being ready yet.  And in the meantime, they've I mean, they said in their last quarterly financial results, yeah, we're not actually going to make it.  Yeah, we're not actually going to report on unit ships anymore, just on revenues, which was basically a sign that, yeah, we're just going to be relying on jacking up the price and profit taking.

Start time: 516.94
End time: 560.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other way of spinning is saying that the unit sales are not really what's driving income going forward.  They're flat.  What we're going to take a look at is how much money we make per customer.  And that's I think that's not an unreasonable thing to do.  A lot of companies do it at.  Microsoft doesn't break down unit sales.  Google doesn't break down unit sales.  It is maybe especially in this new world for Apple more appropriate to look at revenue per customer.  Well, but look, we knew Apple was going to I have to say a lot of this is just shot in front.  Oh, a trillion dollar company.  A will show you a we like to.  That's what we do.  We build people up to knock them down.  That's kind of the way it is.  I mean, we're not going to solve human nature on this show.

Start time: 562.25
End time: 565.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can at least understand that it's we can try.  We can try.  It is part of it.

Start time: 565.54
End time: 586.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do have a philosophy degree.  So there's a legitimate.  So you were right.  Celebrate.  Take a victory lap.  Mike Elgin.  Apple's been was been facing this problem for a couple of years and they have yet to come up with a successor.  I've heard people say this is Tim Cook's fault.  He shouldn't.  He didn't.  He hasn't come up with a follow up.  You even kind of implied that because I was at a.

Start time: 586.88
End time: 601.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, he's not quite scully levels about.  He's very good at keeping the business running and making it profitable.  No, he's a great operations guy, but he's not an innovations guy.  And Johnny Ive appears to have basically given up.  I think he's retired.  He's semi retired now.

Start time: 601.50
End time: 604.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So cashing checks is a full time job.  Yeah, exactly.  This is the innovators dilemma.

Start time: 604.52
End time: 615.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the classic dilemma for all companies, especially tech companies.  It's hard to reinvent yourself many times.  And Apple's done it.  But Apple's done it more than most.  More than most.

Start time: 615.80
End time: 633.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing we should all look inside ourselves and question is whether how invested are we in the success of this corporation?  I mean, yes, they're iconic.  Yes, Steve Jobs's career was amazing.  Yes, they've impressed us.  Yes, we've all been Apple fans at some point or another, but it's a corporation.  Come on.  Why?  That's the problem, though.

Start time: 634.02
End time: 642.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of Apple fans really do have an investment.  It's about identity.  Emotional investment.  It's about identity.  And Apple's been good at capitalizing on that.  They became a brand, a fashion brand.

Start time: 644.02
End time: 651.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a limited number of people with both the passion and the money to pay the Cupertino Idiot Tax again and again and again every year.  Calm down.

Start time: 652.01
End time: 655.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop calling me an idiot on air.  Well, I just bought a Pixel 3.

Start time: 655.54
End time: 667.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I moved the iPhone to the Pixel 3.  And Google is selling a fraction of the Pixel phones that Apple is selling iPhones.  They're probably losing money on it.  It's still a great phone.  Apple sells more phones in a month than Google sold all year.

Start time: 668.36
End time: 678.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But one thing that's caught my eye during this entire brouhaha is how we're behind talking about this now.  If you look at global smartphone shipments over the last couple of years, they've been flat.  We should have been expecting this.

Start time: 678.72
End time: 684.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were.  We all were.  I've been saying this for years.  Mike's been saying it for years.  I mean, it feels sudden.

Start time: 685.55
End time: 704.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we were shocked that there was a plateau to smartphone sales.  There's a limited number of people who can afford them.  But I feel like this conversation wasn't as concrete as it should have been.  We should have been more honest about this.  But I mean, one problem that we have is that the old iPhones are so damn good.  Damn good.  Sorry. I apologize, everyone.  Like, my 7 Plus that I still have, I'm going to keep it until it dies because I don't want to ever change it.

Start time: 705.76
End time: 725.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is one of the factors Tim Cook mentioned in his letter, took advantage of the battery replacement.  He said we got more people than we thought would do that and that those people did not upgrade.  She calls her iPhone 6 her beloved iPhone 6.  Does not want to change it.  She likes having a headphone jack.  The new battery made it as fast as it ever was.

Start time: 726.66
End time: 742.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the iPad problem that they've had.  The iPads are so durable and long lasting.  It's like, who needs a new one?  It's really not that different.  And with that battery replacement, it was so inexpensive, it's such a no brainer.  It kind of turned iPhones into iPads because that battery was the thing that started killing you after a couple of years.

Start time: 743.18
End time: 749.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that does raise the issue if Apple did that on purpose because Apple was slowing down phones.  They got caught, but they were slowing down phones with older batteries.

Start time: 749.74
End time: 767.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here again is an unmitigated benefit to consumers and the environment.  Because the fewer phones that are manufactured, the better it is for them.  These are not recycled.  Less sea waste than the rest of it.  So this battery thing is a good thing for Apple to lose money on it and have trouble partly because of that.  So what?  It's a good thing.

Start time: 767.56
End time: 771.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying if Apple becomes, say, IBM in a decade.  So what?  So what?

Start time: 772.50
End time: 792.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still a massive money making machine.  But at the same time, as you say, people are replacing their batteries.  And also, Tim Cook blamed China a little bit on this.  I was kind of skeptical.  And then I talked to friends out there.  And Apple is now becoming, in fact, buying any American technology in China is almost seen as disloyal in some circles.  This is the new backlash.

Start time: 793.34
End time: 817.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, in fact, this happened New Year's Eve.  The Huawei PR team that tweeted New Year's greetings not from a Huawei phone, but from an iPhone and got busted.  And two employees got demoted because of it because it's seen as disloyal.  It's not merely, you know, your company's mad at you.  The Chinese people thought of it as disloyal.  And you were saying we're coming up to peak smartphone.

Start time: 817.60
End time: 825.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huawei released that lesser.  And they're saying, no, we're expecting 30 percent increase in smartphone sales because they're not hyper expensive.

Start time: 825.70
End time: 830.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Partly what's eating Apple's lunch is the very inexpensive but very high quality Chinese make phones.

Start time: 830.60
End time: 836.50

Transcript:  If you're going to pay half the cost and get 90 percent of the functionality, it's a no brainer.  No one needs face ID, really.

Start time: 837.07
End time: 838.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one needs emojis.  No one needs.

Start time: 839.62
End time: 842.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have any of those.  I've never missed them once.  Maybe I'm getting old.

Start time: 842.99
End time: 844.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you miss them?  Mike, you switched to an Android.

Start time: 845.70
End time: 849.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And no, none of those things.  I actually I'm so happy.

Start time: 850.10
End time: 872.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never received an emoji text from you, actually.  You're not going to.  I was talking to my mom and I did turned on the emoji of my face.  She says, stop it.  What are you doing?  Stop that.  Why are you a talking pile of physeeks?  Oh, wait, that's quite normal.  She said, that looks like poop.  She said, stop it.  So, no, I mean, it's innovation.  It's courage.  Well, they've added it.  Yes, courage.

Start time: 872.70
End time: 880.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The courage in making you buy dongles that you immediately lose.  And it's gimmicks like face ID.  So there is, especially among people like you, a certain amount of joy in this announcement

Start time: 883.50
End time: 886.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that Apple's not going to be.  Joy is just like.

Start time: 887.52
End time: 893.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Schadenfreude is the right word.  Finally, they're getting the message.  This is probably an unpopular opinion.

Start time: 897.42
End time: 928.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that all of the success of Apple is due to one person, Steve Jobs.  I mean, we're just coasting after the post Steve Jobs era.  I think there's evidence.  He was so good.  The iPhone was Steve Jobs' other than the building, which is also amazing, the circular  spaceship building.  The iPhone, maybe arguably the iPad, but the iPhone was his last genius move to go into  a whole.  I was critical of it back in 2007.  It was brilliant.  Well, before that, I was critical and said, oh, come on.  I did the same thing.  The worst business.

Start time: 928.54
End time: 932.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said the same thing.  You don't want to get in that business.  Exactly.  What a catastrophe.

Start time: 932.64
End time: 936.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to be fair, the first iPhone was a real dog apart from the user interface.

Start time: 936.84
End time: 942.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The vision of it all and the execution of it all over time was just obviously killer.  Perfection.

Start time: 942.96
End time: 945.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to talk about the Schadenfreude thing, though.  I don't think people are really.

Start time: 945.86
End time: 951.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a German word for those who don't know.  That means the shameful joy at the misfortune of others.  Except for the shame part.

Start time: 953.70
End time: 992.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing about that is I don't take any joy at a company doing poorly.  I don't particularly care if Microsoft is better than Apple.  What I do want to point out and cop to is that Apple fanboys being sad is fine by me.  That probably gives me a little bit of joy because they've been banging this drum forever  about how Apple is better than everyone else, even though it's not.  It's great, but other companies are good too.  And to see this happen is a bit of like, you see, they're mortal over one Apple way or  whatever because there's just people at a corporation.  So the fanboys drive me nuts.  Apple, I don't particularly care about.  I'll use whatever PC is best.  Currently, it's a Windows 10 gaming rig and this MacBook Pro.  That's all I need.  But I don't care more than that.  Just the people drive me nuts.

Start time: 993.76
End time: 997.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the German word for shameless joy?  The shameless joy.  I just looked up Schadenfreude.

Start time: 999.14
End time: 1004.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is an English word that means the same thing, which is unusual because a lot of German words,  there's no translation.  It's epicaracy.

Start time: 1006.52
End time: 1009.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1009.93
End time: 1018.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never heard it.  Epocharyxy.  It comes from the Greek epi, upon, cara, joy, and kakon, evil.  I don't see that catching on.

Transcript:  We're in an interesting situation right now, though, I think in technology, where it looks like,  and maybe this is always the case because just as fish aren't aware of the water,  we're not aware of our limited scope, it looks like companies like Google and Facebook  have gotten to the point where they can't fail.  They can't wear out.  There's no business cycle applicable to them.

Transcript:  I disagree.  I don't know.  You probably don't know this because you're not on Facebook.  But I'm doing this.  I'm quitting Facebook slowly.  So in July, I'm quitting.  That's called not quitting, I might add.  I did that with drinking for ages.  I've still worked on it.  But it's like Walt Mossberg, four days after I wrote this big post about why I'm doing it, said,  I don't want to convince anybody else.  He quit, didn't he?  He did.  But I want to convince everyone to get off Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger because they're just horrible.  I know you've done it.

If they weren't tied to Facebook, I think they'd be pretty remarkable.  The problem is I can't get my money back.  I've written to them.  They said 30-day money back.  That 30 days has passed.  I wrote to them.  They said, OK, fine.  Why do you want to get rid of it?  I said, because I don't like you or something.  And I sent them the invoice.  I said, we need to see your order.  I said, and then I never heard from them again.  And now I realize it's because I don't have a Facebook account.  I'm caught in some weird.

Transcript:  Can I touch on why Google could struggle if not fail but struggle?  And one thing that people don't keep tabs on is every quarter Google reports earnings and it show off two numbers that are very important.  One is the number of paid clicks they've had always goes up and they also show the cost per click for those pay clicks which goes down.  Yeah.  Because they're driving more mobile clicks from search over time, which is good for them, but they're worth less per click.  And so eventually there will come a day in which the price per click goes down.  They actually pay you if you click something.  Maybe. That's taboola, I think. That's how that works.  But there's a time when these curves no longer work in Google's favor and doesn't actually generate revenue growth.  At that point in time they'll be where Apple is now, still hugely profitable, still doing very well, not the same engine that they were before.  And that's going to change the corporate culture, how they push product development.

Start time: 1247.62
End time: 1264.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have a very simplistic point of view which is well nobody can duplicate their search engine.  But you're making a very accurate point. That's not their revenue source.  The revenue source is paid clicks.  Paid clicks.  And of course I think Google realizes it because there's a frenzied search for the next big thing at Google.  I mean that's clearly a big deal for them.

Transcript:  But you see I think Facebook's problem is that it won't get overtaken immediately, but it's being cut off from both the bottom and the top.  Younger people aren't going to Facebook.  They're actively deleting their accounts.  They're deleting their accounts and okay they're going to Instagram which Facebook happens to own,  but that's not going to work anymore because Facebook isn't going to be allowed to buy up the competition in the same way that it used to.  They're not?  No.  Who's going to stop them?  The regulators.  Facebook has pissed off so many people in Congress at the moment.  That's true.  They're going to face a very tough time.  Facebook buys stuff until Facebook starts writing checks.

Transcript:  But also the upper end of the scale, and this is something I noticed because my parents are on Facebook  and my parents were on Facebook.  Well you use it to keep in touch with people in the UK.  Yeah, which I do, and I do, but I'm seeing a lot of the older generation with the privacy stuff that's been coming out now,  are kind of like, you know what, I was fine with just email and they're downgrading their accounts.  The app in particular, my mum took the app off her phone and a bunch of her friends did because they were worried that it was listening to them.  So they're that aware.  And I told them it didn't happen.  No, no actually.

Start time: 1340.78
End time: 1345.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1358.93
End time: 1372.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that because of you?  They do read my copy, yes.  So I don't know if every 80-year-old is doing it.  They may be unusual.  I mean, a lot of...  They said themselves they've had a massive number of people deleting the app.  And that's really going to hurt them long term.

Start time: 1373.65

Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to say my mum is the most active Facebook user in my family and she's the least tech savvy.  So that's not the demographic you want if you want a cool product that will persist long term.

Start time: 1384.50
End time: 1417.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but if what you want is to sell advertising, there is a case to be made for a less tech savvy audience.  I was told at Tech TV that we don't want tech savvy people because they don't buy brands.  They search for the best product at the best price.  We don't want that.  Give me an impulse buyer who doesn't know what they're doing.  Honestly, I don't know about Facebook, but Instagram, one of the reasons I got off is because I made so many impulse buys on Instagram.  You do buy stuff.  I bought Instagram underwear, I bought Instagram, everything.

Start time: 1418.60
End time: 1423.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1423.78
End time: 1431.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So honestly, you see, I make a point if I see an advert on Facebook, I deliberately don't buy via Facebook.  It's just like me being bloody minded.  That's why they don't like people like you.

Start time: 1432.39
End time: 1454.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the whole problem.  Well, there is a...I don't know if there's a term for it, but there is a thing called banner blindness.  I was just reading about this where people just don't see banner ads.  I know I don't see banner ads.  And I think that is almost like you, a willful desire, which is a shame because I am in an ad supported business.  Well, as am I.  No, no, as am I.  Not to see advertisers, right?

Start time: 1455.18
End time: 1468.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean, I think there is a kickback against it, and particularly when people get more and more creeped out by, as you say, the shadow profiles and the amount of targeting that goes on.  I think that generally does creep a lot of people out and it will come around and hurt them in the end.

Transcript:  What I'm fascinated by is the fact that people think that it's impossible to replicate Facebook's reach, which it is not, actually.  I've created this idea called the Nice Book, which is simply a shared photo of Google photos.  Is it on Google Plus?  Google Photos.  Close.  Close.  The thing that still exists.  I have to say, when Google Plus...

End time: 1521.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, everybody gets it.  Everybody gets it.  I don't get it.  Wait a minute, that is so weird.  I was wondering what those notifications were.  Yeah, it's irritating, isn't it?  I get comments because I'm somehow in your Nice Book.  Yes.  I get those comments on my phone.  Right, right.

Start time: 1522.90
End time: 1536.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've invited everybody on Facebook to join me.  I post pictures of my personal life, my squishy face, all this stuff.  And then until July, I'm going to be posting those on Facebook so that people can click through to my Nice Book.

Start time: 1536.60
End time: 1544.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike Elgin's Nice Book.  There it is.  How did it get there?  Oh, you shared them with me.  I didn't even have to say yes.  That's right.  That's the best part.

Start time: 1545.55
End time: 1569.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're pushing content there.  But anybody who wants to join it can join it.  It's completely open to the public.  But why join it?  I'm getting it anyway.  Well, you don't have to join it because you've got the deluxe edition.  Exactly.  Oh.  So it's all the good things about Facebook.  You share photos and comments and things like people can like it and all that stuff without any of the disinformation, the fake news, the Russian probably whatever, the manipulation, the lying, the ads, none of that stuff.  It's the best part of Instagram.

Start time: 1569.50
End time: 1570.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's comments.

Start time: 1571.60
End time: 1582.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can be the notifications can go through the app and also through email, which means it has three times the reach of Facebook, three times as many people can see my Nice Book as can see Facebook.

Start time: 1582.50
End time: 1615.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I set this up, I would have to add people by their email.  This actually I just read an article about this being a problem that you don't have to say yes.  It's a harassment problem.  Yeah.  They can share.  You know, I get already a ridiculous amount of harassment on Google's Hangouts.  It's very easy for people.  I get like so-called women.  I'm sure never women, you know, saying, hey, baby.  But it's always in French because my name is Laporte.  It's easy to ignore.  But they even try to call.  I mean, I even get calls.  Yes.  Oh, sure.

Start time: 1616.54
End time: 1640.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a problem.  But with this concept, you can block anybody and it's easy to do.  But you don't have to invite anybody necessarily.  You can just put the it'll give you a link.  You say here, everybody, here's the link and they can just join.  They want to.  They can set their own notifications.  The difficulty of interacting is it's actually easier than Facebook.  The quality of photos is like ten times better than Facebook.  Everything about it is better than Facebook.  So I'm just going to see if this works.

Start time: 1640.50
End time: 1656.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that because what I've wanted since I deactivated Instagram is just my public Instagram page without the social element.  And everyone goes, that's a blog, dude.  Yeah.  I'm like, yes, but I don't want to set a blog up.  I want you to do it for me.  I just want to upload photos.  Maybe this is my middle ground.  I kind of like the idea.  It's so easy and fun.

Start time: 1656.52
End time: 1665.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think there's much scope for a paid social network?  Because we were arguing about this in the pub before Christmas.  And it's like, I don't honestly think people are willing to pay for a social network.

Start time: 1665.66
End time: 1676.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like it at all because people have different levels of ability to pay.  And so you're creating this you're creating this thing.  I've always supported that app.  Remember app.net?  Paywalls never bothered me.  Yeah.

Start time: 1677.62
End time: 1695.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by the way, Mike, just as a little tip, you could also make a blog this way.  Google's drive, Google Drive's sharing system also has the same permissions problem.  Somebody can share with you.  You don't have to accept it.  And if you only have you permissions, you can't remove yourself from the share.  This is from an article in How to Geek.

Start time: 1695.50
End time: 1702.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said they would fix it though.  And we'll see if they do.  But yeah, that's a really weird problem.  There's actual I read that unlike their spam and Google Drive.

Start time: 1703.69

End time: 1724.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can't say the same thing could happen.  Now I have to point out they've got to fix it in photos too.  Because let's say you were an abusive spouse and you wanted to use this to harass somebody.  You could do that.  So on the other hand, I like being part of Mike's nice book.  But I like the name of it.  Yeah.

But I can bring up so many more cases where people have killed themselves over bullying on Twitter.  The abuse that happens, the abuse I get and others get, I mean, I was happy.

End time: 1836.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Everybody feels that way.  And it's just an inevitable part of human nature.  But another part of human nature that's driving some of this is, and we're all guilty, everybody at this table is guilty of this.  We have a bias for the new.  And old stuff is like, because I tell, what's the solution?  It's our monkey mind.  Well, it's RSS, it's email newsletters, it's all this old stuff.  Works great.  Nobody wants to talk about it, but that's the solution actually.

End time: 1911.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been saying for a long time also that the best social network by far is email.  And so email newsletters is one avenue of that. People need to spend more time managing their filters and all that kind of stuff.  That's the problem.  And email can be beautiful.

Start time: 1911.50
End time: 1952.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I have one filter that says if there's unsubscribe in the body of this message, stick it over here.  That's brilliant.  All of your newsletters are ending up in that folder, but at least they're all there.  I was wondering where they were going.  That's how he broke through the noise he shared his photos with.  I'm going to remove the unsubscribe.  I think it's a GDPR violation.  I shouldn't say that. Well, that's a great filter, by the way.  Yeah.  Highly recommend it. It's just a newsletter filter.  But I think a lot of people always tell me Jason Calacanis, you say click through rate of newsletters fantastic.  His whole business is now newsletter.  You know what it is online?  I don't get it. I don't want to. Maybe I get too many newsletters.

You know, American finger, Democrats...  60% is pretty good.  See, this is why I can't read these.  Yeah.  Because I will then buy an Instapack.  And forget that I bought one last year and the year before that.  Why are people so into their Instapack?

I want to read it, but that's buried in with all of these.  You're paying for it. You should read it.  I know. $400 a year.  And I'm sure I'm getting Mike's list and, you know, and Stacey Higginbotham's list.  Who's fantastic.  Who are these people that are reading these?

Because if you don't get paid to be informed and you work at a job where you click buttons and put things in spreadsheets,  you want a digest in the morning you can read on the commute or at the coffee spot to get caught up.  And so us at this table, we get paid to know stuff, which is a great, great job to be clear.  But like that's why a newsletter roundup for me is ridiculous.  So I don't need it.  Look, I get the Times and Print in Providence every day.  Well, five days a week. And so I read it and often I'm like, oh, this is just last night's news.  I know.

This, today's show brought to you by Atlassian.  Now this is a part of the 21st century I'm liking.  Staying competitive in a cloud-based world means your teams need to work together  and execute faster.  Your IT team does, and Atlassian empowers everything we do in IT.  It's the company behind Jira, of course, and every developer knows Jira for agile development.  But we also use Confluence.  We use Bitbucket.  We use Jira to keep track of punch lists, things that need to be done to communicate.  Atlassian uses software to manage complex collaboration, and it does it so beautiful.  It's the technology backbone that helps modern IT organizations plan, service,  and support the kind of change that propels the business.  And it doesn't have to be really an IT organization.  We use Confluence for our engineering staff so that they can keep track of what's going on  with the equipment, what's going on with the network.  It's DevOps.  It's agile development.  It's IT apps and ops, ITSM, and whatever is next.  An affordable, and this is important, an affordable, reliable suite of tools.  Jira software, Confluence, and Bitbucket.  Atlassian forms the backbone of effective cross-team project planning, organization,  and communication.  And don't forget Jira Ops and Ops Genie and Stannish Page, which helps you keep track  of incidents, alert response teams, coordinate response efforts to resolve issues faster,  and keep customers or stakeholders like me updated.  Your team could choose tools that are right for your current framework while trusting  that as you grow, they will grow with you.  And of course, it all integrates right into Jira and Confluence.  So you don't have to go from platform to platform.  Everything you need is right there.  We love Atlassian.  And of course, you will too.  And like all of Atlassian's products, the tools for your IT team are easy and easy to  configure, easy to set up, and free to try.  So go to Atlassian.com and find out what's right for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The very next day that press release.  This is interesting.  I got this press release about the Apple store capping off a blockbuster Christmas weekend.  Google flagged it up as potentially a philips spam and phish.  That's terrible.  I got in contact because I get my Apple releases from Apple UK because Apple US hates us.  I contacted my contacts at Apple UK and said, mate, seriously, you've just been identified  as a phishing email by Google.  I don't think we've been virus.  It's like, no, I don't think you've been virus.  I just think Google is playing silly.  They're getting too many false positives from something.

Start time: 2494.85
End time: 2526.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is true.  They take signals from users.  It could be a lot of users are saying.  Yeah, exactly.  Spam, spam, spam.  $1.2 billion spent during the holiday period and a new single day record on New Year's  Day.  It's always a good time for Apple because people get new devices for the holidays and  then rush to the app store.  But that is a spectacular amount of money.  That's a lot of thought apps.  And flashlight apps.  Aren't they mostly free?  $322 million on New Year's Day alone.  $322 million.  And remember, Apple gets a third of that.

Start time: 2527.33
End time: 2563.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, just under.  A little under.  Well, one thing every venture capitalist does on Christmas morning and New Year's Day is  pull up the app store rankings and see who's performing the best.  You can see if Amazon's apps are shooting at the top of the app stores, you can presume  high volume there, better platform for startups, et cetera.  So it's kind of fun to see this from both the inside the app store perspective and also  from the meta perspective, which is how much total volume went through.  But I think the 30% cut will not last another year.  No, they're going to have to change it.  Apple will have to, just the market forces alone are forcing them down.  They don't own enough of the market to demand, is that monopsony pricing or is that monopoly  pricing?

Start time: 2563.50
End time: 2565.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or duopoly if you're taking into them an Android.

Start time: 2565.90
End time: 2578.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, if you're an app developer, you're willing to give them, in many cases,  willing to give them that 30% because you're on a platform that makes you money.  Look at Fortnite for crying out loud.

Start time: 2578.90
End time: 2580.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Fortnite now has its own store.

Start time: 2580.86
End time: 2595.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't like it, but on the other hand, honestly, yeah, they would probably prefer  to be on, as they are on Android, on the Apple store without giving Apple a cut.  But I think they're also pretty happy about the amount of money they've made.  True.

Start time: 2595.86
End time: 2603.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then all of a sudden you need to grow a little faster, hit the numbers, and that  30% seems a lot bigger than it did when you were just happy to have someone else to store  your apps for you.  When your brand is big enough.

Start time: 2603.50
End time: 2606.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the pressure?  How can they bring enough pressure to Apple to make them change that?

Start time: 2606.52
End time: 2615.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, one of the stories that I was reading up before the show is that Netflix  is going to stop paying the Apple tax and they drive hundreds of millions of dollars  of revenue through iOS.  Yeah, that's a huge one.

Start time: 2615.66
End time: 2617.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $853 million in annual iOS revenue.  Right.

Start time: 2618.50
End time: 2626.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now they're going to take that away from Apple and Apple doesn't get a 30% cut of that.  If you're Apple and you need to grow your services income, as we touched on in the first  segment, that's critical.  That's your margin right there.

Start time: 2626.68
End time: 2655.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In that case, you could safely say that's rent taking on Apple's part because Apple,  you know, it's one thing if you're delivering the app and you and people pay for the app,  Apple's giving you some value.  But if you already in Netflix app, you've got the app and you're giving or Kindle books,  for instance, you're giving Apple a third of the subscription fee.  That's rent taking on Apple's part.  I think that's really wrong.  Apple might have to give up on that.  And haven't they reduced the amount of money they take for subscriptions?  Isn't there something like after a certain amount of money a year?

Start time: 2655.78
End time: 2672.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which I think they had to because once you get to a certain number of sales, you  don't need Apple that much anymore.  And they are you are just paying them a third or 30% for very little.  I mean, yeah, you get to be in the app store.  Well, people want to buy this app anyway, as we saw with Fortnite.

Start time: 2673.53
End time: 2679.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, as a developer, you don't have to have anywhere to download Apple provides a  CDN.  They have Akamai.  They store it for you.  Yeah.

Start time: 2685.90
End time: 2702.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Riot Games doesn't need Apple to promote their stuff in the app store to drive downloads.  But that's probably 30 companies out of the 30,000 that are on the app store.  That's the rub.  Yeah.  But they also it's the power law, right?  So they drive most of the revenue.  So Apple doesn't really care if Billy Bob's lemonade factory app store dot Tumblr leaves  or not.

Start time: 2703.50
End time: 2721.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they just care if 853 million fleas from their pocket from Netflix.  That's a huge amount of money, especially if you're banking on services to make up a  shortfall in sales.  I know they're saying that what are they 20 billion.  But the solution is not lowering the cut.  Or would you rather have 400 million than nothing?

Start time: 2721.54
End time: 2737.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Being developer friendly in the long term will lead to more income.  It may lead to reduced growth in the short term.  But if everyone that's the high dollar customer effectively of the app store on the app side  and the company side leaves, what are you going to have left?  Apple needs this desperately.  They need to have good relations and long term commitments.

Transcript:  So this is what I was trying to remember.  The FTC is now suing Qualcomm.  Because this all comes down, it basically underscores Apple's position,  which is that Qualcomm has patents, but they're not licensing them as franned, as fair patents at a fair price.  At a reasonable price, yeah.  So the FTC agrees, and they are going to court.  I think they'll be facing Judge Lucy Koh once again.  Oh my gosh, the infamous, the notorious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes we do.  Anyway, so that's a little, I mean at least a moral victory for Apple, if not an actual victory.  So this fight just is endless.  But ultimately, that's what it comes down to, is that Qualcomm has all these patents,  particularly for outdated technologies like CDMA.  All this will go away, I presume, with 5G, although I think they've been snapping up 5G patents as well.  And they are charging a lot of money to Apple and others for the right to make phones that support these radios and these technologies,  whether they use Qualcomm chips or not.

Transcript:  This all falls back to me, the kind of bifurcation of the tech world into like closed systems and open systems at the country level.  China has their own internet. They want their own chips. They want their own IP. They have their own internet giants, etc.  They're kind of building a nation state of technology that we in the West increasingly don't want to interface with or can't due to security concerns.  And I don't think it's healthy long term.  I think technology thrives on big open markets and I don't think this is going to be to the long term credit of the Chinese economy.  That's my macro view.  I think it's too bad that we're moving backwards.  It seems in terms of openness and sharing across international borders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is complicated. This is a difficult one.  I have read several times and I've talked to people who think that China's interests are hard to understand because while they want total and ultimate control within the country,  they are very much global and globalism is very good for them economically.  That's why the Belt and Road Initiative.  And so they would like to be a world economic power and play and trade and have open trade while they are very backward in terms of their own people.  They're very authoritarian with their own people.  Increasingly so actually.  Yeah.  I read a story. I'm sorry.

Start time: 3357.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just an aside to support that point.  Now there are school children in some school districts in China that have smart uniforms that track the children and they match the face recognition when they enter the school room  to make sure that the child who's supposed to be wearing that particular uniform is in fact wearing that uniform.  So the tracking is actually tracking the child they think that they're tracking.  And then classroom are time late or this.  So it's like a totalitarian or wellian system within the elementary school.

Transcript:  Well, exactly.  But culturally they kind of are.  I mean, to a certain extent.  I mean, there's some there's some desire to have Chinese culture more broadly appreciated internationally.  But most of their activity internationally is about getting resources to fuel this and this enormous economy with all these enormous numbers of people, which is kind of necessary.  Because, I mean, back back in the day when Chinese people used to mostly ride bicycles and so on, it was like the resource demands were not that great.  Now everybody wants the American dream in China, which is why the African push is going on.

Transcript:  That's been going on for two decades now.  But one last thing before we take a break.  But Leo, you said they want to go externally economically.  Not entirely true.  They've been moving away from an export based economy for some time and trying to build a domestic consumption based economy, which is why the last two quarters of summer.  The last two quarters of slipping data on the consumption side of the Chinese economy has been so scary to people because tax revenues and it's a huge mess.  So I think I think this is not the China show.  So I should shut up.  But I think there's a lot here from the tech side that we need to pay attention to in the next couple of years because this topic is not going away.

Transcript:  They had an A.I.  conference where just at the end of last year where they were saying, yeah, well, America's  filed more patents in A.I. than any other station.  Yeah.  The fact that the Chinese aren't actually has filed more papers, academic papers about  A.I.  The fact that Chinese haven't done as many doesn't mean they're not producing the amount  of publishing.

Start time: 3529.50
End time: 3601.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just not publishing.  And it doesn't mean they're not memorizing all the papers that the U.S. has published.  Exactly.  And there's also this feeds into another story that I don't know if it's on the rundown  or not, but it's basically the Commerce Department wants to is considering the limitation.  It is on the rundown.  The limitation of A.I. technology exports, including a number of other things.  And this is a dumb.  I personally think it's a dumb idea because basically the idea that the China will just  raise its hands and go, well, I guess we have no access to the U.S. A.I. technology.  I mean, the students are here.  Chinese citizens who work for corporations in the U.S.  I mean, if you look in the sciences, a huge number of researchers in almost all fields,  including computer science, are Chinese nationals who have come to this country recently.  They have this policy in China called the Thousand Grades of Rice, where if you return  your academic and you work in A.I., you will have a long meeting with some people, nice  people from the government who will start to work on you about what's going on, who's  doing what.  And they have a way of putting a lot of pressure on you and your family and all this kind of  stuff.  So they're going to get this either through exports or they're going to get it through  students or they're going to get it through consumers or they're going to get it the old  fashioned way, corporate espionage.

Start time: 3602.19

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say with a caveat to what you were saying, Mike, yes, OK, there's espionage and  yes, there are students.  There's also a terrific amount of very well funded pure research being done in China.  If you look at particularly in terms of quantum communications and those sort of areas, they  are leaps and bounds ahead because they've invested the money in academics and they've  done the pure research that's needed.  And something America is very bad at is funding this long term pure research rather than going  through short term commercially viable stuff.

Start time: 3645.74

Transcript:  So the Commerce Department is taking comments.  They will make a decision on January 10th.  This comes from a bill passed in August by Congress, the Export Controls Act of 2018,  which allowed the government to restrict exports of emerging and foundational technologies.  Including voice.  And so you would think, I mean, oh, the Chinese are stealing it from us.  They're cheating.  We should keep them from this stuff.  But in fact, academics are worried because, A, you can't control the export of this stuff.  You can't control.  And a law like this will actually hurt us more than would hurt the Chinese because we  won't get the information.  The Chinese will anyway.  And that means we will become we will fall behind.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by my shiny, clean, sweet smelling smile.  Because I use quip.  Quip!  I love quip!  My daughter, the other day, I was so proud of her, this was about five months ago, said,  Dad, I think I need to brush my teeth more.  I said, darling, you do.  She said, I want to get an electric toothbrush.  I said, darling, it's done.  And I had a quip subscription for her by the end of the day.  Starting a healthy routine and sticking to it are two very different things.  I know you'd like to brush better in 2019.  Don't use that tired old toothbrush.  Get yourself a quip.  Quip is a better electric toothbrush.  I just got my quip refill, by the way, yesterday.  It had a new head, because you have to replace that head every three months.  Automatically, they send you the new head.  It had a tube of toothpaste.  And it had a battery in it.  Because quip is the only electric toothbrush that doesn't plug in.  It's a great travel toothbrush.  It uses a single battery, a triple A battery.  You know, 90% of us do not brush right.  Did you know that?  I didn't know that.  Let me ask you, Mr. Dental Health.  You're going to ask the British about dental health.  Did you know you should brush for a full two minutes?

Transcript:  They have a little timer in the quip.  It pulses every 30 seconds.  So you do four quadrants, two minutes, and then it stops.  It's great.  The cover, I love the multi-use cover, because it could be a stand.  But it also has a stick on the back so you can mount it to a mirror.  So you never forget to brush because it's right there in your mirror in the bathroom.  It slides over your bristles when you want to travel.  You put the head down and it protects your quip on the grow.  Plus it declutters the sink and makes traveling easier.  No wires, no clunky charger.  It goes three months on a battery charge.  Brush heads automatically come on the dentist's recommended schedule every three months.  And that's just $5.  Did you know, more statistics, 75% of us use old worn out bristles  that aren't doing the job because we don't change our brush head.  Who remembers?

They say, no problem.  We've got your quip right here.  We'll put their name on it.  It's kind of funny.  They do not like that, I admit.  But too bad.  Too bad.

If there isn't a discount when I'm buying stuff,  I don't give them my phone number,  because I'm not particularly interested  in letting them know that I bought  shaving cream yesterday  or razor blades the day before.

End time: 4769.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is that all stores, for the most part,  are going away.  No, they're becoming experiences.  So they're going to transform, over the next 10 years,  they're going to transform Whole Foods  into like a whole experience.  And I don't know what that means exactly,  but it's going to be a lot more  than just like go and buy some food.  Was this the vision when they bought Whole Foods?  That plus the thing that they're doing,  which is using it as a physical location  for all kinds of purposes.  And a distribution network.  Which is what we do.  Which is what we talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

They eliminate a lot of organic stuff.  They've kind of gone in the direction of...  They don't want to be an organic food store.  Amazon could realize we can make this so profitable  if we just make it less idealistic  and more just ruthlessly businesslike.  And that's what they're doing.

I would like to see the methodology on that one,  because I was highly suspicious about that.  It was just like...  It's really...  You know, it's like, just throw a number out there,  but if it actually came down to it,  I think most people would cheerfully abandon Facebook for...  100 bucks.  Yeah, 100 dollar gift card.  Like a real 100 dollars.  Like, here's some actual 100 dollars.  And then, of course, they'd sign back in under another name,  but, you know, it's just...  Yeah, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's awful.  It's just a waste of time.  It is worthless.  The only reason I use Facebook is because I've got a bunch of friends back in the UK,  and I like to know what they're up to.  With American friends, we generally just talk.  I know it's old-fashioned to pick up a phone and make a phone call these days,  but either that or an email.

They brought entertainment and culture for the whole community together with speakers, teachers, musicians, entertainers, preachers, specialists.  They gathered together, often in a tent, sometimes in buildings, Chautauqua buildings.  There are still Chautauqua institutes all over the country.  And you know what killed it? Radio in the 20s.  And I think we're in a similar situation here.  That's an example of technology killing off something that did solve a human problem.  How do we formalize socializing?

That's what it is. It's kind of getting together and just kind of community and talking.  And I kind of like that. But I think we've lost that a little bit.  I think the current social media doesn't have that same sensation of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what you do with podcasting in the chat room is as close as you can get.  This is much more folksy.  Radio is too commercialized and too desperate to make some money.

I want to ask a word from our sponsor, LastPass.  From TimeHop to MyHeritage to MyFitnessPal, you know what they have in common?  Maybe if I throw in Marriott, Equifax, now you know.  These data breaches, last year's data breaches affected millions of people around the world.  If you're a business and you are keeping track of data, whether it's your data or customers' data,  you need LastPass Enterprise.  It makes password sharing convenient for employees, but keeps corporate data secure.  And you will have centralized admin oversight.  We use LastPass Enterprise here. We have for years.  Ever since one of our engineers put his passwords on a public website because he couldn't remember them.  He realized his mistake.  But we then got LastPass Enterprise because, of course, you want to use passwords you don't remember.  You want to use long, randomly generated passwords.  In fact, we use LastPass's password generator to create these crazy passwords.  Who can remember those? Well, you don't have to. You just remember them in LastPass.  In fact, I trust LastPass so much. It's encrypted only on device.  So even the LastPass company cannot access your password vault. No one can but you.  We require with our admin settings that you use two factor.  We have master password requirements too. That's all important.  You actually get over 100 policies. You get security reports. You get shared folders.  Shared folders are nice because like our ops team has its shared folder, the business office has its shared folder.  So all the company assets they need access to are there.  In many cases, they don't even get to see the password or know the password.  He just logs them into like say QuickBooks, our accounting program automatically.  So if we change the password, they don't have to know about it.  And if they leave the company, they have no way to get into it, which is fantastic.  Two factor authentication. We support multi-factor. We require it.  LastPass integrates with a variety of authentication providers to offer flexible multi-factor options.  They also have an authenticator app that's awesome. Instead of a number, it sends you a push notification.  Approver deny. You press the approve button. You're in.  And even if somebody got your passwords without the two factor authentication, they wouldn't be able to get your stuff.  I just I just love it. If you use Active Directory in your company, Microsoft's Active Directory,  you can log into LastPass with your A.D. credentials for a single sign on experience because the data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level.  Because it's so secure. And we had Steve Gibson actually get together with the creator of LastPass, Joe Segrist,  look at the source code and vet it for us. And he said thumbs up. He uses it now because it's so secure.  I keep my passport in there. I keep my driver's license, Social Security numbers, everything in LastPass.  It's protect your business. They have an enterprise solution.  But they also have LastPass teams for teams a little smaller, 50 or fewer. LastPass premium for your home users.  And at home, we use LastPass families for the whole family. That way everybody, including the 16 year old, gets LastPass.  Actually, the ex-husband also gets LastPass. We're very friendly that way.  It's awesome because things like, you know, when Lisa needs access to the, you know, the Comcast account, it's shared with her automatically.  So she gets access to it. I don't have to think about it. She has what she needs. I have what I need.  I love it. You're going to love it. 43,000 businesses, leading tech brands like MailChimp and Fortune 500 companies and Twitter.  Use LastPass. It's the number one most preferred password manager. LastPass.com slash Twitter.  Find the best password solution for your team at LastPass.com slash Twitter.  If you're coming to RSA, by the way, come to the LastPass cocktail party at Bourbon and Branch.  We went last year with so much fun. We're going to go again this year. And I'm bringing Jason and Megan as well.

Transcript:  So you can come say hi. Oh, I'm totally doing that. A couple of quick things about passwords.  I just got published a I hope well researched piece about passwords and the myths around passwords.  Is this a security intelligence time to dispel these dangerous password security myths by Mike Elgin.  Anyway, one of them one of the most interesting myths, I think, is that people think a long complicated password is always really secure, but they're not.  When if you write your own chances are it may not be all that secure according to some research that's been done.  It's actually really interesting. If you let LastPass create the password, it's going to be secure.

Start time: 5597.28
End time: 5609.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because it's a completely random combination of upper and lowercase numbers and punctuation.  Punctuation, your choice. And I also make them really long, like 40, 50, as long as the site doesn't matter if you're using it.

Start time: 5609.74
End time: 5625.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't matter. Another myth is that password managers last past the leading one have solved the problem.  But the only reason they haven't solved the problems of passwords is because not enough people use them.  People don't use them. Yeah. And so that problem is still there because people are not using them.

Start time: 5625.66
End time: 5631.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5643.58
End time: 5661.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also there's some research on this at DEFCON where they were saying about where you've got to put the uppercase, lowercase on the symbol.  In about 40 percent of the cases, the symbol is always an exclamation point at the end because that's easy to remember.  And password crackers are smart to this. And that's one of the assumptions they'll make when they're trying to brute force them.

Start time: 5663.46
End time: 5732.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's a new kind of AI that's out there called GANs which can easily crack any sort of new...  Oh really? What is this? Unless they're really good.  So GANs is... Let me see if I can explain this clearly. GANs is a type of technology...  Stands for Generative Adversarial Networks. That's right. You have two machine learning algorithms that go against each other.  One is trying to create fake data and the other one's testing that data and they both make each other better and better and better and better and better.  To the point where the one that can create fake data creates such great fake data that they can actually crack fingerprints.  It'll actually generate fake fingerprints that are very likely to pass as real fingerprints.  And then it just runs a hundred thousand fake fingerprints against it and cracks the fingerprint because one of them is going to get through.  Because finger... Anyway, remember this acronym GANs.  This is a GANs painting.  Yeah. This painting was created by GANs.  GANs is also the technology behind the deep fake videos.  Oh really?  Yes. This is the AI technology that's really changing things.  And it's coming a lot faster than...

Start time: 5732.80

Start time: 5739.64
End time: 5763.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. And together they both get better and better and better and better to the point where the one that's creating fake data makes such great fake data that it's better than the real thing.  The other thing I want to say about LastPass because I'm a dedicated user is I want to speak to my tribe, the lazy.  Because you just set it up with a fingerprint and everything you have that has a password, you just touch the back of your phone and you're on.

I managed to convince my editors to let me do a group test on personal breathalyzers that link into your phone through an app.  So convince the company to buy us some scotch, wine and beer and then we sat around the office drinking and blowing into these things.  And if you take a big shot of scotch and blow direct immediately into the breathalyzer, I got it to say you are in urgent need of medical care and must go to the hospital immediately.

Mary Jo Foley broke the story a couple of days ago.  Codenamed Bally, it's a way to give users control of the data collected about them.  We were talking on Windows Weekly this week that Apple... if you go to CES, there is a big billboard that says what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.  Apple is doubling down on privacy.  It's also not true, however.

Microsoft really needs a button that says, no, I don't want you to send anything back to Microsoft.  And they need to publicize that.  That's an opportunity for them that Google and Amazon cannot duplicate.

Transcript:  In fact, we have every year, our Christmas episode has the chief marketing officer, Chris Capicella, on it.  But I do think, and it's not because of Twitter or me, it's because Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therotte are very, very influential in the Microsoft business.  And they're delightful.  And they know what they're talking about.  So the Bally Project, which Mary Jo Foley found a link to...  Microsoft.  Nice job.  Mary Jo.  ...described as a new personal data bank which puts users in control of all the data collected about them.  This is something a lot of people, including...  Was it Tim Berners-Lee who's created a company to do this?  A lot of people looked at this idea of, you know, with all the privacy issues we're talking about, really, it's a question of selling your data for something of value.  The only way that'll work is if you know what data's being collected, you control it, and then you actually decide who to give that data to and what the value is going to be to you.  If you can do that, I think then there can be a reasonable conversation.  You know, if I know how much data Google's getting out of my Gmail account and I know how much value I'm getting from using Gmail, then I can make a logical decision about whether it's worth it.

You stole my joke!  Oh!  Oh Sam, sorry.  I was like, oh, oh, I have one.  But seriously, I mean, there's one of the things I hated about Windows 10 is that it's so data grabby.  You know, they will stick adverts pretty much anywhere.  Yeah, they've got to stop doing that.  It's not a bad operating system in itself, but it's the nagginess and the snoopingness about it.

A fight for a human future at the front...at the new frontier of power.  So she's really done a lot of work on this idea.  And we are in a state...we are in a world of surveillance capitalism.  That's how these companies make money is by surveilling us.  I don't know if there's an answer, but I'll...we'll talk to Professor Zuboff about that.  Are you optimistic?

Right.  People are actually thinking about it.  Unfortunately, the reason they're thinking about it is because these companies have been  so egregious in the way that they've used this data in the past.  But yeah, it's hopeful, possibly.

But what if everybody wasn't on Facebook?  Then suddenly the appeal is kind of weakened significantly.  So that's the idea.  It's not to everybody to leave Facebook.  It's for if 20% of the Facebook users left, that would really weaken the value of the service.

It's very much the attitude of people who sign on to Facebook because they can't yet figure out any other way to live.  They do that because they must conform to the apparent need, despite their vague ox-like awareness, they're being spied on, tricked, and defrauded.  This is the resigned malaise that fits the post Snowden internet and tech industry's consolidation.  It's the funereal aftermath of Moore's Law.  He's a great writer.

It's not any better.  It's just like Times New Roman.  No, no, it's worse.  It looks like notepad.  It's courier.  It looks like notepad.  You can't really tell what people are talking about.  You see responses without seeing the main message for it.  The threading's bizarre.  Maybe you haven't figured it out quite yet.  But it was the first time I ever saw the internet was on the well.  You could drop out of the well interface into a command line.  And I could use Gopher and Archie.  You can't do that anymore?  No, I don't think so.  It's web-based now.  Oh, well, forget it.  I'm not joining.  Anyway, I think this is worth reading.  You do have to go visit the well.  If you search for Bruce Sterling and SOTW, State of the World, you can read it.

But Grimms Fairytales public domain, they were able to make Cinderella and Snow White.  But then they pulled the ladder up behind them, made a copyright.  And every time this has come up, they've got Congress to extend it.  The last one was Sonny Bono's Copyright Term Extension Act in 1999.  That added 20 years, keeping everything locked up until January 1st.  So it is 1923 works are now coming into public domain.  I'm probably in the minority.

Transcript:  By the way, I have to correct myself.  Sonny Bono was already dead when the copyright extension term was passed.  He died in 1998. So Congress to honor him.  What an honor too.  Honoring your wife beats such a different time in those days.  It was a different time back in the 20th century.  So this is interesting.  Apparently, you can take some credit for this.  The Internet takes some credit for this.  The Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Authors Guild,  all of whom have been ones to lobby for the extension in the past, gave up.  It's not something we're pursuing, said the RIAA, because there's now a well-organized grassroots lobby against copyright extension.  There are large business interests, Google, now on the anti-expansion side.  Also, a wide popular movement they can tie it into.  The Internet, Internet activism.  The Netroots.  Netroots. I think that's a good thing.

Transcript:  This is why sites like TechDirt, they really keep tasks on the list.  Thank you, Mike Maznik. I really appreciate the work he does there.  Super important acts of journalism that do lead to change and how we think about things.  Because the RIAA is not notorious for its cuddliness, its politeness, its willingness to give away profits.  But we're going to get some of our stuff back into our own culture that we made and shouldn't be tied to commercial demands.

Transcript:  It was interesting, the Motion Picture Association of America already did it back down on this.  They were just like, you know, this is costing us too much.  It's costing them an awful lot in terms of legal fees and false positives.  When the RIAA did that big anti-piracy campaign, started suing people for downloading, they lost a ton of money on that.  The only people that got rich on that were lawyers.  And they also created a massive amount of ill will.  Metallica's reputation took a massive hit.

Start time: 7199.50
End time: 7227.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Possibly the most ridiculous product of the year so far.  It's basically too big. From a journalist perspective, the press day is an absolute nightmare because you've got a queue for two hours to get into a press conference.  And then when you get to the door, you're told the thing is full.  But the conference floor itself, it's a sales conference.  It's about introducing new products and trying to get buyers to sell them.  If you want to get mobbed on the CES show floor, you wear a buyer's badge. You don't wear a press badge.  They don't want the press there and they make that fairly with fairly here.

Transcript:  The reason why I'm glad I don't go anymore is that I always went there, but I never really covered consumer electronics.  And so I was always kind of faking it. I would get assigned to these keynotes like go cover the Qualcomm keynote.  So I get crammed into the back of some godforsaken conference room in some terrible hotel, sit on the floor with bad Wi-Fi and write about chips, which I don't understand.  And that was part of my day.  So we're all basically PTSD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would find out what you're interested in, but expect the fact that half the products that are reported on will never exist.  A quarter of the rest of them are going to be so poor as to be unusable.  And stuff like the Internet connected toilet is just so full of, well, I can't say.

Start time: 7318.74
End time: 7327.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there will be thousands of articles about it.  And there's nothing that going there will give you that you can't get from those thousands of articles.  Exactly.  And so it's a sort of...

Start time: 7645.82
End time: 7669.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should point out the one reason that crap like this gets so much press is because it is featured at these two pre show events.  Yes.  Pepcom and showstoppers.  Yeah.  And a little bit less at the CEA event.  And press is lazy and they want to file early.  So they go to these pre show events.  Whatever is nearest the door, that's going to get all the attention.

And it's like which tiny fraction of a percentage are you going to cover?  You have to decide.  The companies that actually pay money to be in these events are not going to be the no name.  Ten thousand dollars in many.  Yeah.  So they're putting up money like that.  There's something behind it.  They're much better than average as a CES product.  If they're in those events.

Transcript:  We do Twit every Sunday afternoon.  We're back in action now, the 2019 episode.  I didn't even mention it, but this is episode 700.  Wow.  I don't know if that makes it any...  You're all in the 700 club.  That's right.  Does that mean something else over here?  Yes, it does.  We do the show every Sunday afternoon, 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern.  That's 2300 UTC.  We'd love it if you watched live.  You're always welcome to.  You get that way.  You get all the stuff we edit out later.  At twit.tv slash live, we have audio and video live streams.  If you do that, irc.twit.tv.  You could join in with the kids in the back of the room as they talk about the show.  Let's see.  What else?  If you don't get here on time Sunday afternoon, we have on-demand versions.  You can always have everything we do.  Really, that's what a podcast is, is on-demand.  We have audio and video available at our website, twit.tv, or subscribe in your favorite podcast  application.  We don't have an official twit app.  There are a few unofficial and very good twit apps on all platforms, Android, iOS, even  Apple TV.  There's a very good one.  Actually, there's three or four very good ones.  And Chrome extension.  You can always just use whatever podcast application and subscribe.  That way you'll get it the minute it's available Sunday evening.  Thanks for being here.  It's good to see you all.  Good fun.  Another twit is in the can.
