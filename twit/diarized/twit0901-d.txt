Transcript:  24 years.  Somebody on the YouTube buys old crap.  And I was watching his YouTube, actually somebody else was and they sent me a link, watching  his YouTube channel and he found a DVC recorder and with it a handful of DVC Pro tapes of  the Call for Help show.  And I commented on his YouTube, I said, dude, that's how we recorded the show.  Those could be masters.  That's probably not a dub, that's probably a master.  Probably, yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, great to see you, David.  Thank you for joining us.  I don't know why I brought that up.  Also here, there's other things to talk about, believe me.  Amy Webb, CEO of the Future Today Institute, our favorite futurist.  Hi Amy.  Hey Leo.  She's just back from a 10 mile hike with the Girl Scouts or what is the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Scouting.  The Girl Scouts kind of tap out at some point and this is really about, this troop is amazing  and it's all about leadership and sort of being independent and building confidence  and it's really incredible.  The troop leaders are amazing.

Start time: 345.20
End time: 354.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We absolutely can.  I mean, this view right here is about 10 steps from my office on the same floor.  So I just move a few monitors and some cables and we're good to go.

Start time: 354.46
End time: 429.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to do it.  It's a deal.  April.  Yeah.  Yeah, Benito, we'll take you.  We will take you.  So what a week we have had.  It's not normal that I would have two stories vying for our lead, but there are two massive  stories and they are somewhat interlocking, I think.  There's of course the collapse of FTX and of crypto in general, and then the ongoing  pyre at Twitter.  Let's start with Twitter because we've been talking before the show and we all have strong  opinions about this.  The latest Twitter news is coming out.  And again, a lot of this news, who was it?  The Verge.  Somebody tried to contact Elon Twitter for a comment and the response was Twitter has  no communications department anymore.  So there's no way to really know if any of this is true or not.  But the latest seems to be true, which is that 4,400 contract employees were summarily  terminated this weekend.

Start time: 429.70
End time: 431.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's on top of the 50% that they dumped?

Start time: 432.86
End time: 459.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's on top of the employees.  So they dumped somewhere around 3,000 to 4,000 employees, many of whom have asked to come  back.  But then now the latest is these contract employees and it seems to be they didn't  tell them ahead of time.  They just disconnected their Slack, they disconnected their tools and disconnected their company  email because you know what, they're just contractors.  And of course they get no...

Start time: 460.00
End time: 461.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a security issue though.

Start time: 462.66
End time: 468.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they could send an email at the same time saying, we're terminating your contract.  They apparently neglected to do that.

Start time: 470.22
End time: 489.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could listen with the amount of animosity right now, I can absolutely...  If it was me, David should speak to this, but if I was the CISO or if I was the...  The CISO by the way quit.  Yeah, they don't have a CISO.  Well, I would have shut everything down first also.  I mean, it's not the humane nice thing to do, but it's the safe thing to do.

Start time: 489.78
End time: 512.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is by the way the process when people leave, the security department does a process  of closing accounts, removing access, things like that.  It's all identity management.  And if you're doing things that quickly, I don't see how you can physically shut that  many people down that quickly.  I don't know.  I don't see how that's possible.

Start time: 513.48
End time: 556.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, and I feel for anybody laid off, there were 11,000 layoffs at Meta this week also.  This is a tough time.  A lot of those employees, Meta handled it kind of dramatically differently than Twitter  handled it.  But it's hard to lose a job whether or not you get severance, whether you get health  care and so forth.  You're still out of work.  So according to Casey Newton on the platformer newsletter, contractors aren't being notified  at all.  They're just losing access to Slack and email.  Workers figured it out when their workers just disappeared from their system.  So there is normally some notification, even if it happens after the fact.

Start time: 557.72
End time: 581.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stripe is the good example, right?  So the Stripe also has some layoffs.  And in the middle of the catastrophe that was happening at Twitter and Meta, I think  that the letter that was published, they didn't sign it by the way, Stripe.  They signed it the names of the CEO.  Their actual names were signed and it was humane and honest.  And I think if it's got to be done, that's a much nicer way to do it.

Start time: 583.32
End time: 584.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do wonder though.

Start time: 584.26
End time: 602.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The big issue is the fact that they've they let go a huge chunk of infrastructure workers.  And according to some reports, they let go of some infrastructure workers in the middle  of changes.  That's a recipe for disaster for a company that has already let go so many of their engineers.  They don't know what most of the moving parts do.

Start time: 604.72
End time: 609.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So right now it's coasting on inertia.  You're actually watching the disaster unfold is what we're actually watching.

Start time: 609.24
End time: 651.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I add a disaster to this disaster because nobody's really talking about it yet.  So because of the inflation rate, there are a lot of companies that still have pensions  where people who are anywhere close to be like if you're close to retirement and you  do the math and it works out that you're going to if you put in those last two years of work,  effectively working for free.  Those people are taking early retirement and that's all happening between now and the end  of the month.  We are going to see tens of potentially tens of thousands of people who are retiring all  at once.  On top of all of these people who are now out of work, there's going to be disastrous  economic consequences that I don't think we're prepared for.

Start time: 652.16
End time: 676.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me ask David, because you you do cover CISOs.  How the CISO of Twitter departed?  He left with the head of trust, Joel Roth, who had been kind of tweeting and trying to  calm people down and the head of advertising and a number of executives and they all left.  Why at the same time?

Start time: 678.12
End time: 687.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well some were let go, some chose to go.  Both things.  I actually don't know specifically the reason why the CISO left, but I mean, I do.  We're kind of all talking about it here.

Start time: 688.12
End time: 795.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to know?  So there was an internal Slack message from an unnamed lawyer saying, internal in Twitter,  saying, look, we've lost all the compliance people.  We are under an FTC consent decree, which we've already paid more than $100 million  The consent decree says before Twitter rolls out any new feature, it has to be vetted for  security and you have to tell us the FTC what you're doing and how secure it is.  This message went out saying, we're very concerned because this compliance is now on the head  of engineering.  You are responsible for certifying the compliance to the consent decree of any new feature you  roll out.  There's no one above you to do it.  At which point there was a mass head for the exit because people don't want to be responsible  for that.  He quoted the de facto chief counsel, which is Elon Musk's personal lawyer, saying, this  is a man who launches rockets.  He's not scared of the FTC.  To which some reported, look, you've already been fined $114 million.  The next one's going to be another comma over.  That this is really serious.  Of course, the same day, President Biden, when asked about this, said, yeah, we're going  to keep an eye on this.  I think that part of the reason the CISO left is that there's some serious concern about  liability landing on his shoulders.

Start time: 796.12
End time: 880.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that is, by the way, the big discussion that's been happening among CISOs.  I'll rope in the Joe Sullivan Uber story as well.  When that broke and he was found guilty, all CISOs started to worry for themselves.  This became a big issue about getting an employment agreement when you take on the role of a CISO.  But there is no similarity, I believe, between Joe Sullivan and the CISO of Twitter who just  left.  There is none whatsoever here.  CISOs, we were talking about this on our show recently about burnout, about cybersecurity  professionals.  If you've got bad culture and unreasonable expectations, looks like the formula we got  here, that is cybersecurity burnout and that's why people leave.  It is like the magical formula that's happened at Twitter, so that's why you are getting  people burnt out and a mass exodus, not just of Elon's doing, but others choosing to go.  Because there's no question, to have Twitter on your resume and to be available in the  cybersecurity space right now, you will be snatched up immediately.  Every CISO we have on our shows, well, not every, I'll say almost every, is looking to  hire.  If you worked in cybersecurity and you were at Twitter, you will have no problem finding  another job.

Start time: 882.50
End time: 890.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me first of all correct myself, the CISO was a woman, Leah Kisner, so I apologize,  not he, she.  Leah Kisner-

Start time: 891.48
End time: 895.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, I'm sorry, take that back.  I think Leah is a male.  No, no, Leah is a woman.  Am I wrong?

Start time: 896.36
End time: 923.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I checked.  Oh, excuse my ignorance.  It could be, could be Leah, could be Leah.  I checked.  Chief Privacy Officer Damian Kieran, Damian Kieran, Chief Compliance Officer Marianne Fogarty,  all left at the same time.  Now I've got a story from Bloomberg from a few days ago in which Spiro, who's Elon's  lawyer said, Twitter has spoken to the FTC.  Its first compliance check is upcoming, but he said, don't worry, the legal department  is handling it.

Start time: 924.76
End time: 934.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't somebody, didn't one of the GCs send a slack or something to the remaining Twitter  employees-  Yeah, that's the one I was talking about.  Yeah.  About the whistleblowing.  Yeah.

Start time: 935.34
End time: 938.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty-  He said you should all become whistleblowers.  This is internal.

Start time: 939.82
End time: 951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't, I mean, wasn't it more like if you choose to disclose you are covered,  you should know that you are covered by, I mean, by the whistleblowing law in the United  States, wasn't it?  Yeah.

Start time: 952.08
End time: 952.53
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean-

Start time: 952.88
End time: 958.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was just reaching out and saying, you could have some personal liability here.  So don't do anything that you can sketchy about.

Start time: 958.80
End time: 972.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  That's a question I have.  Okay, so that's one question I've got for all of you, maybe David mostly.  So if you were chief privacy officer, compliance officer, CISO, do you assume personal liability  if something goes wrong or is that-

Start time: 972.36
End time: 982.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's the employment agreement that I was referencing earlier is, yeah, CISOs who  agree to that are making a huge mistake.  Right.

Start time: 983.00
End time: 987.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they would not have been per, I mean, they were leaving because they don't want to either  be a part of what's happening or they don't want to deal with the aftermath of what's

Start time: 987.60
End time: 1015.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  happening.  CISOs do not, and security professionals do not own risk, don't own cybersecurity risk  of the company.  Their job is to explain risk to the business leaders and it is for the business leader  to take on the risk.  So saying, if you do this and compliance is a perfect example of it because that is a  very known risk where there's a very clear financial loss that can be had if you are  not compliant.  I mean, it's clear as day right there.

Start time: 1015.84
End time: 1025.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there like a medical, you know, how there's malpractice?  Is there such a thing as malpractice in risk and compliance and security?  I mean, there's always some-

Start time: 1025.22
End time: 1029.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Malpractice, I don't know, but you could be bad at your job.  There's always something that's analogous to malpractice, right?

Start time: 1030.08
End time: 1059.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The company could say in the contract, we indemnify you against any judgments from the  FTC, but there's always a risk if the FTC sees that this employee knew that something  bad was happening and didn't do anything about it.  I don't care if the company indemnifies you.  I feel like that employee is somewhat at risk and has some responsibility.  Am I wrong?  David, you can't say, you know, it's not my fault.  Look at my contract.

Start time: 1059.76
End time: 1113.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, yeah.  So the job of the CISO is to communicate the risk situation like, okay, if we don't do  this, if we don't meet this compliance regulation or this regulation, which is a compliance  requirement, then you will be fined this.  It is very clear.  If we don't do this, you know, we don't have endpoint protection out here, then there's  a possibility someone's going to break in our network.  That's going to increase our risk levels here.  Are you aware of that?  And one of the big things CISOs do when they're explaining risk to the business is they say,  here's what the risk situation is for not doing this.  We can spend X dollars to reduce this risk.  Are you aware of that?  Do you want to spend that money?  As long as you know, I don't want to spend this money, then they have to sign off on  the risk.  That's a key thing.  They have to actually sign.  I acknowledge this is a risk.  Right.

Start time: 1114.12
End time: 1117.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's the re-per, okay, so fine.  What does that mean though?  If it turns out-

Start time: 1117.50
End time: 1122.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That means that it was communicated to them what the situation was.  Right.  But what's the repercussion is my point.

Start time: 1122.48
End time: 1215.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me read this thing.  By the way, this comes-  Well, it's just really a paper trail is what we're looking at.  This comes from Alex Heath at The Verge who says, we know who this person inside Twitter  is.  Obviously, we're not going to reveal that.  They looked at the Slack message and wrote this.  In a note posted to Twitter's Slack and viewable to all staff, an attorney on the company's  privacy team wrote, quote, Elon has shown- this is somebody inside.  Elon has shown his only priority with Twitter users is how to monetize them.  I do not believe he cares about the human rights activists, the dissidents, our users  in unmonetizable regions and all the other users who made Twitter the global town square  you've all spent so long building and we all love.  It says, he has heard that Alex Spiro, the current head of legal, says that Elon's willing  to take on a huge amount of risk in relation to this company.  Musk's new legal department is asking engineers- and this is a good question for you, David-  to quote, self-certify compliance with FTC rules and other privacy laws.  This is in that lawyer's note.  And the Verge checked and another employee familiar with the matter said the same.  And so at that point the lawyer said, if you're being asked to do anything you're uncomfortable  with, become a whistleblower.  If you were uncomfortable, you knew there was something bad, nobody upstairs was willing  to hear it or sign off on it, do that process, that orderly process you're talking about,  David, I think you have to go to the FTC at that point, don't you?

Start time: 1216.76
End time: 1227.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't just sit on it.  I mean, if you see someone being negligent, but also you may have NDAs that you've signed  as an employee.

Start time: 1227.64
End time: 1232.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but that's why you go whistleblower, because that obviates the NDA.  Yeah, I guess.

Start time: 1232.94
End time: 1238.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like there's no obligation other than maybe a moral obligation.  There's certainly a moral obligation, yeah.

Start time: 1238.54
End time: 1295.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the thing.  For example, one of the things we hear a lot from CISOs is, I'm not running the business,  it's my job to reduce the risk, communicate the risk, and do my best on that.  If someone chooses to do something that I don't agree with, it's not my responsibility  because I'm not running the business.  So I'm just communicating to them, but it's very, very important that they acknowledge  they understand it and they sign off on it.  Which I'm sorry, let's just get into the grander discussion of business.  Businesses are in the business, all businesses take on risk, not just cybersecurity risk,  there's all kinds of risk.  So they have to acknowledge it.  Some people are riskier investors than others.  You can't bring cyber risk down to zero, so you're willing to take certain risk in certain  areas to maybe open up the business to do other things.  And that is pretty clear.  That's what Elon is doing here.  He's taking on a lot of risks.

Start time: 1296.00
End time: 1298.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually think Elon is doing something different.  Oh, good.

Start time: 1299.38
End time: 1378.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he is.  Hold on, hold the thought because we're going to get to that.  I will hold it.  Because that's the next step.  We're just talking about all the horrible things that have happened and I don't want  to know why.  The final paragraphs of this lawyer's Slack message is, all of this is extremely dangerous  for our users.  Also given that the FTC can and will fine Twitter billions of dollars pursuant to the  FTC consent order, extremely detrimental to Twitter's longevity as a platform.  Our users deserve better than this.  I would guess this person's gone by the way, by now.  If you feel uncomfortable about anything you're being asked to do, call Twitter Ethics Hotline  or submit a report.  Please note the FTC's number is FTC Help.  You may also remember that Mudge reached out to whistlebloweraid.org.  I wish you all luck.  It's been an honor to work with all of you.  That is a career suicide note if I've ever heard one.  There have been, I have seen a lot of people warning the security status of Twitter is  now unknown.  That if you have, you should never have had anything private in your DM, but if you do,  erase your DMs, download your data.  Do you think there's cause for concern about the security of Twitter?  Robert?  Yes.

Start time: 1378.94
End time: 1418.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does anybody think not?  Absolutely.  This goes back to the FTC agreement.  I remember in the 2011 FTC agreement, in part B, this was the nuts and bolts part of the  2011 agreement.  It says that there has to be someone or someones who are specifically designated by name to  be accountable for, and accountable is a very important legal word for the information security  program.  There is no one like that at Twitter.  They have all quit.  So that means that the company is now in material breach of the 2011 FTC agreement.  If they are in breach of the 2011 FTC agreement, that means that you cannot count on them to  secure any of the data that they currently have.

Start time: 1418.72
End time: 1441.27

Transcript:  And if there's any question about how...  By the way, they can name, quote, any individual to quote be in charge, even though they don't  technically have a CISO anymore.  And by the way, that's interesting that you brought that up, Padre, because you will see  there's a lot of companies that have been around for a long time that are all of a sudden  getting their very first CISOs now.  Yes.

Transcript:  Senator Ed Markey.  So now let's get to the impersonation problem, because that's another thing that happened  this week.  Remember that...  Pretty humorous, I must say.  It was very funny.  Not to some.

Start time: 1454.66
End time: 1479.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was actually, some of it might have been funny.  Some of it was really catastrophic, especially if you were...  Oh yeah.  The Eli Lilly situation.  Well, yes, that also.  And but like Nintendo, which was interesting for five seconds.  Mario flipping off the customers.  Right.  But there were a lot of horrific images and that happened in the middle of the night for  Japan.  I talked to some of my friends there.  That was nothing that anybody was preparing for at like two o'clock in the morning.

Transcript:  So as we know, Elon says for eight bucks, you can buy a blue check, which prior to this  mid authentication, there was a lot of back and forth.  For a while, for like five minutes, Marques Brownlee tweeted, look, not only do I have  a blue check, but now it says that this is an official account.  I have a gray check.  And then Elon replied, no, not anymore.  That went away.  Apparently they put a hold on this.  You can still buy Twitter blue for 8.99, but you won't get a blue check.  They put a hold on that.  But in between those times, there were people impersonating, authenticated, impersonating  Elon, Kathy Griffin got booted off the platform for saying she was Elon.  Elon said, you can do this, but you have to say it's a parody account.

Start time: 1526.31

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the problem with parody, and this is the famous onion.  It's a new definition of parody.  Right.  Well, and this is also the famous onion pleading in the Supreme Court cases.  If it has to be labeled parody, that kind of takes some of the fun out of it.

Transcript:  Stephen Colbert had a joke about this the other day where he told the chicken across  the road joke, but set it up with explaining that he was about to tell a joke.  I'm about to tell a joke.

Start time: 1555.44
End time: 1631.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kills the joke, right?  Yes.  Tweeting, Senator Markey, the Senator Markey, a Washington Post reporter was able to create  a verified account impersonating me.  I'm asking for answers from Elon Musk, who's putting profits over people and his debt over  stopping disinformation.  He sent a letter to a Musk, of course, as senators like to do.  And then he tweeted, one of your companies, Elon, is under an FTC consent decree.  The photo safety watchdog, NHTSA, is investigating you for another company of yours for killing  people.  And you're spending your time picking fights online.  Fix your companies or Congress will.  To which Elon Musk replies to Senator Markey and the Washington Post, perhaps it's because  your real account sounds like parody.  That's not a smart way to respond to a senator.  No, it really isn't.  That's not a good idea.  But I understand.  You know what?  Again, from that point of view, Elon's basically a 13 year old and, you know, them's fighting  words.  I'm not going to take it.  So what's, if we covered everything, should we do more on the impersonation things?  Because this is crazy.

Start time: 1631.94
End time: 1656.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's just the whole, it violated the whole principle of the blue check.  Right.  By the way, Twitter has this long history of when people come up with a really bad idea  that everybody knows is a bad idea, they exploit it and it is exposed instantaneously.  Like I think about the Microsoft AI thing they did a while ago.

Start time: 1657.08
End time: 1659.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was more of a Microsoft problem to be fair than a Twitter problem.

Start time: 1660.22
End time: 1686.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it was a Microsoft.  But I'm just talking about problems in general that the community realizes are stupid.  So it always amuses me.  They're like, oh, I think we'll just do this and people will go along.  But if people don't like it and realize the fallacy in it, they'll prove very quickly  the fallacy like they did with what Elon did, like they did with the Microsoft AI situation.

Start time: 1686.56
End time: 1699.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the fake accounts was Eli Lilly.  Yes, this was a bad one.  Yeah, in which the fake account with an authorized blue check.  I think by now everybody knows the blue check is meaningless.  So this could only have been done.

Start time: 1700.42
End time: 1703.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I don't actually know that that's true.  Really?  I think that was part of the problem.

Start time: 1708.12
End time: 1727.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the challenge is that not everybody knew that.  And for one tweet that I think probably those of us listening to this recognized was not  true.  It moved the market and it didn't just move the market.  Explain to me what happened.  So there was a tweet from what looked like an authentic Eli Lilly account that said insulin

Start time: 1736.42
End time: 1739.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is now free.  It's gone now, so that's why I think it's not showing.

Start time: 1739.90
End time: 1789.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically it was like insulin is now free.  It was not taken down and it didn't sound official.  If that was true, you would usually see a press release and some more.  But again, we're talking about a wide sort of birth of people who may not be as savvy,  but it had a market impact.  So it was what, 3.4% or I forget what the actual amount was.  20 billion in market value.  It also had an impact on its competitors.  So that was Sanofi and Nova Nordisk.  So again, from my point of view, it seems that there is liability here because this  was an avoidable, this was a situation that Twitter caused.  And so again, I think the FTC is well within its rights to investigate.

Transcript:  Eli Lilly on their actual official account, which now has both a blue check and an official  check, we apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly  account.  Our official Twitter account is LillyPad, which perhaps is not the best Twitter handle  for an official account.  The fake one sounded more official.  It was Eli Lilly and company, right?  That was the hit.  Now, here's the thing.  I think the stock will come back.  Obviously it's bogus.  So that's not the issue.  The issue is it raised awareness that Eli Lilly is in fact price gouging on insulin.  And so there is-

Start time: 1834.46
End time: 1848.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a horrible thing that happened to a company that we would all agree probably needed  something horrible to happen to it, but that doesn't change the fact that this was a massive,  massive drop.  And yes, the stock is recovering, but it's still down 1.26% from where it was before  this happened.

Start time: 1849.81
End time: 1854.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the market's-  You have to look beyond the market though.  There's a long tail here.  Yeah.  And I don't think the market's done.

Start time: 1861.56
End time: 1872.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the market's done.  I think that they pretty quickly, any invest series investor knew that Eli Lilly was not  announcing that insulin is free now.  And if they did, they were quickly disabused of that.

Start time: 1874.70
End time: 1885.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It brought something to the public for that had been sort of overshadowed by other things.  And so now there's a public conversation yet again, which there should be by the way, about  the cost of insulin.

Transcript:  It's embarrassing.  Yes.  But this goes into a greater discussion.  And we talk about this a lot in security of you don't have to make a permanent, if you  want to cause damage, it doesn't need to be permanent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So big layoffs, lots of brain drain going on.  Elon not looking too serious.  Although I note, you know, in the first few days after he bought Twitter, he tweeted  three or four times at the norm, his normal rate.  He's really dropped off a lot.  Most of his tweets have nothing to do with Twitter all of a sudden.  Although he did tweet on Friday that all of this excitement has really increased engagement  on Twitter.  He said, well, it's really improved the number of posts on Twitter, which may be true.  I don't know.  It sounds a little like, you know, he protests too much.

Start time: 1980.92
End time: 1987.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 2000.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the big, the real problem for Twitter, if let's say they get past the FTC and a pissed  off Senator, the real problem is that advertisers don't want to be anywhere near this, right?  That's the, that's the.  Did you see he threatened the advertisers?

Start time: 2000.54
End time: 2004.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He goes, he was going to say he was going to go thermonuclear name and shame if they  cut off their advertising.  That's a guarantee that advertisers are going to lose their life.  What are you trying to do?  Who talks to their customers that way?

Start time: 2024.94
End time: 2030.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is in effect telling advertisers, I am a loose cannon and I can hurt your brand anytime.  I don't think that's what he's doing.

Start time: 2031.68
End time: 2047.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honestly don't think.  I think what he's doing is creating a situation.  So if any of you out there are, have employees, think about the process that you would use  to get rid of an employee who's underperforming.  You can't just fire them.  You know, I guess unless you're Twitter.

Start time: 2047.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You write them up, you create a paper trail.

Start time: 2048.68
End time: 2081.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to go through a process where you either, I mean, some companies sort of make  the circumstances such that they want to quit, right?  Or you, you have a whole long process of write-ups and things like that.  Is it plausible that given the weight of the investment and the total improbability  that any current financial model works out to pay that back, that he's creating the circumstance  where there is no alternative but bankruptcy so that he gets out of this whole thing and  Twitter dies permanently?  That would be my take.  My hot take.

Start time: 2082.06
End time: 2087.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So...  There was talk that he wasn't, that bankruptcy was, I think, a possible option.

Start time: 2087.00
End time: 2096.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, he told...  I think it is the only option.  It's inevitable.  But he said this at the all-hands.  Turning it into a payment platform doesn't make sense when there's plenty of...  This doesn't make sense.

Start time: 2098.64
End time: 2123.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I don't think that's why he did it.  I think he was...  Listen, I mean, again, let's go back in time.  I think this started out as a probably overconfident ruse that turned into what felt like a real  thing.  I mean, we're kind of seeing this pattern over and over again with powerful men, right?  And then it kind of became real and there was no way to walk things back.  And this seems to be the only way for him to get out of it at this point.

Start time: 2125.23
End time: 2129.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not a really good way to get out of it though, because I mean...  It is the only way to get out of it.  He's burning a lot of his personal wealth.

Start time: 2129.89
End time: 2133.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but he didn't want to be in it.  The problem was there was no way to get out without a lawsuit.

Start time: 2134.00
End time: 2145.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was...  Apparently...  I agree with you, Amy, that the original decision to buy Twitter was either a joke or...  I don't think it was a joke.

Start time: 2145.54
End time: 2155.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that there's a certain amount of highfalutin-bloviating that's happening right now among our tech oligarchs  who are running the show all over the place.  And this was kind of like...

Start time: 2156.64
End time: 2160.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was showing his tail feathers.  A little bit, yeah.  And then realized this was a bad idea.  And then it kind of got real.

Start time: 2160.82
End time: 2171.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no way to get out of it without a lawsuit, which was the whole like, all of  Twitter is bots, prove to me they're not.  This is a reason for me.  I've got grounds to not go through with the sale.

Start time: 2171.88
End time: 2173.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think he always thought...  Well, I can always get out of it.

Start time: 2175.80
End time: 2182.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, again, I would call them the sort of tech oligarchs think that they  can get in or out of anything.  I think that's part of how we got to know.

Start time: 2183.18
End time: 2216.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then for some reason really feared what was going to happen in the Delaware Court  of Chancery.  He was about to be deposed.  They had already revealed some embarrassing direct messages.  Probably he knew of others that were to come.  I'm wondering if he had some conversations with Mudge, Peter Zatko, the Twitter whistleblower  at some point that might have been incriminating.  So for some reason, which we don't fully know, he decided, I guess I have to buy it.  Do you think at that point he starts squirming and looking for ways?

Start time: 2216.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2217.64
End time: 2223.31

Start time: 2223.80
End time: 2229.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it?  I thought it was like...  I thought he put up the money, but I thought the real amount was closer to a billion.  Was it that much?

Start time: 2230.45
End time: 2242.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, it was a lot.  It was way, way more.  It was more than that?  So he borrowed 13, I think, billion from banks.  Those guys cannot be very happy at this point.  They're really exposed.

Start time: 2243.52
End time: 2245.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were really foolish for going in on this.

Start time: 2245.76
End time: 2273.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a mistake, right?  But he also got money from Larry Ellison, kicked in a couple of bill.  The Saudi sovereign fund, we don't know how much, but a lot.  So you're right.  Elon might not have been in for more than 13 or 14 billion.  If he declares bankruptcy, would it be chapter 11 reorganization?  Is that what you think?  Does he then get to put off the creditors?  He's got more than a billion dollar yearly annual interest.

Start time: 2274.60
End time: 2304.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So again, I think this is one of these things where if everybody, if the Saudi sovereign  wealth fund still wants to go out and have, I guess, not a beer, but some type of non-alcoholic  drink and sit around a bar because Elon's cool, then everything is copacetic.  I just don't think that's going to happen.  I think he is actually stuck.  I think he's actually stuck.  And the worse that the situation gets, the worse this becomes for his other holdings  from the other companies and their market cap.  This is a cascading cycle of apocalyptic hell.  Let me ask you a question, Amy.

Start time: 2308.00
End time: 2325.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I was just thinking about the sheer number of people that were let go.  What other company could function if they just one day got rid of half of their employees?  I'm talking any company over a thousand employees.  How do you function if half of your employees are gone?  And Samaritan, right?  Without a lot of...

Start time: 2325.92
End time: 2327.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there weren't that many to start.  They only had what?

Start time: 2329.92
End time: 2337.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so could this been all a plan like, well, I'm going to have to...  He was thinking bankruptcy before this.

Start time: 2337.96
End time: 2340.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm saying.  I think Elon is quiet quitting Twitter.

End time: 2354.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2355.48
End time: 2406.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So again, let's stop for a moment and forget about all the insanity that's happened.  If Twitter were to go away tomorrow, Twitter is not general purpose technology, right?  Like electricity.  The only way to calc...  What's the total valuation of the internet?  There's no way to calculate it but for in the reverse, right?  That's a general purpose technology.  That is not Twitter.  Twitter goes away tomorrow.  There's no meaningful economic impact.  There might be on the companies that are solely set up to serve Twitter and anybody who's  using OAuth and using Twitter to sign on, there might be hiccups.  Twitter goes away tomorrow.  There's no real problem.  There's no real infrastructure.  The user base isn't all that valuable because it's relatively small, right?  So again, who would buy it?  How do you monetize it?  There's no business worth saving.  That's a good point.

Start time: 2406.14
End time: 2409.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thousand years ago, I was talking to, I was wasting my breath on some news organizations  and saying that there's no way that this is going to monetize in the long run because  the, like, there's no model that I saw really working.  So Newsorg should buy it, turn it into a 21st century wire service, allow people to use  it as we currently do, but police some of the bots and other things and control more  of the advertising destiny.  We would, you know, collaborate to do that.  So I don't know.

Start time: 2458.28
End time: 2473.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's by the way, the people who are not moving off of Twitter include all the news  services.  They really, although Reuters now has a Macedon feed, but I think the news services don't  have anything anywhere they can go like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I'll tell you because we work with some of them and some others and I know that  there was a meeting among the largest foundations on whether or not they should all leave Twitter  or stay on, you know.

End time: 2516.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you got to, it's like, you got to stay where the news is breaking.  You just have to.  That's your job as being news.  Like when people complained about, you know, reporting on our president, I'm like, well,  he's the president.  You got to kind of report on that.  So it's kind of the job of news to where the news is breaking or where you can get that  information.  You have to gather it.  So a few organizations.

Transcript:  You have to remember you, everyone looks at the 1.3 billion users of Twitter and they  say, that's the big number.  So even if a million left, it's not really that big of a problem.  But you look at the revenue of Twitter, 92% came from advertisers of that 92% that came  from advertisers, 50 to 50 to 60% came from the United States content developed in the  United States.  So in the United States, you had about 38 million active daily users, 25% of those or  about 9 million generated the content of about 97% of that.  So 9 million users in the United States are responsible for roughly three quarters of  Twitter's revenue.  So if he's driven away a million of those, that is a huge hit.  That is unrecognizable.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mastodon is not a Twitter replacement.  It is not.  And it shouldn't be.  It's designed to kind of avoid some of the pitfalls Twitter offers, especially to disadvantage  people, people in the LBG2Q plus community.  They left Twitter a long time ago.  Frankly, because Twitter has always been kind of, last five years, been a toxic place.  It's really, so are we going to mourn the loss of Twitter, Father?

Start time: 2640.86
End time: 2680.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  My experience of Twitter was a lot different than some others because very early on I wrote  a bot that got rid of the worst signals from Twitter.  And it was very good at it.  It made Twitter a very useful place for me.  And it still is.  And yes, I'm on mastodon.  Yes, I'm trying out a couple of other social media services.  But Twitter was actually useful for me.  It wasn't just a place to broadcast thoughts.  I got some very interesting ideas from the people that I met in the communities that  I formed within Twitter.  So that is a unique forum that I do not think is duplicatable anywhere else on an existing  Internet property.

Start time: 2681.23

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  And I've used Twitter, again, since 2006 and along the way.  So early on, that's where my friends were.  And it was fun to have conversations in public, I guess.  But I was there for the links people were sharing pre-political, you know, Meyer.  And Jonathan Abrams, who I really respect, is always slightly too ahead of the curve.  He founded Friendster.  He also started something called Nuzle and use ZZEL, which was this awesome app that  you could set up.  If you had Twitter lists, once a certain threshold of people posted, accounts posted the same  link, you would get a notification.  So this is really, really great way.  I made like 200 private Twitter lists that were each about a specific topic.  It was a really great way to surface totally original signals that I just would not have  picked up on my own.  Actually, then Twitter bought it and turned it into blue and dumped it down and made it  terrible.  And I use Twitter to present.  I used to have the script running in Keynote.  And anytime I gave a Keynote presentation somewhere, I would sort of have a back channel  of me talking while I was talking on stage.  And it would tweet out the links.  I would try to think ahead of what somebody might stop when I was talking to look up on  their own.  I would tweet it while I was saying it.  It's like those other utilities that I really miss.  And I miss, yeah, it's a different place than it was.  And I'm sort of ready to let it go.

Transcript:  I mean, these things, listen, I think all of this thing, I'm a futurist,  but we look backwards twice as much as we look forwards.  We sort of go in cycles of things.  So we've got social media that are kind of imploding.  I think we're in a period of social distortion where we're sort of spreading out again and going into different directions.  But at some point years down the line, there will be consolidation again.  So the mastodon may be decentralized,  but there will still be a consolidation of players in the market as there is with every single industry over and over again.

Transcript:  There is an interesting tangent to this.  You heard about the senior director of engineering got caught sending out a slack that is just tone deaf.  No. Do tell.  So Luke Evans-Simon, he is the senior director of engineering at Twitter, sent out a slack saying, I'm going to quote this,  This is going to be the challenge.  The engineers I am bringing back, the ones he fired and then rehired, are weak, lazy, unmotivated, and they may even be against an eel on Twitter.  They were cut for a reason.  So we need to think of these people as just needing to be around until the knowledge transition is completed.  Imagine sending that out on a company slack to the people who are going to read it and say, yeah, I'm going to be as slow as possible.  I'm not motivated to work for you.

Start time: 2971.92
End time: 2994.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wait a second. Let's pause for a moment on that.  So that really went out, yes?  That really went out.  So you bring those employees back and you call them lazy.  Yep.  Was that posturing though?  Half of those employees are going to design back doors into their software so they can hack it later when they're dumped again.  Well, if I was employed-  They just opened up a Pandora's box of problems.

Transcript:  So some of them, I understand, have to come back because they weren't-  In order to avoid the Warren Act, Elon, who originally wanted just to fire him without severance and no notice, realized he had to give him 90 days of continued salary.  Those people are still getting paid.  And so it's easy to call them back because they never really left.  And if they don't come back, then you can say, well, then you're not getting your 90 days.  Now you've quit.  So you might wonder, well, why would anybody come back after being fired?  Well, that's why.

Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology and HPE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  WWT is at the forefront of innovation, working with clients all over the world to transform their businesses.  And I have to tell you, because we went out and saw it right before COVID in March of 2020.  Lisa and I went out to St. Louis and saw their Advanced Technology Center.  And this thing is a mind blowing, amazing thing for anybody to have.  Anybody.  The ATC is a research and testing lab with more than half a billion dollars of equipment from all the OEMs that you might deal with.  Why did they build this?  I mean, they've been building it for a decade.  This is in many buildings, rack after rack of incredible gear.  Well, they built it at first for their own engineers so they could test products, integrate solutions, roll out solutions.  It would reduce their evaluation time for new technologies by from months to weeks.  They could spin up proofs of concept and pilots.  It was a great way for WWT engineers, for the WWT team to understand the technologies that they're working with.  But they've done something that is really incredible.  They have opened it up to all of you.  Anybody on the WWT platform can access the ATC.  You don't even have to go to St. Louis to do it.  They offer hundreds of on demand and scheduleable labs you can do from anywhere in the world at any time of the day or night.  Like HPE's Data Services Cloud Console Lab.  These labs represent the newest advances in every area of enterprise technology, multi cloud architecture, security, networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics, AI, even things like DevOps, process, and so much more.  This has been a great boon for WWT internally, but now it's available to everybody.  With the ATC, you can test out products and solutions before you go to market.  You can access technical articles, expert insights, demonstration videos, white papers, hands on labs, all the tools you need to stay up to date with latest technology.  Here's the key. WWT is a partner.  They're a partner and they want their partners to succeed.  And that's why they offer you these great tools.  It's not just a physical lab space in St. Louis.  It's a completely virtual lab that you can access anywhere in the world 365 days a year.  And it's free. All you have to do is be a member of the ATC platform.  That's not the only thing WWT does.  We went out there and marched and we did an event.  It was so much fun.  Mary Jo Foley came out with us.  Make sure you check out WWT's events and communities.  Lots of stuff going on there.  Learn together about the technology trends.  Hear the latest research and insights from the WWT experts because they are your partners in this.  Whatever your business need, WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested tailored solutions.  WWT brings strategy and execution together to make a new world happen.

I mean, I've only been a minor user of Twitter for the last three or four years.  But nobody here's leaving, which is interesting.  Amy Webb, CEO of Future Today Institute.  Did you predict this would...  It's really not Twitter.  It's social media.  Look at Facebook's valuation.

Start time: 3431.21
End time: 3447.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, again, there are cycles that every industry goes through.  And from my point of view, we were at the sort of zenith of the cycle.  And so it makes sense what's happening right now.  Maybe uncomfortable.

Start time: 3448.76
End time: 3474.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amy, can I ask you a quick question about cycles right there?  When things don't have much of a history or things are changing so rapidly,  what do you use to predict?  And I know I'm being super vague, but the reason I bring this up is because one topic that comes up with us is cyber insurance.  And I'm like, Jesus, that changes so drastically.  It's not like the industry has decades of information like actuarial tables, like auto insurance.  Oh, no.

Start time: 3476.10
End time: 3483.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually do a ton of work in insurance, and those actuarial tables have pretty much not been updated in the past century.  So, no, they're still trying to sort things out.

Start time: 3483.92
End time: 3493.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what do you do when the history is either so drastically changing you can't see a pattern?  What is it that you do?

Start time: 3494.13
End time: 3590.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can always see patterns.  The issue is making sure we're seeing evidence and data backed patterns and not ones that we're seeing because of our own bias.  But we actually don't make predictions.  So I didn't we would not say that we would predict something would happen on such and such a date or by such and such time.  Right. Right.  You're showing trends more.  Yes.  So we build models, evidence based models, sometimes primary, second.  Yeah.  I don't want to get into the weeds because it would bore that out of everybody who's listening.  But yeah, even when there are so what social media is 15 ish, maybe a little bit longer, 18 years old, we could say.  It's every industry or micro industry moves at a different speed and trajectory.  And we're just one of the biggest signals we look for is consolidation.  So consolidation over time tends to attract regulatory scrutiny and all the other stuff that comes with it.  And either that micro industry survives because there's no there's nothing else or there's an implosion and something else happens.  So a good analogy here would be drug stores in the United States.  CVS may have incredible technology, but it is it doesn't it does not care about customers at pharmacies.  And so the tech might be great, but the user experience is horrible.  But there's nowhere else to go, which is what left the opening for Amazon, because it's there's so much market consolidation, it would be so challenging to set up a competitor that, you know, so we've got like two or three in the market.  That one continues to hold social media didn't.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's more than that, actually.  There's a bunch that I just have forgotten about.  It was I mean, it was a very interesting platform from the very beginning.  It was very friendly to writing bots and I was experimenting.  And it was that thing where I would create an account and forget about it and create another account.  I did that for three or four years.  Yeah, you're going to find a lot on Twitter social.

Transcript:  Twitter social is it's actually perfect.  And I've hit the inflection point.  So, you know, I may have what 45,000 users on Twitter and only 2000 on mastodon.  But the engagement I'm starting to get from mastodon is getting very close to the engagement for the same topics on Twitter.  So that's yeah, that's good.  That's good.

Start time: 3651.32
End time: 3690.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me, the lesson and I also take this lesson from the collapse of FTX is that centralization, Amy, you'd probably be good to talk about this.  It's not always a good idea.  Certainly, it's the kind of the way capitalism works because that's how you capture values by centralizing it, siloing it and selling it.  But for end users, I don't know if centralization is the right thing.  Of course, that is the complaint people who don't want to leave Twitter have as well.  But I like all the people I can follow and talk to on Twitter.

Start time: 3691.34
End time: 3706.18

Start time: 3706.86
End time: 3714.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Maybe if we're bridging to sort of the exchanges, the crypto exchanges, you know, listen, I don't think our central banks, I'm not sure what the Fed is.  I don't know that I agree with what the Fed has been doing.  But I also don't know that completely unfettered exchanges where you have a handful of people making the liquidity.  I don't want to get like super in the weeds on this, but we should not be in the place that we are right now.  And this is no longer an experiment that's happening during COVID.  There's real money being lost.  That's a good point.  Like significant real money for people.  And again, if we play this forward, you put somebody in dire economic circumstances without in our current economy with the current inflate, like with all of the other variables that are not playing to our favor.  This this is where you have a vulnerable population that decides to, you know, we've seen we've seen how this has happened throughout history and it has typically not gone well.  So that's what I'll say.

Start time: 3785.00
End time: 3836.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting.  I, you know, I maybe because I'm not a good capitalist.  I'm not good at marketing.  I'm not good at, you know, if I like the idea, for instance, on our mastodon, I don't really want to promote it.  I just kind of like it better if it's grows natively and it doesn't need to be big.  I don't want to get big.  Getting big sometimes is not a is I understand from a capitalist point of view, from an industrial point of view, getting big is a secret to economies of scale.  It's where you really get the big money.  I kind of like not getting big.  Mastodon is more like having a cottage garden.  Well, I'll tell you, it's not as efficient as having a giant, you know, 15 million acre beet farm.  But it's kind of more personal and more satisfying.

Start time: 3837.54
End time: 3852.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all about niche and getting to your very specific audience, which is very much evidenced here.  I mean, we don't have enormous audiences, but I like very desirable for our specific audience.

Start time: 3861.14
End time: 3888.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And so again, like that, that is a better situation for potential advertiser.  The challenge with advertisers on platforms right now is you kind of don't know where your ads are going and you don't have clear metrics on anything like it.  If I had an opportunity to talk to 2000 people about something that was aligned with whatever it is that I'm working on and I was going to do it in a way that they appreciated, that's the best possible advertising there is.

Start time: 3888.82
End time: 3911.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't even have to be that large.  I mean, this is one of the things we talk about when people like start out doing podcasts and they get very depressed because they see download numbers over 100 or 200 people.  But if you just take a moment and say, what if I had 100 or 200 people just in a room listening to me?  Right.  That's plenty.  Yeah.  That's really powerful.  And if you just think about that.

Start time: 3911.82
End time: 3927.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if it's the right 100 or 200 people, that's all you need.  I mean, honestly, that is Twitter.  Twitter's user base is pretty small relative to the global population.  It just happened to be a concentration of media people and that's a good point.  It's not Facebook, is it?

Start time: 3930.52
End time: 3966.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Twitter's user base had an advantage over some of the other social media platforms and that is the user base tended to be a bit more educated and it tended to be a little wealthier.  I think the last stat I saw was 87% make more than 30,000 a year, 40 some percent make more than 75,000 a year and something like 15% make more than 100,000 a year.  So if you're an advertiser and you're looking for your niche, that platform that has fewer users but has more of the users that you want is a better buy.

Start time: 3968.06
End time: 3976.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Well yeah, it's Patreon.  That's Twitter.  Remember Patreon was the 1,000 loyal listeners.  That's all you really need.  You get that and anything else is gravy.  If you get the 1,000 people who really want to hear what you have to say, who are willing to give you that dollar a week or dollar an episode.

Start time: 3991.82
End time: 4005.35

I think it was driven by the desire to reach a mass audience so you could sell it to advertisers as opposed to what people really needed or wanted.

Transcript:  David Gales, yeah.  And still very much is, especially in Latin and South America.  But scale is everything.  It has like our modern business in the US especially has been built on scale and financialization, meaning you want to get to the biggest possible numbers that you can and then the rest of the, you want to achieve non-organic growth is kind of how we got to now.  And I don't think that's the best way to do things.  It just became the way that we do things.

Yeah.  And that was critical to building his audience.  Yeah.  And I would say we spend kind of close to that too.  Yeah.  It's, you got to spend a lot of time engaging with your audience directly.  Jack Welch.

Transcript:  You know, Leo, scale gives you one very important thing.  The larger social media platform is, the easier it is to drive interactions without rage.  Right.  At scale, the rage machine is amazing.  You can get so many engagements, you can get so much spread by bringing up something that makes people upset.  And then you can spin out your rage.

Transcript:  Exactly.  This is parallel theory.  The internet is a speed from bad to worse.  It's like, how can I say the worst thing possible, the quickest, faster than anybody else?  We've seen this with how people sort of do this pile on of like, you know, I hate this person, I want to hurt this person, I want to kill this person.  I'm like, boom, boom, boom, that fast.

Transcript:  The greater number of connections, if I go into a Macedon instance and I just start spewing out rage, I am going to get blocked so quickly because people are going to say, I don't want to hear this.  This is nothing to do with what we're discussing.  I do that on Twitter.  I'm still going to get people blocking me, but I will find a big enough critical mass of people who share the same rage and will amplify it.  So that happens on large instances that doesn't happen on small ones.

Transcript:  It was fast inorganic growth and a lot of, so organic growth would be developing new products and services and growing that market over time.  Inorganic growth tends to happen through M&A.  So you're buying up competitors or other companies and you're trying to sort of spin up your P&L to appease the market.  And, you know, that's a risky, dangerous game.  But typically that happens when you're also cutting way back on staff, on services, on people.  There's a terrific, there's a terrific chapter of that book on GE, on Boeing and how Boeing got sort of gutted and the history of, you know,  and the history of really like great R&D in Boeing, you know, was sort of blown apart.  So I think we have this tradition in the US of scale up, scale up, do less, you know, get rid of as many people as you can, divest in your talent pipeline.  You know, there's a lot of that happening and that's also the sort of playbook for a lot of a lot of companies that get consulting from a particularly large consulting company based in the United States.  I won't say who it is, but that's kind of their playbook.  And all of this is about driving up share prices as much as humanly possible.  But then that's a great short term game, gain.  And it's good for the market in the very near term.  But that is it produces just disastrous results down the road.  Now, I don't know if Elon himself has been a recipient of any of this advice or if any of the tech companies have been recently, but they seem to be following at least in parts of those models.  Yeah.

Transcript:  What about Meta? What about Facebook?  54% of the 11,000 laid off were in business positions.  But the other 46% were technology roles.  That's a lot of technologists to lay off.  If he let me ask you, they decided to kill.  They've decided to kill portal.  They're smart display division.  They decided they had smartwatches in development.  They decided to kill that.  I'm not saying Facebook or Meta is a very well run company because a lot of what's going on right now is Mark pivoting to a very speculative investment into.  Virtual reality.  So I used to think he was a real smart guy.  What happened?

I have a question and I don't know if you've been tracking this specifically, but he seems to be betting Zuckerberg betting a lot on virtual reality.  What is your understanding of how big that market's getting and growing?

Transcript:  Oh, the demand?  Zero.  I don't see any, but there's none of the, I mean, that I know of.  There aren't any with the exception of maybe DOD, but like there's no real investment.  There's a lot like marketing departments are very excited about metaversal technologies and XR.  There are a lot of anthropomorphic chat bot type of things that are being built.  You know, to me, this feels a lot like the days of Foursquare when everybody threw money at badges because they thought gamification was the next big thing and they followed the wrong trend.  They followed the shiny, not the infrastructure.  Always follow the infrastructure.  That's what matters most.

Transcript:  Well, I was not in the room where it happened, right?  So I don't know the conversations that are happening.  But as an outsider, I see two plausible reasons.  There's probably others, but you know, one is I think at some point if you have consolidated enough wealth and power, I think you start to think, hey, I'm going to be the guy that does blah, like X, right?  And through sheer force of my will, it shall be.  So I don't know if it's that or if it's Facebook was facing some significant and I think warranted regulatory challenges.  And maybe this was a pivot away from that.  I'm sure there's other plausible reasons, but those would be the two from my vantage point.

I was sweaty.  I was dizzy.  I had to go sit down for about an hour.  So there's something about my brain that just will not let it go with VR.  It just knows it's not right.

This is OnLogic, is the name of the company,  and they make the greatest little hardened computers  for industrial and other challenging environments.  This is one of the, I think, the trends that's changed the world.  Computing has moved from a thing on your desktop to computers everywhere,  and that's where these OnLogic computers are showing up, everywhere.  The world of hidden computing that's revolutionizing every area,  sustainable agriculture, smart cities,  the Assym on the factory floor, increasing manufacturing efficiency,  operating robots, improving the quality of our lives.  That's where you'll find these OnLogic Distinctive Orange,  Industrial and Embedded Computers.  OnLogic is the first choice in industrial computing for innovators around the world  who are looking for computing power that can survive and thrive  where traditional hardware is just going to choke and die.  OnLogic designs and creates computer solutions that can fit in the palm of your hand,  while powering everything from advanced robotics and AI  to manufacturing automation, digital media solutions,  smart agriculture technologies.  These are engineered for reliability.  For instance, this baby, and you can tell because of the fins,  these guys are passively cooled,  so they don't have any fans that eliminates any moving parts.  There are no moving parts at all, which makes this a solid-state device  perfect for an environment where there's lots of vibration or shock.  You can also get them sealed,  so they're completely protected from dust and other airborne contaminants,  other design features.  They're all different ones for different uses, obviously.  Other design features and specialized components protect systems  from extreme temperatures or interference.  This is such a cool idea.  If you're looking for a computer that can live in the most challenging environments,  check out OnLogic.  OnLogic systems are extensively tested to operate reliably wherever they're needed  whether monitoring a remote mining operation.  You might even see one, I hope you don't, on a crash cart at a hospital.  The team at OnLogic truly cares about creating right-fit technologies  tailored specifically to solve your challenges.  So get in touch, tell them what you need.  They partner with great companies.  For instance, they have an AWS IoT Greengrass compatible computers vetted by AWS,  so you know you've got the peace of mind.  It's going to work right out of the box.  So if you're doing a Greengrass solution, this is awesome.  They work with these companies to enable rapid evaluation,  deployment of edge computing solutions based on technology from companies like AWS.  If you need a computing solution that can easily be configured to your particular needs,  supported by industry experts,  they're just a phone call, website chat, or email away.  Tell them about your difficult environment.  And by the way, they're delivering these quickly.  You don't have to wait.  The team at OnLogic is here, ready to design, build, and get you the hardware you need.  To get started, learn more about OnLogic's 30-day risk-free hardware trial,  onlogic.com slash twit.  Maybe you've never heard the name, but now you know.  And I'll tell you, if you ask somebody who's working in these kinds of environments,  they know, onlogic.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting twit.  We're not getting these back.  We could think of all sorts of things.  This one's got, I don't know why, it's got one, two, three, four, five, six Wi-Fi buttons on it.  I don't know what that's for.  And then all these LEDs, and it's got three display ports.  It's got like two 10 gigabit ethernet ports.  It's got breakouts for a bus, so you can access a data bus directly.  Very cool.  Very cool.  Onlogic.com slash twit.  Thank you, OnLogic, for supporting the show.  All right, we got to talk about FTX, because this is another drama.  Oh, wait a minute, before I do, though, this just in on Twitter.

Transcript:  I haven't checked on that.  I cashed out a huge chunk of the Dogecoin so that I could invest in other cryptos.  And then when it started dipping south, I cashed it out and I've just got it in a holding  account right now.  So I'm not affected by the dip at all.  I'm just watching it just in horror for the people who are now stuck with tens or hundreds  of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency that will probably never hit.

Transcript:  I was experimenting with Dogecoin that I mined for fun.  Back in the early, early days, I was one of the very first miners and I got a couple  million, which became some real money just a couple of years ago.  And then I sold that and started investing in some others and made some money there.  But, you know, I said this on another twit.  Cryptocurrency is great as a speculative investment, but you should not fool yourself into thinking  that it's actually anything.  It's not held up by anything.  So you need to be ready to lose absolutely every dollar.  It is held up by marketing.

Transcript:  It's crazy.  All right.  So let's cover the thing that's...  So you may remember the Super Bowl last year.  A guy named Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm, did a very nice, a very funny ad for a little  company called FTX in which Larry was, you know, through the ages, he was in the ancient  times, he said, the wheel, it's no good.  You can eat a bagel.  You can't eat a wheel.  And then he downplays the fork, the toilet, every invention.  And finally, the modern times, he's sitting at his desk and some guy says, let's talk  about cryptocurrency.  And Larry says, it's not going anywhere.  And then the tagline for FTX, remember that name, don't be a Larry.  Or maybe you remember Matt Damon doing an ad for crypto.com, as it turns out.  Fortune favors the brave, you know, the Wright brothers, the moon landing, you should buy  some crypto.  Or maybe you remember Tom Brady and his model wife, Giselle Bunshin, with their phone saying,  Tom saying, I'm going to make a trade on FTX.  And Giselle saying, oh, how exciting.  All these celebrities promoting cryptocurrencies.  So what happened to FTX this week?  It went from $19 billion in assets to zero.  Sam Bankman Fried, who was on the cover of Fortune magazine as the next great, I don't  know, technology savior.  Apparently, if he had been doing with FTX, been doing the same thing with real money,  he'd be in jail by now.  He had created FTX as a, and correct me if I'm wrong, Robert, because you're the expert  on this, as a crypto exchange, place you would store your crypto or trade your Shiba Inu.  For some for some Doge or whatever.  But at the same time, he founded a trading company called Alameda Research, which was  funded by tokens, FT tokens from FTX.  Correct.

Start time: 5601.84
End time: 5727.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think honestly, it was a little feud between him and another big crypto exchange, Binance,  run by a Chinese.  Well, we don't know exactly, right?  But the CEO is a founder, I think is Chinese.  Binance, it kind of somehow, I think it was on Twitter even, somehow impugned FTX.  And people said, you know, I'm going to get my money out of FTX.  A run in the bank, $6 billion later, they had to freeze assets because they didn't have  reserves to cover the run.  At that point, everybody went a little bit crazy.  FTX had earlier this year, Sam, Sam is smart guy.  He bought, burnished his image.  He became famous for effective altruism, implied that he was giving away a lot of money.  He was worth at one point, I think $19 billion.  He bailed out Robinhood.  When Robinhood kind of got underwater, he came in and said, well, here, we're going to give you some FT.  And we'll bail you out.  He did the same thing for BlockFi.  When they were starting to have some trouble, he was really the white knight.  Everybody thought this is the guy who understands crypto.  Who knows how to make it work?  Who doesn't make it fly?  Now apparently he's in custody in the Bahamas because he was fleeing to Dubai.  The money is gone.  His net worth has gone down below zero.  And there are a lot of FTX wallet holders who are out of luck, just like BlockFi, which also froze withdrawals this week.  Binance was going to swoop in like a white knight.  And then, and I swear to God, I think they planned this.  They said, oh, yeah, we'll save him.  And then they said, oh, wait a minute.  We just looked at the balance sheet.  No, no, we don't want anything to do with it, which immediately created the whole thing.  Putting a competitor out of business.  So, Robert, what's your take on all this?  Was Sam Bankman freed a Bernie Madoff or a genius?

Start time: 5729.93
End time: 5736.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5738.82
End time: 5854.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what this is.  Because, OK, he was trying to set himself up as I think you nailed it.  He wanted to be the white knight.  He was going to be the one who would show that it was possible to create a professional exchange and just make money from the fees.  In fact, it was making so much money that he was able to bail out fellow trading sites and services.  But as it turned out that the only profits he was making was off of the trading that he was doing with customer funds,  which worked fine as long as the market continued to go up.  All of these stories are the same.  As long as the market continues to go up, he kept getting enough profit from that illegal trading to be able to make the business look reputable.  The moment that it dipped and we started to lose market, there was not enough money to cover the customer funds by far.  And when Binance came in and they looked at the books, the one thing that people heard was misallocation of customer funds.  That kills an exchange instantly.  It always has and it always will.  Because then they realized the exchange is not playing on the up and up with the trading, with the tokens that it has been entrusted.  And once it does not have the trust of the token holders, every token, because of the nature of cryptocurrency, can be withdrawn immediately.  So the only option is to immediately halt all trading.  Imagine this.  This is a run on the bank on steroids without even the waiting period to go down to the bank to close your account.  And the entire crypto community looks at FTX and it's kind of resigned at this point.  We know this is happening.  We know it's going to happen a lot more.  There are other exchanges that are going to go under.  And everyone is just hoping that theirs will hold out long enough for crypto to go back up so they can get some of their investment back out.  That's a terrible idea.  Get out now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, listen, almost 100 years to the day, it's what 20?  It's been almost 100 years, October 29th crash, still the largest sell off of shares in US history.  Because of trust and confidence, any exchange exchanges only work when they're not hyper volatile and the volatility is tied directly to consumer and customer confidence and trust.  So we're going to continue to have liquidity events.  I don't care who's running it or how much they how much they're promising to do altruistically.  That's one variable that's outside of everybody's control.  And by the way, once you introduce bots or once you introduce bad actors who start seeding mistrust, you know that that run on the bank that Padre just talked about happens faster and there's no way to stop it.  Right. So this is what I was talking about earlier.  We have very long tail challenges ahead of us.  And the technology is on a developmental track that's just going faster than our current regulatory track.  By the time those decisions get made, it's too late.  So I'm not usually a fan of like regulating upfront and I'm not saying we should do that here either because it stifles innovation.

But one of the things that we've learned is that the very institutions designed to to keep us all afloat and to trust are the ones that are causing problems at the same time that these new exchanges that are totally decentralized or whatever causing problems.

Transcript:  I think it's important to separate the technology infrastructure from the business model supporting it because I will say there's some interesting applications here when it comes to privacy.  So there's there's a way now to create an NFT for your genome, for example, and grant permissions so you can license out parts of your genome for let's say, renumeration by a pharmaceutical company, but without giving them indefinite rights to it.  So the technology is interesting, but so far the business models are totally there's nobody minding the store, right?

Start time: 6051.59
End time: 6161.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like that was in addition to these guys being scammers.  They took advantage of the fact that the technology is somewhat confusing to do a lot of hand waving.  And I really I hear it all the time.  Other underlying technology is interesting.  Blockchain is just a distributed database.  That's all.  It's not magic.  Cryptocurrency is is just, you know, fiat currency managed on a blockchain.  And I'm not sure that that gives it any real benefit.  Unfortunately, part of the way this was sold, and I think, again, I feel like this is criminal.  Maybe it wasn't.  Maybe it was with the best intentions.  But part of the way it sold is, well, there are a lot of people who the banking system disenfranchises in third world nations in the poor people in ghettos.  So Jay-Z created a school to teach young black children, poor black children about cryptocurrency because it's somehow magically going to re-enfranchise them.  And if it didn't and it doesn't, and I'm not saying Jay-Z knew better.  Maybe I'm not saying he was a con man, but I think he was probably conned because the technology there's a lot of hand waving on the technology.  But really, underneath all this, it was a Ponzi scheme.  It was a very traditional, old fashioned scheme, a scam.  And unfortunately, the promise of this technology fooled people.  And that makes me mad because that is a really horrific misuse of technology.  And it's going to make more people bitter about technology, too.  I think they played off the fact that nobody really understood it.  In fact, they intentionally made it obscure.  OK, I'm done. I'll get off my soapbox.

But there were a lot of people who jumped on this bandwagon as a way to make a quick buck, unfortunately, and it tarnishes it.  Tim Berners-Lee said Web 3 is not the Web.

What Sam Bankman-Freemage was doing was similar to what a lot of people in crypto do, which is moving stuff around to make it look like.  For instance, a lot of NFTs are bought by the same person who made the NFT to kind of pump up the value.  I think a lot of Bitcoin bros were throwing their money into FTX.  So probably a lot of the people who lost money were playing with the house money anyway.

And the reason that they got excited, they were excited at the high part of the risk, the part that you can get a huge return.  Guess what?  When you were looking at risky things, there is not only a high part, there is also a low part.  We're now seeing the low part.

But I think the point is, I don't think a lot of people saw it as a risky.  Matt Damon told them it was OK.  Matt Damon said it's OK.  I don't think a lot of people understand that it is a risk, especially when you have famous football players that you really admire, seemingly endorsing whatever it is.  Let's not forget, and let me harp on American education for two seconds.  It's not as though we teach kids coming up in our schools, regardless of the school, basic financial skills, basic statistics, like enough math to understand probabilities.  So I think we're dealing with a lot of people who were feeling excited and believed in the marketing.  And I genuinely do not think they understood risk, and especially when it comes to Robin Hood, which literally sounds like a good, safe play.  I don't think we can entirely blame the consumer here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I do know the process to short anything is extraordinarily challenging.  To me, it's a little bit like playing craps, which is the only game that I play when I'm in Vegas.  In order to make any actual money, you have to have time, and you have to have a lot of cash on the table to make that work.  And you have to be able to do math, and you have to be able to sort of do that over a long period of time.  There's like two ways to short a stock.  One is you have to be Dr. Manhattan, like stop time, see what's coming in advance, and pick the day that something bad will happen, and then make sure that you get your money out first.  You still have to have $500,000 to make that work.  It only works if you're a hedge fund, basically.

In fact, two-thirds of traditional hedge funds, not crypto hedge funds, two-thirds of traditional hedge funds are invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum.  I have to think those hedge funds are hurting at this point, right?  And they're doing it with direct but also futures, options.  They're doing derivatives as well.  Derivatives is another, by the way, great example of something that was so complicated nobody understood it except a handful of quants on Wall Street.  And there are people who really lost their shirt when the derivatives market crashed because they didn't understand what they were investing in.  So I don't want to blame people who lost money in crypto.  Yes, it was risky, but nobody was telling them it was risky.  I was telling them it was risky.  I'm saying it's I would say it's stay out for more than a year.

Because they knew that the number one currency in the crypto game is some sort of legitimacy.  So, for example, if a crypto market exchange has bought the naming rights for a sports arena or if they are on the side of an F1 car,  people will see that they'll say there's obviously money there.  So therefore it must be safe.  So, yes, you and I may look at that and say, no, this is a super high risk investment.  But they're going to say if I saw it on the news, if I saw it on Netflix, if I saw it on the arena the last time I went to go watch the Warriors play,  then it can't possibly be a scam.  Yeah.

Transcript:  But this gets back to the original premise that the value that it has, the only value it has, because it doesn't, isn't backed by anything.  The value it has is how much marketing it has, what it associates with, and the amount of news that comes out.  That's why there's so many news outlets that are about cryptocurrency and there's so much advertising that's going on,  because that is how they can keep their value high.  If all of a sudden they stopped advertising, there was no more news, it would all crash.  Yes, of course.

So, very long story short, when Russia did its thing and US levied sanctions, this gave the world an alternative.  It showed the rest of the world just how strongly the dollar is tied to decisions that are being made, and it gave China an opening.  China's digital yuan is backed by the government.  So again, there's different types of crypto and different types of exchanges.  So the freewheeling ones we have in the West may crash and burn, but the ones that are being developed elsewhere that are CBDCs or backed in some other way by the government,  that actually poses a little bit of a geopolitical threat.

It's not tied to anything.  It's a fiat currency, but that doesn't necessarily...  I mean, I think people would trust a digital dollar or a digital yuan, but that's not what we're talking about when we're talking about buying Bitcoin.  Just trust in exchanges?

People were saying, I want to invest in crypto.  So they created an instrument to do that.  There are a lot of exchanges, too.  If the audience demanded it, they have to deliver a product.  Their customers demanded it.  That's the problem.  I think you can't just say, well, it's an ignorant investment.  You should never have done it.  You should have known it was...  I mean, who's buying cartoon apes?  That's obviously stupid.  You know why people do it?  Because they think they're going to make money on it.  They think, well, it's hot right now, so I'm going to buy it low and sell high.  Maybe it's greedy.  Weaponized FOMO.

I don't know if you could say that he has crossed the threshold.  Correct.  Now, he's done a lot of really other shady things.  Like, for example, just was it yesterday they found out that he had a 10-year, the director of the car division of Tesla had he had been getting paid in stock options.  And Elon Musk had asked him to forfeit $600 million worth of those stock options.  That's one of the ways that Elon continues to appear successful.  He just takes away money from the employees that they were supposed to get.  He did the same thing when he went to Twitter.  He's going to go through this whole court case with the top executives because he says they were released for cause.  Of course, that's ridiculous.  But it will run through long enough for him to be able to report it on his balance sheet that that was a successful sale.  Wow.  So is it illegal?  Probably not.  Not criminally.  Is it immoral?  Absolutely.  But his stands don't care about that.  Wow.

And the person who's in charge of doing that said that I just did that to him.  And he feels like he's not going to be able to go to sleep.

I'm I think the risks for me have more to do with bio weapons, which I don't want to see.  And not having equal distribution.  I don't think it was good that big parts of the world didn't have access to any vaccines because of money.  I thought that was ridiculous.  So I think there's significant risk.  I'm very worried about what China is doing.  But I also think there's huge opportunity.  I really do.  I mean, I think it's probably our best at this point.  Best hope for climate change mediation.

Always fun to have these three in the room.  I'm just going to sit back and listen.  It's fantastic.  Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.  This is now you.  There are.  There are the big cell phone companies which cost a lot of money.  Just if you're on AT&T T-Mobile Verizon, you're probably paying 80 to 100 dollars a line.  You spend a lot of money.  I look at sometimes I look at that cell bill and I go, wow, wow.  I can't believe I'm paying that much.  And it's gone up and up and up, hasn't it?  Well, there's a better way.  There's something called Mint Mobile.  And I talk to more and more people all the time who say, Leo, I did it.  And that's incredible.  Premium wireless starting at 15 dollars a month.  And there's no there's no catch.  There's no plot twist.  This is actually the price.  Premium wireless from Mint Mobile.  Fifteen dollars a month.  No two year contract.  No crazy fees when you open your bill.  No, they don't lure you in with free subscriptions to streaming services that you'll forget to cancel and they get charged a full price for.  They don't do any of that.  In fact, the way they save money is by not doing that, by not even having stores, by doing it all online.  And it is amazing.  You're going to get unlimited talk and text, high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network.  Fifteen bucks a month gets you four gigabytes a month of data plus unlimited talk and text.  You can get more.  Twenty bucks a month, ten gigabytes.  That's more than I think almost anybody.  I went crazy.  I got the twenty five dollar a month.  There's even an unlimited plan.  It's still only thirty dollars a month.  Unlimited talk and text nationwide.  High speed data.  It's on the T-Mobile network.  I'll tell you the secret.  They're a T-Mobile and VNO.  It's amazing.  You can bring your own phone.  They will send you a SIM card for free.  And by the way, they do eSIM.  So if you've got the new iPhone, they do eSIM as well, which is great.  Makes it very easy to switch over.  You can port your number over.  Keep the same phone number.  They sell phones too.  So in fact, I bought an iPhone from them, iPhone SE for fifteen dollars a month.  Such a great deal.  Switch to Mint Mobile.  Get premium wireless service.  Starts at fifteen dollars a month.  No hidden fees.  No contract.  No extras.  Just simple.  Just simple.  Fifteen dollars a month.  There are no unexpected plot twists.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Take advantage of this.  Everybody I know is switching because it just makes no sense to pay five times more.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  You'll make your wallet very happy.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Thank you, Mint Mobile, for your support for the show.  We are going long.  I always can tell.  The show goes long when we have a great panel here.  Let's do a few other things.  A bit of trouble for Apple.  Gizmodo published a story that really, I think, stuck it to Apple a little bit.  Basically saying that it's lip service.  That Apple is paying lip service to privacy.  They did a bunch of research.  They found that the iPhone data is collected even when Apple says we're not going to collect data.  They tested multiple iPhones.  Apple analytics data, regardless of your settings, sent to Apple.  As a result, there's a class action lawsuit filed immediately after the article came out in California Federal Court claiming that the iPhone is violating privacy rules.  The problem was spotted by two independent researchers, according to Gizmodo, at a software company called MISC.  They found the Apple App Store sends the company exhaustive information about everything you do in the app.  Now, you have to be in the App Store.  Despite a privacy setting, iPhone analytics, which claims to, quote, disable the sharing of device analytics altogether, when switched off, Gizmodo asked the researchers to run additional tests on other iPhone apps.  Apple Music does the same thing.  Apple TV, Apple Books, Apple stocks.  Most of Apple's suite of built-in iPhone apps track you, violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act.  The plaintiff said in the suit Apple's privacy guarantees are completely illusory.  Apple has not responded.  Thoughts?

Start time: 7883.61
End time: 7914.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That has been their differentiator.  I know.  They've, in fact, put billboards on this, and this has been like a hot topic we've discussed is how security and privacy actually can be a product differentiator to push people to want to buy.  And so this is, you know, flying in the face of what they are intending to sell.  Now, this is my first of hearing it right now.  They could just come out and go, oh, we screwed up big time.  This is how we're fixing it.  But it'll be interesting to see how it's handled.

Start time: 7914.88
End time: 7962.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Researchers looked at Health and Wallet.  They did not collect analytics data, but the Stocks app sends your list of watched stocks, the names of stocks you viewed or searched for, timestamps for when you did it, as well as records of any news articles you saw in the app.  You know what?  Okay, now this, since the app is connected to a server that has those settings, those news articles come from, all of that stuff would be collected anyway in the nature of the business of the app, right?  I'm not trying to let Apple off the hook, but sometimes you see these things and it's like, oh my God, they know what stocks you picked.  Well, yeah, because that's how it works.  So that when you choose stocks on the Mac, it propagates the phone and vice versa.  Apple does have to keep track of that.

Start time: 7964.42
End time: 7966.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a part of the functionality of the app.

Start time: 7968.16
End time: 8023.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't actually search for an app if the app doesn't know what apps are, you can't search for an app if the app store doesn't know what apps are compatible with your phone.  Right.  So it needs that data to be able to offer you the selection that will work with your device.  So if you were, but, and I get that, Leo, but the problem is, as both David and Amy have already stated, they sold this as a product feature.  They told people in their commercials and in all of their press events that we will not track you at all.  We give you that power.  Now, if they had told told you that, oh, except in the app store, then everything would be fine.  Like I use an Android phone.  I know I'm being tracked six ways to Tuesday.  Yeah, I expect no private given.  But if I went with an iPhone, that would be the reason why I did.  And to now know that, oh, this was just another PR puff piece to try to get me to buy them.  Then no, you've just broken my trust again.

Start time: 8024.50

Transcript:  But honestly, God, what amazes me most about all of this is how we care about it now.  I'll just backtrack.  Twelve years ago, I was in an event of which I heard Eric Schmidt of Google saying we can track with very high probability where you will go next.  Right.  And nobody blinked like, oh, my God, like nobody good.  Everyone's like, oh, that's quite fascinating.  Like no one cared about privacy 12 years ago.  They simply did not.  Today they do.  You could not say that without tomatoes being thrown at you.  Right.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, my as my friend Jeff Jarvis would remind me, and I want to create techno panic because some of this is just the operation of the app itself.  Yeah.  And also an EFF is pointed this out as well.  A lot of times the thing is, well, they sell that information to third party.  No, neither Google nor Facebook nor Apple tells third parties about you.  They don't want to.  They keep that to themselves so they can sell ads against it.  It's not in their interest to give that information away.  And so in most cases, first party information is held by the first party.  But, you know, Apple's perfectly happy to say no third party can let that information and kind of pretend that they're not collecting the information.  When they certainly could if they wanted to.  And now that they're putting ads in many places, including, by the way, Apple Maps, there is certainly an incentive for them to start collecting that data and use it to sell those ads.  Right.

Start time: 8121.63
End time: 8136.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I really want to see how they're going to respond.  Yeah.  How they respond is brand new.  They can either say, look, this is not an issue that they got it wrong, or they could say, we overlook this.  We'll upgrade the privacy policy.  But we do need to have this information.

Start time: 8137.18
End time: 8206.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's an extremely good point, Padre, because, again, we bring this up all the time.  Being breached, having, you know, a privacy issue or something like that is not the issue because now it's literally happening to everybody.  What the issue is how you deal with it in a very public manner, how you address it and manage it.  And also these moments really can present staff and companies an opportunity to shine.  This could actually turn out good for Apple if they respond extremely well.  And I do want to throw out one other comment here about people making comments of like, I don't care, you know, track me.  And I've heard this so many times.  And I just want to stress to people who say that, yes, you do need to care because the way to hack, the way to get to you is to use your information and to use the information that others have on you.  So your relatives, too, and your friends.  And so you do actually need to care about this, even if you, quote, have nothing to hide.

Transcript:  Can I offer one additional dynamic to what David just said?  Yes.  We were in Ireland on a runch of cars.  This was pre-COVID.  We're driving around.  We're at the southern tip.  Brian decided to take a shortcut to get to the ferry and it was my daughter and he and I, we're all very excited to be on a ferry.  We'd never been on a car on a boat.  So this is a very exciting moment, but we needed to make sure.  It's the little things, isn't it?  It's the little things that make such a difference.  And so anyhow, he says to me, drop a pin.  And I say to him, I can't.  And he's yelling at me.  He's very frustrated.  This is how he's trying to explain to me how to do it.  Right. You're on an Android.  You don't know.  And I'm like, no, I'm just telling you, I can't do it.  He starts losing his mind and he never gets mad.  But he was so frustrated.  He wanted to get the car on the boat so we could have a whole experience.  And finally, I was like, I don't have any location turned on.  He was like, what the hell is wrong with you?  Overseas, you're supposed to be navigating.  I'm like, yeah, I'm following a static map.  You know, like I know where we're going.  I just can't drop a pin.  I'll remember where we are.

How do you do that, Padre?  I have dummy devices in many of the data closets.  He works really hard.  Around the world.  So yeah.  It does mean that my advertising is never accurate.

Apple has lost its web search team to Google.  They came to Apple from Google and now they're going back.  Apple in 2018 bought a company called Laserlike.  Now this is not search on the app store.  This is actually Apple creating technology like Google for Spotlight and Siri suggestions.  Siri, which is notoriously stupid, often says, let me show you what I found on the web about that.  They wanted to make it smarter.  So they hired or bought this company and hired the founders.  Four years later, they probably vested their stock because they're gone back to Google.  So don't expect Siri to get smarter any time soon.  Let's see. What else?  Let's take a little break.  You've got a couple of stories in here.  I want to talk to you about David Spark, about security.  I want to get to those in just a little bit.  First, though, I want to talk a little bit about our sponsor, Noom.  Usually when we do Noom, I like to parade my wife in here.  She is the poster girl for Noom.  We actually have a lot of poster people for Noom.  Retcon5 was in our chat room.  He's the poster boy.  We were on the Twit Cruise last July and I knew that he was going to come on the cruise and I couldn't find him.  I went into the Discord and said,  Retcon, I thought you were going on the trip with us.  He said, I'm right behind you. Turn around.  I said, I didn't even recognize him.  He had lost, this blows me away, 100 pounds.  I saw him recently, kept the weight off, looks great, 100 pounds.  I said, how did you do it?  He said, Noom.  I've done Noom, lost 20 pounds.  Lisa lost about the same.  She did not need to lose it.  She looks great, though.  She's happy.  And I'll tell you what, she's doing it.  But religiously, she loves Noom.  Noom Weight has a psychology first approach that really works.  It works for me.  It worked for Retcon.  It worked for my wife.  It empowers you to build more sustainable habits and behaviors.  And the results last.  To date, Noom Weight has helped more than 3.6 million people lose weight.  And it does it with a very personal program.  In fact, because they're completely customizing the program to you, to how you think about food, how do you relate to food, to your goals.  Every journey is different.  Your lessons are personalized to you, your goals, but also how much time you want to spend.  You can choose your level of support from five-minute daily check-ins to personal coaching.  They have a group you can join.  So you get a coach.  You get the lessons.  You get the group.  You get the group.  But one thing you don't get, a list of things you can't eat.  Noom does not believe in restricting what you can or cannot eat.  That was kind of a mind-blower for me.  I've been on such restrictive diets in the past.  Noom, it's not about perfection.  It's not about restriction.  It's about learning how you think about food.  For instance, I learned I'm a fog eater.  I come home after work and I stuff my face.  And I'm not even aware of the food I've eaten.  I don't even know it.  It's almost unconscious.  By becoming more conscious of where Lisa and I now sit down, we turn off the TV, we put away our phones,  we've got silverware cloth napkins, and we eat.  And sometimes, and it's a little weird, but it's just the two of us, we'll stop, we'll close our eyes,  and we'll actually really taste what we're eating.  And I can't tell you what a big difference that makes.  Progress is in a straight line.  Noom knows that.  Off Day is totally okay.  In fact, I even get bonus days when I've been doing well.  They say, oh, eat anything you want today.  It's a bonus day.  And then Noomway gets you back on track.  It's grounded in science.  Active Numbers lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks.  So I should say Matt and Lisa and my experience is not typical.  Typically, 15 pounds in 16 weeks.  I have to say though, 95% of customers say Noomway is a good long-term solution.  I think that's a real test of anything.  It's easy to lose weight, really.  It's hard to keep that weight off, and Noom does it.  They've published more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles that inform users, practitioners,  scientists, and the public about their methods and effectiveness.  The best thing about Noom, it's not work.  It's not suffering.  It's not deprivation.  It's fun.  It's like I'm learning.  And then it's natural.  And you absorb it, and you do it for the rest of your life.  Stay focused on what's important to you with Noomway's psychology-based approach.  It really works.  Sign up for your trial today, Noom, N-O-O-M dot com slash twit.  Go to the website actually and read up on it.  There's some really good stuff there.  If you have any questions, you'll find it all there.  Noom dot com slash twit.  Sign up for your trial at Noom dot com slash twit.  They've got a new book too, which is great.  You could check it out.  The Noom Mindset, it's called, is a deep dive into the psychology of behavior change.  Actually, it's not out yet, but you can preorder it right now.  The Noom Mindset, another great way to kind of learn about what's going on.  But honestly, I want you to get the app, do the program, put it on your iPhone or your Android phone.  Log your meals.  You do the lessons.  You talk to your coach.  You talk to your group.  It is a system that really supports you and really works.  Noom, N-O-O-M dot com slash twit.  We are very happy Noomers in my family.  Now, let's take a little break and watch a little movie that we made about this week on twit.  On twit.

So they just need to take their focus off of like twerking bears and other strange products that people don't want.  I forgot about the bear.  Twit.  It was hilarious, but like pointless.

So that kind of didn't really work so well.  That hands on Windows, by the way, you may say, where's that?  That's a club only special.  If you're not a member of Club Twit, I want to remind you we do some club only shows because the club pays for them in effect.  So I want you to join Club Twit at twit.tv slash club twit.  It's seven bucks a month.  It really makes a difference to our bottom line.  And frankly, going forward, I think it's going to be more and more important to keeping all of our shows on the air.  You get ad free versions of all the shows because we don't need to do ads.  We don't need to track you.  We just you know, you're paying for it.  You also get access to the wonderful Discord, which is always full of fun and great stuff.  And I'm looking at a animated GIF right now.  This looks like Elon as a as a deacon.

You also get the twit plus feed, which is where that whole singing thing showed up.  Stuff that happens before and after shows.  Plus shows, like I said, that we don't normally put out in public like Hands on Macintosh with Micah, Hands on Windows with Paul Thurotte, the Untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett, the Giz Fizz with Dicty Bartol, Stacy's Book Club.  There's a lot of stuff we do.  I'm going to do more and more in the club as well.  I've been planning a whole bunch of ideas.  We have our own Minecraft servers.  There's a lot of stuff going on.  And all of it is really about financing what we do here at Twit.  So we're less dependent on advertisers.  We love our advertisers.  But frankly, with a recession, the downturn, it's getting a little harder.  The club makes a big difference.  We really need that.  So please, if you're not a member, and I understand money's tight, but if you're not a member, you can afford seven bucks a month or more.  It also finances the Twit forums, but you're open to all at twit.community and the Mastinon instance, which 20 times more expensive than it was last month.  Unfortunately.

Transcript:  You're underestimating it.  I had 15,000.  Do you want to see the growth?  Do you want to see the growth, man?  This is cray cray.  And what happened was, now it's 18,642% growth in new users, active users, now almost 3000.  It was like 300 until two weeks ago.  So that ends up costing money.  And the club supports that as well, although it is open to all.  So if people ask me, well, how can we help you with the Mastinon server?  Join the club.  Join the club and you get a lot more than just access to our Mastinon server.  But everybody can go to the forums in the Mastinon server and our IRC and all of that.  You know, we really want to continue to offer all the free services we do.  It's just that it really is helpful if you help us out.  Hey, I wanted to mention that this weekend is a tribute to the Internet's own boy, Aaron Schwartz.  Yeah.  It was his birthday, I think, on the 12th.  And EFF has been celebrating his life.  Aaron was a very important person to the Internet, worked on some of the most important pieces of the Internet,  including what, RSS and a whole bunch of stuff.  He was, I think, persecuted by the feds in 2013 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  What did he do?  He was trying to free academic journal articles from the JSTOR database.  He downloaded a bunch of them because we paid for them in the first place.  And JSTOR was charging people to get access to them.  He was facing the prospect of a long and unjust sentence.  He took his life at a very tender age, 26.  But he was, for everyone who knew him, just amazing.  So we just wanted to mention that.  And EFF had a streaming event at the Internet Archive this weekend.  I'm sure they'll put that online for people who can't make it in person and so forth.

He was given the title of co-founder of Reddit by Paul Graham after the formation of Not a Bug, Inc.  The company that he merged with Alexis Ohenia and Steve Huffman's Reddit.  He worked on civic activism.  He was a research fellow at Harvard's SAFRA research lab on institutional corruption under Larry Lessig.  He founded the online group Demand Progress.  That's the group that fought SOPA successfully, I might add.  He was very important to the Internet and a great loss to us all.  So I thought I would mention that.  I wanted to talk a little bit about this piece you did in your CISO series, David, about cyber attacks.  You'd think, oh, they're constantly creating new stuff.  And no, in fact, some of the dumbest, easiest hacks are still in widespread use.  You did this at Black Hat, yes?

And they run the NOC at Black Hat, the NOC Stand of Earth Network Operation.  Oh, that must be fun.  Oh, yeah.  And in fact, Grifter has referred to it as Christmas for him because what he sees in over just a period of three, four days on that specific network is what you might see if it's bad an entire year at some other company.  It's just this highly abused network, mostly because people go to Black Hat the first couple of days for training and they're purposely trying out techniques on the network.

What did you see?  Because honestly, that's why people come to Black Hat.  And to heck to any conference, I want to know what's new and cool.  And the sad reality, and I can't remember the CSO who said this, he said, the reality is the thing you were worried about before you went to Black Hat is going to be the same thing you're worried about after you leave Black Hat.  It's not going to be anything new.  And honestly, it's because the simple things like credential stuffing and phishing work and they're cheap and they're effective.  Yeah.

But I will tell you, the wall of sheep is getting a lot of negative press.  Oh.  I will tell you, definitely among the cybersecurity community.  Because it is...  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing and this is not what we want to do in cybersecurity.  You know, you don't bring people into cybersecurity.  And let me define what the wall of sheep is.  People who get hacked get literally exposed and published.  And the idea being, look at how weak this person's security is.  We were able to break into them.  And that, to mock someone, is not a way to bring them in the fold  of understanding the importance of cybersecurity.  Because one of the things that we talk about endlessly is,  it is not just the security department's job for security,  it is the entire company's responsibility.  You want everyone to be on board.  We do not want to expose people, mock them, make them look like a fool.  Because that is not a way to get people excited about joining your club.  Here's why people are mad.

We don't usually do picks on this show, but this guy put so much effort into it.  I don't know why.  His name is Parker Reed, and he did a cut down of how many?  Like two or three hundred twit opens.  This is from 2009 to a couple of weeks ago.  You can watch my hairstyles change.  You can watch my seat change.  There we are at CES.  You can watch, hear about what stories we were talking about at that time.  You could, I mean, it's just over and over and there's a lot of them.  It's time for Twit this Week in Tech, the show where we cover the latest tech news.  So I don't know why Parker decided to do this.  I guess it was fun.  I'm glad he did.  I watched the whole thing.

Transcript:  Yes.  Apparently, Jason is in the room where it happens at Twitter, which is hysterical.  In fact, I didn't, we didn't talk about it, but the best article about the whole Twitter  thing is a New York Times article that does in fact talk about Jason.  It's called Two Weeks of Chaos.  If you want a great read, this is the beginning of a book, I think.  Two Weeks of Chaos Inside Elon Musk's Takeover of Twitter.  They even have a picture of Jason and they talk about one point where Jason was tweeting  all these ideas about what to do with Twitter.  Let me see if I can find this, this quote.  And Elon sent down a, an assistant to say, can you knock it off?  It's as embarrassing, which is now twice that Jason has been, has been spanked.  Last week, Mr. Musk dispatched the lieutenant to the war room to ask Mr. Calacanis, who  was there, to cool it on Twitter and stop acting as if he were leading product development  or policy.  People familiar with the exchange said, to be clear, Elon is the product manager and  CEO.  Calacanis tweeted, as a power user, and that's all I am.  I'm really excited.  Knowing Jason, he is very excited to be in the room where it's happening and probably  does not want to take any of the blame for anything that did happen.  Thank you, everybody.  Have a great week.  We do Twitter every Sunday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.  You can watch us live at twit.tv slash live.  You can chat with us live at rsc.twit.tv or in the club twit discord.

I don't even know him.  Stay tuned.  Twit is next.
