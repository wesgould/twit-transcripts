Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, Episode 25 for October 2nd, 2005.  You know, because this is video, I can't signal the audience to applaud anymore. I have to do this more subtly.  Can we get an applause sign or something like that?  Welcome to Episode 25. Patrick Norton is on the floor, ladies and gentlemen, with his back to the audience.  That's how he always wanted to do the screensavers. And he finally gets to do it.  But his hat's turned around so you can at least read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there were space issues earlier. Now I'm planted here so I'm done.  You like it?  That would require getting my fat ass off the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no reason why the pocket protectors have to be on the sofa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, now I'm going to have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, stay there. You're happy. We don't have to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got three microphones to move. There's the whole Aaron issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Going counterclockwise around the lovely sofas. By the way, we're at the Gallery Cafe in San Francisco at the elbow where Knob Hill meets Chinatown.  And so all the money rolls down the hill and goes into Chinatown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the only street in San Francisco where there's four one-way streets and a cable car going through.  All meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we're crossing the historical cable car barn or museum.  So how many people took a cable car here today? Oh, yeah, some people did.  How very San Franciscan of you.  David Prager is here, ladies and gentlemen, from revision3.com.  From PC Magazine. The one and only Robert Heron Star.  Along with Patrick Norton of Digital Life TV.  Episode five come out this week. No, we had episode eight come out.  Are you golly? Roger Chang from GameSpot.com.  Kevin Rose from System.org. The Broken. Whatever.  And of course, Digg and Dignation. D-I-G-G.com.  And filling in for Patrick, for John C. Dvorak this week.  I'm really pleased to have Cory Doctorow, the man, author of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.  His new book is called...  Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town.  Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town. Boing, boing.  He's actually posting to Boing, Boing. Right as we speak.  Low even as we speak.  And then there's his day job.  And he has a day job. He's the foreign affairs coordinator.  No, European Affairs Coordinator.  European Affairs Coordinator for Electronic Frontier Financial.  There are other people who have different kinds of foreign affairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't do that.  You slept in the last three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, sleep is for the weak.  EFF.org is 15 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. Today is our 15th birthday party at 454 Shotwell.  You're all invited.  Go to the party.  5pm to 10pm. Chao. Good times.  Stickers that say funny things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's cool.  EFF has always had some good bumper stickers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Fair Use has a posse. JPEG compression is lossy.  No untap dances like Fosse.  The Rolling Stone is rarely mossy.  No.  ISDN Make It So.  We have a big supply of the ISDN Make It So stickers.  About 1993.  That was the early years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We were fighting for ISDN. I guess we gave up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Free Yann Johansson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's DVD John.  DVD John.  Do you call him DVD Yann?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  DVD Yann.  So I went to Norway this year and I met Yann.  It turns out Yann Johansson is probably the most common name in all of Scandinavia.  So he goes by Yann Lech Johansson everywhere outside of Scandinavia.  The guy who broke CSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's DVD Yann.  Is he a young guy? A nice guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a young guy. Nice guy.  What impressions?  Lives in France now. Incredibly funny.  He told me the story of how he cracked the iTunes DRM.  He was very charming and let even a technical slowpoke like me keep up with what he was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He did Playfair, which is now kind of ensconced in J.Hamm and him.  J.Hamm and all the rest of it. Yeah, he's a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's one of the good guys.  And his dad's really cool. His dad basically oversaw this whole...  His whole childhood was basically stolen.  He's like grade nine or so.  He cracks CSS along with some pals from Germany.  Next five years he spends defending himself in court.  Right.  The charge that they managed to get the Norwegian prosecutors to bring against him,  because they didn't have anti-circumvention yet on the books, was invading a computer system.  And he said, so what computer system is it that I'm meant to have invaded?  And they said, well, you know, your own.  You can't invade your own computer system.  Apparently you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's the point, isn't it, as you call it copy restriction,  is it keeps me from doing what I want to do on my system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a funny talk a couple of weeks ago with a guy from a big IT company at a DRM standards meeting  where he was like, you guys, you're so hung up on property.  Don't you know that this is the digital age?  It's not like a property age anymore, right?  So like, yeah, you don't own your VCR anymore now that there's DRM in it.  Now we kind of own it too.  But it's just like Creative Commons, right?  Everything is less privatized.  I'm like, wait a second, dude.  This isn't like reducing the world's net supply of property.  This is reapportionment, right?  This is a tax.  What you're saying is like we're going to misappropriate the property interest that you have in your laptop,  in your PVR, in your computer, in your iTunes, whatever.  We're going to misappropriate that.  We're going to transfer it back to entertainment industry, to C companies, to IT companies.  It's not depropertization, man.  That's a land grant.  Well, it's also twisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We own part of your VCR, but you better not take part of our intellectual property.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Don't reverse the logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, every pirate who goes up the ladder wants to pull it up behind him and dog the hatch.  That's just how it goes, right?  Like the phonogram pirates ripped off the sheet music pirates, the radio pirates ripped off the phonogram pirates,  cable ripped off broadcasters, VCRs ripped off cable.  And now these companies, you know, they're like, well, you know, our piracy, that was legitimate, right?  That was progress.  This stuff people are doing today, it's completely wrong.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's the way it is, though.  So the good news is we'll win in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't keep itself free, though.  Yeah, I know.  That's what EFF is for.  You've got to fight for it.  I'll point out we're a member organization.  15 years of EFF.  And if you join, you get a tax receipt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at his look at his lid of his notebook.  This for the TV audience.  There you go.  Every time I see you, it's got more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because every time you see me, I've broken another laptop and stickered.  Is this a new one?  Yeah, yeah.  This is yet another new one.  I one got stepped on.  I got another one.  I went to Singapore.  The only part of my hotel room where there was Wi-Fi was the bathroom.  I was working on the sink.  Power cable was running at the door.  Rolled the chair back a little.  That went there.  Another power book.  I'm single-handedly paying for Steve Jobs' ivory-handled back scratchers.  And he's got a good collection now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That sounds like our friend Jim Latterback, who was famous for his laptop destruction derby.  He slowed down a bit.  Is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's better?  Yeah.  Now they usually last three to six weeks.  I had to show Kevin Rose this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Milliondollarhomepage.com.  You know about that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, he had a PayPal problem, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that wild?  PayPal shut him down.  Yeah, they weren't going to let him go.  Yeah, they weren't going to let him go.  Because you buy a pixel for so much, and he wants to get a million dollars per pixel.  He's got $249,000 in three weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In a frozen PayPal account.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He changed from PayPal.  Yeah, he was shut down for a while.  And now he's collecting new DNRs.  I don't know how he's doing it, but he's making a lot of money.  My friend, look for the IP Chicken one right there.  That's my buddy.  He paid $2,500 to get that little ad right there.  It's a big IP Chicken.  And he said it's worked for him, though.  He's gotten a ton of click-throughs, so he's happy.  It works.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For now.  That's our old friend.  Who knew?  Used to be our IT guy.  Chris Krause.  Chris Krause.  Who brought Kevin in.  That's right.  He invented IP Chicken.  So these are little tiny ads.  Just so people who don't know, the guy put a million pixel web page up, which isn't that  big.  It's, you know.  10,000 by 10,000.  10,000 by 10,000.  It's not that huge.  1,000 by 1,000.  1,000, right.  And he said, I'll book a pixel.  I'm going to pay for college.  And in three weeks, a quarter of a million dollars.  In a frozen PayPal account.  That's not so bad, is it?  It's been going up every time I go there.  My friend Daniel showed me this last night.  I had heard about it, but he said, have you seen it?  I mean, this is a two-week thing.  This is the next big thing.  This isn't going to endear.  Why does this stuff happen on the net?  I mean, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to go to college.  They got their free college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  go to college.  You can only work once?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's going to work right now.  This isn't a Ponzi scheme.  I mean, he gives you what you pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not saying it is a Ponzi scheme.  the surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's not a Ponzi scheme.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  It's a Ponzi scheme.  And that's what it comes down to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's got to be new.  It's not new.  This is it.  You know how we stay novel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Works great.  Golden Palace has a big ad.  Yeah.  A .com or .net?  If IP chicken costs 2,500?  Yeah, it's about 5k right there.  If IP chicken costs 5k right there, it's about $3,000.  It's about $3,000.  It's about $3,000.  Right?  Well, the funny thing is that Golden Palace, they paid to have someone's head tattooed.  Oh, they don't do anything.  They bought the Mary toasted cheese sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They bought, what was the other thing that was on eBay that they bought?  I mean, what are they going to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't even have a casino.  They're trying to get that last 30-second mention on newscasts all around the United  States.  It works.  They have the three most expensive things on the internet, and they're trying to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that last 30-second mention on newscasts all around the United States.  They have an online casino, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And everyone knows who they are.  Palace is spelled with an S, I want to point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Make sure you go to the right site.  GoldenPalaceWithAnS.com.  Just took care of that.  So much for that mention.  All right, how many of you have seen Serenity?  Oh, opening night.  Am I the only person who saw it?  Patrick's the only Twitter who saw it.  What did you think?  It was awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Heartbreaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Gibson said it was every bit as good as the...  I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was really good, actually.  It was really good.  Maybe it was the only person who saw it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, I think Lucas should just go out and fall on his sword.  Walk out in front of his house and go, wow, with $8 and a recycled television program,  they just spanked.  How many millions of dollars?  I mean, Lucas is making bank, but I just want him to take his can of gasoline, sit in the  middle of the Presidio in front of all that beautiful land he wasted to move ILM closer  to where people want to live.  Just light his ass on fire and apologize.  That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You all agree with Serenity, the greatest movie ever?  Better than Star Wars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Better than Star Wars, but that's not saying much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got a tip for watching Star Wars, which is you get the DVD, you turn on the Italian  dialogue and you pretend it's opera.  It is.  It's space opera.  That's awesome.  He writes dialogue with boxing gloves on.  So long as it's in a language you don't understand that sounds cool, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sounds like those remixes that are real hot right now.  You saw the...  Are you talking about mashups?  No, no, no.  Like the Phantom Addams.  These new trailers that have been out.  There was a little competition.  You could take any film, edit it up, put a new soundtrack behind it.  And so the first one that's...  Oh, it's great.  The first one that emerged was as if The Shining was a love story written by Nora Ephron.  A romantic comedy.  A romantic comedy.  And then somebody's done the titan...  The next one was a zombie movie out of West Side Story, which is amazing.  And then there's a titanic one.  I can't remember what the titanic theme is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the cut line for The Shining trailer is, meet Jack Torrance.  He's a writer looking for inspiration.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They take the pictures, but it's all new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I saw the best movie this weekend.  I saw the new Neil Gaiman movie.  Mirror mask, you're going to say.  Yeah.  Goodness me, that was a fine, fine piece of film.  It was the most...  The coolest looking movie I've ever seen.  Dave McKean did all the Sandman covers and did the Wolf in the Walls and Day I Spought  My Dad for Two Goldfish.  Just did the most amazing job with the visuals on it.  Neil Gaiman's dialogue just pops.  He's brilliant, yeah.  And the storyline was so weird and dreamlike and beautiful.  Is it animated?  It's kind of animated.  The Henson Creature Shop did all the animation stuff.  And then there's lots of live action.  The actors they sourced for it were terrific.  I've never seen them in anything else before, but they were great.  And just beginning to end, a class act.  It's playing at the Lumiere around the corner.  And as the opening weekend, it was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's opening worldwide, or at least in the U.S. this weekend.  It opened on Friday.  Mirror Mask.  Mirror Mask.  Did you see that...  This made me sad.  The Muppets celebrating their 50th anniversary.  They're now owned by Disney.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  You see the Muppets doing American Express commercials.  You know something is going horribly, desperately wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know.  So Neil Gaiman is...  Actually, we had him on the screensavers.  I produced him.  The thing that broke my heart is he drew...  Didn't he draw the Sandman or something on the wall behind our set?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in my apartment.  You have it?  Yeah.  You're kidding me.  You saved it?  I took it.  When he broke the set, I said, I'm taking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Roger, thank you.  I thought it was lost to the ages.  No, it's lost to my closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you save anything else?  He's not giving it up here.  That was the only thing he drew.  It's the only thing he ever draws.  There are laptops and leather jackets.  You're talking about...  Linus Torvalds signed the back...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, all that stuff was on the bigger section of wall.  That's gone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad you saved the Gaiman.  Yeah, that was easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was actually just like a two by four.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a nice tradition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We would have guests sign the set on the back of the set thinking that we would last forever.  And then probably...  I wonder if Comcast got that with the rights to everything else.  Actually, I think a lot of that set got traded in when we got the new set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was visiting a friend in Sonoma County, Roger, who built the set, and he has the spiral

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  staircase.  So he has parts of it.  I should ask him.  Does it lead anywhere?  No.  Still has parts of it.  Well, it was the Vorax apartment.  Wasn't it upstairs?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what happened to the refrigerator?  We sold it for $25,000.  Of course, they didn't pay for it.  No, $8,000.  $5,000 or $8,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The charity auction...  That's low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's low.  You buy something at a charity auction and then you don't pay for it.  Well, what was the charity?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Morgan's mouse pad went for $700.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And did that guy pay for Morgan's mouse pad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Mike Kilton's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want to know what he did with the mouse pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That all started when Martin was trying to sell my badge from CES for one of that...  Right.  That segment on Call for Help.  What did he get for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  I got the coolest auction thing.  What's that?  Walt Disney World Security Guards jacket from Epcot Center.  Isn't this badass?  I'm going to do a little social engineering the next time I'm in Disney.  Excuse me.  Do you have a license for that shirt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He is down and out in the Magic Kingdom.  Did you get that on camera?  I have to now consider the camera because we've got video now, which is probably not  a good thing.  Patrick, how do you feel about wearing makeup again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's other entirely more complex conflicts of interest I have with making video on Twitter.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right.  I didn't even think about that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do you want us to stop?  We'll worry about that after I get yelled at this week.  Just show his back.  Somebody's going to yell at you?  Somebody's going to have a strong conversation with me.  You're kidding.  No, I'm not, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because there's video of Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you're talking about going to a three-camera shoot and the more screensavers like format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, well, we won't do that then.  We'll go to a five-camera shoot and it'll look more like Serenity.  I love Lucy.  None of them.  I love Lucy.  That's it.  Leo!  As if it were a Nora Ephron comedy.  I like that.  What could we do to make that person who's going to yell at you happy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put it in Italian.  It works for Star Wars.  Pretend it's opera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter!  Don't worry about that later on.  We'll just call you Don from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to get you in trouble, Patrick.  Stand back.  Leo's opening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a gift from Dan Dorado at uneasysilence.com.  He says you can't have pocket protectors without pens.  So we'll go everybody who gets a pocket protector get a lovely colorful twit pen.  Thank you, Dan.  Was it with people?  People sent us weird stuff.  Did you notice anything in the news, Kevin, that you thought was worth talking about this  week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google announced that they're going to be offering Wi-Fi in the Bay Area, but they also  put down a speed to that as well.  Will they say 300?  300 kbps.  What?  Yeah, in the Bay Area, in San Francisco.  You mean 300 per area?  No, just kill a bit.  Total speed.  So it's slow.  It's slow.  It's good for web surfing and email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what's the theory of that?  ISDN is back.  Good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make it FF1 after all that.  The big question is, is there a business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, heck yeah.  Are you kidding?  They know where you are.  They know what you're searching for.  They could say, oh, you want a latte?  Look at the board right where you're sitting.  Of course there's a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just got to come up with the most creative ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the other thing is, how many people here log on to a free Linksys router rather than  paying the five bucks to get the access to the coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if it wasn't for the Linksys community network, those wouldn't exist, man.  And the default community network are kicking their ass.  Those guys are so organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is where you hack the Linksys 54, WRTC 54 with Linux firmware.  I was actually just kidding.  Oh, you're kidding?  But they are doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's Flickinger X over Riley's thing.  Yeah, and a lot of people are doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's the community nets.  You log in.  You get a home page that's relevant to this micro community that you've got.  Montreal's doing it.  Toronto's done it.  I think that's a great project.  And of course, you've got the Bay Area Wireless User Group here in San Francisco that put  Wi-Fi on Sutro.  So you think Google is now, Google's becoming the evil empire.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  It's weird how they're able to do all this and not feel like an evil empire.  You know what?  They are feeling like it.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think so?  Yes.  I think it's about to shift for Google.  I don't know.  Don't you think so?  What do you think, Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they're doing generally good stuff.  I think my big problem with Google is the same problem I have with all the companies  that are doing business in China, which is that they all say, well, to do business in  China we have to sign up to like Yahoo a couple of weeks ago.  We need to sign up to rat out Chinese journalists and send them to jail for 10 years.  Google had an investor give a talk at Web 2.0 last year about how they censor the news  search results.  And they said, well, we're not doing it because it's evil or because we're kowtowing to the  bad Chinese government.  We're doing it because it's like a bad user experience.  If you search on the news page and you follow a link and you click on it and it says you  shouldn't have clicked on that link, do it again and we'll come over and arrest you.  So what we do is we take those out to improve the user experience of a Google user.  And it's like, you know what?  We're keeping them from being arrested.  If you're doing it because you're a publicly traded company that has a duty to shareholders,  I may or may not buy that excuse, but at least it's honest.  To say that we're doing it, it's for their own good.  It makes the user experience better to be censored.  I was in Singapore a couple of weeks ago.  It's like an Orwell novel.  Yeah, yeah.  And I did this phoneer with this woman who runs the book section there.  I said, so what's it like, you know, editing a newspaper where you're in a police state?  And she said, well, you know, it doesn't come up in the book section much.  Of course, we can't review books by gay people.  And I was like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That eliminates a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you have to ask ahead of time?  So I asked them about it when I got there.  And she said, well, you know, the intelligentsia you run the government, they're cool with  it, right?  But the lumpenproletariat out in the heartland, whenever we mention gay people, they get up  in arms and they demand that the government do something about them.  And so really, by not ever mentioning gay people, we're doing them a favor because it  would whip up all this dissent otherwise.  It's this amazing kind of, you know, up is down, black is white.  It helps people's user experience when you don't show them controversial news results.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody wants to feel bad.  They want to rationalize it.  So they're justifying what they're doing.  You think because Google is a public company now, though, we're going to see more of this  kind of behavior?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think everyone thinks that they need China.  And I don't know what to do about it.  I mean, I think China needs Google as much as Google needs China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you have to go in and cooperate with China?  Well, so that's the question.  Only if you want to make money.  Couldn't you just be Google here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but hang on a second.  If Google said, right, we'll just keep serving.  We won't play ball.  Would China have the guts to block access to Google when every Chinese businessman would  go, holy sh**, you can't do this.  You're going to destroy us.  They would.  Would it endure?  I mean, look at how wired the business community is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's what you have to take that hard line and just say it's like nonviolent  resistance.  Do the right thing and keep doing the right thing.  What you can't do is compromise in the way that they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's a little like DRM, right?  As soon as you lie down with the dogs, you wake up with fleas.  As soon as they say, you've got to make a little concession here, otherwise you can't  get in, then that invites the next concession and the next concession and the next concession.  That's what I'm saying.  So Yahoo started censoring your search results and then Yahoo answered weird no evidence  subpoenas that resulted in revealing the identity of a dissident journalist that sent him to  jail for 10 years.  By the way, I think this is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a difference between a corporate entity.  I mean, I mean, I agree with Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you have to understand the Chinese government runs and owns most of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So don't go in China.  So you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what we're saying.  All these companies are like if they don't go into China, then they're basically any  publicly held.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If no company would go into China, no company would sign that we're going to give up on  human rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No publicly traded company in North America can afford to not go into China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because their shareholders are going to kick the bejesus out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we want one billion new customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when you tell me you go into a store and you want a DVD player for 40 bucks, where  do you think that from?  How do you think they make it?  Yeah, everything's made in China.  You're talking about a government, you're talking about a system.  That laptop's made in China.  That laptop's made in China.  That laptop's owned by a Chinese company.  It's not just directly related.  It's also what's indirectly related.  You have a lot of money.  People don't realize the amount of public debt the U.S. has is held by China.  All those bonds they have, if they wanted to, they could turn the screws down on us  and basically bankrupt this country.  So everyone walks a fine line because like Patrick says, people want to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But hang on a second, are you saying that if Google doesn't censor the internet that  they're going to call in U.S. national debt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What he's saying is like, what I'm saying is if Google says, hey, we're going to take  the high road, we're not going to go into China unless we can have the completely free  and uncertain experience we give in America, right?  I think Google shareholders in Wall Street are going to go berserk because Yahoo and  everybody else is already in there.  So what I'm saying is how long can China afford to boycott Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And is it longer than Google can afford to boycott China?  Because I think that it would be really bad for China's economy to boycott Google, right?  Because Google delivers a lot of value, right?  And China depends on getting the internet into China.  That's why they have the internet, right?  Like they could just cut it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have a whole handful of players that are willing to step up to the plate if Google doesn't, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can they deliver as much value as Google?  Like if Yahoo and Google walked away from it, could they deliver as much value?  That's the whole reason it's happening, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google's getting in there because if they don't get in there, then Yahoo's going  to get in there.  If Yahoo decides to make compromises, then Microsoft.  You know Microsoft will make compromises.  But that's a race to the bottom, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can also structure it like a race to the top.  I agree with Corey.  Yeah, but if none of them go in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If we're asking you to stop using the S word, or Time Warner AOL won't carry this on our...  Can you edit that out?  Just make sure you bloop him when he says the...  When he says s***, can you edit that out?  Oh no, I just said s***.  Oh no.  S***.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  S***.  What are we going to be doing today?  What are we going to do?  The little beepy s***.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a giant big square where your head would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we even know what the most popular search engine in China is right now?  I don't know.  Does anybody know?  Is it Chinese owned?  Is it internal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if I were a Chinese dissident, I would want access to Google.  And I wouldn't want Google to say, we're going to cut off anything that's politically sensitive from our search.  I think they're probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, not a Chinese dissident.  If you're a Chinese businessman though.  Anybody.  And you found out that Google was being censored.  I mean, they tried it for a while, right?  Long before Google caved, there was a time when they boycotted Google.  Then there was a time when they unfroze Google.  And then they went back to Google and they said, we froze you once, we can do it again, now you've got to play ball.  Well, they unfroze Google not just because they wanted to play ball with Google or they thought they could make Google dance to their will.  They unfroze Google because...  Because they had to.  People were up in arms because you took away their Google and all of a sudden they were freaked out.  I mean, yes, it's a police state, but police states rely on people being okay with living in a police state to a certain extent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at the same time, you're also assuming a lot of the populace that they have a particular viewpoint that is similar to your own.  I mean, take Burma for example.  When the state runs the media, you're grown up and you're fed a certain line.  So anything outside...  You buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's the power of the Internet to overthrow that.  All right.  Moving on.  It would be nice.  It would be nice.  I'm dreaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of like weird partnerships, BitTorrent gets shade under nine million in VC to start doing file sharing service, hopefully distribute Hollywood content.  That was like the line.  USAID, everybody's covering this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dvorak sent an email to us all saying it's the beginning of the end.  For BitTorrent?  I don't know what he just said.  He just said it's the beginning of the end.  I don't know if he meant BitTorrent or the world.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those cryptic messages he likes giving out.  Is it the beginning of the end?  Let's just narrow it down to BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As soon as they take money from VC...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, beginning for the end for the studios, then make those?  I think it's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll say it's good.  As long as BitTorrent doesn't sell out and say, okay, we're going to DRM.  But to take a little money to become...  I mean, they really...  I want BitTorrent to succeed.  We rely on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The piracy business is not something anyone can make money on, says Ashwin Navin.  Not since the Supreme Court decision.  BitTorrent with Bram Cohen.  We want to distribute paid and ad-supported content.  Don't you think it's Bram Cohen's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  After the Supreme Court decision, the first thing Bram does is say, oh my God, let me  look at all those things I wrote.  Wait a minute.  Oh, here's a page that says, I support piracy.  I'm in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a page he wrote supposedly as a joke.  Yeah, well, that was his rational.  Somebody else dug it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what do you think Bram does?  Maybe if we can get some VC funding.  We can be legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, E-Donkey just basically laid down and said we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He probably thought he was screwed after the Supreme Court decision.  Don't you think?  Interesting thought.  Hey, I want to keep BitTorrent alive, however it happens.  And the stuff we distribute over BitTorrent and the stuff you distribute over BitTorrent  and the stuff you distribute over BitTorrent, Kevin Rose, is all legitimate legal stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's tons of legitimate users.  BitTorrent's open source.  I mean, it's not going anywhere.  Nobody controls that.  I don't need to give them money.  Obviously, he has commercial intentions in mind when taking the funds.  He wants to make a little money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nothing wrong with that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, to feed yourself.  Yeah, it depends on what he wants to do with it.  I'm curious to see.  Yeah, it's going to be interesting to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, feed more power to him.  He got nine million bucks more power to him.  Top 100 products of 2005 according to PC World.  I just thought I'd run them by you and see what you think.  Should we go backwards?  How much time do we have?  I won't start at 100.  Top five.  Top, yeah, five.  Top five.  Number 10, the Trio 650.  That belongs.  No?  The PDA that no one loves.  I've got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think people love the 650.  You're the first person I've heard of.  I know three people who've been carrying them for months.  I've got the ectoplasm case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's got rubber on his.  His is in the sheaf.  I mean, I had the P900 before.  Talk about a boat anchor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, I liked my P900.  Oh, no.  But I don't use it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the thing I like about this is it's the first phone that I've gotten to successfully sync with my Mac ever.  Because the P900 just didn't sync.  Never did.  It just never, ever, ever did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the sidekick never really sunk very well.  Well, it sunk.  You know what?  I just went back to a phone phone.  Yeah, so did I.  I have the 650.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gave it to a friend.  Yeah, you didn't like it because it was too big.  It's just too bulky for me.  I mean, I like the fact that you can get your email on it.  You can sync your contacts.  But it's like the web browser sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, so we say it does not belong on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they sell 130,000 of them a month.  Depends on your needs.  Ah, not bad.  And then now they think they're going to sell even more of them because they're moving over to Windows.  Because they're moving over to Windows.  Windows mobile, yeah.  Which probably, they'll probably sell a lot more because of that.  And then there's going to be a lot of pissed off people that want it with the Palm OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't it funny to see Palm as a Microsoft partner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said they're doing both, though, right?  For the 700, they're going to do a Palm version and a Windows.  So which will win?  Oh, the Windows, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Number nine, Canon EOS Digital Rebel, the new XT version.  I think so.  Sub 1000 SLR.  High performance SLR.  Nice.  It's much faster than the original Digital Rebel.  And it still takes all the standard Canon.  All the Canon lenses.  I think that belongs there, yeah.  Number eight, Skype.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure.  So here's an interesting thing about Skype and the Skype acquisition.  So those guys have got like gigantic judgments outstanding against them in Australia now.  The guys who founded Skype, right?  As a result of the Kazaa litigation.  Is that money ever going to get into their hands?  Sharman Networks, you mean.  Yeah.  Well, no, not Sharman Networks.  See, I don't understand the relationship of Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It says it's a Luxembourg company.  Is that just an affront for the Sharman?  Well, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm not making any kind of allegation.  That's our...  No, I'm just saying that it's the same founders.  They're never going to get into 3.5 billion.  Right?  And if they can figure out a way to make the liability leap from the company in Australia  to the founders.  Right.  And then they can then say, all right, well, the founders have got billions of dollars  rolling into their personal accounts this week from eBay, from PayPal.  They can then go to the courts and say, well, we have a judgment outstanding against these  guys.  And then at least freeze this until we can figure out where this is all going.  It's just speculation.  But I wouldn't be surprised if we saw that kind of sneaky underhanded stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just gave nightmares to the Sharman Networks guys.  They're great guys.  They're just dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've already been living in a nightmare for quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This one kind of surprised me.  I'm not sure I would put this on the top 10 list.  Number seven is the Seagate USB 2.0 Pocket Drive.  You've seen that.  It's about the size of a matchbook.  It's hard drive, 4 gig hard drive, USB.  I have one with the little cord.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it flash?  How much is it?  It's $20.  It's ARM 4 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the cool part.  It's ARM, correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a great one.  They might make it on a storage device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You get a nano now and you get the same amount.  But what's the price on that?  It's $200.  That's pretty pricey.  I mean, for two gigs of flash.  Yeah, I wouldn't put it on the top 10 list.  It's not flash.  It's not flash.  It's a hard drive.  It's a little Hitachi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's a moving force?  It's a 40 gig or more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But just comparing it to say a 2 gig key that you get for $120, $130 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Speaking of which, rumors are flying new iPod might be an 80 gig because Hitachi's got the  80 gig iPod.  iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, my...  It's not this little orange.  That's the C.  It's a little more stylish.  And it's orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's 8 gigs.  It's 8 gigs.  And it's $149.  Well, screw this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem with these things.  PC world, we should tell them.  Yeah, that's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's old.  That's out of date.  The one and only PC on the top 10 list is an Alienware, the Aurora 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw Alienware sort of making servers now.  Yeah.  Who's buying those servers?  I want a gaming server.  Because gamers, gaming server.  No, no, no, no.  I'm talking like 1U servers.  A rack.  No, I wouldn't buy that.  PC magazine gave them the rank as the number one.  It's the ones who just got rid of all their Apple servers.  It's got cool lighting in it.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it have like four inches of extra plastic around it?  But Kevin, this is for you who decide that you think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the reasons that you like the Sun Microsystem servers is because it's got a cool logo on  the top of it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See?  It's purple.  I just think Sun makes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, that's true.  They make a pretty server.  I know, Kevin, you're going to agree with the number five pick.  What's that?  The dull, the dull...  The dull?  The dull Ultra Sharp 24 inch LCD flat panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only reason, I don't know if performance wise, Robert could probably tell you better  as far as LCD...  But you like how it looks.  But they're cheap as...  Oh yeah, they're dirty cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You like the Ultra Sharp, Robert?  That is a highly rated display.  There's nothing wrong with it.  What is it?  1920 by 1200 is huge.  24 inches.  Awesome resolution.  Yeah.  And cheap.  That's what I like about Dell flat screens.  They're just so nice.  What's the price?  It's not Dell.  It's dull.  Dull.  Dull.  Dare to be dull.  That was the Bill McCrone motto when he started PC Magazine.  That's a nice display though.  Highly rated.  All right.  That's the number five deserves it.  Number four, the Belkin Preen wireless.  I agree on that.  I've heard good things.  I haven't used it yet.  I think people love that.  It's amazing.  Unbelievable.  I think any of the Preen stuff is good.  Well, not any.  No, no, no.  You got to get the true MIMO stuff.  There's two chip sets.  If you get an Air Go chip set, yes.  800 feet, you get like 100 megabits.  It's amazing.  Of course, don't use your old B and G stuff.  You got to get all new gear.  But it's nice.  Number three, and this might be a surprise, it's PC World OS X Tiger.  Dead silence.  You don't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're using it back.  I use it.  I loathe it.  I've never had a machine freeze up as much as I have since I put Tiger in.  I haven't had any problems.  That was a scary concept.  I was at Disneyland last weekend hanging out with a friend of mine who's like an Apple  guy.  He said, next update's going to fix 18,000 bugs.  Whoa, Tiger.  I've never had more beach balls in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I haven't had that problem.  Really?  I've been very fortunate, I guess.  There are USB issues.  Do you use a lot of USB devices?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use it with my Mac Mini.  I find it actually a bit slower than Panther on my older G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The fact that you hit reply and mail and start typing doesn't buffer your keystrokes.  It takes like three seconds to paint the window on the screen.  You type, yeah, that sounds cool.  I'll meet you there at three.  You're about to hit send.  You're looking there and all it says is yeet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That may not be mail.  That may be OS X because I've noticed that's been happening with Mulberry.  It was part of the 10.4 update.  It's the text.  Mulberry, which I use for email, is an IMAP client.  Same thing.  It must be the text entry routine.  Do you know most Mac users are just installing the updates for the OS just on top of the  previous OS?  Or does it give you an option for fully gutting it?  I've done both.  I've done both and it's the same diff.  It is.  It's a pretty good install because it will move the system folder out.  It's a pretty easy thing to do.  Number two, Gmail.  Love it.  It's pretty good.  We all like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what was totally missing from Gmail?  Delete everything in my spam folder.  I get 20,000 spams a day.  I tried looping my mail through Gmail for a while to do this and my Gmail filled in 60  days.  I was like, okay, time to empty out all the spam.  You can't select all of it.  You can do it 100 at a time.  There were like a million spams and I could do it 100 at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a new free mail that's been going around, invitation only, 30 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like 30 gig dot, who cares?  I got an invitation.  I didn't even, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, will the company be around by the time you fill it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you look at the web page, it's a little funky looking.  It's like, yeah, we'll give 30 gigs to the first 50 people.  I just want 30 gigs of online storage for free.  Well, you could do it because you have email.  Just mail yourself files.  Break it up.  Yeah, you would have to break it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Use WinRAR.  Just spread everything out.  I'm going to try a new spam thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you ever heard of graylisting?  I'm going to try a new spam thing.  I use graylisting.  You use graylisting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The biggest problem with graylisting is you, so the way graylisting works is if a mail  agent contacts your server and it hasn't contacted it in the last 24 hours or 48, depending on  how you configure it, it sends the SMTP on very busy message and says, come back in 15  minutes.  And 15 minutes is kind of how long it takes the big ISPs to see that a mail has come into  one of their fake email addresses, their honeypot addresses, and then block that IP address.  So a spammer has to stay put long enough to be blocked and it kind of fixes that.  No, no, no, it works.  That works pretty good.  The thing that doesn't work is a lot of legit mail, when they see that come back in 15 minutes,  puts it in a 24-hour retry queue.  So here's me on the phone to British Airways going, I really need you to email my ticket.  And they're saying, we emailed you your ticket.  And then 24 hours later, there's my ticket.  So adding potentially 24 to 48 hours of latency to your thing.  And it's not like I can call up BA and say, oh, well, you've got a badly configured mail  agent there, guys.  You should really fix that.  It's like, if I could dictate terms to BA, I wouldn't need them to email me my ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe the key is whitelisting or I'm going to try it and see.  But I think you're right.  The idea is great, because spammers just won't retry.  In theory, it should get rid of all your spam.  So are you still doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still doing it.  It takes care of about 95% of my spam on my personal address.  We don't use it on our EFF stuff.  And the false positives are probably a little below the number of false positives that I  was getting when I was just trying to do Bayesian or whatever.  I just get too much spam to hand sort it.  It's just way too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Me too.  Me too.  Number one item on the PC World Top 100 list.  Let's just give them guesses.  If you're looking at it, don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it made from a company headquartered in Cupertino?  This is not 20 questions.  I was going to say the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's software.  Oh.  That should be enough for you.  Come on, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what it is.  Oh, you know.  But I've read the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  That's why I didn't send this out this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, can I give them all a hint?  Yeah.  You're using it to browse the web right now.  Mozilla.  You're probably all using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Firefox.  Firefox.  How many of you are using Firefox right now?  I am.  Frager?  Yep.  Firefox.  Robert's Firefox.  Me.  At home, I do.  Corey's Firefox.  Kevin's Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the only one without a laptop.  Where's your laptop?  It actually started up four years ago.  I've been kind of loathe to actually buy a replacement.  To take it anywhere.  Eight years ago.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when the burglars got it home and opened it up and they saw the little pterodactyl  and said, ah, it's a living.  They probably would delight it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Roger, you can get a notebook now for under a grand.  And back then, it was $5,000.  You can get one for under a hundred.  You can get $100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you seen Nick Negropani's new one?  Uh, I'll believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, he's amazing, and they've got a lot of momentum.  But I'll believe that when it actually starts showing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love the idea.  It says one laptop per child.  Yeah.  15 million machines within a year.  The cost, the real cost is under a hundred dollars.  I mean, how is it going to be a screen for under a hundred?  They'll be encased in rubber.  So Cory will like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That Tonka, my first laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My first laptop.  Flash memory, not a hard drive.  That's one of the ways they keep it cheap and reliable.  Four USB ports.  Wi-Fi.  That's, what it sells you is how cheap all these technologies are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is a lot of these technologies aren't that cheap.  I mean, you don't think they can do it?  It's going to be subsidized in some fashion.  The big cost is this display, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's got to be the biggest cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The display and the battery are pretty expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It'll have a dual mode display so it can still be.  The last time they did this, they didn't have a display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was this computer, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you would hook it up to like a, what, a TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, like the original, the one before this, this computer was like a little handheld,  like a PDA on steroids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You'd project it.  It had like LEDs or something.  This will have a color display or monochrome.  Four times normal resolution when you use monochrome and it works in sunlight.  That's the idea.  Sounds like the old Apple II, double high res mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, if you go to the MIT's webpage for it, it's basically they're saying, hey,  this is a research initiative to develop a $100 laptop.  So you don't think it's a good initiative?  It's a great initiative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a phenomenal initiative.  The Simputer is being made.  People are making the Simputer.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anyone actually judged the success?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, how, what do you, there's no, it's not financial success.  How many people you get it into their hands and are using it and it's making a difference  in their lives and that's hard to measure, I'm sure.  Any other topics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should we get an email?  No, I think we should definitely tell you.  I see Robert just keeps surfing about it.  The whole HD DVD Microsoft and Intel thing and then of course, Dell and HP firebacks  saying, oh, we'll Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Apple, Dell and HP thinking most computer manufacturers would go this way are supporting  the Blu-ray HD standard.  The movie companies like HD, computer companies like, half of them do.  Yeah, right.  But, but universal until the other race to the bottom.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are they selling it to the studios on?  Well, this one's more restrictive, right?  Blu-ray is more restrictive.  DVD HD has got even more features that none of our customers want.  No, Blu-ray has got more features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't Microsoft and Intel originally in the Blu-ray camp?  And supposedly they switched because they found out as supposed to the story is that  China was actually backing the HD DVD spec and they were, they were, they were basically  planning that the cost per minute would actually go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well maybe it's revisionist because what Microsoft's saying now is we support it.  And I don't think Corey will have something to say about this because it has, it's easier  to copy discs with.  In other words, the thought it's still got DRM, but it's a less, it's a less restrictive  DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure.  But, but you know, the point is that the, the thing that will determine what the studio  is licensed to is which one's most restrictive, right?  We've never said before the DVD that just because you made a record, you should be able  to design the record player, right?  That's just like never been a part of the law, right?  It's never been a part of the way that businesses do business.  You know, traditionally what's happened is like technologists have made cool toys, the  entertainment industry has tried to get them banned, technologists have dragged the entertainment  industry kicking and screaming, buy the hair to the money tree.  And then, you know, we've got VCRs, we've got cable TV, we've got radio, we've got juke  boxes, we've got computers, we've got the internet and so on.  You know, in every turn it's just like made more money for more artists.  And here we have this bizarre thing where Intel, whose grosses are bigger than the entire  Hollywood studio enterprise put together, are saying like, is there some way we can  try and be more like you little pipsqueaks whose business is a lot smaller than ours?  Well, why are they doing that?  Like, you know, I've got a couple of theories.  My first one is that this is, this is, this comes from my friend Tim Woos, a Columbia  law professor.  He says that industries in decline lobby best, right?  If you're in a really, really competitive industry and you stop competing to send someone  to Washington to suck up for privilege while you're there, your competitors eat your lunch.  But when you're down to like four big entertainment companies, you can all gather around and have  like a gentle monopolist agreement that no one will stab anyone else in the back while  we're all in D.C. getting some sucking up.  The other part of it, though, is that, you know, the way that the tech companies are  traditionally interacted with government and regulation is by receiving military funding.  And military funding is really different from traditional congressional battles, right?  You know, there's like big swaths of the military budget that work like this.  You know, someone shows up at Congress and says, I'm taking some money.  I'm not telling you how much or what it's for, but I'll be back when I need some more.  Right?  And if that's the way that you interact with government, it's really easy to become kind  of a nerd determinist.  You know, our superior technology makes your inferior laws irrelevant or like a nerd fatalist,  right?  Anyone who goes to Washington ends up smelling like the swamp, right?  You know, we can't get involved in lawmaking.  It would prostitute us.  We are too pure for that.  So you know, I think that that's more or less why you have the tech companies bending over  for the entertainment companies.  But you know, this all relies on like there never being two guys in a garage or two girls  in a garage who start a tech company that doesn't want to play the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You made your speech, why all healthy ecologies have parasites from e-tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All complex ecosystems have parasites, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really good point that by being so restrictive, DVD has become basically a dead end.  It's not an innovative technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  If you bought $1,000 worth of DVDs 10 years ago, in 10 years the features that have been  added to those DVDs are like none.  Whereas with CDs you've got like karaoke, MP3, ringtones, MP3 CD, backup, share with  your friends, library, all that stuff.  Which should not have happened if it had been DRM.  Yeah, because like no one had a veto if you said, okay, I want to add a new feature to  every CD in the field by releasing a CD player that does one more thing, right?  No one got to say, no, you're not allowed to.  You know, we designed that record so we should be able to design your record player.  But with DVDs, because there's DRM, it's against the law to add a feature without getting permission.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Microsoft, Intel, now HD.  Sony, other compute, Dell, HP, Blu-ray.  Universal HD.  Disney Blu-ray.  Are we screwed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much.  We're going to try to make this the most complicated user experience while you all are getting  driven to HD DVDs for the action of the federal government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's almost as if they drew a line straight down the middle and said, everybody, half  of you go that way, half of you that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically what this means is that the adoption for HD video is going to take longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody's going to take a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm happy with my DVDs, I'm not going to spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But on the upside, it's like, you know, Betamax machines are hard to keep running, but DVD  players should live close to forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now Robert's always made the case that it's going to be cheap to make a dual format DVD  player.  Are we seeing them?  Samsung introduced one.  Well, they have one.  They'll play both.  And that was one of the big reasons that Intel and Microsoft kind of came down on HD DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the recordable formats, and they're not seeing from the Blu-ray camp a 50 gig disc  that you can record to yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've been claiming that storage capacity for a long time.  HD has it?  HD can go up to 30 gigs right now, and for Blu-ray you're looking at 27.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's important to computer makers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then HD came back and said, well, in Japan you can buy the 50 gig recorder right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm looking everywhere online.  I can get a set top recorder shipped from Japan with the 27 gig storage, but the 50

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  gig storage is non-existent.  Is 50 dual sided?  Is it a dual layer?  A dual layer, yeah.  And so far...  So they've got single layer, they just don't have dual layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the HDs...  And they're saying it's unlikely...  The HD number they quoted was a dual layer HD DVD disc, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would have to be, right?  ROMs will probably be available soon.  I mean, for movies.  But nobody can do anything with that other than play the content that's already there.  So we're going to be able to get DVD ROM players, DVD players that are dual format.  That'll be fine.  That's not going to be an issue.  It's going to really come down to...  They're saying initially no.  No.  You're not going to see that.  And that's...  We're not going to see dual format.  We were supposed to have the HD DVD stuff in stores already in this country, and that's  been pushed back till next year.  And now with the new to-do with the formats going every which way, I doubt we're going  to see it by Christmas of next year at this point with the way the fighting's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That'd be the best possible outcome, though, right?  Let them go on fighting while video continues to be delivered over swarming download technologies  to people with hard drives.  And let them go on squabbling while the world moves on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem is we'd like some higher content.  I mean, it would be nice to have better quality on the captures that's going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm using a digital VHS deck to record DVD or Hi-Def at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or a PC-based solution.  Hey, speaking of which, so there's an initiative to put the broadcast flag back on the legislative  calendar in the House.  20 Congress Critters were suicidal enough to publicly support an initiative to break  their constituents' televisions.  I just put a list of their names on Boing Boing.  You can give them a call, tell them what you think.  The last time they tried this about three weeks ago, they got overwhelmed by so much  email and calls and faxes that they just all backed off from it.  Time to do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tweed Army attention.  Go to boingboing.net and call your Congress Critter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, do we have time to read 20 names or is that going to be boring?  Charles Pickering from Mississippi.  Adolphus Towns from New York.  John Schickmus from Illinois.  George Vrdanovic from California.  Mike Ferguson from New Jersey.  Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee.  Bart Gordon from Tennessee.  Mary Bono, of course, from California.  She is in the pocket.  Oh, she sure is.  Lee Terry from Nebraska.  Ed White-Witfield from Kentucky.  Bobby Rush from New Jersey.  Vito Fosella from New York.  Joe Schadegg from Arizona.  Elliot Engel from New York.  Albert Nguyen from Maryland.  Michael Doyle from Pennsylvania.  Charles Gonzalez from Texas.  Charles Bass from New Hampshire.  John Sullivan from Oklahoma.  And Frank Polony from New Jersey.  These guys, if they're your representatives,  you should give them a call as soon as you can and let them know  what you think of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if you just want to fight the broadcast flag in general,  EFF has a great activist.  Action.eff.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can send a letter to Congress to tell them about it.  It's just sort of a one-click action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the fact that the FCC pulled back on the broadcast flag  doesn't mean it's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no.  So the reason it went to the FCC is  because we made such a stink about it  when they were trying to move it into Congress  that no Congress creditor wanted to touch it.  They were like, this is the kiss of death.  When it was small and unregarded,  they thought, oh, we'll just make it happen.  No one will notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is, we should explain, this is the feature  that would be built into anything  that could take digital media that would prevent  copying of that digital media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But not really.  What it would do is it would say anyone  who wants to build a device that's  capable of receiving or sitting downstream from a receiver  for digital television would have  to get permission from a regulator  to add features to it.  And they would have to design it so that users couldn't modify  it, so no open source, no free software.  It all has to be proprietary, closed, glued together,  no makers, no hackers, no nothing.  So we made a big stink.  The lawmakers were scared off.  Fritz Holling sent a letter to Chairman Powell at the FCC  saying, we think that you already  have the jurisdiction to do this.  So we looked at this memo that he sent.  And it was a Word file.  They posted it to the FCC's website.  We took it.  We opened it up with strings in UNIX.  And it turned out that it originated  on a copy of Word registered to Motion Picture Association  staffers, who apparently are the backup jurisdictional question  advisors to powerful committee chairman in the Senate.  And so the FCC made the regulation.  Well, they don't have the authority  to regulate what you do with the device  after you receive the show.  That would basically put them in charge of PCs.  The FCC just doesn't regulate what features PCs can have.  And if they did, it would make them into an agency  1,000 times larger than they are now.  So we went to the second circuit.  We went to the DC circuit.  The DC circuit said, along with Public Knowledge  and the American Library Association and so on,  they said, you're right.  No jurisdiction, no more broadcast flag.  Entertainment industry, if you want a broadcast flag,  you've got to go and convince a lawmaker to cut her  or his own throat by breaking their constituents' televisions.  And so they found 20 lawmakers dumb enough to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you really think it's cutting their throat?  I mean, we know about it.  But do you think the general American populace  knows or cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they will if I have my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we know a couple of hundred thousand people  who now know better.  And that should be enough if each and every one of you  contact your member of Congress.  That'll do the job.  Yes, Mr. Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What time is your flight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, we're going to get rid of Corey.  We should be wrapping this up anyway.  What time is it now?  Oh, you've got time.  Is it a 530 flight?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've got time.  6 PM flight.  All right, we'll get you a cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're actually right on the, yeah.  We'll get you a cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Get a cab for Mr. Doctorow.  Corey, I'm really glad you could be part of this.  Thank you so much for being here.  EFF.org, boingboing.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The new book is?  Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town, EFF,  Birthday Party Tonight, 454 Shotwell Street,  and the Colorful Mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So everybody who's here can go to that,  because you just take a cab over.  Thank you, Corey, for being here.  See you guys.  We really appreciate it.  See you, Corey.  Come back any time.  I know you live in London now, but please come back any time.  Love to have you back.  And by the way, he gets no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your email address again?  No spam I don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no spam.  That's true for me, for sure.  I get every piece.  I'm on every list.  I bought a watch online at a Yahoo store.  That was a mistake.  I now get 20 pieces of watch spam a day.  All of a sudden.  What a coincidence.  How did they know?  At this point.  Got a neat email.  By the way, we've changed how we record the audio on this.  And I had hoped to have audio questions from listeners  this week.  I said I would.  But because we changed how we do it,  I'm not going to be able to do that this week.  We'll figure it out.  We're now using a ProSonus FirePod.  Fireweasel 4000.  Fireweasel 4000 to get into the get this.  And by the way, I want to thank Alex, Lindsey,  and the Pixelcore, because not only  are they doing the video, which they're  going to stop doing, because three camera  shoots are not allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll figure this out later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I also want to thank them for doing the audio.  And the biggest blessing for me is  they're going to do the editing.  So I can go home tonight.  Usually I am at the office.  Oh my god.  Medic.  I'm usually at the office till 2 in the morning doing this.  So that'll be a real relief.  So thank you, Alex, for doing that.  Got an email.  I thought this was a great email from Lubinski.  Just got into podcasts lately.  Didn't know what to subscribe to.  I'm a fledgling IT guru.  Didn't know what podcast to subscribe to.  Twit was on the top of the list.  So I subscribed, and I was glad I did.  He said, can you mention my site on the podcast?  I'm currently activated from the Army National  Guard in Wisconsin.  I'm in Kuwait, Iraq border in Navistar, Kuwait.  We lost two soldiers last week.  It would be cool for maybe to mention something.  I will mention something.  3rdddragoons.org.  He's got a lot of pictures from the dragoons out there.  And I mention this because I know  we have a lot of listeners in the line of fire  all over the world.  So we're glad you listen, and our hearts and prayers go out  with you.  I do have some questions for email.  How long have we been going, though?  I can't.  Does anybody time in this?  We've got a couple more minutes.  You want to answer some questions, or you just want to  talk about life and love?  We could actually.  We have an audience mic.  Should we take some audience questions?  Step right up to the mic and ask your question away.  This is nice.  We've got a good crowd here in San Francisco.  I think this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My question is, I'm an IT supervisor.  And of course, people are downloading on BitTorrent and  stuff at work.  So I was wondering if there's any way I can monitor this PC  or Mac so I can see if they've got good movies.  Maybe I can get some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want to capture what they're downloading.  Can she see into the BitTorrent to see what  they're getting?  Yeah, you can see that, can't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you'd have to take a look at it.  I mean, if it's being switched.  Well, I mean, there's a couple different ways to do it.  If you have the torrent file that they're downloading, you  can use torrents by, drop it, and see what's going on there.  All you really have to do is capture that little torrent

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  file, which you could do with ethereal or something.  And just all you need to see is that .torrent file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it's switched, you have to have a switch that has a DMZ  port that's feeding all the traffic through so that you  But you're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're seeing all the traffic go through, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I can see that they're downloading five or six things  at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I shouldn't tell you how to do this, but I'm going to anyway.  If you had ethereal or any packet sniffer, ethereal's a  good one, you're watching all the packets.  What you want to do is the only packets you really care  about are those small .torrent files, because those tell you  what they're getting.  And the information doesn't say a file name, but it does.  Or does it?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's filters you can apply.  It sends you to a tracker.  And you can find out exactly what it's pulling from.  And it would tell you there what they're getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact, all you have to do is open it in Azure and it would  start downloading it.  A workplace network that allows you to download BitTorrent.  That's nice.  You don't block the BitTorrent ports?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, why should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So really, your only interest is you just want to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, because there's a lot of things.  I've got everybody hooked on DIG and the broken system and  everything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So really what you want is a system so that they don't do  multiple downloads of the same file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and also if somebody's downloading a good movie like  Serenity, and I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like this one.  Where do you work and how can I get a job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I work downtown in the financial district.  I manage a couple of IT companies.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that would be one way to find out what they're getting.  I think what you really need is to run a  tracker of your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, set up your own tracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A little pirate tracker inside the enterprise and let them  get it from there.  Cash all files locally.  This is so wrong.  Yeah, cash all files locally.  Could a proxy server cache BitTorrent traffic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can set up a proxy server to cache anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  As long as you don't have a three camera shoot, it's OK  with Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I'm just having this vision of the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't want to get you in trouble.  I've worked with enough friends in IT to where they're  using software to capture screenshots of their user

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  desktops, the client desktops.  In addition to, if they catch you so much as running  anything, they're at your desk in five minutes and pulling

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the plug on your computer.  Oh yeah, they're absolutely.  You're not refreshing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually, that's how I found out Digital Life was  actually on Torrent, is by doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They just don't even tell you to shut your port off.  You're like, my interconnection's down.  DigitalLifeTV.com, it really is the actual return of the  screensavers because you're actually doing it.  We're just sitting around gassing.  You're actually showing products.  I love it.  I love it.  It's a fabulous show.  DigitalLifeTV.com.  Nice.  And Patrick's on there and Robert's on there.  And we figured out the problem with the TriCaster.  Did you?  You finally got that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's amazing.  We actually had one other guy named Oz.  He's actually one of their, he's kind of our liaison  between, Oz is kind of our liaison between our problems  and the engineering staff who have an interesting  relationship with me, I think, the engineers.  The few of them that know I exist are like, shut up.  You yell at them?  I don't yell at them.  I just occasionally, well, we relaunch, like, hey, for all  those of you watching the live stream, we want to apologize  for that little blip.  Our TriCaster ate its own tail.  But it's interesting.  They gave us some stuff to try to do it.  It's amazing that people are using the TriCaster.  The Air Force has a bunch and a bunch of other people.  And they're mostly using them for live presentations.  I'll tell you one thing we will never do.  We're pushing the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're not going to do this streaming video.  And we're not even switching live at this point.  We're capturing all the things.  What we're going to do is we're going to capture them to a  hard drive and use Final Cut, which has a kind of live  switching technique after.  Which is pretty slick.  Yeah, and much better than having to try to.  And I can't afford the bandwidth.  Ziff Davis can afford the bandwidth for streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Actually, what's been interesting to look at, actually,  is looking at the size.  I didn't realize how big the system files were until I  started looking around and trying to figure out what  typical downloads sizes were for a-  How big is system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a couple hundred megs.  For 20 minutes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you've got files as big as 700 megs up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's why I do the full-  That's the 1080p version.  People that want to burn it out and put on a TV or-  No, that's more like the 720.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if you do a full NTSC, not even an HD, an NTSC  download, it's easy for a half an hour to 40 minutes to get  up around a gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Alex has really been doing well at encoding H.264.  You play with it.  You can get it small, a smaller anyway.  There's tricks to it, aren't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you just don't have to use as high of bit rate as you  normally would to get good quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But also when you're shooting it, having stable backgrounds,  one of the things he does is I think very smart is a lot of  screenshots, because screenshots compress great.  And everybody likes screenshots.  What's wrong with that?  Not a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a thing.  Unless you're trying to do a whole bunch of feeling motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We can't do screenshots, but we're just sitting here  talking heads.  Guys, I just want to ask you not to move any part of your  face but your lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what you need is those wooden clamps they used to use  on 19th century photographs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take shots of our head and we'll clutch cargo or lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go.  That'd be much easier.  We figured it out.  We get these down to 5, 6 km in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be like Conan O'Brien.  What we need is bigger pixels.  And then we can have any guest we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like this t-shirt.  It's an on-off switch, isn't it?  The universal sign for on-off.  More power.  It took me a long time to figure out what that is.  That's a one and a zero, right?  But it kind of looks like a switch.  Another question from the audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hi, I was just wondering what you thought about Adobe's  purchase of Macromedia that's going to just crush web  developers as far as choices on products that they can use.  There were choices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So had they said whether they're going to keep Go Live  or Dreamweaver, are they going to keep both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not sure if they're going to compress  into one product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that wouldn't be so bad, would it?  There's always front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the universal laughter in the background.  Everybody knew the front page sucks.  It's just like an HTML client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you just say front page, they laugh.  They know it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like this group.  It's the best web developers that I know,  they all still hand code their stuff.  Notepad.  Yeah, they don't even use any of it.  They use some of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's changing, though, don't you think?  You can't do CSS by hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're still running into people  who are using these huge CMA systems that are custom designed  and feeding tens of thousands of them.  For huge companies, huge media companies.  And there's still people that go on the rise.  It's like, uh-huh, you go in and you tweak a line here  I spend a lot of time writing bracket href equals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I admit.  You've got to fix video on our site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to do that.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, there's services like Subversion and things  like that and CBS-based systems where  you check out certain files and certain-  I saw a great page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A guy's using Subversion, which is a CBS  checkout for programmers.  He's using it to run his life.  Yeah, I saw that, too.  Isn't that hysterical?  That's awesome.  I must have seen it on Dig, then.  I thought, what a great idea.  What a great idea.  CBS, that's a programmer for you.  Other ways we can use versioning to save our time in life.  Did you get a cross tattooed on your hand, David Breger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's from going to a place last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's from his Bot.  The gangster days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You show your ID, pay your cover charge.  I didn't know churches were doing that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Went to the bottom of the hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Another question.  I don't know if we answered that question.  Adobe, Macromedia, bad idea.  What are you going to do?  It's your life, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As long as they don't make it more like Go Live,  I've always been a fan of Dreamweaver.  I like Dreamweaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do, too.  I am a Dreamweaver guy.  When they bought Homesight, it didn't kill Homesight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on whether they plan to close one of the product  lines down or to do that really horrifying thing where they try  to streamline multiple products.  One, unified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, don't you?  Why don't you put on these headphones?  Was it you, Alex, who told me what the plans were?  That Adobe was going to keep, maybe it was Burt Monroe,  Adobe was going to keep Illustrator but drop Freehand.  Freehand's dead.  That would make sense.  I don't know if I know what the answer is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but I think that most likely Freehand's out.  Illustrator is by far.  Nobody's going to cry over that.  Except for the guys using Freehand.  Both of them.  Yeah, all three of them.  Exactly.  Go Live is probably the one that's  probably the most threatened.  I mean, Dreamweaver is kind of the standard.  The gold standard.  Yeah, so I think those are the big things.  Are you a Go Live user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that why you're worried?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm more of a Macromedia or a Swish user.  Swish is a little more.  Swish instead of Flash.  Yeah, Swish.  Because they have a lot of the features,  like the scripting language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Swish is going to be OK.  I mean, Swish is not affected by this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just more concerned with less of a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's always bad, right?  Yeah, but I think, I don't know, most people I knew that were  doing, like most people who were doing like artistic,  like just artists who just want to throw something up.  They were using Go Live because it was connected to Photoshop.  And the people who wanted more technical background,  who needed bigger sites, things that were robust,  JavaScript and stuff like that.  Tended to be more Dreamweaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's where Dreamweaver really excels in embedding objects,  and scripting objects, and things like that.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the deal with Photoshop Elements, he says,  coming out just for PC users?  Just for PC and Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's actually PC first.  Adobe's kind of going, well, we're  going to put one out for Mac.  But it is interesting that they're not  syncing them all up.  What they said is that it's important to,  with the Pro apps, to keep them all synced.  So the CS2 will continue to be synced.  But with the consumer apps, they were like, it's less important.  And we have more users that are PC users.  And so they kind of went that way.  But it's an interesting thing that Adobe  keeps on moving towards more and more of the PC side of things.  And I think there were rumors for years  that Apple had an Intel OS that was running.  And now there's been rumors for less years  that Apple has a Photoshop killer that's floating around,  that they won't unleash unless the day Adobe releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the cyanide pill.  Well, yeah, you laugh, but it's exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, what it is is the day Adobe drops Photoshop on the Mac,  if that ever happened, Apple releases basically something  really cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, is it based on the GIMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'd do, is I'd base it on GIMP.  Rumors are it's based on GIMP.  It would have to be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have they talked to your buddy down there at G4?  No, no, they haven't talked to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever happened to the stuff that came out of it?  By the way, I just want to say, I  won't make a release that those are all rumors  that I've heard not from Apple.  He does not know anything.  I don't know anything.  I think I know more about what Apple's doing than what Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is doing.  The big rumor is that Apple is going to slipstream some new  iPods out.  They snuck some Mac mini upgrades out.  Didn't tell anybody.  They upgraded the mini this week.  That was kind of wild.  You know what they're doing?  They're keeping the flame going because they're  afraid people are going to stop buying Macs waiting  for Intel.  So they're going to kind of slightly do everything,  sneaky it out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the Intel is, I mean,  the thing I'm most excited about is being able to run  everything on one box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want a power plug with a Pentium M. That's what I want.  That's going to be great.  I agree.  That's going to be the thing.  And then, yeah, you could dual boot, or better yet,  seamless Windows with a Windows window and a Mac window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting because I don't think, Apple, obviously,  it's great for them because it's a hardware,  they're a hardware company.  And for Microsoft, in a lot of ways,  it's great for them too because they can sell more operating  systems.  They're not a hot.  So in many ways, because they have virtual PCs,  so they'll be able to build something that's really,  really fast.  The only people that are going to be upset are more like Dell  and Gateway have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be interesting to see what actually finally  ships in June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to issue an invitation right now for Steve Jobs  and Bill Gates.  When they do that big hug, they can do it on Twitter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, guys, just remember who your friends are.  No, that's the wrong way to approach it.  Any other stories anybody wants to cover?  We've got to wrap this thing up.  I want to thank Alex Lindsay and the Pixel Core for providing  audio.  You know, I really let go of it this time.  I'm not even wearing headphones.  That's how much I've let go of Twit.  Hopefully, that'll be a good thing.  We'll see.  If the sound quality sucks, ladies and gentlemen,  you know who to blame.  It's only me.  And remember, you've got to edit out those four letter words.  We are.  OK, very important.  Because we thank AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth  for this.  And one of the conditions of AOL Radio,  I think it's a fine one, is that there be no ads and no  profanity.  There were no ads during this broadcast, were there?  AOL.  AOL Radio.  That's the only ad.  AOLmusic.com.  Thank them for the bandwidth.  Thanks to Dorothy Yamamoto for the Twit logo.  I'm getting more and more stuff with Twits on it.  Hats, t-shirts.  The folks at ThinkGeek, I'm pretty sure,  are going to come through.  Now, is that going to get you in trouble, Patrick, if they  have?  Only with Jinx.  OK.  Well, yeah, you've got a Jinx relationship.  Is Jinx going to get mad at us?  Actually, we both have a Jinx relationship.  Yeah, they're just buddies of ours.  It doesn't matter.  They're not going to get mad.  Nah, they can trust us.  Because Jinx wasn't going to do action figures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, you want the Leo Laporte action figure.  I don't care about Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to have Patrick and Kevin go, grrr, grrr, grrr.  That's my hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, I remember the Mendel image of an action figure.  And it just keeps going sideways on me.  I can't quite picture it.  I have to make the John C. Dvorak one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How many of you would buy a John C. Dvorak, I get in a spam  action figure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With the pull string in the back.  With the pull string in the back, yeah.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get no spam.  Of course you would.  I would buy it.  Check out my blog at deepdangle.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  You pull the string, it says dvorak.org slash blog.  I think that's a good product.  John had to sign off on that one.  He used buttons now.  Anyway, unfortunately, Jen Frazier,  who's our ThinkGeek liaison, is on vacation.  But as soon as she gets back from vacation,  which has been six weeks, we will make that move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many people work at ThinkGeek now?  I don't know.  It's got to be like everybody did everything,  depending on what the most crushing emergency was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a cool organization.  I think it's a good one for us to partner with, don't you?  And they have wonderful t-shirts.  And not just t-shirts, though.  See, I want blankets.  I want the whole thing.  I want hats.  Bedspreads.  I want action figures.  You want a Leo Laporte edition wardrobe.  I already got a Leo Laporte boxer shorts.  I don't need any more of those.  They don't sell well, by the way.  Is this your sucker suit?  They do not sell well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it's because I'm well as the Wil Wheaton thongs.  No, yeah.  That's a very bad image in my head right now.  Thank you.

Transcript:  Sorry about that.

Transcript:  Actually, the best Western where we're staying is right  around the corner.  It has free Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why I booked the CD motel.  It's got the scariest casino you've ever seen.  The best Western?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks like somebody's living room that hasn't been  touched since the mid-'60s.  Where is this?  It makes a terrible Herbst-Schaubuck scale.
