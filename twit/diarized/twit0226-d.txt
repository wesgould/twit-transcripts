Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, John.  Hey, I just got in from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You got in from China, the Great Wall hat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it at the Great Wall.  That's neat.  What do you think I paid for this hat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  43 yuan.  Two bucks.  Two bucks.  I know.  You know, stuff's cheap in China.  They have a long bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what I used to have for it, keeps me away from the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those not watching the video, he's now bonking the mic with the bill of his cap.  That's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That way I can't get too close.  I can't overmodulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  I need that.  I need that.  Yeah, you do.  Mic away.  Also here, Lisa Bettany from the beautiful Vancouver, Washington.  Hi, Lisa.  It's great to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vancouver, Washington?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean Vancouver, Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vancouver, Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, isn't that like just over the border?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's the joke of it.  It's across from Portland.  Oh, that's very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually quite a drive.  So did they steal your name or did you steal their name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like to think that we were the first Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were because Gassy Jack blew up the gas works there in 1802 and that was the founding.  No, I know my Vancouver history.  You're pretty amazed, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the Vancouver name came from the island.  Wasn't Vancouver Island named before the city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, I'm just going to hold the camera on Lisa until she says something.  Let us Google.  She's Wikipediaing.  There you have it.  Are you a Van?  Lisa, you're not.  No, she's a native of Saskatoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saskatoon is the Paris of Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Paris of Saskatchewan.  I'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what somebody told me once.  I've never been there.  I've always wanted to visit Saskatoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I know from Saskatoon is the show Corner Gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a college town.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Saskatoon itself is a really pretty city.  There's lots of rivers and bridges and that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you got out of there as soon as you could, admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like the cold.  She doesn't have the Saskatoon accent.  She doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can put it on though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're talking.  Is that how they talk in Saskatoon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Worst.  I don't think so.  I think that's more like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Edmonton.  That's Alberta.  Edmonton is wow.  That's Alberta.  That's how they talk in Alberta.  And this tour of Canadian accents brought to you by Ford Sink.  No, no, I won't do that.  And let's also introduce Andrew Warner.  I'm so glad Andrew's here.  I've wanted to get Andrew on the show for some time, actually.  He interviewed me for his website, Mixergy.com.  Andrew's an entrepreneur, a man who had a very young age, founded a business that reached  30 million dollars in annual sales, cashed out after the web bust.  You survived and did well.  And then I guess you're just kind of taking it easy, living a life of Riley, and you decided  to start a site called Mixergy.  How would you describe Mixergy, Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know the way that you guys on MacBreak Weekly investigate insanely every Apple product  that comes out?  Yeah, obsessively.  I do the same thing with internet businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you study entrepreneurship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  I want to know everything about how they got their first users, how they made their first  few dollars, how they grew, how they sold.  That kind of in-depth conversation is what I do with entrepreneurs like you.  You came on Mixergy, as you said, and you talked about how you built up Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Harry Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferriss, Jimmy Wales, that kind of people.  And the reason you're on, we're going to talk about this in a bit, you just interviewed  Chandra Sekhar Rathakrishnan, the guy who is building the juju, the guy who took the  Crunchpad from Mike Arrington.  And we're going to get his side of the story.  I'm fascinated to hear what happened.  And it's not the same story we've heard so far.  Huh?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that should be interesting.  We have all the tech news too.  But before we go too much farther, I want to mention somebody who's a friend of Twit,  Roz Savage, who did a show with us for a long time.  Roz Rose, she's the woman who was rowing across the Atlantic.  She was the first woman to row across the Atlantic and then she is rowing across the  Pacific right now with the idea to become the first woman to row solo across the Pacific  Ocean.  She's doing it stage by stage.  She completed stage one and stage two.  We covered those with the Roz Rose podcast.  She walked to Copenhagen from London for the Copenhagen Climate Summit.  In Copenhagen, everything she owns was stolen.  Her computer, her laptop, her phone, all her gear, everything was stolen.  Last night my coat and bag were stolen while I was at an event in Copenhagen.  In my bag were my laptop and iPhone.  I have no insurance, no money.  She walked there.  No ride home and now no credit cards.  It's a long walk.  She's an adventurer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But from London, how do you walk to Copenhagen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there probably was a ferry involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's not the same as walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She walked while she was on the ferry.  She probably kept stepping or ran to keep up with the ferry.  Anyway, there is a fundraiser.  This is the last day of the fundraiser.  Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield organized this to try to get enough money together to get Roz  at least kind of somewhat replace her stuff.  It's on giveforward.com.  If you go to giveforward.com slash Roz's stuff, R-O-Z-S-S-T-U-F-F, last chance to donate.  They're about halfway to the goal.  They've raised a lot of money, $3,600, but they need $6,500 to replace everything including  her laptop and her phone.  Roz is a great person.  What is that you're flashing, John?  What is that?  Visit channeldeforac.com.  Only John would be crass enough to plug Channel Deforac while I'm giving an impassioned plea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should get the girls some gear from some of these vendors and just have them ship their  new equipment.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  But you know, I think it's kind of cool that her fans have gotten together and they've  raised so much money.  So I wanted to give that a plug.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did she do what she had to bus stop?  She turned around.  Boom, her stuff was stolen.  I mean, how much thievery is there in Denmark?  Well, you wouldn't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I thought Denmark was like safe and you know, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's the Vancouver of Denmark.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Copenhagen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been to wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen.  It's a beautiful city.  I've been there a few times.  It's nice.  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Tivoli Gardens.  Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never made the gardens, unfortunately.  Well, you got to go.  I was with kids and you know, it's kind of an amusement park.  I was there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Andrew Warner, you got to speak with Chandra Sekhar.  Chandra, he's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, you never introduced me, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe I did.  Remember the hat that bumps into the microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean this?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, you turn it into my mom and I'm not sure how I feel about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your mom's my biggest fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She loves you.  She said, you cut that part out where I said I was his biggest fan.  I said, no, I didn't cut that out.  You were in there, mom.  Mom got a lot of fan mail.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I was just kidding.  Mom got a lot of fan mail.  Andrew's turned bright green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's going on, Andrew?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Where's my camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's plugging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should I turn my camera off and back on?  I see myself in the little window on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, plug it in.  I don't know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been broadcasting it.  Looks like it's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So let's hear the story, the real story or one of the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you interviewed and you can hear this interview at MixerG.com.  This week you interviewed at Chandra.  Tell us his side of the story.  Maybe we should recap that Mike Arrington at TechCrunch a year ago announced he was  going to build a touch tablet called the CrunchPad that was going to be kind of open source,  community developed.  He at some point teamed up with Chandra's company, which is called what's it called?  Inclusion Garage.  And then they were about to debut this a couple of weeks ago and the two days before the debut,  according to Mike, Fusion Garage shows up, sends him an email saying, that's it.  We're taking the prototype.  We're going to sell it on our own.  They renamed it the JujuPad.  Mike says we're going to court, but the CrunchPad is dead.  All we've heard so far is mostly Mike's point of view.  And then now they did do a demo of the JujuPad.  We've seen video of it.  What does Chandra say happened, Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I saw that demo.  I had him demo it in the interview.  And this device is beautiful.  And it just reaffirms our excitement for a tablet.  You see it and you start to instantly understand where it fits into people's lives.  And I could see myself flipping through magazines, watching videos on this device.  So what Chandra says is that he had the device before he ever got together with Michael Arrington.  He says he met Mike at TechCrunch 50.  He showed him a prototype of the device.  And Michael Arrington got so excited about it that he said, I want to buy out your business.  Right there, same day that he'd been talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was this after Arrington has said we're going to do a CrunchPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  As I understand it, yes.  Okay.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait, let's get the timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is kind of what, John, this is kind of what you hypothesized happened.  Yeah.  So what's the timeline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The timeline, I actually don't know the exact dates on this.  I don't care about the dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know the sequence of events.  I see.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it sounds like Arrington had announced the CrunchPad and began development of it.  TechCrunch 50, was it this year's TechCrunch 50 or a year ago's TechCrunch 50?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A year ago, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So it would have been very shortly after the CrunchPad was announced then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So Michael Arrington decides instead of building it himself, this guy, according to Chandra,  Chandra's got a device that's already starting to, that's already getting close.  He's got a prototype.  He says, I want to buy your business.  Chandra is getting, Chandra gets excited that he has a potential buyout and he starts to  talk with Michael Arrington and his people about how they can, how they can work together,  how they can buy out his business.  He says that the, it sounds to me like he's, he's being a little mysterious here about  what went on behind the scenes, partially because of the lawsuit.  But what he's saying is that because there wasn't a buyout, he couldn't put the name  CrunchPad on his device.  And because there wasn't a buyout, Arrington and the TechCrunch people didn't contribute  nearly enough to claim, to claim partial ownership of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he says that basically Mike defaulted on his agreement to buy him out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  And he also says that the guys from TechCrunch had nothing to do with the development of  the pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Mike says we bought a house, we had developers from a Fusion Garage and CrunchPad developers  all working together in a house.  Does Chandra deny that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He denies that they've had any, any input in the creation of the device.  He says that he and his people designed it, everything from the software to the hardware,  to the user experience.  And I press them on this over and over again because, you know, user experience is tough.  And for a company that's never created hardware like this before to come out and create something  so intuitive to me sound a little suspicious, but he kept saying that he, that he and his  guys had the experience to build this thing and they did it on their own.  And he also says that that time that the TechCrunch people were in Singapore, where TechCrunch  says that they were at Fusion Garage's office helping them think through the pad.  Chandra says they were only in his office once.  The only reason that they flew to Singapore was to talk about a potential buyout.  It sounds like he thinks that TechCrunch was dragging their keels, that they weren't making  this buyout happen fast enough.  And if they're not going to buy them out, they haven't contributed anything to the pad.  Chandra took the pad and named it and started selling it on his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the chronology.  I'm looking at Wikipedia.  According to Wikipedia, the CrunchPad project was announced July 2008.  TechCrunch 50 in 2008 was in September.  So Mike would have announced this in July and three months later, four months later,  three months later, I guess, seen this device at TechCrunch 50.  And flipped.  Well, now, and now he did have a group led by Louis Monnier working on a CrunchPad and  they had prototypes.  They had prototypes that they showed in early 2009, in April 2009.  In June, they had the near final industrial design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it their prototype or was it the other guys?  Was it the Indians?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Harrington writes that the hardware, software and industrial design improvements seen in  prototype C, the third prototype, were all driven by Fusion Garage.  And this is a quote from TechCrunch.  But one thing I've learned about hardware in the last year is that you need partners  to actually make things happen.  And the credit for what we saw today goes entirely to the Fusion Garage team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was the Fusion Garage product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like it.  Yeah, he's admitted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what Chandra kept saying over and over again.  That TechCrunch on their blog in person kept giving them credit for designing, developing  this pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In July 2009, it was reported that Arrington had founded a company of 14 employees around  the tablet in Singapore.  But you're saying Chandra said that Singapore office was our office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, he's saying that as far as I know, TechCrunch should not have an office in Singapore.  But Chandra is saying that the TechCrunch people only visited his office once.  Which sounds surprising that they go all the way to Singapore and only be in the office  one time.  Even if you're doing due diligence to buy out a company, I'd expect after all that trip  to go into their office and spend some time with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got a real case of he said he said here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But at least now we see both sides of it.  We see that Chandra is saying that he did the whole thing on his own and TechCrunch  didn't have any input in it.  TechCrunch is saying they developed it and these guys stole it from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In regards to the one visit to the office in Singapore, it's possible that he was going  to Singapore for more than the one thing.  There's a lot of things to do when you're in Singapore and we could have had meetings  of all sorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's true too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, so I don't think they took a trip to Singapore to stop by and say hello and  then take off and go back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the bigger question though.  So you think that there's a market for this based on seeing it, Andrew?  You think this is a...  And at what price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's stunning and there's nothing like actually seeing the device, especially after we saw  that ESPN video where they showed what they would do if there was a tablet out there.  When you see what magazines have in mind for this thing and you see the device itself,  you start to imagine how it would fit into your life.  Now I don't want another device.  I've got my MacBook.  I've got my iPhone.  I buy too many gadgets as it is.  But if you think about it, this thing is about the size of a magazine, a little thicker than  a magazine.  You could see yourself on the couch reading a magazine on this thing.  You can see yourself in bed reading a magazine with this thing.  In fact, you think about the Kindle, which only does one thing, which is read books.  You compare it to a tablet, whether it comes from these guys or comes from Apple or someone  else, you say, who would want the Kindle that only does one thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think, Lisa?  You're a gadget hound.  I am a gadget hound.  Is a tablet attractive to you as something you'd want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say that I wasn't swept up in the Kindle Fury at all.  Well, you couldn't be because you're in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right?  Exactly.  It doesn't work in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  But even the concept of it, I actually read a lot of stuff on my iPhone.  When I'm not reading on my iPhone, I have a laptop or I don't know.  I guess the concept hasn't really caught on.  I like to work at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you could buy a device that's twice the size of the iPhone to read your books  on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then I'd have that and an iPhone and a point and shoot and a camera and a laptop.  I guess if we're looking at devices becoming more all-inclusive and getting rid of all  the bits and pieces, that's a good step forward.  But when I've already invested in all the stuff that I've got, I don't know if I want  to add another piece of gear to my bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it sounds like you want the iPhone to do everything and are content with the iPhone  even as a reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I love my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You haven't drank the Apple Kool-Aid to the extent that if Apple came out with a tablet  in the next nine months that you would say, okay, well, I'll buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because I haven't even hopped on board with the new MacBook Pros.  I kind of have my...  This is kind of my feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've got what I need and I don't have the money to just go spending on every new little  gizmo.  I think what you're talking about isn't something that would appeal to me in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, haven't we seen tablets already from a lot of companies?  Microsoft tried to do this a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the UMPC, the Ultramobile PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have seen maybe four iterations of tablet computing going back to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Going back to Grid and Slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Going back further and further and further and they keep going back.  And the problem, I still believe, they keep improving the technology.  The public still doesn't buy them.  And I think it has something to do with the price.  I think they're just too expensive.  People already have a laptop.  If you can get it...  Unless they bring them down to about half the price of a laptop, I don't see them going  anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the key.  Crunchpad was supposed to be 200 and now the Juju is what?  400, Andrew?  Or 499.  Yeah.  That does seem like a pretty high price point when you get a netbook for $200.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, why would you want that when you could have a netbook or something that could do  everything and you could type on and...  Yeah.  I'm not falling in love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our friend feed chatters say, hey, you remember...  Yuppies.  Yuppies won.  Status symbol.  Yup, it's a yuppie.  Yuppies are dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the yuppies are dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the yuppies, yeah, they got burned out.  They got wiped out.  They're gone, man.  There's no yuppies here, man.  All the yuppies is gone.  Well, so it's interesting.  What do you think is going to happen, Andrew?  Do you think this is...  You love this.  Do you think this is a market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do.  I think that now we're starting to see content being potentially created for this device.  I could see people getting into it as a laptop replacement.  I'm not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you right now.  where there's a lawsuit swirling around it, where there's...  Why?  Because...  What difference does it make?  Because you don't know if that company is going to be around.  So what?  People care about that, John.  People don't buy products from companies that are not going to be around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but what difference does it make?  You buy the product, it either works or it doesn't, and if the company goes broke, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what?  No, look at Arcos.  Arcos has been making this kind of product for years, but because they're in France and  nobody's ever heard of them.  We even gave them the Best of CES Award in 2003, I think, for their early Arcos products.  But this is where Apple has such an advantage, and Amazon too has such an advantage.  They have the supply chain.  It's soup to nuts.  You know the company's going to be around.  They're going to support...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait.  I think you contradicted yourself.  Is Arcos still in business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are, but they're not exactly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's to be a prerequisite for what you just said, that they have to stay in business.  They stayed in business.  It didn't do them any good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They survived.  I don't think it's exactly thriving.  I mean, people buy...  Arcos has a tablet.  Did you know that Arcos has a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As far as I'm concerned, if I buy a piece of gear and the company goes broke the next  day, as long as the product still keeps working, I'm only going to have it for a couple of  years anyway.  I mean, I'm not going to keep the thing until...  I mean, look at how many you have, for example.  Let's take a look at the iPod.  How many iPods do you personally own?  Oh, God.  Well, is it triple digits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like candy.  No, I mean, probably half a dozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, John, I think a better question is how many times have you returned one of your computers  to Apple or had them replace a screen or had them fix a keyboard?  These devices do potentially have trouble, whether it's scratches or dead pixels.  You want a company to stand behind it and replace it and support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My juju is broken.  Who's going to fix my juju?  I broke my juju.  I just even...  The whole thing isn't...  You broke your what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they're calling it, the juju.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking of something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the name's a bit off-putting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, more than a bit.  Oh, well.  All right.  So, enough said.  Somebody just pointed out that I just bought a Pioneer Plasma TV even though they're going  to stop making them in a month.  Aha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got you.  They nailed you.  That's what I was looking for, that piece of titbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John's always looking to nail me.  Well, not...  Yeah.  Not literally, but just, you know, you're always trying to catch me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just catch you.  So, you're trying to make sure your game is...  You're on your game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I just feel like, look, Pioneer's not going anywhere.  They're just not going to make the...  I wouldn't buy...  Would you buy a TV from Joe's TV and Appliance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you want to buy it from a solvent company.  I think Fusion Garage is the tech equivalent of Joe's TV and Appliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think the other thing that's hurting them is this potential Apple tablet.  We're all standing back and waiting to see if that comes out.  Nobody wants to buy the Juju or any other device.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other shoe has to drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  Yeah.  Until Apple says one way or the other.  Until we know that they're going to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And rumors are that may be nine months.  That may be September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, would that be the Juju shoe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Juju shoe.  Okay, we have a name for the show anyway.  Let me write that down.  Juju shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it has to drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Juju shoe is about to drop.  Hey, we're going to take a break and come back with more with our great guests from  Mixer G, Mr. Andrew Warner.  John's putting up his card.  John C. Dvorak from ChannelDvorak.com.  It looks like you printed that out.  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like you're prepared.  I just did it a minute ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this so like you can change clothes?  Is this like the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to go back to the wardrobe change.  This is monasty screaming.  This is how I get to see what these different outfits look like and then I can determine  what I have to do to look good on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa, do you know any other guys who call their clothes outfits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe a few, but they're very Metro.  Yeah.  John's Metro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John is pure Metro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If anybody's not Metro, it's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what John is, but you're right.  I don't think it's Metro.  Lisa Bettany is also here for MostlyLisa.com.  We're going to continue with our conversation in just a bit, but I do want to remind you  that Ford is just breaking new territory all the time with the amazing Ford SYNC.  I hear we're going to hear some great stuff from them at CES.  We'll be there to cover it.  In fact, Lisa, we're trying to figure out...  I think we're going to get you to drive my Mustang down.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Me drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't know there was driving involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I thought Kiki was going to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Kiki's flying.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be driving by myself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll find some people.  So here's the deal.  So when we first started our CES thing, I thought it was just going to be fun.  So I booked eight first class tickets on Virgin America to Vegas for the staff.  It was going to be their reward for hard work.  But then CES got heated up.  We started getting interest.  We started...  Well, now we're going to cover it.  So we're going down, but we've got those tickets, but we now are now shipping equipment down.  I think Cody's going to be driving the equipment down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you want me to drive your gear down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we got a guy driving the gear down.  I want you to drive my brand new 2010 Ford Mustang, candy apple red 19 inch wheels, V8.  Can you drive a stick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this whole idea has just gone to hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lisa, you're not supposed to admit that.  This whole idea has just gone...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can take lessons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can learn on my Mustang.  Okay.  Well, see, the idea was Ford was going to sponsor this trip.  We were going to stream Lisa driving to CES, the road to CES with Lisa and the Mustang,  listening to the tunes on Ford Sync.  Hey, I got to play you something.  Ford Sync is the hands-free Bluetooth music search, turn-by-turn navigation.  I got an unsolicited email from John Belmont, who is a good friend, an old radio guy, many,  many years.  We heard him on AP radio news on...  How was he on CBS radio news?  He's currently on POTUS on XM.  His brother, Jeff Detro, is also a very well-known radio guy.  He was with Jeff and Jer on the morning team in San Diego.  Jeff bought...  He's never heard the show before, but he bought a Ford Flex and sent John this voicemail message.  By the way, John's given us permission to replay this, as has Jeff.  This is unsolicited testimonial.  I'm going to let you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so Lisa was up in my car and I actually bought my car this time.  I bought a new Ford.  So check this out.  You hook up your iPod to your Ford and it's probably...  I think I have 4,000 songs on there.  I'm about to have my CDs loaded, right?  Check this out.  Here's how you play songs.  I'm going to put you on speakerphone.  All right, so right now I'm listening to a great Berg Bagrax song, Magic Moments by

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Terry Colwell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like listening to something else.  I'm just going to call it up.  All right.  Play track, South American Getaway.  Thanks for a second.  And...  All right, now how cool was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an unsolicited testimonial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I basically have like 10,000 songs on this mammoth iPod that cost me $200 for Amazon.  All right, here we go again.  Ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a guy who just got his Ford synced and completely unsolicited calls his brother  and says, this thing is amazing and does a demo for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not kidding.  Here we go again.  Here we go.  One more time.  He's leaving a message.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to tell you, when you become a Ford Sync owner, this is the kind of crazy message  you leave.  Thank you, Jeff Dettro for letting us play that and John Belmont for passing it along.  You got to try the Ford Sync.  Go to syncmyridepodcast.com and check it out.  Or the best thing to do, go to your nearby Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer and say, I want  to test drive Ford Sync and come see us at CES.  Watch Lisa Bettany strip the gears on my brand new Ford Mustang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm an okay driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it'll be fun.  We'll figure this out.  We want you to be at CES, but we need somebody.  We'll fly you to San Francisco.  You don't have to drive from Vancouver.  In fact, you know what we should probably just do is drive you to just outside of Vegas  and then put you in the car.  Drop her off.  Drop you off.  And just push the car.  Yeah.  And then you can just, yeah, you can roll the car into town.  Yeah, no, this was a great idea Kiki had.  She forgot.  She neglected to ask you a couple of things.  Now John's got his new outfit on.  He is wearing the Boise State Broncos t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a t-shirt that somebody says, but this is the Kansas Jayhawks hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kansas Jayhawks, baby.  Number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, are you in a rap crew?  You have like a special like, you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do they call that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do they call that when you're in a group of rappers?  Is it a crew?  Or that's Mardi Gras?  That's it.  That's it.  You're the crew.  Oh, golly.  Good golly, Miss Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kansas Jayhawks, baby.  Number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number one.  Yeah, baby.  Jayhawks.  All right.  Let's let's talk about some other stories.  Australia.  Tech stories.  Australia.  You know, we have a lot of listeners in Australia who are just going crazy about this.  Google, in fact, has posted a blog mandatory.  The government in Australia plans to introduce mandatory ISP filtering, the first of its kind  among Western democracies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Professors Katherine Lumbee, Lila Green and John Hartley untangling the net, the scope  of content caught by mandatory internet filtering has found the kinds of content that could  be prohibited under the proposed filtering regime includes not just child sexual abuse  material, which of course is always, always the, you know, the stalking horse for this  kind of filtering, but also socially and politically controversial material, educational content  on safer drug drug use, politically controversial crimes such as euthanasia, content that's  merely unpleasant or unpalatable to the regime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why Dvorak and censor will be censored there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now Johnny Worthington is in is in Australia.  He's listening to the show right now.  And John, I would love to get your opinion on this.  Let me give you a, let me give you a phone number to call Johnny, because I would very  much like to get your opinion on this one.  You can use Skype to do this, Johnny.  Just call that number, Johnny.  Call Johnny.  We're waiting for you.  Like saying Johnny.  Hey, Johnny.  Hey, Johnny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you call?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  Do that again.  Yeah, you do that.  He'll call in a minute.  Do that again.  That was I want to call now.  Hey, Johnny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want to hear from you.  Why don't you just call?  How do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you do that voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She just has that voice built into her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it just built in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just there.  It's just ready to come out whenever.  It doesn't seem like, there he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Johnny.  Hello.  So what's a, hello Johnny.  Can you hear us?  Yes, we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From Brisbane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Brisbane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's part of it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's the story with this ISP filtering?  Basically, the whole issue comes down to is that parents in Australia, and this is where  it's pitched at, parents in Australia don't really understand the internet.  So rather than actually taking an interest in their kids or monitoring their kids, they're  actually, it's easier for the politicians to go, no, no, wait, we'll do it for you.  You don't have to think about the scary computers.  Let us do it for you.  And then they put in these filtering and the problem with it is it doesn't really work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the biggest problem with all internet filtering.  It's crap.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's total, it just doesn't work because the people who really want to find the stuff  either aren't doing it through the normal channels or find things, ways around it.  And the people who are looking for it, the people who aren't looking for it are just  going to get caught up in the web.  So it's like, it's basically just pure political crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hasn't this been kind of floating around for at least a year or two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has.  The only problem is they haven't been able to make it work.  That's the big delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that the first time they pitched this, didn't they offer a free filter to all  families on their own computers?  And it was cracked the first hour.  It was cracked.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they actually still have that.  And the biggest problem is that it's not opt-in, it's opt-out.  Sorry, it's not opt-out, it's opt-in.  So everyone gets switched on by default.  So rather than educating people and saying, look, hey, I actually think putting mandatory  filtering on ISPs is a good idea.  I think if parents can't understand and look after their kids, this is a really, really  good thing to do.  But they should choose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should choose it.  So what is the status now?  Is this law?  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of weird because our parliament's sort of on a break at the moment for Christmas  and everything like that.  So they've tried to bring it in and it's not necessarily working.  And they've just finished the trials and now they've gone, right, this is cool, we're  going to go ahead and do it.  But they're still going to get it through the parliament, I believe, the last little  bit, they've got to go through the national parliament.  And the biggest problem for us is that geeks in general or people who use a lot of computers  are very easily sidelined.  So if we make a lot of noise, they can go, oh, don't worry.  Like if you speak out against censorship or filtering against child pornography, everyone's  going to go, hmm, why are you doing that?  Rather than actually thinking of the issue and going, no, this is actually about freedom  information.  I mean, I'm a 29-year-old male.  I should have the right to view what I want on the internet.  The only problem is it's very hard for me to say that without someone going, oh, do  you want to look at kiddie porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a strongman argument.  It's ridiculous.  They've made this thing the, you know, like the be all end all of all decision making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because it's a sacred cow, you cannot, straw man, sacred cow, you take your choice.  You cannot.  The sacred straw man.  It's a sacred straw man.  You cannot stand up and say, I'm against it because then they can easily say, oh, so you  believe in child pornography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why don't someone think of the children?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think of the children.  But that's not what this is about.  The question I have is why does the government want to do this?  Is there some other reason or are they just stupid?  Because, no, it's actually very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they can say to the parents, look, you don't have to understand the internet.  You don't have to stand over your kid's shoulders and watch what they're doing.  We will do that for you.  Let the big government take care of it for you.  And it's kind of funny because the current government in there now is sort of my political  leaning, but I'm looking at them wanting to slap them across the face going, no, this  is stupid.  What are you doing?  Johnny, I'm so glad you could call in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you're practically always there in our FriendFeed room.  Johnny does a really great FriendFeed podcast called FunderCats.  And where would we find FunderCats?  FunderCats is at FunderCats.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's 2 F's for awesome.  2 F's for awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  FunderCats.com.  Johnny, it's great to talk to you.  And I'd like to add, we're starting to do something on the network where we can get  people to join us.  We're starting to do something on the network where we do world news check-ins.  We call it our Tech World Beat.  And I'd love to add you to that list of people so we can, as we call around, talk to people.  I would love to be on it.  Thank you, Johnny.  I really appreciate it.  Johnny Worthington from Brisbane.  I thought best to get this story from somebody who's actually living there.  Kind of a crazy idea.  But do you say, John, this is the kind of thing that you see in other countries doing?  Me?  Yeah.  Why would they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, half of Russia right now is filtered away.  Really?  There's a, in fact, in Brazil where I'm fairly well known, half the country can't get to  my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this, is there governmental filtering is not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are mostly ISP filtering right now.  Okay.  But why are they doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's their interest in it?  Maybe that's a competitive thing if they say, hey, come to our ISP, we'll protect your kids.  Maybe.  But I'm fine with that because then I would say, okay, have fun and I'll be somewhere  else.  Andrew, what's it like?  Andrew's in Buenos Aires right now.  What's the internet's, you obviously have great bandwidth in Argentina.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And frankly, that's one of the reasons why I decided to come to Argentina.  I think governments need to understand that they no longer have a chokehold on their people.  We can fly, we can work from whatever country we want, and we're more and more going to  pick the countries that have freedom and that freedom to us is represented by what  kind of internet access they give us because that's what exposes us to ideas.  That's what lets the world hear the ideas that we have.  And if I'm going to start a company, I don't know that I would go to Australia and start  it because of this.  If I were an entrepreneur in Australia, I'd consider leaving and going someplace where  I have the full internet at my disposal.  And I could see why ISPs actually would want to be a part of this.  It seems like ISPs are bothered that anything could go on their networks.  It lets them off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want control.  And there's a subtle threat that if you don't do this, then you could be prosecuted as transporting  child porn because they've been let off the hook up to now as common carriers that they're  not responsible, just as the phone company is not responsible for what you do on a phone,  they're not responsible for the data that goes across their network.  But if something like this happens, then it's kind of the implication is, well, if you don't  do it, we might hold you responsible.  And then what are they going after next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it going to be what we watch?  Is it going to be BitTorrent is also the next step after that?  And then it's competitive phone services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somewhere behind all this lurks the RIAA and the MPAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do I feel like that's the case?  I just always think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you feel that?  Yeah, I wonder why.  Because it's always the case.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These guys, they're such jerks.  All right.  Moving along.  Another story.  Have anybody seen the BitTorrent avatar?  Oh, I mean, no, I'm sorry.  Did I say BitTorrent?  Anybody see Avatar yet in the theaters?  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you say?  No one's going to BitTorrent it because the experience is IMAX 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, why do you think it's IMAX 3D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how you bypass the copyright worries.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  You make it impossible to BitTorrent.  Although, get ready, the Blu-ray disc association, BOODA, has decided that on a specification  for delivering full 1080p high definition stereoscopic video on Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the mechanism here?  Those crappy glasses that get blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have to wear glasses at Avatar, too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't wear shuttered glasses.  Those are just polarizers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, they're doing something really weird with Avatar.  They're doing two different wavelengths, and then you wear glasses that aren't shuttered  and they aren't polarized.  They have filters for the different wavelengths, so they separate the image using filters.  It's a very interesting technology.  I didn't know this.  Yeah, no, this is how they're doing Avatar.  What technology is that?  I don't know.  Have you seen it, Leo?  I have not seen it, and I've heard mixed reviews.  Some people love it.  You guys seen it?  Okay, we got a couple of people in this.  Pull the microphone up there.  We got a couple of people in the studio who have apparently seen it.  It is actually...  Adam Jones, you're from LA.  That's correct.  Tell us about it.  Hello.  There you go.  So what did you think?  Avatar, thumbs up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gave it two thumbs up.  Oh, screw you.  No, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do know a bit about stereoscopic 3.  No, actually, Adam works.  He's a camera specialist for stop motion animation, so he actually knows a lot about this.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what this technology is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, the technology is it's digital projection, and it is using polarization.  And rather than wavelengths, it's left spiraling and right spiraling.  The Avatar is not using that.  It's not using digital 3D.  It is not doing it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that may be how they're going to do it with the Blu-ray.  Well, at least, you know, I talked to our home theater guy today on the radio show,  and he said they weren't using the spiraling.  I'm aware of the spiraling.  That's how everybody's been doing it up to now.  And now there's a...  They were using wavelength manipulation for the 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Is that for better color?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, you know, the real problem with all of this is you've got to wear these dorky  glasses, right?  It's Dolby 3D is what they're using, and it uses...  So it's from Dolby, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought the Dolby technology was all polarizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  I'll read this to you here.  Let me find this here.  I've got it.  I've got it.  I found a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Dolby's probably the leader in this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Avatar.  This is from facepunch.com, the Avatar 3D viewing guide.  It's using these tinted glasses, which...  I guess some of them might be using the IMAX spiraling.  It's really great technology.  I think IMAX is using spiraling.  If you go to a Dolby 3D studio or theater, this is the real D competitor.  Real D is what a lot of people are using.  Okay, I'm going to read you the different technologies.  Real D...  One of these days.  ...is the most widely installed 3D system in the U.S.  This is a regular, digitally protected theater using a 2K projector and a polarized 3D system.  That's polarization.  Pro's less ghosting than the IMAX 3D, which uses the spiral polarization you were talking about,  and crystal clear and sharp digital projection.  Glasses are brand new, and you can take them home with you,  so you don't have to share glasses as you do it on IMAX.  Good health.  You can buy your own Real D compatible 3D glasses in designer brands on the net.  Oh, boy.  The Dolby 3D, which is the lead competitor, uses a color wheel 3D system off a single 2K projector.  That's one of the advantages, one projector.  Glasses are slightly tinted red-green.  They're transparent, so screen brightness is not affected.  They're reported to be very comfortable, apparently less ghosting than Real D,  and a significant increase in the 3D effect.  The cons, slight color aberrations can occur in certain scenes across the red-green spectrum,  and glasses are reused.  So Avatar is being seen in three different ways.  You can get the IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're actually doing, they did all three technologies?  Apparently.  Well, it's, yeah, you can just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we can go see it three different ways.  Pick this theater.  Let's go, let's make it a field trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the same guide at facepunch.com says,  for God's sake, don't watch Avatar in a 2D theater.  This movie was, which by the way leaves me out because I don't have stereo vision.  I only use one eye at a time, so I can't see this.  This movie was made as a proof of concept for 3D movies.  It would be pointless.  You might as well watch The Wizard of Oz in black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is this whirling thing you're telling me about?  So, Adam Jones, describe this spiral technique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this what IMAX, I think this is what IMAX uses.  This is what Real D uses.  That's what Real D uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Real D has a digital projector, right?  So traditional film is made and is projected in 24 frames per second,  but Real D ups the resolution, I'm sorry, to about 124 hertz or 148 hertz.  Anyway, so...  So they have, because they have to do twice as many frames.  Right, right.  So you have two images, two oculars in your 3D projection.  That's how they keep it from looking interlaced?  Well, they aren't interlaced at all.  In fact, actually they are projecting, like I said, six frames per one frame at 24 frames per second.  Wow, very high.  And you have a screen in front that is synced to each image, so it flashes left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right,  for each one frame in a 24 frame per second cinema.  And then your glasses are passive.  So left eye is left spiraling and right eye is right spiraling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So by using spiral polarization, they don't have to have a shuttering.  So none of these use shuttering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the image is projected digitally, so it's digitally shuttered.  And then the ocular division is made by a screen in front of the projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you go to any of these three technologies without the glasses or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to separate the image because you're just looking at it on the same screen.  It'll look at it weird.  And you need that interocular division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I use my glasses from up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's the spiral polarization.  The real glasses are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IMAX was invented in Canada, in Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably some of my relatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, probably, because you're fully three dimensional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing.  Even now on Skype, I don't know how you're doing that, but you're three dimensional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it doesn't say how they're going to do this on TVs.  Do you know how they do it on TVs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some TVs are already 3D compatible.  In fact, they'll show you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they using one of these three technologies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're using the spiraling technology, but you need active glasses to filter out...  Shuttering glasses.  Right, to filter out each different ocular.  Yeah, that'll ruin you.  Well, actually, the glasses are fairly comfortable.  They're expensive. They're hundreds of dollars.  Right, and they're battery powered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got a problem with the glasses.  I mean, if you looked at the glasses when they first appeared, they didn't have these warnings out at first,  but after a couple of incidents, I suppose, now if you buy a set of these, any of the shuttering devices,  they tell you that if you're under, I think, the age of nine or something like that...  Cross seizures.  Well, no, it also does some screws up with your ocular nerve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. It's like Steve Martin in The Jerk.  He invented the handle that you put on your glasses, but it made everybody cross-eyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had great headaches from poor 3D.  Oh, this is not good.  You can really get eye strain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait to get this technology in my home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I talked to a lot of people who said they get headaches just using puttymon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting a headache thinking about it.  The format relies for the... this is for the new Buda Blu-ray spec.  It relies on an extension to the H.264 encoding standard.  It provides for a fallback to 2D output on players that can't decode it,  so you have to get a new player and a new TV.  It goes along with an update to the HDMI spec to support it.  It's doing something called MVC, Multi-View Video Coding.  It's an extension to the H.264 AVC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they'd spend more money on good writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just give me a story.  You know what the whole plot...  Okay, you saw the movie, Adam. Oh, you didn't see the movie.  Has anybody here seen Avatar?  What a bunch of lame geeks you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was released last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're supposed to go to the midnight show for the crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I usually... I was there for Watchmen. I did Up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't you glad you saw Watchmen before anyone else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That was pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. No. It was a crappy movie. That was the wrong answer.  What?  It was a god-awful film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I liked it.  See, I wait.  It wasn't that bad.  God-awful.  What's wrong with this?  Leo, let's go back to the way you said you see separate eyeballs.  You got one eyeball, something like a chameleon one eyeball.  Is this so you could...  So one of your eyeballs can just keep an eye on all that cash you're making?  I always got an eye on you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got to keep an eye on Dvorak.  Because you never know what he's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can look at that and still do the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was born that way.  It's something. I can't remember what it's called.  But it's strabismus or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Dvorak's going to go a little cross-eyed.  He's got one eye on you and your money and another eye on the sign that shows his website that he keeps flashing.  And his hat's pointing a third way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's crazy.  The man's insane.  As long as we're visiting channeldvorak.com, why don't we visit one of our fine sponsors?  How about that?  John, you may go baste your meat.  I always have to baste the meat.  In the middle of his silly show.  Actually, costume change for Mr. Dvorak.  I once saw Carol Channing.  I think it was at the Venetian Room in the Fairmont where they have all the great acts.  And she had a...  What do they call those screens? Changing screens?  Like every song, she'd go behind the changing screen and come out with a new outfit.  She wore 20 different outfits in one show.  You're like that, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to tell you a little bit about audible.com.  And I know, Andrew, you're an audible listener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me quote Jason Calacanis and say, oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody who spends any time...  See, Lisa, I was going to set you up in that Mustang with all the audible books.  You could listen to books driving down to Vegas.  It would have been so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can learn.  She can't drive a stick.  You can teach me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll teach you how to drive a stick.  I'm going to be teaching Abby and Henry, both my kids, to drive a stick.  We can have like a little driver...  Yeah, we'll have a driver training thing.  I'll just get a second break and steering wheel put in the car.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Audible is the leading provider of audiobooks.  More than 60,000.  I think it's now up to 70,000 downloadable titles across all types of literature, including fiction, nonfiction, periodicals.  And right now you can get a free book just by joining audible.  Actually, I'm going to give you two books.  Go to the Platinum plan, audible.com slash twit two.  Your first two books are free.  And Andrew, you got a recommendation for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got so many recommendations.  Let me give you one.  How long have you been an audio listener?  So long that my username on audible actually includes the word PalmPilot.  Wow.  Because I never thought I would have anything but a PalmPilot to listen on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, now it's on 135 or something like that devices, including your Zune and your iPod.  So tell us some of your favorites.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, here, let me give you two of them.  Okay.  First is a book called The Real Deal by James Kahn.  And the only...  I never heard of this guy before.  To me, James Kahn was the actor.  But apparently James Kahn is a businessman in the UK.  And audible kept showing me his book as one of the best sellers.  And I finally said, all right, let's get it.  Why not?  Because you get these credits and it lets you experiment with books that you wouldn't otherwise listen to.  Yeah, there it is.  This is a guy who started out with nothing but a phone in a closet, essentially.  And he built up one of the biggest businesses in the UK.  He was in the HR business in the headhunting space.  And you watch him through this story go from being in this little room to building up a team of people in a smoky room that's still tiny, but a little bigger than that little closet to a big company.  And you watch it grow and you grow and you grow.  And I trained for a marathon as I listened to this book.  And man, did I run hard because of that.  And that's one of the reasons why I turned to audible.  I love podcasts like yours and mine because you get about an hour and a half of information and it's fun to listen to.  But for longer runs, for longer commutes, I like to get lost in a book and some books like this one really motivate you and get you fired up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  James Conspelt, just like the actor, C-double-A-N.  The real deal. My story from Brick Lane to Dragon's Den.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to give you another one because I listened to all your shows and I don't think I don't think you guys talk enough about this.  You don't just have to subscribe to books.  It's not just books that you can sign up for with audible.  There's also magazines and radio shows and TV shows that you can listen to.  And one of my favorites is Charlie Rose.  I bought a one year subscription to Charlie Rose and I keep renewing it.  He's incredible.  He brings authors on and when he interviews an author, I almost don't need to read the book afterwards because he dives so deeply into it and makes it so interesting.  So Charlie Rose is my second suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's a really good point.  We don't mention often enough that audible is more than just books.  And yeah, you can watch or listen to really TV shows like Charlie Rose.  You can get the Wall Street Journal, which I imagine for somebody like you, Andrew, is a real boon to have that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think they give you the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times for free with a subscription.  But in addition to it, you can sign up to something like and you could tell me if I'm wrong.  But in addition to that, you can sign up to a show like Charlie Rose and you don't get just one episode for your credit.  You get a month's worth of shows for that one credit and you're giving people to credit so they can get they could get more than that.  That's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never get to see Charlie Rose.  I always wish I were seeing it.  And one month subscription can be added right to your cart audible.  This is Andrew.  I'm glad we got you on great.  Two really great picks audible dot com slash twit to you're going to get two credits when you sign up for the platinum account and you're going to I promise you you're going to love it.  The best way to spend time when you can't read a book, you know, when you're stuck in the car or whatever, it's just fantastic.  Thank you so much, Andrew, for your recommendations.  And we'll put those in the show notes so you can just click a link audible dot com slash twit to thank you for your support audible.  John, you back?  No, the guy's not back yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is that?  Who is that there?  There's a guy with a hunting cap and a beard on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the tech grouch tech grouch dot mevio dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been watching your show and you are grouchy.  What is why are you so angry?  Tech grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What else is there to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could listen to an audible book or something.  I mean, you don't have to be so angry about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I listened to an audible book once.  Yeah.  What do you think?  It was a guy talking in my ear.  Where's the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an audio book.  Huh?  Yeah.  Do you have a computer tech grouch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I'm a computer expert.  Oh, you are.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that because you live next door to Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He taught you everything he knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's the joke of it.  I taught him everything he knows.  He doesn't know crap, that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean you're the inspiration.  You're the guy who teaches John C. Dvorak all his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  It's always some old fart like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't think there was anybody older than John C. Dvorak.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plenty.  So is there anything here, we're going into the Christmas season, a little holiday cheer,  a little holiday spirit from the tech grouch.  You can't be grouchy all the time.  Maybe there's something that you'd like to share with us that makes you happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, there is a lot of, you can buy your own 3D glasses nowadays.  Bring them with you.  Anywhere you go.  I think there's a lice problem with some of these glasses.  Uh-huh.  They should not be recycling them.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never really thought about that.  Oh, yeah, it's dangerous.  You don't know who's wearing that glass.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, portable radio is handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Portable radio?  Oh, yeah.  Why would you need a portable radio?  Earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're always ready, are you?  So the Dvorak says he's going to be basting his meat for a while.  I don't know why it's taking him so long.  Well, why don't you join the show?  You just know it takes him eight minutes or so.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a little slow today.  Let me introduce you to Andrew Warner here.  He is from MixerG.com.  Howdy!  They're podcasts, right, Andrew, about entrepreneurship and businesses on the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I started out doing audio like you and then moved on to video the way you do.  I'm going to follow everything you do.  You go 3D, I go 3D, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will never see me go 3D.  I think that's something we're just going to have to.  Unless I get Adam here to help us out.  Maybe he can.  He does stop motion.  That's kind of cool.  He worked on Coraline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does stop motion this week in Tech.  I don't even have to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Tech Grunch.  Tech Grouch.  Tech Grinch.  Tech Grinch.  Yeah, for the holidays.  I think we'll call you the Tech Grinch.  Right below you on the screen, Lisa Bettany from MostlyLisa.com.  Wow, she's purty.  She's a photographer.  You know why she's interesting?  Because she's been a model.  She's been an ice skater, professional ice skater.  But now she takes pictures of other models and is a very accomplished photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's vertically integrated.  That's what we skate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  And she cannot drive a stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't.  I can't be talented at everything.  I have to have my weaknesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's because when you were a teenager, you didn't focus on the things normal teenagers focused on.  Can't drive a stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tech Grouch is not happy.  How old were you when you started ice skating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably three, two.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when did you get really serious about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably when I was maybe five or six.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  I had determination.  You retired at nine.  I know.  And so you actually moved from Saskatoon to Vancouver to study with a coach or was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toronto?  Where did you move to study with a coach?  Well, I lived in Calgary and Toronto both for following male partners because as you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  know, there aren't many male figure skaters.  So you have to kind of go where they are.  Go where the guys are.  Yeah.  So I followed it.  Sam, tell me who's Paul Beckins.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Paul Beckins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a lot of male figure skaters in San Francisco.  Yep.  That's what I hear anyway.  How old were you when you left home to kind of pursue this full time?  See, this is why you don't know how to drive a stick.  You were busy skating.  And you were Olympics bound.  Was that your goal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was my goal.  And I'm really excited about the 2010 Olympics.  I'm in your way to Vancouver.  I know.  And I actually live a block away from the hockey venue.  Oh, that's great.  Like I can see it right out my window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you going to cover it for anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am.  I'm going to be covering it for the Vancouver province, sort of a daily column and videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about, are you going to go to all the figure skating events?  You have to, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's so hard to get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But won't it be kind of bittersweet to go to that?  I should say her career was cut short by an injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm definitely over that part of it.  I don't like to watch the figure skating event because it's so tragic because it's always  someone falls and someone loses it.  And it's, it's, that's really hard to take.  That's the best part.  Well, of course you'd think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TechCrouch loves the figure skating.  Just wait.  They fall down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's horrific.  It's hilarious.  Just waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they do not, TechCrouch.  No.  They don't fall down on purpose.  Do they, Lisa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Is there, is there any?  Let me ask a question.  So you're losing.  You're not going to win.  There's no chance.  How about just going through the wall and getting on the, at least you'll get on the  Sports Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have seen, I've seen someone jump through the boards onto a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On purpose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, as an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, how horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She kept going.  It was all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, they just impressed the hell out of me.  Yeah.  2010 Olympics.  When does that start?  It starts soon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the 2010.  In 2010.  Yeah, it's, it's really soon.  I mean, there's, there's a lot of hype going on right now and I'll be covering some stuff  in January, but I guess it starts on like sort of middle of February.  That's exciting.  And yeah, I've never been part of Olympic games.  So, and I'm right sort of situated right in the middle of it.  So I'll have good, I'll have to get a really long zoom lens so I can sneak some photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody should get Lisa into the figure skating.  That's ridiculous.  So according to Ars Technica, Bing doesn't belong to Microsoft.  Microsoft called its search engine Bingo for a while, then removed the O. I didn't know  that.  But then they called it Bing.  But a small company in St. Louis, Bing Information Design!  Is suing Bing, suing Microsoft.  They're a web design firm dedicated to taking tough, hard to design concepts and boiling  them down in a simple, easy to understand ideas.  They say that Microsoft's Bing causes confusion with regard to the relationship between plaintiff  Bing Information Designs and defendant Microsoft confuses the public with regard to the origin  of the plaintiff's services and dilutes the value of the plaintiff's trademarks.  And they say Microsoft knew perfectly well that St. Louis Bing existed.  It would just take a Google search to find it.  And they're asking not only actual damages, but punitive damages.  Oh, thank God you're back, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to get rid of that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man, is he grouchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  North Carolina, baby.  North Carolina.  Oh, I'm sorry.  North Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big difference, John.  I don't want to say anything, but you got that one here last week too, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  North Central, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, now he's all North Central.  Number one what?  Do they have a team?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't even know.  I never got a backgrounder on the school.  You just got the shirt.  How about doing some tech news once in a while?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did.  You were gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Tech Grouch, we did a bunch of stuff.  The Tech Grouch.  That guy's a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he wasn't really giving us what I would call insightful commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's how pathetic things have become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm looking at the story rundown and there's a couple interesting ones.  Pick one that you like.  Well, it was the one at the top, which is not, I think, on the other page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hang on.  You guys, actually our audience is about to leave.  Google and books, that's a plus.  Hang on.  Our audience wants to get out of here.  Can we hurry this up so they can get going?  Yeah, the court ruled against the Google book case.  Paris Court said that Google's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It ruled against Google books and the book case that the books are in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't like the case.  They don't like the books.  They don't like anything about it.  They ordered Google to pay.  Google is going to be thrown out of Europe, I think.  They say they're breaking French law with their policy of digitizing books.  They're getting a $14,000 a day fine.  10,000 Euros, $14,000 a day until Google rids the search engine of literary extracts.  They also have to pay 300,000 Euros in damages to a French publisher, which brought the case.  Google will appeal, of course, but this kind of underscores the problem Google's going  to have in each and every country, one by one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, they need Google more than Google needs them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would happen if Google just said, okay, we won't let anybody with a .fr...  I mean, this is the solution, right?  If it violates your laws, sorry, we won't let anybody with a .fr...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The French would probably think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Use Google.  They'd probably backfire.  Okay, no problem.  We don't like you anyway.  We'll use our little French thing called Gugl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think Google's going to buy Yelp?  That's the other big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very interesting.  Google, you know, does this Google Goggles.  Did we talk about Google Goggles last week?  Yeah.  That was the recognition software that they won't let you do faces but recognizes, you  know, monuments, logos, so forth.  And shortly after they do that, TechCrunch says Google is going to buy Yelp, which is  the biggest online service of reviews, end user reviews of businesses, restaurants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A very useful site, especially if you'd like to...  You know, want to go to a new restaurant, you want to check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So imagine combining Google Goggles with augmented reality, which Google already has, with Yelp.  Now you've got everything on one.  And I think we're heading towards...  We talked about this yesterday on Twig, towards the Google HUD, a heads up display that you  wear, you know, just a little helmet.  You actually probably fit in your hoodie, John.  I think he's wearing it right now.  It looks like Darth Vader.  A little plastic screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm your father, Leo.  I'm your father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a scary thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll be a second set of glasses.  We'll have to have glasses for 3D, glasses for Google Goggles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa won't mind.  She was wearing three headsets earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could wear several pairs of glasses at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could.  But the whole thing of augmented reality, I mean, have you actually used Yelp Monocled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're already doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's all...  I mean, it tells me that there's a Chinese restaurant in my wall.  Well, you have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're supposed to use it inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or look in your wall.  Google can't be wrong.  There might be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  They might be right.  I don't know.  You're supposed to...  Lisa, I know you don't like to go out, but you're supposed to go outside and be on a  street and then you point the Google...  I mean, the Yelp Monocle around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I want to know before I make that big leap...  Well, don't use the augmented reality then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a mistake.  I think it's just kind of a natural...  Only TechCrunch has said this.  Google hasn't commented on this and it hasn't gone through yet, but it does seem like an  obvious thing for Google to pick up.  A lot of...  25 million unique users every month.  Lots of very good reviews.  Yes, Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's surprising to me is that they weren't able to create as robust a community on Google  itself.  I know that when I do a search for a restaurant and I do a search for other businesses on  Google, Google gives me the ability to...  They give me a platform to give my review of it, but it hasn't been as robust as Yelp.  It's interesting to see that Yelp, even with Google battling them and coming into their  space has been able to hold their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you get Yelp in Argentina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I could use it.  I could beat that on your head now.  It's my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I took off the hoodie.  You were complaining.  You couldn't see me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, John.  John has long gray hair now.  I don't know where that came from.  Do you have that in whatever...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think I'll just do anything to get a cheap laugh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you look up...  Olivia, I've got my wife here watching us.  This is my big moment here.  I'm on This Week in Tech, so I wanted her to know that she married the right man.  Does Olivia even know what This Week...  I'm impressed by my new fame.  Does she even know what This Week is?  Can you look up Yelp in Argentina, see if it has the restaurants that we like here and  see if their reviews are accurate?  I'm sure it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might be surprised.  This thing has gone worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure there's an Argentinian...  You're working with services like Priceline and other services that we've come to rely  on in the US.  They exist here, but they're not as robust because there isn't the culture that there  is in the US.  There aren't as many reviewers.  There aren't as many hotel operators that are participating.  At least in the little bit that I've been here, that's what I found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You raise an interesting point, though, John, or Andrew, why Google couldn't do this itself.  I think Google is just historically not very good at creating community.  Now, Orkut...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did a good job with Orkut in Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I found interesting, that there are some places where Orkut is huge, but not  here.  Right.  It did not take off here.  I'm not sure why...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Brazilians are the most sociable people in the world, so they jump on a social networking  thing like there's no tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why that and not Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I look like Timothy Leary?  Yeah, a little bit.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I look like Andy Warhol, actually, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you could give it a bowl cut.  I mean, out of curiosity, John, why do you have that wig in your office?  It's not a wig.  Okay.  It's just a strange thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you this.  Do you want to hear the story about the wig?  Yeah.  So, when I was developing a character that you may have seen once in a while that wears  a long beard, I actually had an original idea and I was going to use this on the Tranky  Geek Show.  And I had this wig along with a white beard and it was a Santa Claus outfit and this wig  was all...  It was just this curly mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't look curly anymore.  It's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daughter grabbed the wig one day and she combed it out.  And now it's just like this...  And I didn't realize that it was actually a real wig of some sort.  So I couldn't use it for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could use it for a Santa that got caught in the rain.  You could use it for something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should throw some water on it.  The wet Santa.  I think this is my new look.  It's a good look.  I'm going to end up looking this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever have long hair ever?  Like when you were at Berkeley, did you have long hair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only had long hair to a point.  I could get my hair...  I couldn't wear it this long because my hair is extremely thin and it would always have  the split ends and it would drive me nuts so I'd be scratching my face all the time  so I could never really have long hair.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's more of a revelation than I really thought I would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something that needs to know.  I was scratching my face all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comcast is doing something really interesting.  They just started doing this.  I'm a Comcast customer.  I checked it out and it's true.  Users who are dual play subscribers of Comcast cable and Comcast high speed internet.  This is one way that they can keep you using both.  We can log on to something called Fancast, which Comcast has had for a long time, or  Comcast.net and they can see on demand pretty much anything they get on their cable.  If you have HBO content, you can watch HBO content.  27 partner networks including A&E, History, ABC, Style, G4, Ovation, Travel, TLC, Animal  Planet.  Comcast is essentially trying out cable via the internet.  It's not enough.  It's not enough?  Is this a last ditch attempt to save Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's another attempt.  It's not a last ditch one, but they're going to keep trying these things.  I think they need a bigger vision here.  One of the problems, by the way, with this is that you need to be dual pay.  You need to pay for cable and you need to pay for internet through them.  And I don't want cable at all if I'm on my computer.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  What if though your cable included all these shows on the internet as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still don't want a TV anymore.  TV to me seems like an out of date technology.  I want to watch on my computer.  I want to watch on my iPhone.  I want to watch away from my home, away from my desk.  I think we need somebody with a big vision here.  Somebody to stand up and say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want a big screen, not a big vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, home theater.  We just were talking about that.  How about you, Lisa?  Would you watch all of your...  Do you watch all your TV on the computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  I don't have a TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that this is true among people in their 20s now.  I know Colleen.  Same thing.  Now you're in Canada, so Rogers has done something similar, haven't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Rogers has put...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not a Rogers.  That's right.  I guess you'd have to be a Rogers subscriber, but I believe Rogers has done something very  similar because you can't get Hulu in Canada.  So they said, all right, no problem.  We'll do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can if you're sneaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can go through a Tor network maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do?  Use a proxy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Proxy.  Hotspot Shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it works like in real time?  You get able to watch video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not bad.  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the name of this thing?  Hotspot Video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hotspot Shield.  I know Hotspot.  It's actually a very good service.  I use it too.  What do you use it for, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get a lot of lag with that?  A lot of buffering.  That's what I've been worried about.  I've been testing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry?  That's exactly what I'd be worried about is that you wouldn't get the...  So it works pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not bad.  I mean, sometimes you get a bad connection, but I mean, it's better than the other option,  which is nothing.  Nothing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Slingbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True.  Slingbox.  Here's a story from Maine, Aya.  A Maine legislator wants to make the state the first to require cell phones to carry  warnings they can cause brain cancer.  They still talk like that?  No, they don't.  No one in Maine talks like this anymore.  Even though there's no consensus among scientists...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you're starting to sound like Roosevelt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I think I noticed that.  I'm turning into Roosevelt.  Today is a day which will live and infamy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another joke that nobody gets.  Roosevelt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and me, John.  Well, we're the only two people who remember what Roosevelt sounded like.  Now ubiquitous devices carry such warnings in some countries.  I didn't know this.  Some countries actually warn.  Gavin Newsom wants San Francisco to require warnings on cell phones, even though there  is no evidence and no consensus among scientists that cell phones cause cancer.  They want to put it on there anyway.  Well, dad gummit.  Federal Communications Commission, which sets standards for cell phone safety, does not  require handset makers to divulge radiation levels.  They have set a standard for specific absorption rates.  In fact, I remember when I was at the FCC headquarters, they had a human dummy filled  with some gooey stuff that simulated the viscosity and density of flesh.  They had a machine that would take a cell phone and move it in small increments around  the body.  Then inside the viscous material, they had receivers and they were measuring the radio  transmission, how much energy was absorbed by various cell phones.  I guess it doesn't hurt anybody to have a warning on it, but the question is, is there  really isn't evidence that there are risks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe it does hurt us because if we keep seeing these warning signs that really don't have  any scientific basis, we're going to start ignoring the ones that do have a scientific  basis.  Good point.  And that's where I think the damage is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's happened in California, right, John?  Because everywhere you go, you see Prop 65 warning.  Chemicals in this building are known to cause cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  They got all the gas pumps too.  Everywhere.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  And you do, you get numb to it and you no longer care and you see warnings and you couldn't  care less.  It's like, so what?  It's their BS warnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I took off my makeup, so what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He took off his makeup, he's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you see the mask that he's got on, that John C. Dvorak has on?  Imagine that in 3D and tell him you don't want to take Twit to 3D.  All right, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  Twit should be 3D.  That nose that Probescus is coming right out.  Ooh, it's 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is that mask?  Yeah, that's a mask.  It looks like actually looks like Dicty Bartolo from the Daily Gizmos actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Dicty Bartolo mask.  That's exactly what it looks like.  It kind of in a weird distorted Dicty Bartolo.  Keep your finger out of that nose.  That's huge.  Are you scared, Lisa?  Don't be scared.  It's just John.  You haven't worked with him as long as I have.  That's a very good point, Andrew, that these warnings have the complete opposite effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got one on my mattress.  I've got one on my phone soon, on my keyboard, on my wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the nanny society that we live in these days.  I wouldn't mind if there were evidence, but there's absolutely no consensus.  In fact, most scientific consensus is that at the levels that the cell phone is working  the energy levels it's working at that they're harmless.  Unless you glued it to your head and wore it around as a hat, which John might be doing.  What if he slept with it under your pillow?  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you do that?  Do you think maybe you'll get an emergency call in the middle of the night?  Are you worried?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just like to hold it when I sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the iPhone, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you keep it on vibrate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, stop that, you ugly jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just was wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jerk.  Time to talk about Squarespace and I'm going to let John do a costume change because I  don't like the John C. Dvorak I'm seeing here today.  Squarespace is a great place that lets you, my friends, you design your own website using  such easy to use tools.  You start with beautiful templates.  By the way, not just a blog, it's exceptional websites of all kinds.  Lisa, you'd love it for a photo blog.  People use it for forums.  Great statistics.  Beautiful intuitive editing.  All the social media you'd ever want.  Sites start at just $8 a month.  You can blog, you can build, you can host design.  Most importantly, you can impress.  I want you to try it free right now.  You don't even need a credit card.  Go to squarespace.com slash twit.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Try it.  It's very easy to get your data into it.  In fact, this is one of the things that really I think is a great selling point of Squarespace.  It imports data from all the major blog engines and exports.  You're never trapped from TypePad, from WordPress, from Blogger.  Just get that data over and take a look.  Boy, these templates are gorgeous.  You start with a great looking site, but then you build it, you move it around.  They have amazing iPhone app.  Lisa, so you can blog from under your pillow.  Have you seen the iPhone app?  It's really, really slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't.  I mean, I've been on WordPress for a while now, but it's starting to, I don't know, it's  not giving me what I want.  So I'm definitely looking at Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  I'm a WordPress user too.  And one of the things I worry about and one of the reasons we've started to move our Twit  blogs over to Squarespace is every five minutes, there's a security issue.  And if you don't keep on top of your WordPress blog and update immediately, you get hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, hacked and your site will go down.  It's ugly.  And it's sort of every, there's an update all the time and all the plugins and it's  just such a nightmare to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The beauty of this is they keep it updated.  You don't have to do anything.  The engine is always up to date.  You're on their servers.  It's just 60 templates, one, two and three column styles, drop down menus, point and  click visual design lets you drag and change, you know, widths and everything.  It is so beautiful, so elegant.  SEO optimized, of course, WYSIWYG editing interface, spam filtering, great for podcasting,  code insertion and video insertion directly from the WYSIWYG interface, full iTunes support,  Lightbox for your pictures.  I know you like Lightbox.  It's the analytics.  I mean, just go to squarespace.com and take a look.  Squarespace.com slash twit and you get 10% off if you use the coupon code TWIT when you  sign up.  Squarespace is amazing.  Our Insight Twit blog is running on it now and I'm just thinking, boy, I got to move  everything over there.  Squarespace.com slash twit, the place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see what John looks like now.  He just looks normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like you got breasts though.  Maybe that's the lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  3D, I'm telling you.  You want to see what John really looks like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  What else is going on in the world?  Anything else?  We got to wrap this up.  What is the big story?  What are people talking about in Argentina in tech, Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  Actually, here's what I'm noticing around here.  Theft is what they're talking about in Argentina.  Really?  So I brought my iPhone here.  I'm able to connect it to the local carrier because I jail broke my phone.  But I can't take it out in public because I'm worried that someone's going to steal  my phone.  Apparently, there's rampant theft for that.  Computers, you can't take them out.  I'm wondering if we need to lower the prices of these computers just to bring the rest  of the world in so that they're not theft bait anymore, so that they're more accessible  to people.  I mean, in Argentina, they can afford to buy these computers.  I want to bring more people online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Argentina like Brazil where they tack on some of these ridiculous tariffs and so  these things are extremely expensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People find out that I'm American and they keep asking me to have my friends when they  come visit me bring Dell computers for them and other computers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That used to be rampant in Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in effect, you create this black market, this underground where thieves are rewarded  because if you buy it in country, it's so expensive.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And how are they going to encourage technology and innovation here when people have to pay  so much for the basic computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes no sense to me either.  I always thought it was screwy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does seem like the thing to do if you're a government, if you want to encourage innovation  in business is you make the internet unfiltered, widely available, high speed, inexpensive.  You make sure technology is in the hands of people and then you let them go and you let  them do it.  And I think the US isn't a perfect example either.  We pay a lot more for our internet than in a lot of countries and we get worse quality  than in a lot of countries and there's a constant pressure on the internet to shut  down free and open internet.  But boy, that seems to be obvious that that's the key to success in this modern economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's also easy in the US and we don't realize this.  It's a lot easier to start a company in the US than it is in much of the world.  Oh really?  You could just call up one of these instant company corporations and they set you up with  a company within days.  You can't do that in other countries.  You have to go through bureaucracy.  You have to pay.  You have to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I used BizFilings.com.  I asked Kevin Rose who's got about 80 different LLCs.  I said, how do you do it?  He says, Biz Filings costs a couple hundred bucks.  You got a business.  That's all you have to do.  And I was an LLC just like that.  Of course, I brought it to a lawyer later.  He said, I wish you'd come to me first.  Now you're screwed.  No, no, it's fine.  We're a Delaware corporation.  And I found out later that people do Delaware corporations because venture capitalists like  it.  And that was not a good reason to do it.  I had to pay extra money to be a California whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We found that Washington State has really a liberal approach to these things.  That's what we do our work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a recommendation, Andrew?  You do this a lot.  Incorporate.  Starting a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  I actually used to create my company as Delaware corporations the way that you did.  But after 9-11, it became a problem.  It became harder to open up bank accounts in California if you've got a Delaware corporation.  We had to become a California registered corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're still Delaware, but you pay extra money and you're California registered and then  it's a lot easier.  You're exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And frankly, what they'll tell you is that if you ever do need venture capital or do  need to go public and need to be a Delaware corporation, you just form a Delaware corporation  and have it acquire your other business so that you've got all those benefits.  You should have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andrew is at Mixergy.com.  Go there.  And there are some great interviews, wonderful stuff up there.  And I know you have a big fan base of people who have been begging me to get you on Twitter.  So I'm so glad we could get you to do it even though you're in our company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am so appreciative of people who heard me say that I'd like to be on here and actually  emailed you or tweeted at you.  Thank you guys for telling them.  The network.  I've been dying to be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The network.  It's great.  Well, we're glad you got Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're pretty much in the right time zone because north and south, it's not like when  we talk to people in the UK, they're like at 2 in the morning.  Right.  Right.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is nice.  We're almost here now on a Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beautiful evening, I'm sure too, in Argentina.  Mixergy.com.  Thank you, Andrew.  Lisa Bettany, how's the photography going?  Are you doing a lot of photography?  I see your flickering all the time.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, since I got my 5D Mark II, which my baby.  My baby.  I think if he proposed, I would accept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a beautiful camera.  He's a gorgeous camera.  If you go to Mostly Lisa, that's Lisa's website.  You're still Mostly Lisa on Twitter, right?  I am, yes.  You got that back?  Yes.  But MostlyLisa.com is the place to go to see everything you want to know about Lisa.  She's also doing some great pieces on photography if you want to learn about photography.  So, that's kind of fun.  A lot of tips.  Look at this voice morphing app.  Oh, no.  I was silly.  I don't know what you're up to, but it looks silly.  It looks really funny.  Fish Eye Fever, How to Take Better Portraits.  It's really a great site.  You're doing a great job, Lisa.  And if you would just learn how to drive a stick, then you could drive.  I can try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the one thing we didn't ask.  Take a Mustang with 400 horsepower engine and give her the stick to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a little powerful, but it's fun.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  Thank you so much for joining us.  MostlyLisa.com.  I don't have to tell you where you can find John C. Dvorak because he's been vlogging  it throughout the show.  Channeldvorak.com is the place to go.  There it is.  See all the stuff's there, including his neighbor, the tech grouch.  Deke.  Deke, the tech grouch.  He left his hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to have to go over there.  And I hate to see this guy more than once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said he taught you everything you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  We've got John fighting with himself now.  I want to thank Adam Jones for being in studio with us and kind of setting the record state  on 3D.  That's really great.
