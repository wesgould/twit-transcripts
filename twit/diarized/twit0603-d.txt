Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, great to have you all you had a good piece this morning on Sunday on the CBS Sunday morning about  Recreating actors you call them digital doubles and I you said I didn't realize this that more than a hundred actors have  posed  Have been scanned for movies including Angelina Jolie Tom Cruise Brad Pitt Sigourney Weaver Dwayne Johnson  Aren't they worried about losing their livelihood?

Start time: 244.43
End time: 262.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's really complicated  One of the reasons they do this is of course if the original actor has died  So rogue one the Star Wars movie with with the dead Peter Cushing Peter Cushing resurrected  Kind of started all this and when I saw that movie, I did not realize that he was completely computer-generated

Start time: 262.66
End time: 269.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read that later. So they're not using old clips and kind of jamming them in they actually created a whole new character

Start time: 270.28
End time: 323.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Based on scans. This is totally they did the same thing with Paul Walker and furious seven  You may remember he died partway into filming  And they of course resurrected the 20 year old Princess Leia for  Rogue one so you might be interested and we can make me talk about this later  But what started me on this idea for a story for Sunday morning was not  recreating people's faces and bodies digitally  But Adobe's demonstration in November of a new Photoshop for the voice  Yeah  This is a program where you can feed it recordings of some famous person  20 minutes worth and then type in anything you want and it will say in that person's perfect voice  anything you want it's like the dawn of audio fake news and  That Adobe suddenly like clammed up like oh, sorry. We're not talking about this anymore. No, you can't interview us  No, we can't. It was a little bad

Start time: 324.22
End time: 328.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly because a lot of people put it out while this would make it trivial to fake anything

Start time: 329.66
End time: 344.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was that was the thrust of my story today is like yeah cool that you can resurrect dead actors  But isn't what does evidence mean anymore? Like if you can make any video of any person doing something that they never did  indistinguishably

Start time: 345.64
End time: 360.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that the ultimate fake news you talked to somebody from USC who is building a human scanning?  system using  $120 cameras and a Home Depot shower curtain  So this could this could be done at home in other words

Start time: 364.46
End time: 375.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the point of visiting that guy is that this isn't a million dollar thing anymore  this is something you can build super cheaply in your own basement and  Start creating digital doubles in your free time

Start time: 376.32
End time: 412.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is fascinating to me because I think art didn't Arnold Schwarzenegger a few years ago when they did that Terminator  The youth and him and he thought I think I remember him saying he thought this was the future of movies and  For those guys who are being aged out of those action roles. Is it possible?  I mean, we've seen this in a number of movies as you pointed out, but even like in the X-Men  That when they look pretty crappy back then with Patrick Stewart. Remember he looked all  Cherubic a few in the few X-Men films ago  They even tried this with Brandon Lee and the crow after he you know  And they tried to digitally morph him into the end scenes of the crow

Start time: 413.80
End time: 421.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I think it's fascinating there is isn't there an uncanny valley though. I mean, we're not quite I don't know  I didn't see the rogue one. Did they look real? I guess they did Peter Cushing

Start time: 423.46

Start time: 450.60
End time: 478.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To answer your question Leo so uncanny valley is this place where?  Completely computer-generated humans has been stuck for the last 15 years where there's something a little off like  Theoretically they should look normal, but they look a little off and the argument of this story now is that we have finally  exited  Uncanny Valley they can now make characters on screen that are completely computer-generated that are so real  You literally cannot tell the difference

Start time: 480.06
End time: 492.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are such a big thing right now, especially because they really market well at globally and  In action movies you don't actually have to know how to act  So I think it doesn't really matter

Start time: 494.34
End time: 505.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wonder what this does to the stunt double to you know like is are the or would this make more stunt doubles fewer actors  They'd have him in more scenes, and they need him and they which would digitally put their faces on there

Start time: 506.30
End time: 517.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I also I hope for a day when I can retire, but there'll be enough footage of me  The show goes on with or without me like Chuck E Cheese

Start time: 527.28
End time: 545.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello boys and girls  So this is Tarkin from a rogue one and notice  He's kind of dimly lit if you if you stall it it looks his hair even looks a little  Plath you can there is uncanny valley here, but but the thing is it's a short scene that moves very quickly

Start time: 546.22
End time: 570.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I I don't know you know my my story from CBS Sunday morning this morning is online  Just you can Google it CBS Sunday morning  You know yeah, ho digital doubles and yeah, and they chose for that some really dead-on  close-up well lit dialogue scenes Wow of Tarkin and  I mean when I saw the movie I didn't know yeah, it's yeah

Start time: 571.00
End time: 575.14

Start time: 591.05
End time: 624.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was amazing  but I feel like they I was gonna ask you about that if that was in your piece or not because that's that seemed to  Me it was kind of like it was like they were not making it as real as they could have on purpose interesting  That's the way I took it or you know when I was looking at I instantly knew it was digital  We know that he's not that young so clearly  There's not gonna be footage of him at that young and they're gonna be able to use it so  Maybe it's that not being able to suspend disbelief. It's being pulled out of you because you know that he's he's the age he is  But here's the yes, that that does look pretty good. Yeah

Start time: 625.78
End time: 645.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does look pretty good, but it you guys do you guys watch this is us  I spent so much of that show trying to figure out how Mandy Moore goes  Like 40 years between being a 20 something and a 65 year old something so even though there's no CGI on that  I feel like I spend a ton of time

Start time: 647.40
End time: 665.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Disbelieving makeup. It's amazing  You should see the portrait of me in my basement  But and I think as my as my understanding unless the technology is  Advanced that they're they also sometimes use real actors and then modify them slightly this one is that that's what you're seeing here

Start time: 665.58
End time: 686.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they got another actor on the left  That's guy Williams who looks a little bit like Tarkin to where the motion tracking dots on his face  And he performed all the lines so that's how they got his mouth to move and they got the accent right  He sounds a lot like Peter Cushing  And then they overlaid Cushing's face on that performance before she died

Start time: 688.70
End time: 699.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Princess Leia said she called Princess Leia  That's kind of me said that that she will not be in future Star Wars movies that she knows for a fact  They're not gonna do that to her right there was some debate over that

Start time: 700.16
End time: 712.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting because it actors increasingly are now putting it in their wills right what's allowed to be done with them. I think  Robin Williams, for example said for  Something like 25 years you can't use my image

Start time: 713.88
End time: 738.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way, remember Fred Astaire dancing with a vacuum click in the ad  Swiffer Swiss with a Swiffer. I mean whatever that was. Yeah, it was something like that  I mean they've been doing this for a while and you figure 25 years from now Robin Williams will resurface and it'll be in ads and stuff  And yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't want that which is again leads me to that question  I asked you at the very beginning. Why would these actors allow themselves to be so the Fred Astaire one?

Start time: 738.94
End time: 766.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You brought that up first of all, that's a that's a different matter they're taking existing footage  There's nothing new created. But the reason I think that one is so significant is because his  widow  Gave permission the estate sold children said no way. Oh interesting  So obviously the the rule now is get the estate's permission, right?  We could all agree we'd all be happy with that. But what if some agree and some don't that's where it gets tricky

Start time: 767.26
End time: 778.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or what if things change where the the language is even written into the contracts like this new technology doesn't even exist  I mean like Johnny Cash is a state. I think weren't they upset that they used a ring of fire for a hemorrhoids commercial

Transcript:  It's Cirque du Soleil. Yeah, so like yeah, and so to answer your question  Yeah, one that's it. Yeah one. That's it. Thank you  Why these performers would want to do it is because there is a form of artistry in that  I mean when the hologram appeared on stage, I will completely admit it. I cried I just it was so  Surprising and emotional and you know growing up with in the Michael Jackson era. It was sort of  It shocked me a little bit how an artist would want to try and expand the boundaries even after death

We're just going to all have to become more skeptical  Consumers and the third guy said we need to start coming up with rules  We need to make some laws.

There certainly is a delete uber movement clayton did it he's taking a lift from now on  um  It or is as becky says is this is this just a bad publicity but uber will  Because when you're drunk at 1 a.m. Who else you're gonna call?

Um  Acceptability  Uh spectrum for a lot of these behaviors, but if you look at the trajectory of where we're going  It does point to this being unacceptable and ultimately hope  Well, I hope market forces will will drive it out of the business world because it just doesn't make sense in the long run

And then they did an asian filter that were wholly racist  And the point was made if you have a bunch of white bro programmers writing these filters  They're it's not that they're racist necessarily.

There's another one google's suing uber actually. They're suing a company uber uber uber acquired called auto  That's the self-driving trucks. Apparently  A guy who was working for google's  Waymo their autonomous  vehicle division  Anthony levandowski downloaded 14. This is in the lawsuit  They claimed downloaded 14 000 technical files from the google servers and then launched the autonomous truck startup auto  Which was acquired a few months later by uber and of course levandowski is now running the automated car division at uber  And so google is now suing uber saying they said we don't want to do this  We don't like to do this, but boy when somebody steals your stuff  Uh, then then you gotta get upset according to wired. It's actually it's the lasers  The the lasers that they're using to make the lidar maps  Uh the technology that was borrowed from waymo

Start time: 2622.66
End time: 2646.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in reading a little bit about this story one of the things that I found really interesting is that I had presumed  Incorrectly that google was going to be licensing their self-driving technology to other manufacturers of cars who were already in the business  but um at the  I think it was at the detroit auto show one of the auto shows early this year the ceo of waymo this google self-driving car

Transcript:  So good, they tell me exactly what they're doing  Waymo it's waymo better waymo better. Hey you from hawaii, bro. That guy is so much waymo better  But that they are actually going to be making the hardware themselves google is  And that the lidar sensors can cost up to seventy five thousand dollars per sensor  Component group and that what waymo has done is decrease the price of that by 90 percent in their manufacturing research  so to be able to shave, uh  67-68  Thousand dollars off of this component is a huge advantage to them  And so the fact that they have such compelling evidence that this guy has stolen the the design components  um, I don't know if you  most people know this what was the whole story was that a  supplier for waymo  accidentally emailed them  With they thought they were emailing auto and they included auto's new design spec which looked oh exactly like waymo's  So then waymo went back and did a forensic investigation and found that this uh,  It's not lewandowski is levendowski levendowski.

They were years ahead  And they just sat on oh, we're gonna license. We're not gonna license  We're just gonna not do anything and we're gonna partner they they keep changing their minds  And meanwhile the competitors have caught up and in some cases lapped them

Phenomenon remember that draw something that was the app  That was the hottest app in existence then zynga bought it and  They bought them at the absolute peak  Maybe the same thing with snap. I don't know. Let's talk about euro though first. You know what? It's a year old euro  happy birthday  euro  euro created the mesh wi-fi that's  changing the world  Uh, and it is an amazing solution  Everybody knows wi-fi has become a problem because there's so few reasons. There's so many wi-fi  You know networks in your area congestion, but also our houses are bigger. We're doing more  We're sending more stuff over wi-fi a single router model, which was great five years ago. Just doesn't work  You need a distributed system. You need euro  Euro the world's first home whole home wi-fi system it blankets the entire home  In fast reliable wi-fi no more buffering. No more dead zones, and this is not a repeater  This is not a wi-fi extender euro is much smarter than it's a mesh system  Which means oh, what do we have there? Is that an euro? I see it. Oh, yep

Transcript:  Euro you you manage it through an app  It's nice because they've managed to make something that's very easy and straightforward  To set up and use but if you dig deep they have features that even some high-priced, you know  Fancy geek routers don't have  They come with more memory and power than than you need currently to zap wi-fi. That means that they can upgrade it  They overbuilt the euro. I don't know if people realize this but you know that for instance  They just had the 2.0 update which which enhances to the new mesh  But there's even more capability because they they overbuilt it. They put more  cpu and more memory in there so they can add  All sorts of things zero is one of the only routers that gets updated automatically all the time  Plus as you can see, there's no need to hide it. It looks great  State-of-the-art wpa2 encryption, of course great customer support  Of course, I actually tested them and called them up and said I can't get my minecraft server working  And they were great. They stayed on the line until it was working. I was very impressed  You've seen them everywhere  Including we've talked about them 4.4 stars on amazon 750 reviews one-year warranty  Of course will work with your existing modem and internet service and there's a 30-day money back guarantee  Eero was the original to celebrate their first birthday. They have permanently lowered prices. Who does that?  399 for the three pack. That's a hundred dollars off 299 for a two pack  Each euro is worth a good for about 1500 square feet. So many people a two pack would be plenty  And the nice thing is you can always add more euros as you need them  To get euro at its new low price  Eero.com or best buy or amazon to celebrate one euro of euro  Eero  Eero.com or best buy or amazon everybody loves euro but loves their euro  Snap I guess the latest is  They're gonna probably do their ipo this week like wednesday march 1st  And it's gonna be big  20 billion 20 billion  They're they're gonna  Initial price we're not sure but the you know, they haven't announced 14 to 16 dollars a share that I give it a 22.2 billion dollar  market cap at that price  That's considerably above their last private valuation, which was 17.8 billion dollars  They will have the new york stock exchange symbol snap. That's a good easy one to remember  Like uber like a lot of companies they have great revenue  404 million dollars in revenue  Last year that's up from 58 million dollars a year before they also have great losses  Revenue does not necessarily mean profit  Their net loss. Okay. Remember 404 million dollars in revenue  They lost  514 million dollars in other words  They spent half a billion dollars to make 400 million dollars not a good  Business in the long run  Last the year before they lost 372 million dollars. They are close to having lost a billion dollars in two years

I use the story so so  Let's let's here. I'll tell you what let's let's i'll get out of this  One of the reasons a lot of adults don't use snapchat is because it's completely opaque, right? Nobody nobody could figure out how to use it  And oh look jimmy kimmel's just appeared see this is how they make money there's an oscar  Snapchat filter. Hi kids. I now have lipstick and sunglasses. So great. Um,  Yeah, this is why I use it because it's funny and but and by the way instagram and others have added these kinds of capabilities  Facebook just bought a company that uh  msqr  masquerade  Which does an amazing job and arguably better than snapchat and i'm sure that we'll see that in instagram  Soon those filters are so addictive. They're addictive and I do and so I can I can I can record this  I can save it to a story that easily  And uh, and now people, you know strangers can see my snaps

Transcript:  And snapchat is kind of snap has addressed this the news feature for a long time was just pictures of kim kardashian's butt  Because that is news. Yeah, well mostly because uh the companies who put the news on here real  Like mostly the daily mail realized hey if we put her butt on there people are going to click on it  Snapchat actually made rules just a few weeks ago to eliminate that kind of clickbait  So you see how much boring more boring this is?  Than it used to be. Oh wait a minute is daily mail still has something a young woman in a in some sort of  Lingerie on the front if it got really bad at one point with some there was a story  Uh, what was it?  It was it was a I think it was a wired story or something about guys  Using a technology and they had a picture of a girl in a bikini on the on the front page just to get you to click it  It got out of out of control  um, I I see the I see the power of snap, but I think what you've brought up clinton is interesting, which is  Anything based on a social graph?  Including facebook is very vulnerable if its users like those teenagers in panera  Uh decide en masse to move

I mean, it's arguably there's no better driver of traffic  I mean like we said this before if you're a small business, you know, you're a  You're a pet store in a small village in a small town  You better be on facebook  You better be on facebook because you can do such  micro-targeted smart advertising just to pet owners who live in your zip code and who are able to then to come into your  Town and you can offer them a coupon to come in and say hello  You just open your store and say hello and i'd like to meet you and etc. Etc. You're developing that relationship with that pen  owner in that town  It's phenomenal. I mean, there's no better way to connect with you know for businesses and to drive traffic that way  Than using facebook ads. I mean it really is  And and then to retarget those people who were kind of like, hey, I don't want to kind of go in but maybe I would  next month retarget those people  So i'm just curious. I'm i'm confused by that though if so many people are saying hey facebook's not cool  Then how is facebook such a behemoth and continuing to see such phenomenal growth?

That's going to be hot  Maybe not with that perfect demo  But with the bell curve and they're always looking to see if they can get some an up-and-comer because they have the money to do it  and the fact that

I mean, it's kind of like like disney  You know in the feel of it and disney's figured out how to create this huge horizontal umbrella of vertically integrated businesses  I don't see anything in the core values of snap that would create more value

Inside your facebook app as a feature. I mean that's where I could see it going  But I don't see it yet to your point becky.

Transcript:  Did an explainer for yahoo finance a couple months ago on on snapchat for those who don't know what it is  Which is most people and  There's a lot of psychology to it that again limits it to this particular age and gender bracket. For example  Leo you were pointing out how opaque it is how hard to use how?  Non-intuitive and I actually think that's part of it. I agree  Teens and pre-teens want something that their parents can't use and won't understand  And you know in terms of the large female teenager thing  It's been argued that that's because women girls  Are so constantly judged  Today for their looks for their behavior for their clothing  That something that lets you send an unfiltered snap of yourself where it's not going to come back to haunt you  Is not going to be judged is this huge psychological burden lifted?  And again though, that's kind of unique too. I mean not solely unique, but that's a lot of teenage girls who feel

Start time: 4085.58

It's like the opaqueness is what we saw in ios 10 with the messages app  I mean trying to navigate that if you're my mom you're not going to be able to do it  But if you're a teenage girl, you're going to be able to find all these hidden things inside the messages app and on purpose  Look at pokemon go  It's pretty opaque and you're trying to find and navigate through that to find it trying to figure out different menu and sub menus  And it's part of the it's part of the fun of the hunting and pecking of that game  Wouldn't be surprised in a future version of ios.

Transcript:  There's um, there's a word affordance that uh user interface design  people use that is an affordance is a capability of an object like a you look at a doorknob and you can kind of  Intuit that it turns and you know if it's got you know, you could push a push plate and you pull a handle  There's a certain information you gather from looking at it. And of course, uh snapchat and more recently apple's messages  Have all these hidden  Features and i'm of the opinion it's intentional that these hidden affordances are actually a social tool  because they encourage  People to share look I figured out how to do this  And show other people and it actually helps their word of mouth  I think snapchat almost proved that by being completely opaque. Hey, yeah, it hit it from parents  And and you know, there was an in group who understood it and an out group who didn't and then people who were in the out group  And didn't understand it but but were buddies with people who did wanted to be in the in group  So the buddies got some social  uh  Reputation by saying oh, I know how to do that watch you do that and then there you're in the in group  And I think that was part of how it spread but I I also think  um  That apple saw this and said we should probably put some hidden affordances  In messages and see if the same thing can happen  And I don't know if it did but I do have to admit  I've spent a lot of time with my 83 year old mother showing her how to make balloons appear  On an apple message when you do that see what happens when you do that  You send a message to somebody and they get the confetti or the fireworks of the laser show  The first question is how'd you do that? How'd you do that? Exactly get some social currency by saying oh well i'll show you

He's not only the ceo of facebook.

I think there's a long way to go and I think  You know apple does what apple does which is sit back and watch these companies try that  I mean, I think there's a space for something with a screen in that environment  You know, how many times do you wish that your your echo had some sort of you know  Sort of a screen on it that you could interact with in a deep way  Or the google home for that matter instead of having to go back to square one  There's a way to to work with it. Yeah, siri has been  Wolfily behind in certain ways and the speakers that are on our apple, you know devices don't  You know don't kick on unless I have it right up to my face to be able to get answers to it  But I think there's still a lot of room for growth there.

I was cooking something the other day and I wanted that recipe that I had saved in epicurious a while ago, right?  I don't want to have to tap for it  But wouldn't it be great if that device was able to bring up that recipe right before me?  Right right there on that screen but could also be playing music and have a countdown timer and there is a need for those  Types of things and I think apple probably is testing it. I'm sure amazon's probably testing it as well  We don't know until we get our hands on it, right? Or we don't you can actually

That's very interesting  But I guess we should talk about mobile world congress it starts technically tomorrow, although all day today there were press conferences  We tried to cover the samsung press conference this morning, but they started 25 minutes late  So I had to cut it off and as it turned out you missed nothing. They announced a galaxy tab 3 which is an exact  Copy of an ipad 9.7 inches. The only difference is it's an oled screen and probably a very nice oled screen  But it has a stylus has all the same things the ipad has then they announced an exact copy of microsoft surface pro 4  a tablet windows 10 computer with a detachable  Keyboard and then they announced a copy of google's daydream  They take the gear vr virtual reality headset and they it's basically the same but they've added  Something that google added to the daydream a lot of people liked which is a little controller a push button  So that was samsung's announcements. They did not announce a new phone  They said they wouldn't they they're going to do that march 29th  In new york city  And then uh, the note of course is in the fall, but the galaxy s8 we expect them to announce that in march and april availability  LG did announce a new lg g6, which looks pretty nice. It's kind of interesting  It's a it's a super tall 5.7 inch screen. They've decided that people want big screens, but they don't want a big phone  In fact, everybody's trying to solve this apple. I'm sure with the next iphone. We'll try to solve this samsung has two with a curved screen  Uh, this is going to be a weird aspect ratio a two by one  Phone so it's taller than you're used to but the idea is you can hold in your hand and still get lots of screen real estate  dual cameras as as before with the g5  Sad to say they're removing the removable battery. This is  The g5 was one of the last phones you could still get a second battery and put it in  There'll be two g6s one the the smaller one won't will have a removal battery, but the high end will not  And as a result will have better battery life

End time: 7035.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're kind of trying to figure it out, right? So this week he repealed  Privacy rape regulations for isps  And just make sure I get this right so that they can't sell your data the way that search engines and social networks can sell your data  For advertisers, this was a relatively new rule created last fall

Start time: 7035.98
End time: 7090.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  under democratically controlled  Agency that would say that that said that cable and wireless internet service providers  Had actually tougher privacy restrictions than facebook google or google  So for instance the fcc rule said that marketing of web browsing history would require your permission your opt-in  the ftc  Requires opt-in only for certain sensitive categories of information for google and facebook  So pi's position will and this is by the way, I believe what's really going on  Pi wants to eliminate fcc regulation  Of the internet entirely  And put it under the ftc the federal trade commission on this issue not on every I think on every issue  He doesn't he doesn't believe the fcc should have a regulatory role when it comes to the internet

End time: 7123.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so he was on cnbc and I got this that watched it and I recommend watching it because you get a measure of the man  More so than all of these discussions kind of trying to figure out what he's about  So to give you a little the the most important part says my own view is that light touch regulation means  We create broad regulatory frameworks to protect consumers  But blah blah blah competitive marketplace being the primary thing. We shouldn't  Micromanage how these companies operate in the absence of evidence of a market failure

Start time: 7123.22
End time: 7138.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is it is in a competitive marketplace and that's partly thanks to the fcc, but it is not a competitive marketplace  86 percent of americans only have two choices your cable company and your phone company for internet service and a great many have one choice  That's not competitive

Start time: 7139.74
End time: 7150.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and why are we talking about the privacy thing when this is the guy who wants to get rid of net neutrality?  Why aren't we why haven't we dedicated two hours talking about that? It's all of a piece and I and I really think that

Start time: 7151.86
End time: 7172.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did he address this this ftc thing because  You know some people say well, of course  You don't want the ftc to regulate it because they're overburdened trying to regulate things like false ad claims  They don't they have the fcc does not have an enforcement arm the ftc does  But they're in this doing many in the cnbc article or in the cnbc interview

Start time: 7172.22
End time: 7183.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't address that directly but in some of the other articles about this  He says that if they're going to do it, they should do a broad regulatory framework that affects everyone's  Sense of this as opposed to just picking and choosing right?

Start time: 7184.82
End time: 7193.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does that framework look like who's going to you know, who's going to get to weigh in on this framework?  What does that regulatory framework even look like it's nice to be able to throw around loose language like that

Start time: 7194.90
End time: 7197.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the bottom line is I mean the elephant in the room is that he was a verizon lawyer and he is yeah  He he's a pro. Wheeler was also a kid anti-consumer. I know but tom wheeler  Got pushed back from the public and changed his mind. He came around right and in fact end up being a great defender of  The public interest I think everything pie has done or said  Is to the benefit of the bottom line of the of the comcasts and against the interests of the consumer

Start time: 7226.40
End time: 7230.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean you could say that about the about the trump administration in general

Start time: 7231.14
End time: 7255.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  true, yeah, I mean that seems like it's a overarching I mean his comment here was  Uh  Otherwise we don't sit in judgment from washington dc  My own view is that the internet should be run by technologists and engineers and business people  Not by lawyers and bureaucrats here in the nation's capital. I mean who can disagree with that. I don't disagree with that  Well, but then that's also just standard, you know, that's kind of republican policy spoiler plate. Yeah

Start time: 7256.98
End time: 7272.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean would part of the framework be hey these cable companies get the opportunity then to look at this data  They get to understand it's their business after all the pipes through which these users are using their data  I mean using their information. Yeah through their pipes and we'd like to know can we provide better service to those individuals?

Start time: 7272.48
End time: 7316.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not merely know that clinton it's sell it  That people are concerned about  Right, right. I mean and and I think people often we hear always people complaining about google and facebook what they know about is  No one knows more about you than your isp. Everything goes through your isp  Including your google and facebook stuff anything is not encrypted anyway  um  You know, I don't I I am still I think the jury's still out. I  I think what I hope for is a kind of more traditional  republican administration that uh favors deregulation  As opposed to what i'm fearing we're getting which is uh a trump administration  Run chiefly by steve bannon's uh doctrine of eliminating  government entirely

Start time: 7317.94
End time: 7323.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I did not get that sense from him in that interview and it was much it was comforting to me along those lines

Start time: 7323.72
End time: 7383.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it's at cpec bannon basically said  Uh, what we want to do is is get rid of all of these administrative  We want to get rid of these cabinet jobs get or uh, not cabinet jobs get rid of these agencies cabinet agencies  Just eliminate them entirely  That would be a little more scary to me than a more i'd be very happy with a kind of more traditional outlook  Republican outlook on this at this point  Uh, we'll see all I can say is we gotta watch I and here's why david I i'm being  I'm reluctant to  Because tom wheeler we really did think he was going to be a jerk. We could  John oliver called him a dingo  Was it john oliver or was it might have been uh on the daily show might have been john stewart said, you know  I think he was oliver did the whole thing on internet neutrality neutrality in the hands of tom wheeler  Would be like giving your baby to a dingo  it's  And he turned and john oliver apologized and and tom wheeler said I am not a dingo  And uh and uh  And he turned out not to be

Start time: 7383.94
End time: 7389.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So i'm hopeful right and his privacy rules were pretty I mean, they're pretty stringent. They're they go pretty far exactly

Start time: 7389.96
End time: 7423.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's in fact what's being overturned right now. I I think that though you're right david when you say it was it was  The public response that changed his mind  Overwhelming public response in the case of net neutrality  So let's keep that pressure up and say and tell them what we want  Maybe we can influence it  All right last story heart bleed  Uh, and it's not really there's not much to say about this. It's a very technical topic  I guarantee you we'll be covering it in great depth on tuesday with steve gibson  but in short

Transcript:  On a week ago saturday  Tavis ormandy at google started noticing some very odd  data in cached  Uh information from websites doug deeper and he realized it was websites that were using  services from cloud flare, which is a cdn network often used by people to  prevent ddos attacks and for other purposes and uh, it contacted well, he didn't contact cloud flare he tweeted  To cloud flare and cloud flare reacted very quickly on friday  It was an all hands event a week ago friday  and within 47 minutes they discovered and fixed the bug a bug that uh,  Was a kind of weird interaction between two different pieces of software they use  And uh, so they mitigated it. They didn't announce it publicly until google wiped the cached information which took them another week  And we learned about this just a few days ago  um it if  Cloud bleed affected affected a lot a large number of sites  Although if you're interested, I do encourage you to watch the interview we did yesterday  on the new screensavers with the chief of encryption at cloud flare who I think did a good job of explaining it and  What he essentially said was  Our cto who is a good friend of the show john graham coming i've known him for years  And myself are we are not changing our passwords. So that should give you some idea of how serious  We consider this it is not  Uh hair on fire time by any means, but we will we'll you know, we'll watch this with interest  It's pretty technical. So i'm not sure there's a whole lot to say except  I think cloud flare responded appropriately  and quickly  And uh did what needed to be done and I don't think they were to be to blame for this  This wasn't a case of them accidentally leaking  Information because they did things stupidly or badly there was a bug  A really pretty stupid programming bug in a library that we're using that interacted poorly  with some of the other software they were using what seemed interesting to me about this is

Start time: 7552.14
End time: 7563.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wondering if it isn't  A service or maybe incumbent may not incumbent  But it would be a nice service from your password managers like last pass to be the determinants of when you do need to change

Start time: 7563.76
End time: 7601.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your passwords. They don't do anything like that. Do they they do both one password and last pass have a security checkup  The watchtower program on one pass and last pass security check, but the problem is it's not it's not  It's very difficult to know a what sites were affected and b what information was leaked  There's no way to know that so this isn't like the target breach where you can look at a database released of target information or  And say oh well look at all these email addresses. You've been pwned. This isn't going to show up in that way  So it's very difficult to for them to do that  In other words, however, if you last pass services is passive though

Start time: 7602.08
End time: 7617.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to go in and dig around and find that watchtower is a little opposed to  When you log on to your vault and then it would say hey just so you know  This vulnerability happened and therefore this password could be vulnerable. It's impossible. Unfortunately, it's impossible to know

Start time: 7618.04
End time: 7689.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So but the good news about any password vault is they generally have some sort of simple automated system where you can change passwords  In my opinion you don't need to especially if you're using two-factor authentication this if you have two-factor turned on an unimportant  Accounts, you really don't have anything to worry about but I would suggest you listen to our interview with nick sullivan  He's the head of crypto a cloud flare  We talked to him yesterday in the new screensavers and tune in Tuesday because steve gibson will have a deep dive  I'm sure into this bug and what it means and and what you could do to mitigate it. I in my opinion  There's nothing to worry about at this point  But it's hard to write good news and security. Yeah, it's better news than  Well, and if you you know, for instance, there's a github page that publishes a list of every company that uses cloudflare  They're not all affected by this  In fact, it was a very tiny percentage of companies that use cloudflare that were that are affected by this. So  It's probably not a problem  But you never know do you?  All right, david poke tell me why  Nova has decided to go to kickstarter to raise money  For is it a show? What is it exactly you're doing?

Start time: 7691.16
End time: 7740.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it is a show. It's a two-hour special about molecules and the elements called beyond the elements  and you're right, this is really kind of extraordinary that a  Public television show is seeking money from the public via a kickstarter campaign  It's it's nova kickstarter.com  Nova kickstarter.com and we're looking to yeah, there we go. We're looking to make two hundred thousand dollars to start shooting this thing  And we're about halfway there  um, and you know, it comes at a time when both public broadcasting is being defunded and science is being defunded  so to me it's kind of like  Guys, let's let's show the world that science matters science education matters  Nova's an amazing show. It's been on the air for almost 45 years. It's the most watched science show in america

Start time: 7740.64
End time: 7745.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great show and you're great on it. I watch it every single week. I love nova. Well, thank you

Start time: 7745.68
End time: 7780.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're yeah, so this is a sequel to hunting the elements that that I hosted in 2012. It's now  a staple of of high school  Science curriculums all over the all over the country  Um, and we're hoping to take it one step farther  But I mean just getting involved with this as always with kickstarter. It's not just about the money, right? There are these cool  Rewards and one of them is as we shoot this show  I will be sending you you know outtakes and bloopers and backstage videos right from my phone  In the various places we go  And there's some there's some cool rewards too. You can you can have lunch with me

Start time: 7781.26
End time: 7800.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, who wouldn't who wouldn't want to back that I feel like we've cheated because one of the levels of rewards is a video chat  with you david and  Here I am kind of doing that so  But i'll look for your name in the list of backers leo now you got a ways to go and I and I think that one of  The things I remember you well, what did you initially ask for a million dollars? Was that right?

Start time: 7801.54
End time: 7830.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we yeah, the original ask was a million dollars. We're going to try to almost fund the thing through kickstarter  and unfortunately, we launched the day after the inauguration  When you know the the country's hair was on fire and people were funding  Really important things, you know planned parenthood and the aclu and it was kind of like we ranked too low on the who cares meter  I think  At the time so we we closed that we've relaunched with a much lower target and you're almost there

Start time: 7830.60
End time: 7844.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're halfway there anyway 12 days to go 91 000 raised 200 000 is the goal. There are a thousand backers so far  Uh, this is definitely worthwhile and this isn't really in a sense. This isn't new for public broadcasting  It's always been supported by its viewers

Start time: 7845.60
End time: 7870.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true that the stations are supported by the viewers and then that money trickles back through a very complicated  series of channels the corporation for public broadcasting and pbs and wgbh and and  Eventually winds up at the individual shows  But this is a really remarkable experiment going  Directly from nova to the public. In fact one particular special one documentary that we're trying to make to the public

Start time: 7871.04
End time: 7873.72
