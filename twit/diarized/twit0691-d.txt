You were doing internet history long before you were doing Tech Meme, right?  Yeah, five years.  So now here it is in advanced uncorrected proof form, how the internet happened.  Congratulations on the release of the book.  That's great.  Thank you, Leo.  You can see a full interview with Brian on triangulation for this week with Megan Moroney.  Nice, triangulation 371.

Transcript:  Oh, there's a bunch of stuff.  There's Moron Gate.  There's Satellite.  Wait a minute.  What's Moron Gate?  Oh, this was the latest...  A press conference was called this week by an internet celebrity called Jacob Wohl who  apparently basically responds to every tweet Trump makes with, oh, you're the best thing  in the world.  Anyway, he called...  I've never heard of this man.  Oh, don't worry.  A lot of people haven't.  But he called a press conference in Virginia saying that they had proof that Robert Mueller  had had an affair.

But it was all based on this report by Surefire Intelligence, created by somebody who doesn't  know about Google image reverse search.  Oh dear.  Because all the sort of...  If you search for the pictures of the people there, it was both Jacob Wohl himself, the  guy who plays the Jew Hunter in Inglourious Basterds, one of Israel's top supermodels.  You think, really?  They're doubling down to work for you guys.  And then the affidavit was robo-signed and it was a complete farce.  But yes, it got the Moron Gate tag and I was just like, yeah, that's good.

Start time: 367.88
End time: 448.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The internet, it's quite a concept and someday we'll all understand how it works.  So there was that.  There was Apple had a little event.  Yes.  Yes.  We could talk about that, of course.  Apple also released financial results and decided, you know, folks, this is the last  time we're going to tell you.  This is the last time we're going to tell you how well the iPhone, iPad, Macintosh sale.  I wonder why.  Well, Luca Mainstreet, the CFO said, because it doesn't reflect our business.  What?  How does that even legal?  Isn't the reason that-  A lot of companies do it.  No, Microsoft does the same thing.  They don't break out individual sales.  It seems to me, and I don't really understand this and I was hoping maybe somebody smart  would explain it to me, that the whole reason publicly held companies are supposed to give  quarterly results is so that investors can make an intelligent decision about whether  to buy their stock or not, whether to invest in the company or not.  And it seems to me, Jermain, when you are talking to investors about your quarterly  results that you tell them how they're doing, you know, how your stuff is selling.  Yep.  You'd think, but-  Is there no enforcement on this?  Are you allowed to do anything you want in your results?  Could you just say, hey, it was great.  Thumbs up.  We're doing great.

Start time: 449.34
End time: 454.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to fully disclose certain categories of the financials.

Start time: 455.00
End time: 458.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like revenue and profits.  Exactly.  Tax rate.

Start time: 458.52
End time: 489.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one of the things that Apple is transitioning into is cloud services and other services  from which they're making tons of money, hand over fist.  And you can't really count that very well.  It's not like iPhone sales.  The other thing is that they're facing increasing competition on the unit sales, but nobody  can touch Apple on the amount of profit they can gain from any sort of tablet or phone  or anything like that.  So they're very happy to talk about the money they're making.  They don't want to talk about the number of phones.

Start time: 489.16
End time: 491.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can talk about cost of sales.  They could talk about sales.

Start time: 492.36
End time: 517.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they were trying to say that margins are all that matters, right?  That's the new metric that they're trying to transition to.  But even the analogy that they came up with on that call where it's like, well, it doesn't  matter what's in the shopping cart when you go to the checkout line in the grocery store  or whatever.  In my mind, that kind of argues exactly against the point they were trying to make.  As Leo's saying, as an investor, I kind of want to know what's in the shopping cart.

Start time: 518.45
End time: 523.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  How well is that iPhone selling?  And it's completely coincidental, but iPhone sales went up 0%.

Start time: 526.02
End time: 531.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is it.  We've reached peak smartphone now.  Everyone who was going to buy a smartphone has got a smartphone.

Start time: 531.68
End time: 534.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But margins went up because they charged so much.

Start time: 534.20
End time: 535.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because you pay the Cupertino Idiot Tax.

Start time: 536.16
End time: 538.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Globally, though, smartphone sales overall.

Start time: 538.46
End time: 540.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Cupertino Idiot Tax.  OK, I thought you said that.

Start time: 541.00
End time: 564.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that related to Morongate, the idiot tax?  Globally, smartphone sales on a unit sold perspective have declined 6%.  And that's just saturation, right?  Exactly.  Apple is doing better than average in terms by breaking even, by leveling out.  And they're just figuring out how to charge more and more and more.  And that's, I guess, a great business that they can keep doing it.

Start time: 565.04
End time: 569.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the problem.  They're charging more and more and more.  And I'm not seeing that much innovation coming out of Apple in the last five years.

Start time: 569.62
End time: 596.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with not knowing how many unit sales is you don't get the specific metric  on the ecosystem.  You don't know how attractive the iPhone is as an app development platform.  If you don't know how many people have iPhones, you know what I'm saying?  It's great that Apple's making a ton of money on iPhones, but if they're selling fewer of  them or if it's in decline or if it doesn't compare well to Samsung or something like  that, that tells you a lot about the future of the company, the ecosystem, the developers  and all that.

Start time: 597.44
End time: 691.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example.  Here's Jason Snell at Six Colors, does these great pie charts.  And he's got iPhone, which is 59% iPad, Mac.  But next-  He only has four colors, by the way.  Yeah.  And you won't need as many colors because the wedge will just be this.  Sales of stuff, Mac, iPhone, iPad, all looks like this.  In other words, we're going to stop breaking that stuff out.  And I think that that's kind of, I don't know, look, I'm not investing in Apple, but I think  that if you're covering Apple, I think it's important.  For instance, one of the conversations, and we'll get to this in a second, we're going  to have is future of the Mac compared to the future of iOS devices.  And I think that the breakdown is relevant there.  I do want to point out one thing.  You see this service is 16%.  Apple doesn't break that out either.  For instance, is that from app sales?  Is that from Apple Music?  Well, I'll tell you where a big chunk of it is.  From Google.  Yeah.  Turns out Google, this is according to Forbes, I'm sorry, Fortune, in 2018 will pay Apple  $9 billion to, which is by the way, about what their quarterly results are for services.  So a quarter of their total revenue just to be the default search engine in Safari.  And Business Insider says next year it will be $12 billion.  If you say my services, they're doing great.  But then if people know, it's not that you're selling a lot of music or you're selling a  lot of apps, it's that Google's given you a huge bank just to be that little box.

Start time: 692.04
End time: 726.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reason they're doing that is because Apple has a perfect monopoly in the world  of iOS devices.  And they get away with not being considered a monopoly because they, oh, smartphone sales  are only a fraction of smartphones.  No, the Android ecosystem is the market.  The iOS ecosystem is that market.  And Apple has a perfect monopoly, 100% of market share in the iOS market.  That's why they can say, Google, if you want to be anywhere near the iPhone, then you're  going to give us $12 billion next year.  That's the most brutal monopoly in history, as far as I can tell.

Start time: 727.02
End time: 737.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also that the data that Apple users provide will be very, very valuable.  I mean, they're not giving this away, not expecting to make a profit out of it.  If you're buying an Apple piece of Apple kit, you're used to paying over the odds for technology.

Start time: 738.28
End time: 762.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the interesting thing.  Google's must be making more than $9 billion.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, they're not a charity.  Yeah, I mean, they're doing it because it's profitable for them.  Yeah.  So you think it's information beyond just the fact that you're using Google to do search  on Safari on the iPhone and it's taking you to a Google page that has Google advertisements  on it.  There's more than that?  You think Apple's leaking information to Google?

Start time: 762.60
End time: 782.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Apple's actually always been very strong on not leaking information like that.  But at the same time, you've got, they do have, you say there's a lockdown on the iOS  market is tremendously valuable to advertisers because, you know, they are generally well  off, the most well off people on the planet, and they're willing to pay over the odds for  what they want.  Where the spenders are.

Start time: 782.58
End time: 797.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're dumb enough to spend them over a thousand dollars for a phone.  Well, I didn't say that.  It's a perfect customer.  It must be dumb enough to buy my product.  That's for sure.  Apple revenue, 62.9 billion.  I think almost a billion.

Start time: 798.08
End time: 801.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is three months.  I think it's something about 138 million a day for the last year.

Start time: 805.76
End time: 826.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Profit 14 billion in three months.  But you see it's very cyclical, isn't it?  Those peaks, if you're watching, you'll see these peaks and that's every, that's in, well,  actually that's, yeah, that's the first quarter, Q1.  That's the results from the holiday period.  Q1 is January, February, March, no, no, for Apple it's...  They're on a weird schedule.

Start time: 826.80
End time: 832.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not, they're not, they're fiscal years different to the calendar.  The big ones are holidays.  Holiday sales.  Holiday season coming into December.

Start time: 833.37
End time: 870.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Q1 is, okay, that's it.  It's October, November, December.  It's when the new iPhone has come out, when the new iPad has come out and now people are  buying it.  So you really don't see, the reason you see flat sales in this quarter, the fourth quarter  of the fiscal year is because the new iPhones are barely recorded there.  They had just come out.  So really that's flat demand because everybody's waiting for the next generation.  Yep.  We won't see it, but they'll likely be one of those big spikes next quarter as people  buy the new iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, 8, 9, 7, 6, 5.  Yeah, 6, 5.

Start time: 872.76
End time: 883.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, I think Brian, you may have a point on this, but it just seemed like Apple's  going back to, we were talking about this in the office, it seems like they're going  back to the scully days where they sort of a plethora of models, but no real innovation.

Start time: 883.90
End time: 925.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is bleeding into the conversation about the Mac thing, but you know, when I was  on here last time, we were talking about the confusion just about the names for phones,  but now the confusion about if I wanted to buy a 13 inch laptop, I think there's 18 different  SKUs now.  And you have the MacBook Air that is in the name, it seems like it's the thin and lightest,  but it's not the lightest.  There's one that's got nowhere at all.  Right, right, right.  You've got the MacBook, which costs significantly more than what is probably the better laptop  in the light.  I have no idea what to think of that.  Well, Brian, you may have...

Start time: 925.92
End time: 933.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is one thing that Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple.  That's exactly right.  He took those crazy SKUs and he simplified, they're going the opposite direction.

Start time: 933.40
End time: 954.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another way to look at that is that only Steve Jobs made Apple not a regular company in that  way because companies want to have a specific device for every possible segment of the market.  And Steve Jobs, his whole perspective was, no, here's the phone, it's called the iPhone,  buy it.  There's only one.  And that was kind of his mindset.  Which is more appropriate?

Start time: 955.04
End time: 968.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, maybe Steve was wrong.  Maybe the modern Apple should have...  Oh my God, I don't even know how many phones, different models of phones they sell.  They still sell the 7, right?  They still sell the 8.  I believe so.  They still sell the 10.  They still sell the 10S, 10S Max?

Start time: 970.10
End time: 996.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was the point I made on the show last time was that I really strongly believe next  year they're going to go to, it's going to be the iPhone 2020.  And because I said, car makers figured this out a long time ago.  There used to be a model 10, a model, whatever.  But so next year, we'll release it in 2019, but we're going to call it the iPhone 2020.  And that's going to be what we're going to do.  But you're the internet historian, Brian.

Start time: 996.70
End time: 1007.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who else did that.  Microsoft.  Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000.  And then they stopped.  And then no one ever mentions any anymore.

Start time: 1007.96
End time: 1009.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they went back to numbers.

Start time: 1010.18
End time: 1012.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They went to numbers and then they started skipping numbers too.

Start time: 1013.10
End time: 1029.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they stopped.  Yeah.  You really wonder how these...  I don't know what the right answer is, but you just wonder.  Nevertheless, iPhone year over year revenue, despite the fact that sales were flat, year  over year revenue up 29%.  That's the number in a nutshell.

Start time: 1030.88
End time: 1034.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having a nice high margins and continually rising prices.

Start time: 1034.32
End time: 1037.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this mean that people are willing to spend more than a thousand dollars for a smartphone?

Start time: 1039.26
End time: 1043.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Unfortunately, so I don't understand it, but you know, such is life.

Start time: 1043.32
End time: 1070.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a, there's a lot of expectation that people spend even more and more and more.  I just wrote a piece about the coming wave of flexible screen devices that are coming  out.  There's already one that's...  Oh yes, I saw some video of this this week.  Yeah.  I saw a bunch of them working on that.  But the Samsung flexible screen device, it's basically a kind of a flip phone type of thing,  but this is one continuous screen is expected to sell for $2,000 for a smartphone.  Yeah.  So they think...

Start time: 1071.46
End time: 1083.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is your computer, right?  It's your...  And let's not forget that Apple's computers, if you include the iPad, are all much more  expensive and close to $2,000.  So is your phone your primary...  It's your primary computer for most people.

Start time: 1084.92
End time: 1090.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?  I mean...  It's the one that you buy most often.  I think you're the wrong guys to talk to.

Start time: 1090.52
End time: 1106.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of you are writers, you know, you need different kinds of devices.  Yeah.  But generally, I think, I don't know, look at your family and friends.  And definitely outside the Western world.  You don't see people sitting down to computers and a desk anymore at home.  No, but at Starbucks you do.

Start time: 1108.32
End time: 1128.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're trying to work.  They bring laptops.  Like if you think, right, if you think about the...  My mom always hates it when I do this.  I'm thinking about my mom.  Yeah, I know.  She goes on the internet 50 times a day, but she goes on her laptop maybe once a week,  tops, right?  It's like she's on her phone all the time.

Start time: 1128.52
End time: 1130.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's true for me too, really.

Start time: 1130.82
End time: 1141.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in terms of actual time spent online, I can see the phone being the primary one,  but that's just really about consumption.  If you actually want to produce anything, then you've got to spend time on a computer  and a desktop.

Start time: 1142.80
End time: 1159.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, production is looking at pictures, taking pictures, responding to pictures, commenting  on pictures, doing social media.  So right, again, she's retired.  She doesn't have to do work in the capital W sense, but all of the things that she needs  to do, her phone can do for her.

Start time: 1161.20
End time: 1221.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Apple really gives you this information now.  I'm looking at screen time on my iPhone, average on all devices.  I guess iPad too.  I don't know, it's all iOS 12 devices, 6 hours and 13 minutes a day.  That's a lot more than I spent on the desktop or laptop.  That's a lot of time.  I think some of that's Pokemon Go.  19 hours is Pokemon Go.  I'm still playing.  That's sad.  That's so sad.  I spent 2 hours and 7 minutes in settings.  What the hell, I must have passed out.  An hour and a half in the clock.  Come on, man.  An hour and a half in the Apple store.  Yeah, yeah, clock watching.  Maybe I don't want to know this information.  Is that possible?  I don't want to know.  I noticed though, no social media on here because I don't have any social media.  You add that to the mix and that's why Pokemon Go went through the roof.  I got nothing else to do.  It's been really good for my Pokemon Go.

Yeah, gotta catch them all.  So this is, remember we just told you that Google spent 9 billion last year, was going  to spend 12 billion this year on service and that goes into Apple services revenue.  Services revenue is going up.  This is a big thing for Apple, but see if you don't break it out, it sounds like, oh,  Apple music must be doing really well or the app store must be making them a ton of money.

Transcript:  But remember, okay, all right, and I'm playing devil's advocate here because I think that  this is silly, especially if you're an Apple investor.  But everyone knows that, like we said at the very beginning, Mike said it, we've reached  peak smartphone.  Everyone knew it was coming, right?  So again, if you think about what they did, they were blatant about it.  We all know that we're going to reach this ceiling where if we sell 10 million more iPhones  next quarter, does that really matter?  Because it's not going to lead to a trend where all of a sudden we're going to sell  100 million in two years.  So forget about that.  Just worry about our margins and our average selling price.

Transcript:  So then, but then the second thing is, is what is the watchword on Wall Street right  now?  It's all about everybody turning something into a service.  Everyone wants this subscription revenue sort of stuff.  So actually the thing that investors should be concerned about or pissed off about would  be, okay, so Apple wants to say, don't worry about our cash cow.  We're going to be delivering these iPhones all the time.  Worry about our growth rate.  The way we're going to deliver growth to the stock is by the services stuff, is by getting  people to subscribe $50 a month, $100 a month, $200 a month.  And that's where we're going to become a $2 trillion company.  So then if I was an Apple investor, then I would be, I actually wouldn't care about the  iPhone breakout.  I would care about breaking out the services.  I agree.

Transcript:  well.  Well, I think one of the other things that is that Apple has been facing a future transition  difficult for them to pull off even for Apple.  And that is the transition to getting mainstream users to use iOS instead of Mac OS for their  desktop.  That's the conversation we're about to have.  iPad sales look terrible, but I think the future of the desktop is an iPad this big.  I agree.

Start time: 1479.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Data storage is, you were just saying, we're moving to the cloud.  Services of the future.  IBM just spent $34 billion on Red Hat, a services company.  The cloud is everything these days and data storage in the cloud is a huge concern.  According to estimates, there'll be 163 zettabytes in the cloud by the year 2025.  That's 21 zeros.  163 zettabytes.  If you're going to the cloud or you're doing a hybrid solution or you're thinking about  moving your data up to the private or public cloud, you've got to find out about Wasabi.  Clearly, being able to efficiently and affordably store the data is critical.  Did I say affordable?  I did.  Wasabi was created by two of my great friends, the David friend, literally that's his name,  who started Carbonite and his buddy, Jeff Flowers.  They created Wasabi because of the things they learned at Carbonite.  In particular, they had a patented unique technique for writing directly to the disk  on hard drives that's going to save you a ton of money.  They lay disks, data on the disk sequentially, not in blocks, and that results in storage  that's 80% cheaper and six times faster than S3.  One tier of service too, unlimited free egress.  You don't have to think about that because it's not going to cost you anything.  It's awesome and 11 nines of data durability.  11 nines.  Secure, in fact, in some cases more secure than your on-prem storage.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  They don't charge you for egress.  They don't charge you for API calls.  Super fast uploads, the fastest possible downloads, six times faster than S3.  Data center redundancy.  There's one other thing I really like that I think is unique to them.  Immutable storage.  You can designate some of your data or all of it as immutable.  It's protected against accidental or malicious deletions or modifications.  No chance of ransomware getting into your cloud and corrupting your data.  No chance of fat-fingered employees deleting your data.  It's protected.  And if you've got to move petabytes to the cloud fast and easily, take a look at the  Wasabi Ball.  It allows you to migrate data simply, quickly, and fully, securely.  I understand.  You're looking.  All I ask is you add one more name to your list.  W-A-S-A-B-I, wasabi.com.  If you click that free trial link, we're going to get you unlimited storage for a month.  So you can try it.  You can verify all of these claims.  I think you'll see this is the solution for you.  And man, the boss will love you when you come there and say, hey boss, it's six times faster  and 80% cheaper.  Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I, wasabi.com.  Use the offer code TWIT to try it free, unlimited, for a month.  That is an amazing story.  One of these days we'll get David and Jeff on and we'll talk to them.  88, what am I saying the phone number for?  You can't call.  I was going to say 88, 88, ask Leah.  No, no, that was just habitual.  This is TWIT.  That's what we're doing.  And we're talking about the Apple event on Tuesday, which by the way, cost us a copyright  strike on YouTube.  I don't know yet how that's going to come out.  For I think 12 years we've been streaming whenever Apple streams an event or Google  or Microsoft streams an event, we rebroadcast their stream with our commentary on top of  it.  That seems to me to be fair use because it's for use in commentary so people can understand  more than just watching the stream.

So TWITLIVE is off right now because of that.  We've appealed it, of course, and I do hope that we'll get back on TWITLIVE.  But we fortunately have other streamers, Mixer and Twitch, Ustream, other places you can  watch.  So if you just, you know, a little programming note if you can't see it on YouTube Live right  now, that's why.  But we did watch it at 7 a.m. here because they were in Brooklyn.

Transcript:  I'm just going to say, Brian, from my personal experience, begging does not help.  Yeah, I know.  I've been to an Apple event since 2009.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's all right.  I don't mind.  In fact, I thought the best thing we could do is to stream it and comment on it.  And I think that that's a valuable thing to do.  But I'm sitting there.  So first of all, we already knew everything they were going to say.  There were no surprises.  So all you're watching at this point is for little details and maybe trying to get some  flavor.  It's basically Kremlinology for what's going on.  What is Apple's positioning?  Because that's what these events are most.  You could read a press release that gives you the specs, the prices, the availability  and you'd be done.  But what you're watching, at least what I'm watching on stage very carefully, is the nuance  of what Apple's saying.  They started by talking about Macs, which first was very, as a Mac fan, was very gratifying.  Hallelujah, with a little Mac love.  They announced a new MacBook Air with frankly an anemic processor.  Yeah, very poor spec.  Very poorly spec'd and very inexpensive, $1199.  We were hoping it would be sub-$1000.  It's not.  They do have a sub-$1000 MacBook Air.  It's the old one.  Then they announced a Mac Mini, which with lots of ports.  We bought both.  We're going to use that Mac Mini.  Also more expensive.  $100 more than the base model last time, which was, let's face it, four years ago last time.  I think the dollar was worth less.  But nevertheless, then they go to the iPads and suddenly everything's shiny, bright, new,  faster.  I realized if you had started with the iPads and went to the Macs, it would have been like,  oh man, how depressing is this?

Start time: 1873.04
End time: 1881.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, it's the essential message they're pushing, which for me was, you will buy an iPad whether  you like it or not.  We're going to price and spec our systems to do it.

They had a song.  Apple II forever.  They killed it six months later.  It was very clear to me that this is basically the end of the line for Mac OS.

Transcript:  Furthermore, they're also beholden to Intel, right?  One of the reasons that Apple's Macintosh line has been held back is that Intel is stymied.  It can't seem to do a 10 nanometer chip.  Apple is very clear.  We've got the first seven nanometer chip in production, the A12X.  I feel like Apple would love to get out from under Intel.  Even for the Macs.

Start time: 2045.00
End time: 2076.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Intel's got massive problems at the moment.  Their work on 10 nanometer is completely stalled.  Cobalt which we're trying out as a method of getting around it hasn't worked.  At the same time, other chip companies are eating their breakfast and they've got major  supply problems on the server side because they've got 99% of the market and people are  still buying those chips and they can't produce them fast enough.  Plus they've lost their CEO in rather unusual circumstances.  Intel just seems to be flailing at the moment.  I don't blame Apple for trying to dump them.

Transcript:  The other thing is that they're grappling with a new generation of people who, like  you were saying earlier, only want to use their phones.  They grew up with touch devices.  They only remember touch devices.  There are lots of kids these days who never used a mouse before.  They think it's kind of a weird contraption from the Victorian era or something like that.  And let's face it, this is how change really happens.  Old people die and young people are born.  And so they basically they're thinking, OK, in 20 years or 10 years, how are we going  to get today's iPhone, 20 year old iPhone users to buy a really expensive second computer  for their desk?  And it's got to be something that's going to be iPhone.  Otherwise, otherwise they're not going to buy it.

I think there are going to be screens everywhere on your face, on the wall, on the desktop  surface will be a screen.  But this whole touch, it's all going to be iOS like.

End time: 2218.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Brian.  Yeah, I was going to say that's fine and great, but there could be a fairly long interim here  before that reality comes.  So the question is, and this has been debated.  I'm not the first one to bring this up, but at what point do they risk?  Apple's always been the company of creatives and high end professionals.  It's the thing that kept Apple alive as a company in the late 90s.  What's the tipping point where those people have to go away and go to someone else?  And also, what is the tipping point where Apple is fine with that?

Start time: 2218.76
End time: 2240.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Brian wasn't at the point of the event.  That's what I'm saying.  Let's see what's in the making.  It was about creativity.  It was a Brooklyn Academy of Music in the Opera House.  It was you create with an iPad.  You can create with it.  So you got the keyboard issue and somebody told me that kids don't care if they type  on glass, which I find hard to believe.  Maybe they don't want to type ever at all.

Start time: 2240.70
End time: 2258.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying, Leo, is the interim of the next five or 10 years.  And I find it fascinating.  Look at the recent surface events and look at all the things that Microsoft has been  producing in hardware.  I feel like Microsoft is super aware of this, too, and they're pounce.  They're ready to pounce and grab this market and say, we'll take the creatives if Apple  doesn't want them.

Start time: 2259.02
End time: 2309.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But their solution was this, was to make a hybrid, a desktop operating system that has  touch.  The surface books and all of that stuff.  Yeah, I agree.  And I don't know.  Honestly, I think at least certainly with Windows 8, it was a horrible mistake.  Oh, yes.  Maybe they've come out of that hole with Windows 10.  I feel like you can't really hybridize.  Apple clearly said, no, we're never going to put touch on our Macs.  We're going to make a clear distinction.  To me, the biggest problem is not creatives.  I think if you look at an iPad Pro nowadays, a lot of artists, designers, even video editors  are going to be attracted to it.  But the biggest problem is developers.  There's no good development path on an iPad Pro.  You at best, you know, SSH out to a terminal somewhere.

Start time: 2309.40
End time: 2332.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

You can.  Well, no, if you're a short ass like me, then the back end of the...  Oh, short what?  A short ass.  Okay.  What does that mean?  Arse.  Someone who is compact and bijou.  Okay.

The biggest leap they made was adding a file system to the iPad to iOS where now you can  just download folders and stuff like that.  And they're chipping away at it.  And they have to tackle the development issue.  They have to tackle...  Yeah, because somebody has to write the software for the iOS devices.

And people are hanging onto their laptops and their desktops and they're not really  moving to iPad.  And if they do get an iPad, they hang on to it for a decade or whatever.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, because all of this talk about future computing and we're not going to have  to...  Again, the reality is go into any office, be it an architect's office, an accountant's  office, anything.  I was in Bloomberg doing stuff for the book.  It's all...  You still need a keyboard.  Now, Apple, granted, doesn't have that market.  It's still a Windows PC market.  But at the same time, if it's just...  But again, it was what we were saying earlier about the phone usage.  If it's just for media, then that's fine.  However, that's still ignoring an entire segment of a computing market that still requires  machines to be updated.  And if Apple just wants to walk away from that, that was my original question.  Maybe my original question is not, are they willing to walk away from creatives?  When is the point when they're willing to walk away from the Mac?  That's probably the bottom line question.

Transcript:  If we're walking into offices, let's walk into an office with Terminator Vision where  we have insight into which of the devices people are using were profitable for the companies  that sold them.  So you go into an enterprise or something like that.  Yeah, there are keyboards everywhere and screens everywhere, but the money is being made from  services.  That's the biggest thing, not from those devices.  And people are using phones, which if they're iPhones, those are massively profitable.  If they're Android phones, they're break even.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's not really from Apple's perspective.  They don't care about having every device be an Apple device.  They're looking at which of the profitable devices.  And that ain't laptops and it ain't desktops.

But I do think for those of us who cover this and are interested in this, it's an interesting  question, not an Apple question, but just an interesting question.  What is the future of computing going to look like?  How long are we going to continue to see Bloomberg-style laptops and desktops on the desk?  How long?  At least a decade.  Until we can get virtual reality glasses and dictate?  Yeah, I mean, virtual reality...

So imagine a device for the home that's like a 41 inch screen and it's essentially an iPad  that is also voice controlled and all that kind of stuff.

Magic Leap has been touting this fantasy for the last two or three years, burning through  cash.  We've got other players on the market.  I love the HoloLens.  It was a great toy, but I couldn't conceivably sit down in the office, put that thing on  my head and get any work done.  I think there's easily another five to six years before we get anywhere close to having  that kind of AR experience as a matter of fact.  Because as you say, there's also the latency, there's the bandwidth issue and battery life.

We don't know what other startups are going to emerge in that time.  And think about all the companies that emerged in the last six years.  It's going to be pretty fascinating.  What we do know is that augmented and mixed reality is going to be a very compelling thing.  I think it's going to be extremely ubiquitous and multiple levels.  We're going to have low, low, it's just going to be like Ready Player One where our hero  in that movie had this really low quality experience until he started winning money  and then he got the really nice one.  It's going to be like that.  Augmented and mixed reality is going to be absolutely everywhere for almost everyone  within a decade.

However, Stuxnet did leak out and then affect everybody else.  Okay, so there was some collateral damage.  Blowback.  Yeah.  They were so pissed at that, that they started to roll up...  Try to roll up the CIA moles in their operation.  And they got one guy...  This is a story from The Telegraph.  By 2011, Iran had infiltrated the CIA spy network and in May, it announced they had  broken up a 30-strong ring of American spies.  But the interesting thing is, this happened because they got one guy who said, oh yeah,  I've been communicating...  This is actually, Yahoo News gets the credit for this, which is kind of, seems like an  oxymoron, but no, it still exists.  They caught one guy who said, yeah, I communicate with the CIA on this website.  This was back in 2009.

The Yahoo article starts, in 2013, hundreds of CIA officers, many working non-stops for  weeks, scrambled to contain a disaster of global proportions, a compromise of the agency's  internet-based covert communication system.  Teams of CIA experts worked feverishly to take down and reconfigure the websites secretly  used for these communications.  Others managed operations to exfiltrate assets to safety.  When this was going on, and the source was a former intelligence official, when this  was going on, he said, or she said, it was all that mattered.

Is it too late?  No, we got another little ways to go.  You want to put...  Just don't forget.  Yeah, I'll set a timer.  If you hear an explosion from the freezer, we've left it too long.  I'm in the mood.  I don't know about you.  I'm in the mood to get nude.  Our show today...  Good to know.  Okay, right.  I'm going to need that drink faster than...

Transcript:  I'm Brooklyn Brian McCullough, the tech meme drive home, ride home, drive home, ride home.  Every day at 5 p.m.  Yes, sir.  How's that doing?  A daily news show.  What a crazy concept.  Who would do that?  You'd have to be nuts to do something like that.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Let's talk about buying a house for a minute.  Quicken Loans, number one lender in the country, eight years in a row, number one in customer  satisfaction according to JD Power.  That's a pretty strong statement.  I'm sure they'll get it again this year.  What's really cool is there's a nice side effect to that.  As of December, they are now the largest home lender in the country.  I think that they go together.  You make your customers happy.  They're going to tell their friends more people are going to use you.  You're going to become number one in every respect.  I'll give you an example.  They're very customer focused.  They created Rocket Mortgage for us.  People who don't want to go to the bank to get a home loan.  Do it all online.  Rocket Mortgage is so easy.  You can actually apply for a loan on your phone.  It's fast too.  They call it the power buying process.  You go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number two, rocketmortgage.com slash twit  two.  You answer a few simple questions.  Within around 10 minutes, they're going to check your credit and give you the loans you  qualify for.  You choose the term, the rate, the down payment and you've got pre-qualified approval.  That fast.  You can do it in an open house.  Step two kicks in.  Within 24 hours in most cases, Quicken Loans will verify your income, your assets and your  credit and then they give you verified approval.  There's even a button on the app that says print the letter.  You can give it to your realtor.  More importantly, you give it to the sellers.  You move right to the front of the line.  You've got the power of a cash buyer.  The seller goes, oh, oh, they got verified approval.  They're good for the money.  Great.  You're going to beat out anybody who's saying, well, we'll buy the house if we get the loan.  No, you don't have to.  But step three is even better.  Now, one of the things that's changed in borrowing in the last couple of months is interest rates  are going up.  That means if it takes you a while to find a house, your loan could cost you a lot more  as interest rates go out.  So Quicken Loans protects you.  Once you're verified, step three, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  Your rate can't go up.  Interest rates can go up, but your rate can't go up.  If interest rates go down, your rate will go down.  Either way, you win.  I love that.  It's exactly why America's largest mortgage lender, Quicken Loans, is its most beloved.  To get started, it's simple.  You go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison  to public data records.  I guess my question is, if they've got one...  Who was excited when the very first words practically out of Tim Cook's mouth were  Macintosh?  I can't believe we got new Mac minis.

Transcript:  We couldn't kill the phone, by the way.  It didn't work.  It's supposed to stop the clock, right?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you, this is actually the weirdest story ever.  And Kyle Weins of ifixit.org wrote it up on the iFixit blog.  It starts in a hospital just outside of Chicago.  They got a new MRI machine.  And all of a sudden, everybody's phone in the hospital, the guy, the assistant in the  hospital gets all these calls.  People say, my phone's not working.  It stopped working.  And at first he thought, oh, as I would have thought, it must have been an EMP, like some  burst of electricity fried the phones.  But it was weird because no Android phone stopped working.  Even iPhone, there was an iPhone 5 in the hospital.  It did work.  It was just later iPhones that stopped working and Apple watches.  And he couldn't figure it out.  Anybody who's fixed computers or has been a geek, you've had this experience where,  I don't know, that makes no sense.  But at the same time, I always in my head, and I even say this sometimes on the radio  show, look, these are not magical machines.  Everything is deterministic.  There's a cause and effect.  There's something that happened, but we just can't figure it out.  The guy's name is Eric Woldridge.  He posted the puzzle on Reddit.  That was a good move.  Other sysadmins said, you know, MRI machines are cooled with liquid helium.  Maybe it was the helium.  So he investigated and found, yes, there was a little helium leak in that new machine.  It vented into the building and because the MRI room was not on an isolated HVAC loop,  it got pumped into the ventilation.  It was about 90,000 liters of gaseous helium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's what Kyle said.  I bet the nurse's voices were higher pitched that day.  But what people didn't know, and it's even in the iPhone manual.  Nowadays, most devices are made with MEMS, microelectromechanical machines.  These are tiny physical machines.  In fact, here's one from Kyle's article.  That one right there is a gyroscope and this is an accelerometer.  If you actually look closely at the accelerometer, you can see it's broken.  The way this works is these things go back and forth.  They move.  This one got broken.  This is 50 nanometers.  This is a scanning electron microscope.  You cannot see this.  In order to save room in iPhones, Apple has started using these MEMS for gyroscopes accelerometers  and Apple is one of the few companies that uses a MEM for the oscillator.  All computers have a clock in them.  I think it's a 32 kilohertz clock.  It's literally the heartbeat of the computer.  Every tick of the clock, the processor moves on.  If that clock stops, the whole thing stops.  It turns out Apple says this in their manual.  I guess nobody read it.  Exposing iPhones to environments having high concentrations of industrial chemicals, including  near evaporating liquefied gases like helium, may damage or impair iPhone functionality.  What it is is these MEMS are oxygen.  Air can't get in.  The molecules are too big, but the helium molecule is two atoms.  It can penetrate.  Then I guess it's like a particle of dust in this tiny thing.  It's a physical impediment.  It didn't break them, but it made the oscillators stop.  Kyle was able to demonstrate this.  He started a clock on his iPhone, put it in there.  He said within eight minutes it had stopped.  Put it in helium.  You could try this at home.  The good news is in most cases it doesn't break it.  Apple says if your device has been affected.

Transcript:  They say leave the unit unconnected from a charging cable.  Let it air out for about a week.  The helium will fully dissipate from the device.  The battery should fully discharge after a week.  Plug your device in.  Let it charge up.  It can then be turned on again.  In other words, once you get the helium out of there, it'll work again.  How bizarre.  How bizarre.

Start time: 4179.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4183.44
End time: 4220.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We tried.  The other thing is apparently Android phones don't use MEMS for oscillators.  I put a Note 9 and an iPhone XR.  It was a brand new R. One of the things Kyle said is R phones have been disassembled.  I think it takes it apart.  Maybe the seals weren't as good.  His phone was more susceptible.  Maybe the people in the hospital had older iPhones that had been around the block.  This was a brand new XR.  Seals are probably still good.  I tried to kill it.  I did it all for you.  You did your best.  Helium, I could not break my MEMS.  Break is not what you want.  You just want it to freeze.  I thought it was an interesting...

Microsoft put out 1809 and it deleted data on a small fraction.  Microsoft said 1 one hundredth of one percent of users, 1500 users.  They pulled it back.  They still haven't released it.  Here we are in November and it's not out.  Apple apparently put out a watch update this week.  WatchOS 5.1 that bricked watches.  Does anybody know about it?

Transcript:  They did the very clever thing, from a PR perspective, of releasing a ton of security  updates one hour after the iPad presentation finished.  Of course everyone was just like, Apple, Apple, Apple, and on all the news feeds.  That dominated everything and nobody actually read the security stuff.  It did brick some devices.  There's also some very interesting hacks they've patched.  Oh really?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft, so this is another thing.  Microsoft, the day before the Apple event, announced that one and a half billion users  are using Windows, actively using Windows.  Tim Cook comes on stage, probably hadn't read that story.  He says, well, we're so happy to report that 100 million people use iOS.  It's like, yeah, not quite in the same ballpark.

Start time: 4331.06
End time: 4365.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what were the flaws?  Oh, there was some stuff in iOS that could allow remote code execution.  The watches needed an update.  Apple TV needed an update.  There were some quite nasty flaws fixed.  Of course, now, whenever you release floor information, immediately everyone starts trying  to reverse engineer it to find ways to access it.  So once the updates are out, you've got to update everything as soon as humanly possible.  I mean, generally, I have a t-shirt with Exploit Wednesday with the Microsoft Windows logo.

Transcript:  I care.  Google had a little bit of a walkout also on Tuesday.  This goes back to the story we reported last week.  Andy Rubin left Google.  It turns out because of a relationship.  Well, I don't know exactly what was going on.  Yeah, I've heard a lot of stories.  Was it a sexual?  It seems like it was consensual, but maybe it wasn't.  Anyway, he was kind of forced out at Google.  You would never have known from the fond farewell he got from Larry Page and the $90 million  check.  Yeah.  But Google says, well, we owed him that because we really didn't give him enough compensation  for bringing us Android, which he did.  And Google's made billions on that.  Yeah.  But on the other hand, it seemed unseemly that somebody should be leaving over sexual  harassment issues and get a big reward.

Start time: 4454.98
End time: 4459.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4460.32
End time: 4467.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The trend wasn't so much that it was about the existence of sexual harassment and things  like that.  By the way, there are quite a few incidents.  Yes, quite a few.  And the overarching trend was the way that company typically seems to be dealing with  these things is to silence the victim and go on with business as usual, to sweep it  all under the rug.  And that seems to be the organizational problem that Google has if these stories are indicative  of how things generally work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which by the way, also this week before this, I think it was on Tuesday, the guy from X,  the moonshot unit was forced to leave and did not get a $90 million payout.  But so I brought up my story from this from the week.  So the five points that the organizers behind this, there were things that I didn't even  know about.  Like that for any, if you sign a contract to work at Google, there's forced arbitration  for cases of harassment and discrimination.  So number one, they want to be able to go to court.  It's as bad as Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4550.88
End time: 4568.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting because we also, if you sign a contract to work for us, have an arbitration  clause and I think most employers in California do because we don't want to get sued in court.  We want to have the right to go to arbitration before we go to court.  And I think most employers do that.  That is controversial.  Yeah.

Start time: 4569.54

Start time: 4589.28
End time: 4618.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I seem to remember that the California assembly passed a bill saying employers could not put  arbitration clauses in their contracts and Jerry Brown vetoed it.  That was fairly recently.  So this is a controversial practice, but I should say it's not unique to Google.  I would say most employers in California, as we do, put that in there because it could  be an employee lawsuit could be very costly, whether it's justified or not.  So we'd always want to go to arbitration if we could.

Start time: 4618.78
End time: 4621.62

Start time: 4622.58
End time: 4627.08

End time: 4655.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think talking to men and women at Google, we had reporters out for the protests.  Demonstration seems a bit strong when the CEO sends you an email saying, you know, this  is fine, go for it.  But I don't think Google's as bad as other tech companies out there.  I think they do actually make a genuine attempt.  There are other companies and we could name names where this kind of thing is still stuck  in a 20 year old mindset.  We're not going to name Uber's name.  Yeah, we'll say the word Uber.

Start time: 4657.22
End time: 4663.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I think is really fascinating is that this is part of a larger story where there's  a growing protest culture within Google.

Start time: 4664.12
End time: 4685.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what I think.  I think that's what's really interesting.  It started with the $10 billion Pentagon, actually started before that with face recognition  and the Pentagon contract.  And then the Chinese search engine.  Google employees signed petitions.  They said no.  Is it a bunch of entitled millennials working for Google?  Or is this the new future of employees?

Start time: 4685.94
End time: 4712.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is the future of Silicon Valley because part of it is that we have this booming  economy.  And so if you're a hot developer in the Valley right now, you can write your own ticket.  You're empowered.  Yeah, exactly.  And so I wrote this big piece for Fast Company last year about how the general sentiment  about Silicon Valley has turned super sour in recent couple of years.

Start time: 4713.14
End time: 4717.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Outside of Silicon Valley.  Yeah, exactly.  The government, the world, the EU.

Start time: 4717.62
End time: 4757.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so now I think Silicon Valley employees are thinking, well, why are we have this bad  reputation?  I go home to the Midwest to my family on Thanksgiving and they're asking me questions like, why is  Silicon Valley so toxic?  Why is everybody so sexist?  Why is everybody so racist?  Why are all these things happening?  And so they're starting to feel like they don't want to be part of it or they believe  they can fix it or something else.  But it's clearly a sea change, a very different cultural element for developers to be protesting.  This is not how Silicon Valley used to work.  It's starting in Google in a big way.  I think it's going to spread throughout the Valley.  Do you think it's a bad thing?

Start time: 4757.12
End time: 4768.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's a bad thing.  In this case, I think employees, it's appropriate for them to say, this is how we want you to  be responsive to these things.

Start time: 4768.72
End time: 4781.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, particularly at Google, which build itself with the don't be evil thing.  You can't recruit people on that kind of level to a company like Google and then say,  actually, we are going to be a bit evil.  You know, China's search engine, the rest of it.  But don't you worry about it.  Just collect the paychecks.

Start time: 4781.36

Transcript:  And Googlers are saying no.  If you look historically, labor movement in this country, I mean, look at, go back to  the riots and the anti-union suppression.  Yeah, you don't get given stuff for free.  You've got to fight for it.  That's where the Pinkertons would come and beat up union guys.  It seems like it's a and then the unions went through a kind of a trough where unions were  kind of not widely regarded, well regarded and seen as somewhat corrupt.  And I think maybe we're coming coming back to another way of thinking about collective  bargaining.

Start time: 4813.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That point made about how much power the best engineers have right now.  And you know, you think of I was the company should remain nameless and the person should  remain nameless.  I was someone that works at a big publicly traded tech company today and he was talking  about how young engineers feel like they don't have anywhere to go where it wasn't even,  you know, in the early 2000s, if you were smart, you went to Google and then it was  Facebook and then it was what and he was he was talking about because he's a recruiter.  Where am I supposed?  Where do these kids want to go?  And so if even the smartest of the smart are like, I don't want to go to Facebook anymore.  I don't want to go to Google anymore because Google is not don't be evil anymore.  Well, now, OK, so then if you're Google and you're facing that sort of a job market, then  the internal employees, you've got to keep them.  So suddenly they do have power.

Start time: 4870.08
End time: 4901.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I mean, employees in some respects always have power if you if they're well  trained and they do a job and you need them.  So in a way, I feel like this is a that this is employees reasserting collective action,  collective action.  I think it's not just it's great because an engineer at Google can individually say,  well, no, I'm not going to put up with that because I'm that's good.  But this is everybody standing up and saying, no, we don't we want our company to have heart  or we want a company to handle sexual harassment cases this way.

Start time: 4901.64
End time: 4907.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4907.54
End time: 4917.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Well, lots of things. So I'm going to make this point and then we can come back to dealing  with it in that context, which is also important.  But, you know, also the idea of if you're an engineer and you're doing work on a project  and you're coding this and then you find out that it's it's being used for something that  you personally do not feel is ethical and you don't know that because you're doing a  little piece of this and a little piece that you don't have the the operational knowledge  of what it in the end, what this product is going into.  Like that's the other part of this that I feel like is fascinating is engineers starting  to say, I need to know what I'm doing, what my work is going towards.

They need to weigh in on how their technologies are being used, that they can't wash their  hands, that the guys at Facebook can't say and gals can't say, oh, it's used to make  a Skinner box to get people to buy more. You can't wash your hands of it. If you're making  the technology, you I think it's a responsibility for what it's how it's used.

And then  you go to Google and it's AI to search video for autonomous drones in a battlefield situation.  And so I can, I understand that like if, and again, maybe it's part of being young and  being idealistic that you you're sold a bill of goods in terms of you're going to change  the world and then wait, change the world means that?

And in fact, they aren't, they have no heart,  they have no soul and don't understand how the world works. But just because they made,  you know, a billion dollars, they think they know everything.  That's different from the fact that the, the, the technologists who are actually writing  the code, I do believe should have some say in how that code is used.  Absolutely. I mean, it's just because you can code doesn't mean you should run the world,  but you should have some say in how it's.

So they were going to introduce a new tax  to if you're making more than 50 million, it's kind of like Prop C. And if you're making more  than a certain amount of money, you get charged a little extra tax on all the people that you have  working in the city. And we use that to solve homelessness. Amazon may have to get that quashed.  Yeah. Amazon got that quashed really quickly and then spent two billion opening up a homeless  shelter, but it could write that money up against tax. So yeah.

They drive around on election day honking and waving and make a big deal out of  it. It's not a... I think a legal remedy is one remedy. A cultural remedy is something we could  really use. I heard a shocking statistic. In 2016, a very consequential election, only 16% of  millennials voted. 16%.  That's insane.  And yet you hear millennials complaining about who the president is. 16%.

It wasn't Twitter that did it.  No, it wasn't Twitter. It was the Democratic Party. But with most of these stories, including  the Facebook story we just talked about, it was the press that exposed these. The press has the  worst rap these days, but it's like one of the last things protecting us from all of these  election-mongering evildoers. It was the press that exposed the Internet Research Agency in Russia,  New York Times Magazine specifically. It's the media doing investigative journalism.

Transcript:  Yeah. Have there been any exploits in the wild? In the wild, it's too hard. Yeah, it's an incredibly  difficult one to do. There have been derivations of those original exploits which have appeared

Start time: 6176.74
End time: 6216.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the wild, but they are few and far between. What has happened is the origin. So a lot of the  exploits we had first heard about were just poor code. Buffer under runs, buffer over runs,  accessing zero pointers, things like that. Those are still around, but now researchers,  and these are by the way, these are like super geniuses. This one was discovered in Finland at  the Tampere University of Technology in Finland and the Technical University of Havana by a team  of five academics. These guys are way smarter than the average hacker. These timing attacks are very

Start time: 6217.62
End time: 6255.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  difficult to implement. The other thing is I have my own gas index, which is Steve Gibson is a  trained and licensed professional. He cares about all the... Yeah, he's got a report on everything.  But really there are big major exploits that are going to completely ruin your life that you can't  do anything about. And there are ones you can do something about. And those are the ones you  should really as a user care about. Because if you can do something about it, do something about it.  Usually it's get the patch updated, et cetera. But there are many of these in the last couple  of years that we've seen where some horrible chip flaw, several Intel flaws where it's like,  well, that's awful. But what are you going to do? You can't do anything about that.

Transcript:  It's kind of like the side channel attacks that occasionally get pitched to us because I used to  cover security on a regular basis. And there it's like, yes, you can work out the encryption key.  And then when you look at the details, you've got to have physical access to the machine and  collect it up to an oscilloscope and various other things. It's a huge... Well, that's not a real

Start time: 6271.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  threat. This is called port smash. Yeah. That's by the way, another thing. If you're a PhD student  looking to make a good thesis, come up with a good name for that hack. Yeah. But on the other hand,

Start time: 6282.66
End time: 6293.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we say in the office, if it's got a name and it's even got its own branded website as Hartley did,  it's probably, you know, massively oversold. Harkley, Spectre meant that port smash is a

Start time: 6293.48
End time: 6369.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  side channel vulnerability exactly as you're talking about. And it comes from hyperthreading.  So hyperthreading is actually Intel's marketing term for something called simultaneous multi-threading  or SMT architecture. And more than Intel chips use this, but Intel calls it hyperthreading. The  idea that a single chip could do multiple things at once, a threaded chip. And it's the same kind  of problem that Spectre and Meltdown were, which is essentially because you have multiple processes  going. If one process say is a password, but the other process is malicious process two can peek  into process one and perhaps get the password leak encrypted data from a computer's memory or CPU.  But listen to how it works. It works by recording and analyzing discrepancies in operation times,  power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or sound. So essentially, and this is true of Spectre and  Meltdown too, the way they work is that took a little longer than it should have. And from that,  these super brains can figure out what your password is. You know, they're hard to weaponize

Start time: 6369.52
End time: 6392.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  these attacks. You guys clearly know way more about this than I do. So let me stand in for Joe Sixpack  here. Is the issue that I feel like I never used to hear about chip problems. Like is there some  sort of a trend where on the silicon side, they're more vulnerable. Something has happened.

Start time: 6393.86

Transcript:  Rowhammer, which was a way to, you remember Rowhammer? People started to realizing that  if you mess with timing, you can exploit stuff. People stopped looking at buffer overflows or  started, you know, it's, I think it's PhD students trying to get their thesis, trying to get their  doctorate. They figured if you, oh, that's, you know, not interesting to find a buffer.

Start time: 6423.96

Start time: 6471.00
End time: 6521.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  other I think culprit is Google and project zero. They have a really good team of, of  security researchers who they, the ones who came up with row hammer back in 2015.  And they pointed the way row hammer is a problem with some recent Ram devices in which repeatedly  accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. And to do, and then they do that in  such a way they can gain kernel privileges. If you know what you're doing. The problem is these guys,  you know, of course the first thing they do is they go to Intel and say, fix it. Yeah. And then  if Intel doesn't or after Intel does, they'll, they'll release sample code. And at that point,  even a script kiddie sometimes can take advantage of this, but well, I mean, they give them 90 days

Start time: 6522.30

The scare is  the side channel aware engineering security project funded by the European research council  because it has to have a name like that. Scare the goal of the project to find new side channel  vectors and mitigate them. I can't wait till the till, you know, we see the CW series about this.

And they've been some of the attendees have been trying to get the name changed because  they don't really feel comfortable going to a conference called NIPS.  And the organizers said, well, we pulled our people and that's it. We're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  keeping the NIPS. It's not so much the people who feel uncomfortable. It's the people who come in  the door thinking they're going to find something else being disappointed, disappointed Intel's  response, by the way, as of yesterday, Intel received notice of the research, the port smash  smash research. The issue is not reliant on speculative execution. That's what Spectre and  Meltdown did. It's therefore unrelated to Spectre Meltdown or L1 terminal fault.  See, you don't hear a lot about L1 terminal fault. It needs a better name.  We expect it's not unique to Intel platforms. Research on side channel analysis methods often  focuses on manipulating and measuring the characteristics, such as timing of shared  hardware resources. Software or software libraries can be protected against such issues by employees.  I think Intel's response is designed to bore you so much that you just forget the whole thing ever  happened. By employing side channel safe development practices, protecting our  customers data and ensuring the security of our products is a top priority for Intel.  And we will continue to work with customers, partners and researchers to understand and  mitigate any vulnerabilities that are identified. Thank you Intel.  I forgot. What were we talking about? Something.  Good news, passwords. Well, maybe are protected by the Fifth Amendment.  Yeah, this is the Florida case. For now, somewhere. Hey, at least we have a court  that says they're protected. I mean, that decision. So it actually is a reversal by the Florida Circuit  Court of Appeal on a lower court ruling. I don't, the details are long and elaborate of the case,  but essentially it was a case of a fatal car accident. The police wanted the driver's phone.  They got a warrant, fairly broad warrant to search it for data, photos, text messages and more.  They also got an order compelling the driver of the car to hand over the passcode  for the iPhone and an iTunes account associated with it. In court, in the lower court, they said  that's fine. That's okay. You can, you can demand a passcode. You can get it. You can get whatever you  get out of that phone. You can be used to this. And you can do it because we know you know the

Start time: 6772.88

Start time: 6778.14
End time: 6812.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had agreed to compel the disclosure given that quote, the act of producing the passcodes  isn't testimonial. Remember the Fifth Amendment protects you against the,  says you have the right not to testify against yourself. You cannot incriminate yourself.  The lower court said this isn't testimonial. It's not testifying because the existence, custody and  authenticity of the passcodes are a foregone conclusion. We know you know it. So it's not  testimony. We can, police can't ask for your fingerprint. You know, when you get booked,  they fingerprint you. They can pull a hair out of your head without permission. They can take your

End time: 6872.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to drive. Yeah, that would be okay. Or even reasonable expectation. And that's why I love  this ruling. It's, it's an anti-phishing expedition. That's exactly right. The state, according to the,

Start time: 6872.52
End time: 6924.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is the decision, the state did not show with any particularity, knowledge of the evidence within  the phone. The trial court could not find the contents of the phone were already known to the  state and thus within the foregone conclusion exemption. In other words, knowing the passwords,  not enough. You've got to know the state seeks the phone passcode, not because it wants the passcode,  because it wants to know what communications lie beyond the passcode wall. If the defendant were  to reveal this passcode, he'd be engaged in a test and a testimonial act utilizing the contents  of his mind and demonstrating as a factual matter. He knows how to access the phone as such,  the compelled production of the phone passcode or the iTunes password here would be  testimonial and is covered, is protected by the fifth amendment. Can I, can I be really dumb here

Start time: 6957.14
End time: 7004.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this case, the argument is, if the warrant said, I know in that safe is the gun you use to murder  the victim. I can get a warrant and chisel you away that says I can go in that safe. I can compel  you to unlock it. But I, what I cannot do is look through the other contents of the safe. I can look  and see that gun and take it and use that as evidence. So that's the problem with these phones  is you can't just say, well, we want to see what's on your phone. That's not sufficient  because everything's on this phone. And so I lie. I think it's really important that this court  decided that it, that merely knowing that you can unlock the phone is not sufficient. You need to  know what you're looking for in here. You cannot, as you said, might go on a fishing expedition

So this one decision doesn't  protect you in any other state of the union. It might not even protect you in Florida.  It might be influential though. Well, it's a, it's a precedent. And so it's not settled law. It's  not stare decisis, but it is at least a precedent that people can call upon and say, well, look,  here in Florida and this decision. So I think we want, we want to see more cases like this  because I'm of the strong opinion that law enforcement should not be allowed to demand  the contents of your phone.

Transcript:  news from, well, I mean, at this point, anybody who proposes a bill we like, that's good news,  right? The fact that it will never ever see the light of day is meaningless. Ron Wyden has proposed  a bill that could jail executives who mishandle consumer data. I don't think Mark Zuckerberg would  last a day in the big house. The bill suggests creating a penalty of 10 to 20 years in prison  for senior executives who fail to follow new rules around data use. The Consumer Data Protection  Act would give the Federal Trade Commission more authority and resources to police the use of data  by adding 175 new staff. They'd be also allowed to fine companies up to 4% of revenue. Where have we  heard that before? That sounds like something from GDPR. For a first offense, it would create a  centralized do not track list that would be enforceable. This, companies that make more than  $1.5 billion in revenue and handle information to more than a million people would be required to  submit regular reports to the FTC describing any privacy lapses. This is basically Ron Wyden's  version of GDPR. It doesn't stand a chance and hell won't even come to committee. It'll last

I have a post  office box. I have a key. I go there every week and I look at it and say hi to the people.  But the last thing I'm ever, in fact, the last time I was there, there was a woman there who  was using, they have the self-service kiosks. She had 40 or 50 packages and was one by one,  putting it on the scale, pressing the buttons, paying a quarter, taking it off, putting the next  one on there. And there were people coming in and they were looking and they were going,  and they were turning out, you don't need to do that. You should get, this woman of all people  should have stamps.com. Stamps lets you at your desk, buy and print real US postage. It's not a  postage meter. You don't need any special ink. It's just a website, stamps.com, your computer,  your printer, you're done. Anything you can do at the post office, you're done. Buy and print  official US postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail. 24-7 when it's convenient for  you. You don't have to worry about any woman mailing a hundred packages to Peoria. You can  create your stamps.com account in minutes. You don't have to lease any equipment. There's no  long-term commitment. And by the way, if you do this, if you go to stamps.com right now and you  click the microphone on the top of the homepage and you enter twit, you will get a USB scale.  They'll send it to you that automatically calculates the right postage. It'll help you decide the best  class of mail. It saved us a lot of money. Sometimes they'll say, oh, you should mail that  media mail because you could say click print and mail. You're done. It couldn't be easier. You'll  also get up to $55 in free postage and you'll get a four-week trial of stamps.com. And all you have  to do is go to stamps.com, click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner, enter twit. You  should, you owe it to yourself to at least try this. At least try this, especially now as we're  getting close to the holidays and the post office is going to get busy. Business has to get done.  If you use US mail in your business and who doesn't for bills, for brochures, if you're at Amazon or  Etsy, oh my God, a seller rather, you'll love this. It fills out the forms.

Transcript:  Worst corkscrew. Why don't we, we live in wine country, have the crappiest corkscrew ever.  Should I go out and pick this? No, no, that's the one. I use the shoe. At home we have, you know,  much better ones. Remember Elon Musk's Starman, he launched it into space, the roadster with the guy.  It's cherry red. Cherry red. It's not looking so cherry anymore. Thanks to, I don't know what,  space debris. It has now gone past Mars. It is putting it one of the greatest distances away  from the sun. It's the, what do you call that? The Healy, APA Helion. Oops, press the wrong  button there. Perry Helion. It is 1.66 astronomical units or 155 miles, million miles away. It's not  going to rendezvous with Mars, but it's pretty good as the Engadget folks point out for a mannequin.  And it's going to be a long time before the Starman comes back our way. Ben Pearson has  apparently made models that show that the roadster won't be close to the earth until two years  from now, November 4th, 2020, a mere 32 million miles away.  So you're not, we've seen the last of Starman, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in this interview, he said why he sent his car to space. He said every rocket has to be tested  with a payload. And usually they do something really boring, like big block of cement or  something like that. And he said it made him angry that they were being so boring. So he did something  interesting and sent his own car. Right on. Bravo. Yeah.  And he wasn't high. So.

End time: 7773.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sadly, no. They've the Kepler space telescope, which has been looking for exoplanets.  They've lost contact with that? That's run out of gas. It can't  maneuver anymore. But that was normal. They expected that.  They've expected. And they just replaced that. It's been up there nine years.  It's the one point the gyroscopes are so out of whack that they're actually balancing it on  solar radiation. The Dawn spacecraft is around Ceres in the asteroid belt.

Transcript:  Oh, yes. The triple whammy. Kepler's out of action. Dawn spacecraft didn't call back on  schedule on Wednesday. The dawn of the dead?  That's right. Dawn is currently in orbit around Ceres, the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt,  and they think now it can't maneuver and point its antenna back to Earth.  Then Opportunity, it's not looking good. They're going to give it until January,  but 14 years on the surface is a damn good run, but it's looking as though it just can't charge it.  That's the saddest one. That is the sweetest little rover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. We've got a new exoplanet. It's actually already up there. They're just calibrating it  at the moment, but Kepler is just the amount of repair work they've done on that has been  from, we think remote tech support is tough. Tried doing it from a few million miles.  And at one point, as I say, they only had one gyroscope functioning. They were using the pressure  of solar radiation to keep it on target. I mean, NASA engineers are just the bomb.

One of the most interesting things was he said, the single product that I am most  excited about is our forthcoming pickup truck, which he said is like a cyberpunk pickup truck.  He said straight out of Blade Runner.  Yeah. And I thought, okay, that should be cool. It should be nice. He also talked a lot about the  upcoming opening of the tunnel in Los Angeles, and they posted a video.  The Boring Company.  Today or yesterday, the Boring Company.

Tennessee and Wilson, North Carolina, the notorious Wilson, North Carolina, have been  notorious for their use of speech codes in the terms of service of... See, he's using a kind of  loaded term here. State-owned networks. Prohibiting users from transmitting content that falls into  the amorphous categories like hateful or threatening. How dare they?  Yes. It's a...  It's a...  Some red to see speech.  ...when we let people...  This is a new tact, really, in the age-old fight of telecoms to keep cities from doing  municipal Wi-Fi, which is good for the economy, good for the locals. Often is a response to a  duopoly or worse a monopoly by a telecom company, an overpriced, poor provisioned internet.  But it does pose an ominous threat to the First Amendment.

Start time: 8093.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

And in most cases, you'll get the live stream audio on your Echo or your Google Assistant.  I don't know if my craft is smart enough to do that yet, but you know what?  I'm going to get a chatterbox and I'm going to teach it how to do it.  If you're not here live, don't worry. I should mention you can also come in the studio audience.  Greg and Jillian are here from San Jose. It's Greg's birthday on Tuesday. Happy birthday, Greg.  You're wearing a Disneyland 1955 t-shirt. Is that when you were born?
