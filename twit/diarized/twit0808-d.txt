Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you filed a bunch of stories on tech crunch. I know about we're talking of course about the game stop  um meme stock basically, uh the subreddit wall street bets  about uh deep effing value the  investor who took  Like a 50 000 invested and turned it into 31 million dollars  Uh, this has been a wild story  And I think by now probably people have heard enough about the details of this but i'll just do a quick summary  So you understand what we're talking about game stop, which is  One would think you know on the on the base on the face of it  Not the best most valuable stock one could buy  Uh, they are those brick and mortar stores mostly in malls, which are mostly defunct selling  Physical games which no one is buying anymore because it's all gone to digital downloads  Even even our 18 year old who really loved going to game stop it still does  I think he bought the physical copy so he could sell them as used and maybe get more games that way  But even he is recognizing it's downloadable for the future. So for a while game stop  Stock has been going down down down. There was this little thing that happened  An investor who has some street credibility  Uh bought a big stake in it, right? He bought  Uh, I think 10 or 11 percent of the stock got on the board and has been convincing them to go digital  And so maybe you could say  There's something that makes you think this stock maybe has more of a future  They've been through five ceos in the last 12 months  It's not a good picture. However last fall  Uh an investor named deep effing value on the wall street bets subreddit on on reddit  Started pumping the stock up saying that you know what? This is going to be good started to buy it  He bought like I said about fifty thousand dollars  worth  Others did it it became now the new term is a meme stock with people on reddit  People on discord on the wall street bets discord server and other places  Selling it  Up to buy buy the stock buy the stock now because the stock was such a laggard  It was heavily shorted by a lot of the big hedge funds like melvin capital billions of dollars  And as soon as the stock price started going up and boy did it go up to the hundreds of dollars from you know  from 30 bucks  The shorts got squeezed. These were people who took a bet that the stock was going to go down borrowed stock  Sold it  Expecting it go down even more so they could buy it and repay the borrow  The problem is if the stock goes up you're kind of caught with your shorts in them in a bunch because suddenly  Your your interest is going up as the price is going up and suddenly at some point  You have to you have to get out of this position and it ended up costing billions of dollars for a number of hedge funds  Who got very angry?  robin hood which is  Understandably robin hood, which is a very popular app along with weeble and a few others that are designed to get  What they call retail stock buyers people like you and me to buy stock because they don't charge a commission  Was obviously a place to go to buy game spot stock for a lot of these people but then robin hood  And the stock market as a whole halted trading which was seen by the little guys as protecting the big guys  From the little guys onslaught and then at some point robin hood said you can only buy one share at a time  There were good reasons for that which we could go into but I think what's interesting about all of this this ferment  And there are other stocks that are  Also seeing some of this amc the movie theater chain also suffering  But they that became a meme stock  And nokia became a meme stock. So there's a number of these meme stocks  Um, let me start with you alex is meme stock  It's a little bit of a put down like these people aren't real investors. This is just a meme  Is that a fair characterization?

Start time: 657.66
End time: 676.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's as pejorative as we might think on the surface. I think it's almost one of those  Negative things you kind of take on as a joke that you uh, then begin to enjoy yourself  So meme stock to me just describes the group of stocks that are trading  Not based on fundamentals or long-term value but based on kind of current market sentiment amongst the retail crowd

Start time: 677.04
End time: 686.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So and by the way, the sentiment may not be driven either by market fundamentals  It may be driven and it seems to be somewhat driven by let's screw the hedge funds, right?

Start time: 686.84
End time: 731.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of annoyance  Amongst retail traders about their position in the market  If you have a lot of money you have access to better information better tools  And faster trades if you're a retail investor like, you know us here you kind of regular folks  You don't and so it feels like the market is a little bit set up against you and it is  And so what you're seeing here is a combination of greed  Social interest kind of people banning together on the internet to bring something together  And also annoyance with the way things are set up  and I think a lot of people are still pretty peeved about uh, 2008 2009 and how things kind of worked out there and how  People didn't go to jail and how uh, we the taxpayers spend a lot of money to keep these big banks alive  And so when these social traders on reddit and other places notice that gamestop is shorted more than 100

Start time: 734.78
End time: 742.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I don't even know how that can happen by the way, that's a failure of regulation  But the hedge funds have bought more gamestop stock than exists

Start time: 743.04
End time: 748.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sold it short and so people knew that if they took advantage of this they could never make it good, right?

Start time: 749.18
End time: 753.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's not enough stock to buy  How did they know the most interesting things?

Start time: 754.16
End time: 762.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did they know that it had been shorted 140? Somebody must really someone sophisticated  Must have looked at that and figured it out

Start time: 763.26
End time: 778.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, so so philip the short interest is periodically available  Before this show I was googling around a little bit and you can find data on that and with more sophisticated tool in like a  Bloomberg terminal you can definitely find out but what's really interesting and you raise a good point

Start time: 778.14
End time: 784.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, that's somewhat some people characterize. This is four chan with a bloomberg terminal  Which is exactly what it is

Start time: 785.86
End time: 788.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is exactly wait a minute now. I gotta point out

Start time: 789.34
End time: 821.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and by the way elizabeth warren aoc and others in congress have called for an investigation the ssec which moves like molasses  Woke up late last week and went. Oh, wait a minute  I gotta point out it is not obvious, you know this this is the superficial description of this  but it's completely possible that it wasn't just retail traders that maybe  Other hedge funds  were intentionally short squeezing their competition  We don't know exactly right. Well, I think really going on here. Do we

Start time: 822.36
End time: 832.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think that what happened, you know when the the squeeze started and when you did have people like uh,  Like roaring kitty and and some of the other big wall street. We're kidding is deep a deep effing

Start time: 833.52
End time: 838.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Value. Yeah, it's his youtube band. Yeah, we'll call him more and kidding kitty from now on that's probably right

Start time: 839.10
End time: 997.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so so when you have this guy who's you know turned a fifty thousand dollar investment into 31 million or whatever and and he's  An actual I mean he's incredibly clever and incredibly smart when you have people like him who made those moves  I do think that those were people who saw a  You know a glitch a hole in the system and were able to take advantage and then we're able to propel this into other things  The thing is though is that once the stock started rising and once everybody started kind of staring at it like slack  Shot what's happening and it went up and up and up  obviously, you're going to have  like non retail and  Investors who are interested in it too, right?  Like so I think that it becomes at that point, you know people who are doing high frequency trading and who are trading based on  You know having you know watch lists and algorithms and are doing all the all the ways that you know  Most professionals trade now, which is not the way that retailers retail investors  Trade we're obviously going to be getting in on it and and I wouldn't be surprised if  And this is usually not uncommon where some of the hedge funds will have a position  To backstop against like their short position failing, right?  So I don't think we know exactly what it is  I'd be very curious to hear alex's thoughts my thoughts just based on what we know now and so much of it  We're still figuring out as he said the news cycle has moved so quick  But my gut tells me that while most of the interest has been led by retail  Investors once things shifted past a certain point  Then you did start to see traditional investors whether they be hedge funds or or you know  Just uh, you know high frequency traders or or whatever starting to get in on the action too, which is only going to  Continue to to keep this frothy. Uh, and I mean I look I I expected the crash to have already happened  I was very clearly wrong on that  But I think this is one of those things where we're all expecting the inevitable crash  We don't know when the bottom is going to drop but  the the  Completely nutso thing about this is that we don't know how how high this is going to go until things  Presumably regulate themselves assuming they do and maybe this is one of those weird things where it won't  I think the gamestop as a company is in such a poor position  I don't see how it can continue to you know, stay at these at these levels, but  Yeah, to your point. I don't think it's it's  Definitely, I think that it started and was largely led by retail investors  But if people are making money in this like the game is rigged  It is I mean, I think anybody who's followed anything and has anything to do with finance understands and like accepts that  You can't expect the billionaires to be sitting on the sidelines and seeing  Regular people making money and not wanting to to get in on some of the play too. I mean, it's just bizarre

Start time: 999.16
End time: 1118.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roaring kitty and this is what you do on wall street bets you post  Pictures of your you know losses and your gains and so forth took to fit his he posted and nobody can verify this but  He claims he invested 53 000 and at some point it reached 48  Million dollars whether he sold I don't think because I think he's saying hold  Which I think alex is nuts because isn't this bubble gonna pop at some point? Here's a picture of a kid 10 year old  Jaden car his mom gave him 10 shares in gamestop  Uh in 2019 is a kwanzaa present  He's happy  She wanted to teach him about investing but what lesson did jaden learn  really  About investing that's one of the concerns I have I see people like my own son  naive  Investors who say oh, you know, i'm gonna get me that robin hood and i'm gonna put some money in here because this is a  Great opportunity but but  What do you think alex is the bubble about to burst is it  What I guess it's not because more and more people are coming along saying I gotta get in on this right  Even though now you're buying game stock game spot stock at like 300 bucks. I don't know what the current price is, but  325 so yeah  That's crazy. If this is the this is the year to date graph  It was it was it was yeah, january 5th it was 17  It is now  325 dollars  And there was a sell-off  on thursday  Well, i'm sure there's some uh market, you know  market off market share trading going on right now  It's insane  It's insane. So are people gonna but don't you think people are gonna get hurt by this alex or no?  Yeah, they are gonna get hurt by it. I mean, we know the hedge funds got hurt melvin capital had to go borrow money from stephen cohen

Transcript:  To the tune of several billion dollars. So the billionaires bailed out the billionaires  We didn't do it, which is super important to note  No one knows how long this can stay up because no one thought this was going to happen  And when you discuss people posting their trades on wall street bets and other forums what they're doing is sharing with a large crowd  And it's not like the old days where you had to go on cnbc to talk about your positions to get people to pay attention  Now you can kind of rally an army of individual traders who have access to things like options and more exotic investments than they  Didn't used to have and so now you can really marshal a lot of buying power behind you people are buying billboards and ads  To encourage more people to buy and hold games stop game game. Look at this stock. Yeah

Start time: 1161.92
End time: 1282.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, uh  Deep effing value posted hold hold hold hold hold hold hold  Uh, of course, he wants you to hold in fact, he wants you to buy more  Because his value is going to go up you have to at some point you have to start wondering about these people's motivations  uh  And and maybe not buy into this  It's it's it's crazy  Uh, and I don't think we fully know what's going on. Here's but there's a large to me. There's a larger  Thing at play here  that actually ties into  The events of the last few years  um  This is essentially mob action, right?  Have you ever has anybody ever I was in a mob when I was a kid  I was protesting against the vietnam war with a big group of people  Uh, we did things that I would never have done by myself  You know, we blocked the freeway. We rocked police cars stupid things  That I would never have done when you get in a mob you lose your mind  And you start acting as a single brain in a mob  And we've seen this before we saw it january 6th of in a way to me what's happening in the stock market?  With gamestop is similar to what happened in the insurrection in the capital is similar  What happened? I guess you could say the arab spring and again and again what I think we're seeing is  how social media  These messaging platforms like telegram and discord whatsapp  empower  The formation of mobs when I was a kid you you only became a mob because everybody said let's go down and protest  The war in vietnam on you know a certain day we all went and that mob never got much bigger because there wasn't this mass medium  But social media has in my mind weaponized the mob  And while this seems benign to me, I you know, this is great. I'm glad some hedge funds suffered they should  But it that's today tomorrow. It could be less benign

Start time: 1283.24
End time: 1293.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the comparison to the january 6th is a little bit tenuous because that was a rally that the leader of  America had called people to show up to so it was much more centralized than this sort of

Start time: 1293.78
End time: 1317.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reddit discord type thing i'm not making deep effing value equivalent to president trump, but that's the point  But i'm saying that had president trump not had twitter  And facebook had the had the organizers not had these social media platforms to me  It looks like these social media platforms are ripe for this kind of thing  And this is what we're going to see and I think we're going to see it a lot more often

Start time: 1318.54
End time: 1369.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to add to that point  There's currently a new meme amongst the same trading groups to squeeze the price of silver  And I have not looked into this because all my money is in boring index funds because of journalism rules  uh, but um, you know, this is not going to stop people have now found a lever and they're going to keep trying to move  The world as long as they can and you know, we saw a lot of issues with robin hood disability to stay up and so forth  But they'll figure that out. They'll get that sorted out and then once those pathways are open  there's not going to be the same kind of like um  Slows to the system and so I don't know where this goes  But uh as a person who cares about the financial markets in general  I'm going to be fascinated to see what the next couple years look like  If we do actually see the revenge of retail traders against the professional money  It will be an inversion of trends that have been going on for for decades, you know, and um  People are going to get hurt leo, but it's going to be really fun to watch the financial carnage, uh, either way

Start time: 1370.26
End time: 1428.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know if it's gonna be fun. I think when regular people lose i'm sorry  i'm like very deeply concerned with that and and i've been a little bit of a debbie downer on on twitter and on like  the podcast I do rocket about this because I have like  I will be totally honest. I was wrong and that this is continued to go up far longer than I expected  But the bottom is going to fall from this like i'm not saying that gme is a ponzi scheme because it's not but it has a lot  of the same  um like  Qualities that a ponzi scheme has and fundamentally this is not a healthy company. This is not a good company  This is a company who most of their their you know  Money is is caught up in real estate in in strip malls and in dying areas who has a business model with tremendous amounts  Of problem who has no e-commerce  Um to speak of I mean to have an e-commerce system  But anybody who's bought from them knows how bad their logistics are like they can't compete with best buy or amazon  This isn't based on fundamentals at all. No, no right exactly what i'm saying is is the fundamentals of this company are poor

Start time: 1428.86
End time: 1443.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why it's a meme stock. It has nothing right and by the way  Clarify this for me  Does game stop get any benefit out of this at all? This is no no, no, no, no  That's the other thing. This is bad for them philip says how is it bad for them? Yeah

Start time: 1444.42
End time: 1481.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because because they can't you know, there's this  Thousands of people who work for this company and at some point  uh  The stock is going to revert to the vent to the you know, basically what the stock is what the company is worth  And they're not going to be able to sell their stock or take advantage of it. I talked to a  Sales a guy who used to be a sell side analyst  And he says that first of all, you can be sure that goldman sachs had its blood  Uh sucking thing in the middle of this  When when when there's a lot of money involved the big guys glomp on and they short or long or whatever

Start time: 1481.72

Transcript:  And they can act faster than anybody using robin their trades are going to going to be executed way faster

Start time: 1487.84
End time: 1514.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, now he says this guy says that it's clear that this is going to get regulated  And the question is do you are these guys who have taken advantage of the social network?  Which gives them enormous power to do something that that wall street traders  Are not supposed to do they're not supposed to act as a group. They're supposed to act individually  They you know that gets bent. Is it illegal to act in concert? Yes. Yes. Yeah, it is illegal

Start time: 1514.44
End time: 1537.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, but but the legality doesn't I mean the idea of it being from a subreddit  I bet that's good luck  Well, yes and no, but they did buy billboards look at this look at this  They're billboards all over the country that say, you know, there's there's  There's the guy what's his name? Hello kitty. We like the stock gme to the moon  These are all over the country. They bought billboards

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, the thing is is that there have been cases where the scc has gone after news groups  Like the yahoo groups used to be popular during the dot-com crash and they've gone after  Um, you know newsletters and other sorts of forums for market manipulation before it's hard to prove intent  It's hard to prove other things. I will say as somebody who's lurked in the wall street vets forums for like the subreddit  I've known about it for years. I haven't ever like posted but i've known about it  Starting last week when I guess like actually, you know, it gets thursday or friday of a week before last, you know  So 10 days ago  You started to see some stuff that to me seemed like pretty clear market manipulation  Stuff that seemed to go against the law. How do you prove that? How do you go after those individuals?  I don't know if you can  but certainly  Yeah, there's some stuff in here that that does strike me is very different from people going on cnbc  And talking about their stock and it might be a semantical difference and it might be something where people say oh

Transcript:  Well, I was gonna say usually they but see jim kramer, you know, he's been in trouble for things  But he usually is very precise in his language. There have been things that i've seen. He knows what he's doing  Exactly because he's been he's been sanctioned for it  But there have been people who will promise this is going to this price.

They're willing to let them go off  And i'm sure that the terms of that loan were very advantageous for citadel, right?  nobody's going to be like  Fundamentally trying to change the market because melvin capital or some of these other hedges lost money  It turned into this other thing and I do agree with you that it is like the little guy trying to fight back  I think what what concerns me and I don't want to be a downer is that a as I said  The the house does always win the billionaires are going to band together and people who have bought into this specific stock  Maybe there's some other ones that are truly undervalued and you can do a different sort of short squeeze and you can make a better  Case for it, but people who are buying and like if you bought in like right now at 3.25  If you're able to even execute your your sell orders, which if you're a retail investor you go last you are not  So so you don't even know what you're going to be able to sell at  Like a lot of people are going to be left holding the bag like if you got in really low  That's awesome.

Transcript:  i'm worried though, um because  What they've done here is  Taking advantage of a social network and and use it in the stock market that hasn't been done before  And it's enormously powerful now scott golloway had a good take on it the nyu professor who said  You know, he admired this this was this was very clever  But and they're and he said they're not really doing anything  That the short sellers weren't doing and if if they're going to regulate these guys, they're going to have to regulate  Uh wall street too. They're not going to they can't let the short sellers keep doing what they were doing  Buying 140 percent of a stock borrowing 140 percent of a stock. That's not that's not right  And in fact, you know  Because I follow the apple crowd  They were very upset because we had these blowout earnings and then the stock went down and the reason the stock went down  It was it was an effect of the game stock thing because all the short sellers  They have to cover their shorts  They use apple and the other big stocks that they made a lot of money as atm machines  They bar they sell their they sell their winners to pay for these shorts  So the whole that's the reason the whole market went down  There could be when this thing went up this this could  Really cause a cataclysm in the markets. I tell you i've been reading. Um, I just finished the big short  Michael lewis's, uh wonderful idea incredible and I was getting the same vibe. It felt like credit default swaps  All over again. There's something really big happening. It's not being regulated properly  It it's out of control  And um, I just I fear we're there's something bad coming down the pike and I don't know what it is the big

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and and there have been because of what happened there  There were some regulation changes around naked short selling but I mean look I I agree  I think that the fact that you can short more than is available has been a big red flag  And if this is what it takes to close those sorts of loopholes  I think it's all about it. You know, i'm not against  Um, like but don't you think what'll happen is that the regulation?

I mean it might fundamentally change some of those things  I would say this though and i'd be curious what would alex and philip think of this  I don't think that after all this shakes out and who knows how long it'll last  I don't know if this is the sort of thing that will be repeatable again  I do feel like there's going to be either regulation from the sec or more to the point  There are going to be rules that the market makers and that the brokerage firms take into account that will prevent  This exact set of circumstances from ever occurring again not to say that there won't be bigger maybe regulatory changes  But I feel like this is one of how do you stop it?

Transcript:  One thing that we should talk about a little bit is what robinhood did to the world of trading  Uh, because if you go back to the old days to the 80s  You would I think actually call your broker up and ask them to make a trade for you  And then we had discount brokers in the 90s  They let you trade for seven eight ten bucks per trade which at the time felt revolutionary because it was so much cheaper so much faster  The everyday person could trade robinhood came along and said well now you can trade for free and  Will give you access to options which lets you make uh more highly  It's so easy on robinhood to yeah risk everything by by essentially

Start time: 2019.76
End time: 2046.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Playing on margin, right?  so uh  I've always been kind of against robinhood because I think robinhood takes advantage of investors who don't understand  That in effect, you know robinhood's not the market maker they go to a market maker exactly and the market maker and robinhood make money  Not on commission, but in a kind of more devious way on the spread  So you're not getting the best price for a stock  um, right so i've always felt like robinhood kind of

Start time: 2048.40
End time: 2068.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and it gamifies things  Yeah, and it gamifies things. I think in a really bad way  I mean, I think you can argue and I would argue that zero dollar zero fee trades are not a good thing  I think that it it lowers the risk to a point where or lowers the it's too easy  The barrier to entry where people are doing stuff that they shouldn't be doing but alex am I am I not?

Start time: 2079.11
End time: 2094.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, no  So what uh what we're talking about is payment for order flow  And uh, the way robinhood manages to offer you trades for zero dollars for no commission is that they then route those trades in different  market makers who pay them for the the volume because they want to see all these trades because

Transcript:  Alex if you yeah, and if you want to understand this better, there's another michael lewis book called flash boys  Which I recommend everyone who wants to read into this it's great  But now for the average person if you're going to go on robinhood and buy three shares of apple two shares of ibm and one share  Of microsoft just make christina happy  Uh, then you're totally fine because you're going to hold on to those for the next five years and whatever if you lost a penny  On one side of the trade at the other it doesn't matter  But robinhood doesn't make a lot of money on payment for order flow from trading well-known stocks  They make a little bit more money on trading less well-known stocks  And they make a lot of money on people trading options  Those are the things that get the most payment per trade in order flow  So robinhood's torn between two things one offering people things that make them lots of money aka options  And keeping their users protected from their own worst interests, which is kind of what options let you do is make a lot of very large mistakes  Uh, the difference between now and a year ago when we're all watching wall street batsman  Who's just nerds losing money is that it seems to be much more widespread?  Uh, my friends are talking to me about this people are people I don't even know are sending me dms asking for advice about how  To trade amc stock. I mean my gosh that that does scare me  So there's a question of access there's a question of price  There's a question of who has who gets to do this and then also the popularity of it  Which seems to be the new factor to me and you know philip and leo talking about regulation  Maybe but I don't know how you manage to put the cork back in the bottle of people wanting to do this when it's free

It's with this mob these these these flash mobs that can be created  So quickly so powerfully  By the new social media makes me very concerned today. It's the stock market  Tomorrow  It could be you or me. It could be let's all take down  Exile I mean it could be anything right then it's very powerful  And and i'll tell you once you see people making all this money whether they will make it or not because  You know who knows how deep effing value gets out of his position  But if they make a lot of money then everybody goes wow and let's do that again  All you have to do is look at bitcoin to see how this mentality  Propagates self propagates, right?

So he felt happy to thousand that's the other problem  There's a couple of problems you got to be able to sell you got to know when to sell you got to be able  To do it and finally don't forget you're going to be paying taxes on this  Come next april  So this is something else that I bet you some of these people have forgotten  I feel like there's a lot of naivete as well, right because anybody can do this

You're probably late to the trade by the time we hear about it. Even we're probably too late  You know, but most people don't listen to that people are very greedy  And so people are going to make mistakes and christina's concerns of people losing their money is very real  You know, it's all people making choices. So it's hard to be too mad about it  But um, you know, don't put your rent money into options on robin hood, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, definitely not. Uh, this has been an enormous branding opportunity for robin hood  So even though they've lost brand equity with their current user base  They shot to like the absolute top of the app store  I mean, where does robin hood want to be at the top of the app store?  Right, so I think they're going to be okay  They have a lot of work to do to figure out their financials and we didn't get into the  The money they just raised and why and all that and it's a little bit technical  But they seem to have access to capital they've never had a bigger brand and the market seems to be moving in their direction

Start time: 2431.62
End time: 2459.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so it's the reason by the way, they would they said you can only buy one share is because there is a  the law requiring them to back  Cover those purchases so they need a certain amount of reserves. That's why they had to raise money to cover those purchases  Uh, they it wasn't that they were trying to protect wall street or the hedge funds  They literally they just couldn't buy as much stock as people wanted to buy because they didn't have the resources to do it

Start time: 2459.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're not adequately capitalized right in this right frankly, right?  the and basically the you know, the  Market, what's it called?

There's nothing to tie it to it's just whatever people pay but isn't kind of the stock market that way  Anyway, we assume some sort of rationality  But uh, except for dividends the value of the stock is really just tied to what people will pay you for it, right?

He's loose  I you know, you can start to figure out what every person's strategy  But somebody like me comes and sits down at the table who has no idea what he's doing  Is is actually scary because i'm unpredictable  I could be I could I could bet up a hand I could if I have enough chips i'm scary  And I think that's kind of what's going on right now is the professionals who say no, no, no  We got to you got to look at market fundamentals.

Well, I mean she took a plea for the teeniest weeniest insider trading  It's for the dumbest thing ever but she took a plea and she didn't want to hurt her business. She honestly she's like  She's hardcore, but I have no idea. I I really thought that this would have dropped off already  So i'm not even going to make any predictions. I'm i'm with philip and alex like this is just so unpredictable  Um, it could fall it could continue to rise it could fall apart monday morning. I think it'll be really interesting  I think I will only push think i'll push back on I do think there's a slight difference between some of this and like  A cryptocurrency at this point. I do feel like fairly or unfairly  bitcoin has  Proven some sort of value whether it's the value that it currently has amassed or not  I I don't know but there has been people who are willing to give it some sort of inherent level of value  Whereas I look at something like gamestop and it really does seem to be  Fueled by the mob who were wanting to stick it to the man the man who's trying to make money on the edges and then just the  Cultural, you know insanity of the moment where even people who don't have any sort of you know persuasion one way or another  Are not wanting to be left out, you know the the the yolo factor.

I also think like warren kitty  Actual like this is clever genius, right? And I have I I don't begrudge him in the slightest. I am a little bit  Uncomfortable with some of the other you know people that i've seen who are making promises and are  Trying to get the mob to to either force people into positions or keep them from making  Decisions that could be in their best interest, but I mean alex points out people have  You know can make their personal choices  It will be interesting I think to see what happens with robin hood. Um, I I agree with alex and so far as I think that  You know, this has been a great branding exercise for them  I also wonder what this does  In terms of like their long term like if this will be some sort of black mark for some of their users  And and I just don't know I i'm not a fan of robin hood. I I was  Uh pretty against them when they did the whole fake checking account scandal that that was one of those things where to me  I was like, this is a scummy place  I don't like how easy they make it to work with options  But I also won't  I can't deny that they've had a fundamental impact on how people are making trades that is  More than likely going to outlast all of this and and potentially be something that we see impacts from years into the future

No, no, I don't get anything out of this  Maybe the executive's the worst part if the executives had some stock and they sold it they might have made some money  Maybe some I don't know if employees had stock but it's not like  Next year game stop is suddenly going to be every shop is going to be lined with gold or anything  It's not going to make any difference to them at all

Yeah, they were able to borrow money  They erased like half a billion dollars in debt, which was good  And and then there were some blackberry executives who did sell they more than likely had, you know, um orders set  You know to sell when it hit a certain price as some of those executives  Were able to make trades game stock though. It's kind of it's kind of sad. It's like there's nothing they can do  Yeah, there's there's nothing they can do and um, you know  They're the hedge fund that owned it that this predated all of this  There was a south korean hedge fund that owned like five percent  Of game stock and they sold their whole position  So, you know, there has been some movement in that. Um, I don't know  But that is kind of to me that's sort of the sad part is that you have this failing company who has a lot of  Fundamental problems who has a lot of debt  And who their stock is now high-flying and it doesn't seem like they're gonna have any way to benefit from this

Transcript:  Don't mess with aoc on twitter  Uh  So actually jessica lessen and the information it's you know, it's behind a paywall  So probably i'm the only one who read it, but it says the nightmare awaiting the news industry. She talks about this  She says as journalists we should start being worried because you know what's happening and trump certainly was brilliant at this  politicians are going straight  to  the people  No, intermediation  They're going straight to the people and they're talking about what they want to talk about true or false  No one's there to you know to to to  Intermediate to say oh wait a minute. That's not true. Nothing  Which could be good or bad?  Um, she says most people are going to get information directly from the source  With no chance for journalists or even non-journalists to push back and question them. The result is propaganda  not news  It's everywhere. She also says i'm worried about how readers and now this is  Some might say old media, although jessica lessen is not exactly old media. She's old media like alex williams old media, but  ouch  Or i'm old media. I qualify  um  But but this is interesting. I think is more than that. She says i'm worried about how readers and listeners are going to decide  Who to get their information from I fear they're going to be wooed by personality  Influenced by their own belief system. This is me again  Being a little chicken little saying, you know  These are larger trends that worry me a little bit on the other hand  I I think it's kind of interesting the president was able to talk directly for four years  Directly to his constituency. It proved an incredibly valuable tool for him  Now aoc is starting to use twitch to talk directly to not just her new york constituency  But to a national audience  And if somebody has national aspirations, i'm sure she does this is extremely powerful  And it it kind of says out of the way and I think we're moving to the news organization  I think we're moving in that direction. I think people are getting more and more disgruntled  With mainstream media, aren't they? Is it something to be concerned about philip?

Everybody's going to get a voice  The free flow of information this is all going to be very positive and that's kind of what we're seeing  But it isn't always positive  I don't want to go back to the gatekeepers.

Transcript:  I agree with that entirely now the optimistic thing that I want to bring up though is that think about the internet has brought us  We are currently mostly at home leo. I know you're in the studio. I'm very jealous. You could delete the house  But the internet has brought us together during this time that would have been. Oh, I agree fantastically dull. Oh, imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Much worse than we're currently seeing and also the internet has allowed for a a wave of creativity in music and film and short video  And poetry and even things like fanfic and so there's been a brilliant  Amount of creative freedom that I think we take for granted when we discuss the negative things the internet has brought to us in terms  Of mass communication and so forth  But here's the the the flip that I want to throw in and i'll shut up  But like we talk a lot about going gatekeeper free and inside the technology media where I live  There's a lot of discussions about venture capitalists going directly to their quote audience and bypassing the journalistic  You know media  Entirely and people ask me about this and the short answer is it's a very small minority  Of people that have the pull to be able to go around the gatekeepers and generate their own footprint  It's aoc in congress. It's in recent Horowitz in the venture capital community. It's elon musk in the car community, etc  It's a very small number of people so it's still the big voices

End time: 3772.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but to get there it's rare right like it's not a guaranteed thing  I think it's like anything else is that is it that you have the few who get lucky or who are able to  You know capture the attention and kind of jump on that that rocket ship and I mean that's to be true to be fair  That's true with like traditional kind of media places too, right? There are plenty of people who want to be that, you know, uh, you know  Voice of record and aren't right?  And so  A lot of it just I think that you had the ability to maybe have that happen  But the chances of it happening are still extremely small

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And well, it's not a media company in the way that you and I think about it leo what they're doing is building a very large  Kind of like paid publication for themselves.

You know what the internet is just like life. It's made of people  People can be horrifically awful.

Transcript:  Okay, conspiracy theories are nothing new. No. No, here's what's different about facebook is that facebook?  with the  with the death of the you know, like  Of the chronological feed and the moving into algorithms that recommend you similar content and in the reinforcement loop of showing you the same  Types of things over and over again. That's I think the difference and that's the thing I think that  You know, we should be critical of big tech for it's not so much the the fact that the platform  Or the mediums have been used to spread messages that have existed since the dawn of time  it's the fact that they have started to  Reinforce those messages by changing the way the algorithm works to double down on engagement because that's what their investors or other people  Wanted to see from them as opposed to anything else and that has had I think some pretty catastrophic  Circumstances, I mean and it's not just q anon  I mean even you look at like the the actual genocide and the things that happened in miyanmar which basebook aided with right and again  It comes down to the algorithm and reinforcing and showing more and more that information  You can see it with what was happening on what's happened in india and and that sort of thing and that I think is the the  Thing that is that is dangerous not so much that  Facebook exists and that you have this platform  it's when you have these platforms which on the one hand claim to not have a finger on  Like the scale but on the other hand they absolutely do by optimizing for engagement and reinforcing  You know whatever your persuasion is one way or another and that's something we haven't seen  To this degree that we didn't have even with cable news, right? It's like you didn't have  Uh an always changing, you know  Cable news diet where as you're watching it you didn't you had to change channels if you wanted to see a different perspective  It wasn't as if you can keep it on one channel and it'll continue to show you the same things over and over again  You know bringing you into different types of content and different types of feeds that you might not have  Been exposed to or been drawn to otherwise. Yeah, can I ask a question about that?

Start time: 4155.37
End time: 4192.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean that's one one fix would be  To say turn off the algorithms. I mean, I think if you look at youtube and facebook  The problem they get the trouble they get into a lot of it seems to me  To come from the fact that they're optimizing for engagement that the algorithm is optimizing for engagement if you turned off the algorithm  Facebook would be what we were told it was which is our friends and family  And the things they post  And that's what you would kind of want facebook to be it's not that because of the algorithm youtube's recommendation engine, right?  Is reprehensible I think in a lot of cases so I mean i'll say this

Transcript:  I would be much more comfortable if that were the direction that the government went in then the attempts to  Either breaking them up or to me the bigger concern is is trying to repeal section 230 repealing section 230 is is to me  Bad for everyone and and that seems to be the direction people want to go in saying  Oh, well, this is how we stop this information. I don't think it is  I think it's it's dangerous on lots of levels  So if there were going to be government intervention and i'm always kind of wary of it because I I don't think that our politicians understand tech  Well enough at all. Um  I I would be much more open to them having to change or shut down the algorithms rather than  Repealing 230 and then you know forcing  A much heavier hand in what can be what sort of subcontent can be posted because i'm not a post  I'm not opposed to the content existing. I'm opposed to the content being shown to you reinforced over and over again exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I there there have been some and I think this is really interesting  In fact twitter is moving along this line who suggested that what government should do is open say open your apis  Uh twitter's looking at the idea of federating I this would solve the twitter problem in my opinion  uh  By which I mean other people could run twitters and you could follow you could be on somebody's twitter  And follow other people on other people's twitter. This is kind of what mastodon is  Uh, if twitter opened up their api and allowed federation if facebook opened up their api and there could be many facebooks  I think that by itself  Would fix the problem, but to mandate that would be  For the government's point of view really putting your fingers in the gears. I mean you'd essentially devalue those  multi-billion dollar companies

Transcript:  Tremendous more than that leo you would kill tik tok. Um, so yesterday  I have a friend who's on tik tok and she makes tik toks and i'm a fan of hers  I love on occasion just to watch her stuff  And I was showing my spouse this and I pulled out my phone and I just clicked on tik tok  And she'd never seen it before and if you don't know tik tok just starts playing videos for you  Like you open it up and it starts all algorithmic. Yep, right and she was like wait, did we pick that?  I'm like no, it's just the way it works. Tik tok is an algorithm that people have plugged content into  And so if you take away the algorithm tik tok becomes I don't know what bad youtube like it doesn't work  Yeah, and so when we talk about the thing  It's hard to think about the more modern platforms being the algorithm because facebook used to be time series like twitter used to be  And uh modern stuff isn't like that. So I don't know what the internet the app economy looks like stands an algorithm  But at a minimum  Telling people how these algorithms work seems like a reasonable step  Open up an api. So you can have the algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what I don't have a problem with making tik tok less compelling or youtube yet less compelling  If the way they are being compelling is by this kind of algorithmic  Escalation, I don't have a problem with that  I mean if you know, whoever controls the algorithm has huge power  And if you're worried about tik tok as the government used to be I don't know what the current status of tik tok is  But if you're worried about the chinese government using tik tok to propagandize the uts of america  Uh, the way they would do it is through the algorithm, right?  so, uh, you know

I love all three of you somebody in the chat  I'm saying this is a great panel for twit and I agree  I agree  Really truth is I don't do these shows for you. Ladies and gentlemen. I do them for me  I just like to get together with some really interesting people and talk about stuff. I'm just glad you like to listen and I appreciate it  Uh, we're also glad we have some great sponsors like this company. I want to give them a huge  Plug do you know?  that  The average amount of time it takes for a company  To realize that there has been a data breach that there are bad guys in the network. The average  Is a hundred ninety one days. That's six months  Surely, there's a better way. There is the thinkst  Canary, it's a honeypot that's easy to install  easy to set up  and a remarkable tool because  It it doesn't look like some little vulnerable thing on your network. It looks like it's real a valuable  router or switch or nas server or windows server or linux box  It is awesome mine. We have one in the studio that's set up as a uh, synology nas and it has a mac address  That's a synology mac address. It has the synology login page. It looks completely real  but the minute a bad guy tries to log in or opens a file  Or browses the active directory and explores file shares boom. I get an alert  An alert that I can act upon right away and I get the alert the way I want it  No false alarms. You get alerts by email or text message. There's a canary console  You can set it up with slack. It supports web hooks, which means you can set it up with practically anything  There's a syslog. I mean you can have it right to your syslog. There's even an api  So you get to get those alerts the way you want it, but this is the this is the point no never again  Will a bad guy roam your network without your knowledge?  This is so key. There are canaries on all seven continents. That'll tell you something right there including antarctica  They're all over the world  These guys behind the canary have been doing security for a couple of decades  They've trained companies and militaries and governments on how to break into networks  So they're really experts on this stuff and so they built something  That's that's just going to be so juicy for that bad guy  You could put fake files on them  You can enroll them in active directory when you have a canary you can even generate canary tokens  Actually, you could do it for free from their website, but I use it. I use the canary to do this tiny trip wires  They can look like pdfs or word documents. I have some excel spreadsheets that say things like employee payroll information spread around  The minute somebody opens them boom. I get that alert  They're all designed to be trivial to deploy  With a ridiculously high quality of signal. It's exactly what you want  Canary  Right now I want you to go to canary.tools  Twit canary.tools  You're going to get a special deal. I'll give you an example  You know some companies have thousands some companies have a dozen some companies like ours have one  It's at least that's all i'm admitting to  Here's let's say you wanted five  That's a reasonable start seventy five hundred bucks a year. You get your own hosted console. You get upgrades automatically you get support  Maintenance anything goes wrong with your canary if you sit on it  It's just a little box about the size of your smartphone. You sit on it. You break it  They just send you another one  If you use the code twit in the head you hear about us bucks 10 off that price forever  forever  And we know you're going to love your canary  Although I have to say the best thing about the canary is  When it doesn't say anything at all because it means you're okay  If you're not happy though, you can return your canaries. They have a two month money back guarantee. So for a full refund  That is a really great deal  two months  canary refund  If for any reason you're not thrilled with it, this is such an important security device  Every company should have some banks have hundreds canary dot tools slash twit  Enter the code twit and how did you hear about us bucks for that? Very nice 10 off forever  forever  I love them canary dot tools slash twit very important part of your layered security  in your enterprise  Speaking of stocks apple stock went through the roof when everybody  Bought on the rumor and then the news came out and went they plummeted a little bit, right?

Right because you have the same amount of earnings with fewer shares so earnings per share go up  Also keep in mind that companies often competent their employees with stock stock  So there's a kind of a standard a standard increase in the number of shares that are in the market  So you use some cash to mitigate that even reduce the number of shares out there  Normally, this is not that big of an impact.

I mean wearables obviously I think the watch  Massive success when they pivoted that from being about fashion to being about fitness  And health was was huge.

They've been a long time  iPad sales were up best. They've been practically since the ipad came out since 2012. Anyway, uh  iphone sales through the roof they are every one of their products services  Just doing really really well  Uh, that's that bodes pretty well for a company  Um, yeah, most of their money is still from iphone, but it used to be like three quarters. It's down to 59 percent. I'm looking at  jason snell's uh  He does those  Color charts. Yeah, I love them  To your point christina wearables is now 12 percent  And of course the rumor is we're going to talk about this in a second  That apple is about to release augmented reality glasses another another category of wearable. So it'll be watch  AirPods and now glasses  That could end up  Meaning that wearables become as important as iphone  I'm thrilled that the mac is doing well because their new chips  I think they're going to eat the world. I think that their new chips are so good  That they've got everybody else in retreat

It's gonna it's gonna by definition  Count count out a certain sector of the populace  Although I do think this is where airpods have been and the apple watch for that matter too been fairly brilliant  Is that if you look at them in their sector certainly you can find lower cost devices  But not that much lower cost and when you look at it from a quality comparison standpoint  You really can't do much better. I mean it's it's for finally four years after airpods  There are finally some competitors in the sub 150 space that could be as good as airpods  Even if you're not using them with an iphone. Yeah, um the apple watch, especially when you can get kind of like the  $200 space. I don't think there's anything again. You have to have an iphone. So that is a knock against clobbered  They clobbered everybody else they did they did like they're being there  I wouldn't recommend somebody to get a fitbit  The only person who i've recently who and by recently  I mean in the last couple of years that i've bought a fitbit for  has been my my parents and the reason there is that they have rolexes and  I've come really close to getting my mom an apple watch a number of times, you know, but wait a minute

Transcript:  Right, right. Exactly. And so yeah, but at this point  I mean, I think it's interesting that obviously think the phones and the computers especially right the computers are really where there's the highest  Barriered entry, but it's still aspirational  but for the accessories with the wearables like  You know again like that's kind of why I compare the air the air pods to the ipod because that really was the first hit  mass  Adoption apple product that they had by the time they in 2003 the time by the time they had the usb  30 pin connector it was available for windows, you know that thing sold like hotcakes you couldn't you know  They were selling way more of them  you know for windows users than for mac users and it it created a whole market and took over an entire industry and led to  You know, frankly the apple that we have today and I think that the air pods are doing the same thing  um kind of you know 15  17 years 18 years later. Wow. Um, but you know  To alex's point it is kind of a bmw thing and that they're  They don't go after the bottom barrel thing. They're not going after chromebooks  They're not going after the real entry level like, you know cheapest you can do like they want to have a high margin  They want to have a quality standard, but it is designed in a way where okay  You might not be able to be 100% in the apple ecosystem  But they do make it possible for people to dip their toe in and then the hope is philip was pointing out earlier  Is that once you start to get in you will become fully immersed?

Do you like them? I um, I don't have them  But i've i've i've almost bought them a couple times now that I don't go anywhere  It doesn't make a ton of sense for me to buy them. Just wear those around the house. You'd look silly  Right, but like once I once i'm able to like, you know walk more and that sort of thing. I I um, and when it's not like  Like no sun in seattle, uh, I might get them but that does make me think about something like, you know apples like  Whatever they're going to be doing with their glasses because if you had something like that where you could you know get that kind of personalized  Input in your ear like that could actually be pretty great  But that's been the that's been the challenge  I think anybody in ar and vr has had so far as there hasn't been the killer app and apple obviously has the best  Track record if anybody is trying to kind of come up with the best experience around that  So I certainly wouldn't bet against them  but it's why we've seen other ar plays almost entirely be business to business and  In kind of you know verticals of people who can use them in industry rather than any sort of consumer plays where  for all of the  Like futurist ideas that we have how cool it would be there hasn't been anything  That's just been compelling enough to people to say  Right i'm willing to put up with these limitations and and all this other stuff to have this computer on my face  But if anybody can do it, it's apple, right?

So these first cases  The first was a user in miyanmar to to your point who disparaged muslims as psychologically inferior  The company decided the post violated its policy, but the board overruled them saying the terms used were not derogatory or violent  The board wrote while the post might be considered pejorative or offensive toward muslims  That did not advocate hatred or intentionally incite any form of imminent harm. Okay  In the second case a user posted a term to describe azerbaijanis that facebook said that's a slur  The board ruled the context in which the term was used made it clear. It was meant to dehumanize its target  So they said yep, we're going to uphold the decision  in the third case  Involved nipples  the board  overturned facebook's decision to remove an instagram post  From a user in brazil intended to raise awareness about breast cancer  It's not male nipples that they care about it's female nipples for some reason. Yes, they look exactly the same oddly enough  But the post included five photographs that showed women's nipples which the board said no, that's okay  Because it's breast cancer awareness  In the fourth case a user quoted joseph gebbels  Always a good source the head of nazi nazi propaganda  The board said the quote did not support the nazi party's ideology or the regime's act of hate and violence so they overturned facebook's  decision

We lose the freedom to be human  And yet this is a hopeful new season a time of thoughtfulness and reform  basically, uh, he didn't say facebook by name  But he condemned its business model. He said if a business is built on misleading users  On data exploitation on choices that are no choice at all. It does not deserve our praise.

This could be a huge economic

Transcript:  Although although the one area i'll push back is that as much as people hate like having you know  The privacy sold and whatnot there are advantages to that too like apple music and i'm an apple music subscriber  I also subscribe to spotify, uh, because i'm dumb  And you know have multiple subscriptions to everything but like the thing that you know  The end of year thing that everybody loves so much from spotify the spotify, you know  Unwrapped where they give you all of your analytics like people love that  I know I know even close  So I think that that on the one hand people will be like, oh well  I don't like you taking tracking my emotions or this other stuff  But on the other hand they're like, oh no  But show me all of my most listened to things and who i'm the biggest fan of and and all this other analysis  Like people love that data. So like there's this weird thing where I think in in cases like facebook  Specifically with whatsapp because they'd said that they would keep it separate and then you know moving all the data to facebook  I think that's like one  Big move that you can see people are actively being like, all right  Well getting off of this and we have other options something like music

I mean I like my favorites, um a playlist from from apple music  No, but no, it's not it's stuff that I know I like i'm never going to hear anything new on it  Whereas discover weekly I get new stuff that is tailored to me all the time  So I mean there there's a there's a trade-off to that and part of me i'm like I understand that spotify is monetizing and monitoring and  All the stuff with my listening habits  But i'm getting better listening experience out of it in some ways whereas it's similar to syria right like syria is a terrible assistant  largely because it isn't doing any of the things that google assistant and alexa are doing and  Sometimes if all you're wanting to do is set an alarm or other stuff, that's fine  But if you're actually wanting to try to get information and use it as a as a tool  I mean, I think even those of us who are like deeply deeply embedded in the apple ecosystem  Acknowledge that syria is terrible and that the other ones are better, you know, so sometimes there are trade-offs

You can learn at your own pace and schedule  So many people use udacity why they have day jobs maybe day jobs that don't satisfy  They're they're getting the skills the knowledge they need to get a real job.
