And you're gonna, I think, see if you look at the panel,  there's a little leaning, a little bias  in this particular episode.  In fact, it looks a little bit like MacBreak Weekly.  Renee Richie's here.  He wasn't on MacBreak Weekly this week  because you were getting briefed by Apple on the M1 chip.  Glad to have you.  Renee, did you learn many things?

Transcript:  I have spent the entire week deep diving on the M1.  So I'm ready for anything you can throw my way, Leo.

Start time: 192.08
End time: 206.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is gonna be a deep dive on M1.  But there's other tech news.  But we definitely are gonna spend some time on that.  That's why you're here.  So is Doc Rock.  The YouTube sensation. Aloha.  And you're apparently a fan of not the Kansas City Royals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  This is a car club.  We do a highfalutin JDM style cars.  I mean, it's Japan domestic model, by the way.  And it's called the really executive luxury car.  So my friends, they take like old Japanese luxury cars,  like the Japanese version of Crown Victorias  and dress them up beautifully.

Start time: 226.66
End time: 253.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have beautiful in Japan.  I saw, we were in Tokyo, we saw a wedding.  And they have a beautiful, kind of looks old,  but maybe like one of those checker caps, but it's big.  And it actually, because the wedding headdress is so big,  you open the door and then they have a door on the top  to open up so that the bride can get out  with her wedding headdress on.  It's a beautiful car.  I would love that car.  I mean, spacious, you know?  I mean, just beautiful.

Start time: 254.32
End time: 263.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Japan taxis are awesome.  And I wish they sold them as regular cars  because they're boxy and funny looking,  but they have so much space and automatic doors.  It's incredible.

Start time: 264.84
End time: 297.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right.  They have automatic doors.  Cause you have to learn if you're in Japan,  not to close slam the door like you would in New York City  after you get out of the car.  Cause you'll break the delicate automatic closing mechanism,  which is very embarrassing.  Hey, also with us, it's Alex Lindsay.  Haven't seen you in a long, long time.  Hey, good to be here.  090 Media, founder of MacBreak and MacBreak Weekly.  And he's been so busy with the various conferences  he's been putting together.  You still do though, the morning show, right?

Start time: 298.42
End time: 331.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do, I do.  My office hours, yeah.  We're doing them still two or three hours a day.  And over the course of every morning,  I think we have about four to 600 people joining.  So it's still pretty crazy,  but yeah, you people can find it just with the office hours.  I tweet about it every once in a while,  but we've been kind of just relaxing into the group  that we have.  We've got about 2400 people that are part of the group  and then about 800 in discord.  And then I said about four to 600 show up every day  to talk about media production and virtual production.  So it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice, welcome.  It's good to see you.  So as you can see with the three Apple fans here,  there might be a little bit of a bias towards the M1 chip,  but I want to explain why we want to talk about it.  I mean, this is from the point of view of technology,  this is a very important week.  This is the week Apple said, no more Intel.  We're going to design our own chip,  something we've been doing on the iPhone and iPad for years,  but we're now going to put them on the Macintosh.  This is not something Apple hasn't done before.  In fact, this is the third time Apple's changed,  massive change of chip platforms.  But this is one I think is going to be very interesting  and may in fact be challenging to the rest of the PC industry,  the X86 based industry.  And that's why you guys are here,  because you're going to help us all understand  what is happening with the M1 processor.  Apple announced three new Macintosh computers,  all available day of, which was nice.  People will start putting out their reviews.  Rene, can you tell me when the reviews will come out  or is that also embargoed?

Start time: 398.34
End time: 399.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, typically when you have an embargo,

Start time: 399.58
End time: 423.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the embargo's embargoed.  You can't even mention that you have an embargo.  So I'm going to guess you don't,  you just raise your eyebrows.  No, you don't have to do anything.  Don't even show him.  I don't want to put him on the spot,  but I would guess it'll be probably Wednesday,  we'll start getting reviews of the new MacBook Air,  the new MacBook Pro 13 and the surprise, the Mac Mini,  all based on this Apple M1 chip.  Can you tell us that you got briefed by Apple?

Start time: 425.94
End time: 431.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's such a virtual world, Leo, I don't know.  I did do a lot of research this week though.  Okay.

Start time: 433.24
End time: 441.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go, that's what you can say.  I've done a lot of research,  some of which may or may not have been  by talking to people at Apple.  All right, that's fine.

Start time: 441.78
End time: 446.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  May or may not.  And beyond Apple,  but I also want to hear what the other side  of all those different discussions.

Start time: 446.94
End time: 465.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you the negatives  because there've been a number of articles,  YouTube videos and so forth saying,  whatever you do, do not buy the new M1 Macintosh.  And I'll give you some of the reasons  and then you guys can say why or why not that's accurate.  First, of course, it's the first generation chip from Apple.  We've never seen an M1.

Start time: 465.30
End time: 504.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you just say what it is  before we talk about the negatives?  Yeah, what is it?  Because that would be helpful for some people.  So the best way to think about it,  if you're at all familiar with Apple Silicon,  is the M1 is basically, if you took the A14,  the chip that's in the new iPad Air and all the iPhone 12s,  you made the X version of that,  the one that you would expect to see  in the next generation of iPads Pro.  So instead of six CPUs, it has eight CPUs.  Instead of four GPUs, it has seven or eight GPUs.  And then you added a little bit of Mac specific stuff  like hypervisor acceleration, emulation acceleration,  Thunderbolt controllers.  So a little bit of uniquely Mac stuff.  But that's, I think, the gist, the quick gist of what an M1 is.

Start time: 505.00
End time: 509.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It isn't a brand new chip.  It's an evolution of the existing A14 chip.  It's a sibling.

Start time: 510.12
End time: 510.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a 14th generation IP.

Start time: 512.28
End time: 541.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that that's a really important  piece of information is that Apple  isn't creating a new chip.  This is just a bigger, faster version  of what they're using in the iPad.  So in the iPhone and everything else.  And that's one of the things, this is an evolution.  They've been building their own chips in reality  for quite some time.  And so they just haven't moved it over  to the Mac OS until now.  So, and that gives them a lot of history  and a lot of stability that we wouldn't expect.  I think we think of this as a first generation chip,  but it's really a 14th, 15th.

Start time: 542.28
End time: 546.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've already debunked point one of the multi-point.

Start time: 547.80
End time: 596.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As funny as I've been telling people for,  at least since they got announced,  everyone's like, well, this is not gonna work,  and do you remember the Intel transition?  And I was saying, this is not the Intel transition.  You really have to let go of what it used to be.  And I get that.  I understand your basis for that thought.  But the first statement they made is,  we've been doing this for a decade.  Like dude nearly walked out on stage  and within the first six words, he said,  hey, we've been doing, he said, Aloha, in my head,  we've been doing this for over a decade.  And today we're gonna show you like what's popping.  So I've been trying to say that to everyone,  just calm down and relax.  This is not the first gen.  If you have an iPad and you're expressing my DJ friends,  if Serato and Algorithm DJ runs on your iPad,  it will run on a new computer.

Start time: 596.88
End time: 657.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but I guess I know what role  I'm gonna be playing on the show today.  Okay, but.  Yeah, there's no denying,  Apple's been designing chips since 2007.  But they've never done a desktop version of this chip.  This chip will be attempting to run software designed  for an Intel Mac, not for an A14 processor.  And it's a different environment.  There are new things.  You mentioned this USB for Thunderbolt.  You mentioned the unified memory architecture.  The memory is actually on the chip,  which, and then that brings up the second caveat or negative  because this chip can only have two Thunderbolt channels  and can only have up to 16 gigs of RAM.  That's the max you can get on these new Macintosh computers.  So they are somewhat limited.  I mean, you could get 64 gigs of RAM on the Intel Mac mini.

Start time: 657.38
End time: 677.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a misconception.  Like this is a really weird thing.  Like I think nerds forgot  because we only ever buy the high end  that the literal machines that these are replacing  the MacBook Air, the lowest end pro  and the original silver that they don't sell anymore.  The silver Mac mini were all 16 gigabytes.  And they were exactly the same machines.

Start time: 677.68
End time: 687.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want more RAM, you could get more RAM,  not on an Air.  Not on those machines.  Not on an Air, but you could on a MacBook Pro  and you could on a Mac mini.  I guess I would say.

Start time: 687.14
End time: 688.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there were different versions of those computers.

Start time: 688.90
End time: 694.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And also like the person who buys the Air  is not typically the person who would want 64 gigs of RAM.

Start time: 696.52
End time: 700.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Mac mini buyers, which you own a lot of Mac minis,  are they all 16 gigs?

Start time: 702.36
End time: 748.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Most of mine are actually,  because we don't really expect them  to do that kind of work.  So when we buy a Mac mini,  I'm expecting it to do a limited amount of work.  And in fact, I think I'm gonna be buying a Mac mini,  one of these new ones in the next couple of weeks  is specifically for the kind of stuff that we do.  It could be perfect for what we, again,  Mac minis are kind of for us like glue  that we tie things into.  We don't have high expectations.  In fact, looking at the stats that I've seen come out so far,  I have a feeling that we can do more with them  than we did in the past.  So it looks pretty positive as far as what that looks like.  And while we're limited right now to 16 gigabytes,  we have to remember that this is the 320 by 240 version.  You know, I understand.

Start time: 750.38
End time: 764.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying one should never buy an M1 Mac  or Apple Silicon Mac,  but that these are not,  there's gonna be a lot more to come.  And it might be prudent to wait because it's first gen,  because there are limits.

Start time: 765.62
End time: 775.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, don't buy it if you wouldn't buy the Intel version.  Like if you would never have bought the Intel version  with 16 gigabytes and two terabytes,  don't just buy these because they're shiny and new.  Well, here's a question.  Wait and buy the system you would buy.

Start time: 775.32
End time: 781.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, some people were upset that what,  you mean a MacBook Pro with only two ports?  That's not an illegitimate complaint.

Start time: 781.70
End time: 786.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the MacBook it replaced had two ports.  It's literally that.  Right.  But there is a question.

Start time: 787.82
End time: 804.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is 16 gigs, now I'm gonna put a different hat on,  maybe a defense hat,  but 16 gigs of RAM on this platform  may not be comparable to 16 gigs of RAM  on an Intel platform.  That's what I keep saying.  Intel's memory management's very different.  Yeah. Right?  It's segmented.

Start time: 804.28
End time: 811.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also the same, like it's LPDDR4 memory,  and Apple has their own kind.  It's LPDDR4X, which is just a slightly more efficient.

Start time: 811.26
End time: 815.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is probably faster than DDR4  because it's unified architecture, right?

Start time: 815.34
End time: 836.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's shared.  Yeah, it's shared between the CPU and the GPU.  But the thing is that LPDDR4 itself,  even on the Intel machines is limited to 16 gigabytes.  When Apple goes above it,  they drop the low power version they use just plain DDR4,  and they bolster the battery to compensate for it.  So they're only replacing the lowest end,  most popular and most constrained devices at this point.

Start time: 837.74
End time: 907.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think people cannot get that disconnect  from their head, but again,  you're doing memory calculations based on the way  that a Intel-based processor handles memory, right?  And I keep trying to akin it to horsepower, right?  When you look at a muscle car,  the horsepower is 500 horsepower,  but if you go and get yourself a little rice rocket,  like my boys up here, and you lighten it up  and you put in some turbos and stuff like that,  you end up with an eight and a half second Civic.  And it exists.  If you look at ESPN or sports races,  you'll see it exists in the world.  So again, everybody was trying to put that power  to weight ratio based off of trying  to move a lead sled level car.  But if you take it down to a motorcycle  or a Hayabusa or a Jigsaw,  you have things that are 105 horsepower.  A Suzuki Jigsaw is 105 horsepower,  but zero to 60 is faster than a Ferrari.  So you cannot just align that speed that you know  with the speed that what's gonna come  until you actually have it in your hands.  And there's a lot of postulating bases on guessing  and wanting to feel victimized.

Start time: 908.10
End time: 929.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And even though weird benchmarks are leaking out  to Geekbench and Graphicsbench,  those we shouldn't judge until, as I said,  something like Wednesday when the actual reviewers,  not Renee, but people like Renee,  who are benchmarking furiously even as we speak,  will have some better numbers.

Start time: 929.86
End time: 941.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But-  If you benchmark, I just prefer time to completed work.  I think benchmarks are like,  was one person faster off the post?  Was another person better at the end?  So I like how long I ingest this footage,  how long before I'm exporting?

Start time: 942.00
End time: 945.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just giving you plausible denial of my ability to-  Oh, I appreciate it.

Start time: 945.94
End time: 954.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what you're doing with that machine  you may or may not have.  I was just protecting your ass there.  No, I appreciate it.  I just mean like, there's a lot,

Start time: 954.86
End time: 958.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like benchmarks are one thing,  but also I want to see how a bunch of people  with different workloads do.

Start time: 958.56
End time: 966.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  But I've been, so if you're a Photoshop user,  16 gigs, yeah, it's on an Apple Silicon,  but it may not be enough.

Start time: 966.54
End time: 984.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But imagine this though too, Leo.  Like imagine Photoshop that doesn't bounce 16 times  before it opens.  It doesn't beach ball constantly  with every time you move the pointer.  Like the battery life is going to be transformative.  Like the performance is one thing.  I think Apple was aiming for battery life  and they didn't get lucky with the performance,  but I think the performance blew their expectations.

Start time: 984.90
End time: 996.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They prioritize battery life, you think, on these machines.  Not a Mac Pro or anything,  but these machines, they were looking for battery life.  Yet they put it in a MacBook Pro.  Pro.

Start time: 997.54
End time: 1000.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and I would say that-  This is not the real Pro.

Start time: 1000.24
End time: 1001.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the self-identified Pro.

Start time: 1001.84
End time: 1036.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What I was going to say is that  with the two ports on the side and that 13 inch,  we kind of considered the Pro Lite.  It was never really a Pro.  It was kind of like, or it was like an Air Pro  or a Pro Lite, but it was not really  a true MacBook Pro ever.  And so when you look at the performance specs on it,  it was not something we could,  like if we were buying it,  we have a couple 13 inches that we bought,  but it's the one above that.  So it's not that one.  And so we would consider that one a slightly,  the advantage that it has over the Air is the fan.  That's the big thing that it's going to be able to  manage heat more effectively than the Air is.

Start time: 1036.82
End time: 1048.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically this is a MacBook Air with a fan  is what you're saying.  Yeah, well that's how I view it.  And it's better than heat pipes.  We don't know what the clock speeds even.  Apple didn't say clock speeds.  Because clock speeds might not matter anymore.

Start time: 1049.06
End time: 1052.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They may not matter?  No, clock speeds may not matter anymore.

Start time: 1055.26
End time: 1156.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead, Alex.  All I was going to say is that  the transformative piece of this  is all of these things being on one chip.  The fact that we don't have to go back out to the board  all the time, we don't have to use  those external buses, we don't have to deal with  all those external pieces, is going to dramatically  change the performance profile.  And so it's not going to matter exactly  whether any one of these components is faster.  The fact that they're able to talk to each other  so much faster is going to make a huge difference  in what's available.  And I think that it's probably one of the most  transformative things that we've seen.  And I think that within a very short period of time,  PC manufacturers are going to have to figure out  some way to do something similar.  And it's going to be very hard because without owning,  what Apple is doing is they're forcing everyone  to play a game that almost nobody else can play,  maybe nobody else can play, is that I own the,  we own the operating system, we own the hardware,  we own all the components that go into it,  and we're going to vertically stack those  so that they all work together effectively.  I don't know who else does that.  And without being able to do that,  I don't know how you keep up.  I look down the path of,  okay, well, this is the 320 by 240 version.  What happens when another one comes out  that's got 32 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of RAM,  128 gigs of RAM sitting on that chip with 24 lanes  and all kinds of other stuff that are going into it  when you think about a Mac Pro that is built for this,  the performance specs could be dramatic.  And it really could put the PC industry on,  no, the PC industry will respond,  they'll figure out some way to do it,  but it's going to be,  I don't see how a traditional PC keeps up with  what Apple has just done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  The PCs?

Start time: 1162.78
End time: 1168.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like if you want to build a gaming rig  and you want to have a Ryzen card  or you want to have CUDA cores or whatever,  I think they'll just.  Sure, but the question is,

Start time: 1168.88
End time: 1180.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  if those have a hard time competing  with this unified piece,  what benefit does the modularity give you  if you can't keep up with the unified architecture?  That's the question.

Start time: 1180.22
End time: 1230.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people just like customizability.  And one of the things that's becoming very clear,  and this, we'll talk about later the issue  with the big server release  and the slowdown of the certificate servers,  but one of the things that's becoming clearer and clearer  is that Apple is getting more and more locked down.  It's an appliance.  It's an appliance.  You can't upgrade the memory.  The memory is on the chip.  You can't upgrade the memory.  There's nowhere to put it.  The controller for the hard drive, such as it is,  is on the chip so that you can't replace the hard drive  because there's nowhere to put it.  So increasingly, these are sealed boxes, black boxes.  And some people will hate that.  And some people won't want that.  Yeah.  If all you care about is how it feels to use it  and getting a job done.

Transcript:  And I think that Apple commonly,  I always think of Apple as,  they look at what 90% of the people want 90% of the time.  And in that sense, 90% of the people, 90% of the time  are gonna want something that's faster, that works well,  that's integrated,  and there's more of a fringe element  that's going to want to,  and I have a box sitting next to me that I built.  So there are reasons that you build boxes  that you need to do a very specific task.  So I don't think that that's going away,  but I think that there's gonna be a large number of people  that a vast majority that won't care,  especially if the performance specs start to hit  what the rumors are.  I don't know, there's gonna be a lot of people  that are just gonna buy it.

Start time: 1284.48
End time: 1349.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the 720p camera is easily addressable.  For the computers that it's replacing,  that's a non-factor.  Because they have 720p cameras?  Yeah, and also, for the nowadays.  I know, they suck.  Absolutely, but nowadays,  the people who need a better camera, per se,  you're not gonna use a built-in camera anyway.  You're gonna plug in a Sony a6400, like here,  and you're gonna slap on a Sigma 16 lens, like here,  and you're gonna be fine.  So I don't care what they put in the machine,  I'm not gonna use it.  The people that really matter, they don't care.  But it's funny,  as I'm watching YouTube videos and watching Nebula,  all I saw was people who actually use mirrorless cameras  complaining about the camera that they put in the computer.  I was like, there's some people  that are just capitulating because they have to,  or they make themselves feel better,  or like I tagged on Renee's post today,  I said, I think people are literally saying all this stuff  because they don't wanna get tagged as a fanboy.  So they have to say something bad,  but it really doesn't matter  for the people that are gonna use it.

Transcript:  Maybe, I mean, I don't know if it's...  Yeah, I mean, I think that we send out,  we send a lot of kits out,  and we just assume that the built-in webcam,  whether it's PC or Mac, is not gonna be usable  for our events.  It's not something that we even think about.  So we send them either Logitech 920s or Brios,  but that's just kind of what we send out.  And that's a significantly better camera  that you're never gonna be able to afford  to put into your device.  And so back to Doc's point, which is perfect,  which is that for the people who care,  you'll buy an extra camera.  For the people who don't care, it's good enough.

Transcript:  Yeah, so nerds are gonna buy the Mac Mini or the Air  to tie them over until they get the more powerful machine  just because they want the new thing.  That's the way it'll be.  But I think a lot of people,  I don't wanna say it was a safe and gutsy move  because starting at the low end  is a power profile we all know from Apple.  This is a straight iPad Pro sort of place.  So we know the power that's going into this.  But also the MacBook Air is their most popular computer.  Laptops far outsell desktops for Apple,  and the MacBook Air far outsells any of the other laptops.  So it's also gutsy.  It's like they trust this enough  to burn the boat behind them and go all in on M1  because they stopped selling.  They're still selling the higher end versions of the Mac Mini  and the 13-inch MacBook Pro on Intel.  They are only selling this on the MacBook Air.

The Y series Intel chips were terrible.  Yeah.  It'll be a better experience than your existing Air  and by a long shot probably, right?

Transcript:  And the thing that killed me,  there are two things that really impressed me.  One is Apple seems genuinely surprised  at how good these are.  And that doesn't happen that often.  Sometimes they'll project confidence.  But I think they really were targeting battery life  and they got huge performance gains.  But also I had a chance, I have to admit,  I had a chance to talk to some of them on the record  on one of my shows, the Mac and macOS marketing team.  And from what they were saying, Steve Tonah,  who runs, he's director of product marketing  for Cross Platform, said they were getting better results  on metal in emulation than they would get straight on Intel.  So if you have an Intel app that leans on metal,  it will run better on Apple Silicon  than it runs natively on Intel.  And that is sort of makes me recategorize  a lot of what my thinking was going on.

Start time: 1516.40
End time: 1536.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's another unknown  because most of the software you run  will be having to run on emulation on Rosetta 2.  And so that's the other unknown  is how the software you need is gonna work.  I mean, if you're just using Apple software,  I presume Logic, Final Cut, Office, all the Office tools,  they'll all be native.

Transcript:  Yes.  It's a little bit different though  because it'll do a translation on download  so you don't have to do it at runtime every time.  So it'll do it either when it's downloading  or when it first runs.  And for dynamic code, it'll still do it at runtime,  but for everything else.  And they've had three years to figure out  how to accelerate the stuffing out of that, so to speak.

Transcript:  And somebody brought it up this week  on actually one of your shows, Leo's,  and they were talking about, well,  the Microsoft Office is not gonna work in this and that.  I'm like, Microsoft Office works really well  on phones and tablets.  Microsoft Office works on Amazon super slow tablets.  And large portion of this stuff has gone cloud anyway.  And so again, one of the conversations came up,  well, how's this stuff gonna work with cloud oriented apps?  We find because it's running in a browser, so to speak.  So that's another reason why people's expectations  of what you need for RAM and all this stuff  were kind of different too.  Many applications are trying to move to,  they're taking the dependency off the CPU  and they're moving the dependency to clusters  that exist in space.  And you're just sort of the window sort of back and forth.  As more and more computer applications run that way,  it'll be fine.  Because when we got to, how do I remove this background  of this picture on my iPhone?  Your iPhone isn't doing a lot of that calculation  in the past that would run up to a server,  get done, come back.  But now you can do the kind of half and half,  and then eventually it will be back to just the iPhone chip.  So again, I think people's thinking is based off  of what we know, not where we're going.  Apple's pulling a Gretzky.

I mean, when we look at USDZ, when we look at AR coming,  when we look at all of those things driving forward,  Apple needs these computers to be higher performance.

Transcript:  Apple did say...  We have some more leaked benchmarks that came out, Leo.  So if people aren't aware, Geekbench automatically uploads  everything you run, and I think a lot of people  who have early access don't realize that,  so the benchmarks just got all sucked up.  And they've got a bunch of emulation benchmarks now,  and the M1 by itself is faster than any Apple computer  currently at single thread.  Even in emulation mode, it is faster than any current Apple  single core computer.

Start time: 1712.12
End time: 1753.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that he's trying to redefine...  They're both defining two different things.  Apple's talking about the total number sold,  and he's talking about the number of different devices.  So to him, it's not 98% because it's, well,  there's only X number of devices, and Apple is one of those.  Whereas Apple's talking about the total number  that are actually sold.  And there's a lot of crappy PCs out there.  That's not nearly as impressive a statistic.  But they're talking, he's not comparing apples to oranges.  What they said, whether we decide that's a useful statistic,  and almost all those statistics are useless.  But what they were defining is of the total sold.  They're not full of it, they're just picking a different,  they're picking a more rosy piece of it.

Definitely not battery life.  But I think that if you require those two things,  you're probably gonna have a hard time finding a PC  at the same price that can do the same thing.

Start time: 1855.82
End time: 1937.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, absolutely.  They're still selling them.  If you have a piece of dedicated hardware  that is very crucial to your business, right?  Say like my laser or my CNC,  that I would stick to Intel for for a while  because those type of hardwares,  they don't do these kind of firmware updates  where I can get it fixed or whatever.  Like there'll be two $60,000 bricks that do nothing.  So in that case, yes.  And people love to tax people like me  and my specialized machine as,  well, let's go to break this.  Yeah, but like my sisters,  none of them will be bothered by the chains.  They don't even know what kind of chip  is in their computer right now.  They don't care.  And then the other one that's gonna be kind of crazy  is people like to throw around this pro word.  If there was three letters,  I wish that I could absolutely remove  from everything to do with tech,  it would be the word pro, right?  Because when Apple does it, it's a fire.  When GoPro does it,  oh, it's a dope little camera  that does what little cameras do.  And you know what I mean?  But Alex will tell you there's tons and tons  and tons and tons of high level productions  that are still using GoPros for certain shots, right?  It's not as many as the people who own GoPros  want you to think, but they do exist, right?

Transcript:  What I will say is that after seeing the rumor performance  of this chip, we will hold on to the Macs  that we have as long as we can.  Oh, interesting.  You're not pulling away.  As soon as I saw it, I was like,  oh, I don't know if I wanna buy another Intel machine  until I see what happens with the next Mac Pros  and the iMac and the iMac Pro and especially the Mac Pro,  which we won't see for a couple of years,  but it will definitely keep me from wanting to upgrade  unless I absolutely have to.  When you have to, you have to.  You buy what you need.  If it's gonna pencil out financially for a project,  you buy the hardware as a pro.  You don't think about what you need.  Okay, well, I'm gonna bill out this much work on it.  I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and buy it.  It doesn't matter.  But I will say that we will only buy  what we absolutely have to based on that performance  because of, I think that the Mac, given this chip,  I think that the Mac Pro slash,  I think the Mac Pros and the iMac will be the next group.  And then I think the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro  will be the next group.  And I think that in those swaths,  I think we're gonna see significant performance increases.  And so as someone buying them,  I'm gonna hold off if I can,  and not just jump into something because it was a cycle  or because it's the end of the year  or other things like that.

And I think that, again, I think that by the time  we get to the Mac Pro two or three years from now,  I don't think we're gonna see anything else out there  that has that kind of performance.

Start time: 2083.86
End time: 2102.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Like when I'm scrubbing through a final cut timeline  and I have to wait for the beach ball,  or I'm launching Photoshop and I have to wait for the filter,  shaving seconds off of that is gonna eventually  save minutes and hours of my life.

Transcript:  Well, also, Alan Kay said,  if you really wanna make good software,  you gotta make the hardware.  Or maybe he said, if you really wanna make good hardware,  you gotta make the software.  But that's the point, is you need to control a full stack.  And that's one thing that Apple's doing  that really nobody except maybe Samsung  with their Exynos chip is doing.  They're gonna-  Yeah, I mean, but they're gonna make,  they make the operating system, they make,  and we'll talk about Big Sur in a little bit,  but they're making the chips, they're making everything.  And that's more than just raw power.  That's a synergy that is very hard  for a PC maker to duplicate.

Start time: 2141.48
End time: 2190.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's purpose-built.  Like they have, when you hear Johnny Suruji talk about it,  he says that basically their job  is to make the fastest chipset in the world  given the thermal limits of the chassis.  And that every year their job is to increase  that performance only constrained  by the limits of time and physics.  And when you have a company that's not profit and loss  based on the chipset, which Qualcomm and Intel  just have to be, but they only care  about selling iPhones and Macs,  there is no P&L for that chipset.  They can run as fast as they want.  That puts incredible competitive pressure on the industry.  And I think when you combine them  with what AMD has been doing,  because AMD has been super impressive with Ryzen  and now with Navi too,  it's, I think it's industry redefining this year.  I think we're gonna look back and think that  as bad as 2020 has been in some ways  in terms of just silicon for the PC industry in general,  it's gonna be transformative.

And also, I just think that there is no way,  when you look at the trajectory  of this tiny little chipset doing what it's doing,  at least in the rumors,  and we'll see more of the reviews as they come out.  But as we look at that and you mark a potential trajectory  beyond battery life, just performance,  the PC industry has to do something like it,  or it's going to be very hard.

So if all of a sudden Microsoft says,  and Windows now is designed to run on our custom ARM chips,  that's a problem.  You can't do that.

Transcript:  I also think you were right before Leo.  Like there is gonna be people  for whom this approach is anathema.  You know, they just don't want an appliance computer.  Apple is building, like Apple is not building  general purpose computers anymore.  They're building things like appliances.  Very few people care about being a mechanic to their own car.  They don't care about upgrading their refrigerator.  You know, they don't care about changing their television set  instead of buying a new television set.  And Apple is laser honed on that consumer market  with a little bit of service made to pros,  you know, at the very top of the end.  But there are gonna be a lot of people  who just wanna buy a case and upgrade the card every year.  They just wanna buy a case and upgrade the RAM every year.  They wanna do it like a hobbyist  and Apple is not gonna serve that market at all.  Or they have very specific needs like high-end gaming  that just Apple is probably not gonna cater to.  And it's the same way where someone says,  you know, Apple is Sherlocking this app.  And I'm like, yeah, except for cross-platform people  who Apple will absolutely not serve at all in any market.  And there's tremendous value in that.  I think there'll still be tremendous value  in doing everything that Apple's not doing.  Is there a risk to bifurcating developers?

Transcript:  Again, I think that the issue is,  and I think that I don't know what was gonna happen there  but I kind of feel like the John Hodgman ad at the end,  the little John Hodgman thing, that little preview  could be a preview to a serine.  Like Apple is about to have,  they're about to have the high ground  when it comes to performance.  And I think we may expect to see  more of those kinds of ads again.  Where they're not just positioning ads  that make you feel good.  They are going square and hitting the other platform  really, really, really hard.  Because they have it.  They're gonna have for the next couple of years  to get to Doc's point,  you need to build a consortium  but that consortium takes time.  It'll take two years to organize it.  Then it'll take two more years to agree on things.  Then it'll take five more years to build it.  You're talking about 10 years  of everyone trying to organize themselves  around the idea of what to do  while Apple doesn't have to talk to anybody.  And that is devastating.  And I think that it is,  so what you look at with developers is,  well, I have for the average business user,  15 hours or 18 hours of usage time means a lot.  And then as the performance comes out  for the average 3D artist or the average video artist,  seeing these crazy performance improvements  is going to mean something else.  And then you take that with a searing set of ads  that constantly underline that.  And it doesn't mean that Apple's going to take  more than 10 or 15% of the market  but that's the most valuable 10 or 15%  of the market in the industry.  And that really takes a lot of the fun out of it  for a lot of other PC manufacturers.

By the way, these are the slowest SoC chips  that will ever exist.  So six months from now when the M2 or the X as Renee says  is going to come out, when we get ready to build 16s,  now we're at the next one.  And then soon we'll be at the M5 and it will be at M6  which chips are invisible.  Get it?  M5, MI6?

And again, I think that I do think that the more modular PC  could catch up at some point  but the problem is it's just gonna take them a long time  to make the turn because it requires so many people  to agree on something.  And that is the thing that Apple is forcing.  And I think that what we're seeing over and over again  is Apple starting to really force the industry  to do things they're uncomfortable with.

That really was great to see him back.  Let's take a little break.  This will not be all Apple all the time,  but there are a few more things we need to talk about.  And I really, honestly, I wanna defend this.  I think this is a big shift for PCs,  for the desk, for computing.  And maybe the shift is, maybe Renee,  you kind of nailed it when you said,  there's a fork in the road.  Appliances, whatever that other thing is.  Workstations, I don't know.  And here's the fork in the road.

Start time: 2654.34
End time: 2663.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but we also have to remember there  that the Mac Pro is not an appliance,  and it was built in the era of them working on this chip.  So it may not be the only outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they announced this weird computer,  and they said it was for people  who would normally buy a MacBook Air,  but just wanted a little bit more.  And I think we have gotten people who self-identify as Pro.  They're like, they founded startups,  they're doing crowdsourcing things,  or they just, they wanna feel like they're a Pro.  They want that Pro logo on that machine,  but they don't have intent to compute needs.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by actually what's in here,  Mint Mobile, breaking up with your wireless provider  just got a whole lot easier.  We love Mint Mobile around here.  They were the first company to sell  premium wireless service online only  and pass the savings on to you.  And now Mint Mobile is introducing something  we've all been waiting for, their unlimited plan.  And get this, unlimited, unlimited nationwide text,  unlimited nationwide calling, unlimited data,  30 bucks a month.  30 bucks a month, let that sink in.  An unlimited plan for 30 bucks a month.  Now I'm on the 25 buck a month, 12 gigabytes a month,  which for me is, you know, that's plenty of data.  And so they still have those other plans.  But if you want unlimited, that's about a third  what I'm paying the big boys for.  A third, how much are you paying, overpaying  to your soon to be ex wireless provider?  Mint Mobile saves by not having retail, they're online only.  They pass those savings on to you.  All the plans come with unlimited talk and text  and high speed data delivered on the nation's  largest 5G network.  I know you want to know, so I'll tell you.  It's T-Mobile.  So if you get great T-Mobile service where you are,  you're going to get it with Mint Mobile  for about a third the cost.  You can bring your own phone,  keep the same phone number, along with your existing  contacts, they'll just send you the SIM,  no charge for the SIM, unlike the other guys.  And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied,  Mint Mobile has you covered with their  seven day money back guarantee.  They also sell phones, in fact,  that's where I got this iPhone SE, 15 bucks a month.  So for half what I'm paying the big boys,  I get the phone and the service, for half.  Phone and service, break up with big wireless,  switch to Mint Mobile's premium unlimited data plan,  just $30 a month.  I don't need to say really much more,  it's just that's the deal.  Get your new unlimited wireless plan for just 30 bucks a  month and get the plan shipped to your door free.  Go to MintMobile.com slash twit, MintMobile.com slash twit.  30 bucks a month, unlimited everything.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Thank you Mint Mobile for your support of this week in tech.  Anand did a pretty good breakdown, I thought, on the N1  chip, given that we don't know much about it,  but they were able to take this illustration  from the Apple keynote.  There's the chip, by the way, that's the RAM  on the same part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I just say that when a company drops their own  die shot, especially Apple, because usually you have  to wait for Chipworks to do it, when they drop their  own die shot, that's like the version of a  John Travolta strut.

Start time: 2964.78
End time: 2982.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're pretty proud.  And then Anand, they really worked hard to annotate this.  Here are the, well this is an interesting thing.  They have an eight core and a seven core GPU.  The lesser priced models have less storage and one less  core on the GPU.  Is that going to make-

Start time: 2982.32
End time: 2987.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's just for you.  Renee's explanation is perfect.  I won't even try to steal it.  Go ahead Renee.  Is it binning?

Start time: 2987.88
End time: 2988.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that why you have this?

Start time: 2990.22
End time: 3017.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the same reason why you got the A12X  before you got the A12Z is that if they just went  for the ones that had eight cores, there would be lower  yield and higher cost.  So this way they get more chips that they can use  and they can pass along those savings in a lower price.  MacBook Air.  So instead of segmenting based on clock speed,  they're not doing that.  You can buy the lowest end or the highest end,  you're getting the same clock speed per core on the CPU  and GPU.  They're just saying if you want to save some money,  you can have one with seven GPUs instead of eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3021.06
End time: 3046.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I of course got eight GPUs because I need more.  I don't even know if it makes any difference to me.  It's like cowbells.  I don't even, I need more GPU.  What is interesting is they're putting this 16 core  neural engine in every new Mac.  That's the kind of thing you get on a phone.  I'm not sure.  And they made a big deal about that machine learning  and stuff.  I don't do a lot of machine learning coding  on my Macintosh.

Start time: 3046.54
End time: 3052.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not the coding.  It's going to be the image processing.  It's going to be Pixelmator and Photoshop and Final Cut.

Start time: 3068.02
End time: 3086.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They talk a little bit about the pipelining.  It's a big pipeline, a huge pipeline.  And that can make a big difference in performance as well  as the amount of L2 cache on chip.  16 billion transistors.  I mean if you say it's an A14, okay.  But that's a third more than the A14.

Start time: 3088.62
End time: 3111.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it's got the extra cores  and then it's got the Mac specific silicon IP as well.  And it's interesting because they didn't just spend  their transistor budget on more.  They save some.  It's efficient and performant.  And Apple seems to really believe that you get performance  through efficiency.  That if you can keep that chip super efficient,  it'll perform better because it's not overheating.  It's not sucking down all the power.  And I think they're proving that out now with these designs.  Yeah.

Start time: 3114.10
End time: 3135.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about GPU?  And I'm gonna ask Alex this because I think  you're probably the one that will be most penalized by this.  No eGPU support, no discrete GPU.  How important is that to you?  And do you think that the M1 GPU is gonna be sufficient  for some of your, all of your needs?

Start time: 3135.96
End time: 3167.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not buying a, I don't buy computers expecting  to put an eGPU in it.  So I mean, so the fact that a Mac mini or one of these  can't handle eGPU, I'm not really gonna buy one of these  to expecting it to.  If I'm gonna buy one of these for the field,  I might buy one so that I can,  for me the Mac mini is going to be a really good zoom head  for bringing people into an event  where I do think the GPU is probably gonna perform better  than the previous Mac minis, which were pretty bad.  So we didn't consider.

Start time: 3167.66
End time: 3174.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intel's integrated graphics are so bad  that anything Apple does has gotta,  it's gonna look better probably.  It's better than Iris, right?  That's how much you like it.

Start time: 3174.42
End time: 3197.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, better than Iris, which is not saying much.  Yeah, so but I think that that has me interested  in the Mac mini is because I think I might actually  get better performance than what I expected.  But I don't, again, I don't buy computers expecting  to add an eGPU, so it's not really that big of a deal to me.  I, will that be an issue down the road?  I mean, I build machines sometimes  with four dedicated cards, GPU cards.

Start time: 3197.40
End time: 3203.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I presume you could use a dedicated GPU on these.  Not these, but some generation.

Start time: 3204.08
End time: 3224.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other question is that, you know,  because Apple is pushing down a lot of those pipelines,  we don't know what those other chips are gonna look like.  How many GPU, how many lanes are they going to have?  How powerful are those GPUs going to be?  And again, all of these things being integrated  without having to go out to an external bus,  without having to negotiate with external components,  you know, is gonna save a lot of time.

Start time: 3224.94
End time: 3227.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think Apple intends to eliminate the discrete GPU?

Start time: 3228.82
End time: 3248.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I mean, I think that you can put it in,  but I think that, I don't know if you'll need to  for most things.  Now, I think that on a Mac Pro,  whatever chip goes into there may allow that  because the Mac Pro is extensible.  But I think that as they look at all the other chips,  they're not going to really consider the eGPU  as an external piece.

Start time: 3248.98
End time: 3253.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just eGPU, but even an AMD card in the case.

Start time: 3253.72
End time: 3267.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think that, I don't know what the Mac Pro will do  as far as that goes, but what I will say is that  all the way up to that,  they're not gonna probably really support an eGPU  because I think that an eGPU would actually slow them down.  Yeah, because it's gotta have a bus,

Start time: 3267.44
End time: 3269.83

Start time: 3277.26
End time: 3288.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we're just gonna make better and better,  I don't wanna use integrated graphics,  but we're gonna make better and better GPUs on our chips.  And you won't need an external.  And look at their power,

Start time: 3288.90
End time: 3309.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like if you look at the power consumption of an AMD  or a Nvidia, like if you look at Ampere  or you look at Navi 2, they're 200 to 300 watt draw.  And we've never seen Apple operate  above 10 or 11 or 12 watts on an iPad.  And I don't know what they're going up to on these,  maybe 15 watts or something,  but the amount of overhead that they have to fill  before they even reach parity  with the power draw of those cards is ridiculous.

Start time: 3310.16
End time: 3346.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And also when we're talking about GPUs,  I mean, when I'm using an iPhone,  I am pushing two million polygons,  I'm doing AR tests with the iPhone  and I'm pushing two million polygons  at 30 frames a second right now  on the last generation of iPhone.  I haven't even started on the 12 yet.  And so that is an enormous amount of GPU power  already in the phone  and that's not even nearly as powerful as what we have here.  And so I think that there's gonna be a lot of power  to spare for what these machines specifically are capable of.  And then again, we don't know how many lanes in the GPU  and CPU are gonna be available for larger chips.

Start time: 3347.74
End time: 3434.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I keep telling people now,  when I first heard about it, I thought it was funny.  Then I did it and I was like,  oh, this is not funny, this actually works.  LumenFusion on the iPad to cut 4K stuff, right?  I get my basics down.  And so then I used a Final Cut XML export,  open it up in Final Cut, slap some titles on,  post to YouTube, pray I get as much views as Renee Richie.  But it amazes me until I got this 2020 iMac  like a month and a half ago,  my iPad would run circles around my 2017 27 inch iMac  with like 60 plus gigs of RAM.  So when you start building the software  that works for the chip,  running at the right clip, doing everything as it should,  it's faster than you think people.  And like you're trying to compare,  well, I can't even get 4K streams to run on my computer.  Yeah, but they just said that they did for,  what is it, 4K or 8K two streams on a air?  Are you joking?  Like, are you actually joking?  There's 8K cameras that can't play the 8K footage back.  So I think people again are wrapping their head around  what they know and I fully understand you.  I'm not claiming that you're dumb for that,  but you need to let go.  I do not call Leo by doing this anymore  or going, can I get Lincoln 8573?  No fam, stuff changes, it just changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But again, I do think that there's going to be cases  where you need to soup it up  or where you need a lot of more control.  I mean, I use Android phones for certain things  because I need them to be customized.  I have PCs for things that need to be customized  or the apps only run on a PC.  So it's not necessarily all one way or the other,  but what I will say is that the performance  is gonna be really compelling.  And again, the PC market is gonna have a really hard time  making that turn to compete with it.  And if they really bring out the Hodgman ads again,  it's gonna hurt a lot.

Yeah, and so people want that.  They're not taking away the flatbed,  they're not taking away the big bumpy tires.

I love Lightroom.  It will always be Mac fun to me.  Thank you, thank you, Kevin.  It will always be Mac fun to me.  I love Lightroom from the bottom of my soul,  but you know what I use every day nowadays?  I use Mac fun.  Because what they're doing is different and it's incredible.  And if I had to give it to somebody  who isn't as pixel peeper as me to edit a photo, they can.  Lightroom is great when you're trying to protect a job  but you don't want anybody else to be able to get in there.  But if you wanna be open and inclusive  and let more people come in  because it actually expands the industry,  for what my dad's ilk used to say about us,  hybrid shooters, now my dad, his red sits on the floor.  You know what he shoots with all the time?  His Sony A7 IV because it's better.  It's a nice camera, I gotta admit.  Your dad's got good taste.  And also at his age now, lugging the red's no fun.  Yeah.  Back in the day, the red was the-  It's probably my age.  It was the line.  It separated you from the guys who were just playing.  But if you ask him any day what he wanna shoot with  at 74, he's gonna pick up that Sony and run around.  It has a $6,000 Batis on the front  but that's a different conversation.  Or Otis, he uses Batis and Otis because he's a glass guy.  Is your dad a pro?  Yeah, that's how I got this way.  Yeah, 100%.

And while we have a station that has After Effects  and Premiere and other things,  it's mostly just for getting things in and out  of those apps.  So most of our work, most of our graphics work  is all done in motion.  Our heavy duty technical stuff is all being done in Resolve  and DaVinci Resolve.  And then the stuff that needs to be fast turns  are all done in Final Cut.  And the thing is, Resolve is a good example of,  for 300 bucks, I have an incredible amount of power.

And then you also have Final Cut, again,  that is with both Resolve and Final Cut,  you're paying 300 bucks once,  you're not paying 50 bucks a month for those things.  And so, and then for Photoshop,  while I still have a copy of Photoshop,  I spend more time in Affinity Photo  than I spend in Photoshop at this point.  So I'm slowly transitioning because I'm trying to figure out  can I do it in Affinity Photo?  And right now I can't do absolutely everything,  but the things that I can do are a lot faster.  And so, and to get back to that,  it's very responsive and very easy to use.  And so I think that we're gonna continue to see Adobe  kind of having to kind of figure that out.  Now I will say that I found it interesting  that they posted a bunch of videos about 3D,  like the introduction to 3D.  So I'm interested to see what Adobe's gonna do with that.

Transcript:  Well, and I think the other thing  we haven't talked about at all,  even within all of these things,  is the AR capabilities and what's about to happen here.  If you pop open your phone, your new Apple-  My new LIDAR device, yes.  Well, and you go, but you go,  let's say you go to the Apple USDZ examples,  just search that on Safari, Apple USDZ examples,  and you click on one of those little objects in there,  it pops out of your browser into the real world  and that LIDAR snaps it into place immediately.  Immediately, like instantly you have whatever was there  on your tabletop or on your floor.  And that is the beginning.  Imagine being able to do that.  Right now you can take those models  and put them into your Motion project.  And through Motion, you can put them into Final Cut.  Final Cut and Motion are both using a 3D engine.  And then what we haven't seen yet,  but I can't imagine not coming,  is being able to have that 3D engine,  that AR engine inside of pages and inside of keynote  and maybe even numbers.  I don't know why you would do that,  but the thing is that being able to start putting  that kind of content, that 3D content everywhere,  and then you have, by having the USDZ inside of Motion,  Final Cut, you already have tools that are able  to create content for that market.  That is a big, by the way,

It is going to be, Apple's starting to play a bunch of games  that are very hard for everyone else to play.  Even if you look at some of the stuff around Dolby Vision  and Dolby Atmos, Apple now have,  you have AirPod Pros that are using Atmos.  You have all the phones.  I mean, if there was a race for HDR, that race is done.  No one's-  I actually had-  Average consumer.

Transcript:  Well, the issue is that the problem that everybody has now  there's going to be tens of millions,  possibly hundreds of millions of people acquiring footage  in a thousand nits of brightness.  Before it was like, oh, if they had the TV,  if you lived in a hundred-nit world,  which is standard dynamic range,  if you lived in a hundred-nit world,  your whole world was kind of, there was the real world  and then there was the hundred-nit,  it was kind of dark world, but you were used to it.  The problem now is you have a phone  that is constantly showing you what the difference is  between a thousand nits and a hundred nits.  And so the people's eyes are now getting trained  to what a thousand nits looks like.  And the problem is their TV is not going to be sufficient,  their computer is not going to be sufficient,  and all of that,  and the only thing they're going to know is Vision now.  And they're not going to know what HDR 10 is  or HDR 10 plus or HLG or any of these other formats.  And so, but the reason that that's important  for manufacturers is manufacturers,  HDR 10 is mostly we don't want to pay Dolby's licensing.  So you have Dolby Vision,  is that the consumers are only going to know  what Dolby Vision is at this point,  because Apple's pushing it down the path.  And so Apple's forcing these other manufacturers  to pony up, or be seen as falling behind.  And so Apple, and then the same thing with the chip.  So Apple's forcing everybody else to play a game  that Apple plays better than they do.  And that's going to be an interesting mark  for the next decade.

But we've had, not myself,  someone in the office hours, TJ Asher has,  he has a discrete Atmos system.  So 10 speakers in his home theater.  And he put two HomePods in there  to compare them head to head.  And he said, the HomePods aren't the same,  but he was amazed at how close the HomePods got  to a discrete system because they can hear it.  They can hear the room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I think that, but to the dog's point though,  I do this all the time now.  I do this thing with my head where I go,  as soon as I pop up a video that I know is coming from,  I don't know what the platform is,  I immediately go back and forth with my head and I go,  oh, it's just stereo.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by My Good Night's Sleep.  I'll tell you, if I couldn't get a good night's sleep,  I don't know if I could do these shows.  But thank goodness I have a Casper.  Casper, you've heard of Casper,  the sleep company with outrageously comfortable products  at not so outrageous prices  from award-winning mattresses to pillows I love.  I actually have a love affair going  with my Casper king-size pillow.  It says, get off of me.  I said, no, I'm holding onto you.  The sheets, the duvets, the dog beds.  Casper's got it all.  They even have those great glow lamps.  They transform the way we sleep one snooze at a time.  Bedding, bed frames.  Here I am with my brand new Casper king.  Look, that's a king-size mattress in a pretty compact box.  It's one of the reasons I love Casper.  I mentioned this before I got it from my son  when he went away to college.  He said, dad, the mattress in this dorm is disgusting.  I said, there's help on the way.  He was on the second floor, lifted up the stairs  and replaced the mattress.  And it was so affordable.  After four years, he said,  what should I do with the mattress?  I said, leave it there for the next guy.  He deserves a good mattress.  Every Casper mattress is designed with a system  to react and adapt to your body.  Look at how it fits perfectly all night long.  You know what I'm lying on right there?  1,501 perforations.  I counted them to create a cooling system so effective  you won't even notice it, you won't be awake.  And you know, sleep and cool is really important.  Only Casper mattresses are made with 86 supportive gel pods  to align your spine and eliminate aches and pains.  It does something remarkable.  It gives where it needs to give  and it supports where it needs to support.  That's what you want.  The two combined seem like contradictory,  but really they're quite good.  It's the cooling, supportive comfort you need  for the most refreshed feeling come morning.  Even Samantha, our cat, loves Casper.  Actually, both cats were on the Casper this morning.  With over 20,000 reviews, an average of 4.8 stars  across Casper, Amazon, and Google, Casper is rapidly  becoming the internet's favorite mattress.  And the best thing is you don't have to try the mattress  in the mattress store with a salesperson staring at you,  giving them the stink eye  because you spent three extra minutes.  No, you get 100 nights, 100 nights risk-free.  That's their sleep on it trial.  Anytime in that 100 nights, if you say it's not for me,  you call them up, they come, they take it away.  You don't have to put it back in the box, don't worry.  And they'll refund you every penny.  Casper offers free shipping and painless returns  to the US and Canada.  And now with 0% APR financing options,  it's even easier to try a Casper mattress.  Wouldn't this be a nice surprise for your loved ones?  Honey, honey, go lie down, see how you feel.  Go to casper.com slash twit1,  use the code twit1, twit1, T-W-I-T number one,  for $100 off select mattresses.  Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash twit100  dollars off select mattresses.

You're gonna love your Casper.  Get it for the winter and enjoy it through the summer.  Casper.com slash twit1.  Thank you Casper.  Thank you Casper for supporting the podcasts all year long.  Patrick Wardle, who is one of my favorite security,  Apple security guys, he works at Jamf.  But he's also the creator of some great software  at objective-c.com.  Tweeted, this is true, tears pouring out of the sad face.  Previously a comprehensive macOS firewall  could be implemented via a kernel extension.  That was then, this is now under Big Sur.  Apple has deprecated kexts giving us network extensions,  but apparently many of their apps and daemons  bypass the filtering mechanism.  This goes along with news after Big Sur came out  that anytime you open a program,  Apple checks with their certificate server,  OS OCSP server, to see if the developer certificate's  legit and if it's been notarized.  And because so many people were downloading Big Sur,  it seems to have affected the OCSP server.  Everything slowed to a crawl.  It's designed to fail open.  So if you're not online, you won't even know.  Or if you block it with Patrick's Lulu or Little Snitch,  you won't even know because it says,  I can't get the certificate so I'm not gonna bother.  But if it's slow, it keeps trying.  And your software, now I have to say,  I read about this on Thursday.  I didn't notice it.  I asked my wife, is your Mac slow?  I didn't notice it.  Any of you guys noticed the slowdown on Thursday?  No. No.

Transcript:  I think it was geo.  So this is interesting to me on two ways.  One is I think there was an architectural failure  in the way that it was designed.  Because like you said, if it didn't get a response  from the internet, it would just fail, like, safe.  Like you would just keep going.  But if it got through but didn't get a response,  maybe it thought there was some sort of chicanery,  like malware was trying to stop it from communicating  and it would fail secure.  But that should have been something  that was architected into it.  But I disliked the reporting on this so much.  It was one of those classic examples  of my mom watching BBC and CNN  and my YouTube comments filling up  with Apple is spying on us.

Start time: 4623.10
End time: 4633.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It said things like every time you launch an app,  Apple gets a hash of the app's name  and your geo location, time and date.  And that is not true.  And it was-

Start time: 4633.94
End time: 4635.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and Apple doesn't retain any of that data anyway.

Start time: 4636.46
End time: 4677.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, whether Apple retains it or not,  we have to trust Apple that they don't retain it.  Maybe I trust Apple, but whether they retain it or not,  and by the way, Microsoft pretty much does do that  and even admits that they do that.  Apple's doing it for security reasons.  This is part of system integrity protection and gatekeeper.  But-  And anti-malware system as well.  And it doesn't do it all the time.  It does it the first,  periodically we'll check the developer certificate.  It doesn't necessarily know what you launched  because all Adobe apps have the same developer certificate,  but many apps can be identified  by the developer certificate.  So Apple is getting some information.

Start time: 4679.10
End time: 4693.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's not tied to you.  Like my understanding is that it's very similar  to how their other operations work  where there is a unique, but time-limited hash  that lets it know that these things are happening together.  But again, they say they don't retain it.  They say it could be tied to you.

Start time: 4693.86
End time: 4722.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got the IP address.  By the way, it's not sent.  And this is the other problem.  It can't be sent encrypted  because the OCSP server also does this certificate approval  for HTTPS.  So you would have an endless loop  if you send it encrypted.  So it has to send it over HTTP.  And that also raises the issue  that it's not just Apple that may be seeing this.  Your ISP will see this traffic.  Anybody in between you and Apple will see this traffic.  So maybe Apple's not malicious with it,  but this traffic is being sent out.

Start time: 4723.00
End time: 4745.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that should be better architected.  The other part about the little snitch and stuff,  like again, like if you look at this  through the lens of appliance computing,  I spoke to a bunch of people about this and they're like,  if I'm serious about the security,  I'm not running anything on my Mac.  I'm running this at the router level  because I have 800 different devices in my house  and I'm not just blocking one MacBook Air.  I'm blocking this stuff from everything in the house.  And the only way to do that is a router.

Start time: 4745.86
End time: 4751.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, if you were paranoid about like,  for most people, like as much as we like to believe  that we are a hard target for everyone out there  on the internet, most people could care less  what we had for breakfast.  But if you do, if you have a reason to believe,  like if you were, if you believe,  we had this discussion with Dave Nanean of SuperDuper.  He really opened my eyes on this.  He's like, do not encrypt your backup drive.  And I'm like, but why encryption is good.  And he's like, no, nobody cares about your kids' photos,  but you, and once you encrypt that,  if anything happens to it, those photos are lost forever.  For your personal, private, highly mobile data,  encrypt that completely.  For like stuff that's super,  like for stuff that would cause a divorce,  if you ever lost it, make sure that that is kept  in a way that you can recover it.  And this is similar, like there are certain things  that for people like anti-malware is more important  for the vast majority of people.  If you are the person for whom zero knowledge  is critically important,  you should be doing this on the router.

End time: 4837.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 4857.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm guessing if you're that high,  like so yes, if you're really dumb,  like if you're dumb paranoid, don't do this.  But if you're really smart,  you're engaging in best practices  and malware is not your issue.  Like there are some people for whom their data being stolen  is far more of a worry than their data being lost.  If being lost is far more of a worry,  use every commercially available,  like run it like an appliance.  If being stolen...

Transcript:  And the other thing is that the last couple of months  I had to really think about security for our computers.  And it really became a,  because we were in a position where we were possibly  targets of state actors.  And so the issue is,  is that you get into this situation  where if you're really gonna be serious about it,  like if you're actually interesting,  you need to,  our computers were completely separated  from all the other computers.  They weren't allowed to talk to the outside world.  They were, unless they had to.  And when they did, they went through,  there was all these rigorous,  the way that the passwords work  and the way that you access things  and what you install  and all these things become something  that every single piece,  if you're not gonna do all of those things,  you're leaving gaping holes open.  And the only reason most of us don't get hacked  is because we're not interesting.  So to Renee's point,  is that generally we are,  one thing I got became very clear over the last six months  is that in general,  most of us live in a pretty wide open space.  And so there's a couple of things to do there.  One is to be relatively knowledgeable  about what you're downloading.  Another thing is to,  it's taking those basic,  financial theft is something  that you're probably more apt to be in trouble for.  And also I would say,  don't be interesting.  Like don't do, don't go to websites that aren't.  The thing is online is that,  I used to be very, very like,  how do I stay off the grid  and how do I stay disconnected and everything else?  And I learned that the best thing to do  is just not do anything online that I can't back up.  Because it's just,  when you look at all these things,  people start to feel like they're secure.  You're not secure.  You're not secure online.  If someone wants to,  you're not secure online.  As soon as you go out there,  you're not, it's the wild, wild west.  And so you just have to kind of think about  what you're doing and what you're connecting to  and make sure that you're doing things  that are defensible.

Transcript:  So let's talk a little bit about the change in,  this is Patrick Wardle's tweeting and all that,  the change in how firewalls work,  little snitch still works,  Lulu still works.  I have Lulu running on my big Sir Mac,  but apparently it's not as effective as it used to be  because it's not a kernel extension.  It's in user land now, yeah.  It's in user land.  So A, Apple can bypass it.  And then Patrick says, if Apple can bypass it,  then there is always the theoretical possibility  that malware or bad actors could bypass it as well.

Start time: 5014.22

Transcript:  Actually, big Sir, which I'm not,  the biggest thing people will notice  is the cosmetic changes, which I'm not a fan of.  I find it hard to read the menu now.  It's just, everything is, although text is thin  and the colors are pastel and it's just not as good,  but that's fine.  I'll get used to it.  But there is this big shift that is probably good  for security in Apple's new Mac OS 11.  And they started this in Catalina.  You probably noticed it if you ever looked at your disk  with a disk util, you've got two volumes now.  You've got a read-only system volume  and you've got everything else and they're separated.  And actually more and more we're running into problems  with anytime you run a program,  this program needs access to your document folder.  What, you mean I have to give it permission?  Yes, you do.  Suddenly there's all of these permissions that are involved.  Probably we should learn not to give full disk access  to every app that asks for it, I suppose.  But that's-

Start time: 5097.86
End time: 5161.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've really gotten granular.  And now this read-only system partition  is signed by Apple and can only be signed by Apple.  So one of the first things I wanted to do  with Big Sur is a clean install.  Forget it, Leo.  You're not going to get to do it.  You have to turn off, in order to boot to a USB key,  there's all of these processes you have to go through.  I ended up just saying, okay, fine.  And it is in effect a clean install  because this read-only partition is replaced  with another read-only partition.  Only Apple can sign it, which also means you'll no longer  be able to make bootable backups because it won't boot,  because it's not signed by Apple.  The workaround, according to Mike Bombach,  is to make a backup if you're just going to install  Big Sur onto the backup.  And that'll make it bootable because Apple will sign it  when you install Big Sur onto it.  So there are some big shifts  in the underlying security model, big shifts.  Probably, again, for the best,  but it's the appliance model.  For consumers, for consumer electronics, it's for the best.

Start time: 5164.82
End time: 5206.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's this layer that you always have to be careful of  is that when you turn the security up too high,  people stop using it because it's difficult.  And so that's always going to be,  some people are going to try to opt out of things  or get laissez-faire about opting out of things  because they don't want to deal with that.  So it's always a matter.  And I think what Apple's doing a lot of times  is by embedding it all into that process,  that they're kind of doing it for you.  And again, the average person is going to be,  not going to care and they're probably better off with it  if you're a geek, then it may be more of a problem  if you really want to dive in.

Transcript:  Jeffrey.  As long as it doesn't slow down performance,  I don't think people should just get  bent all out of shape over it.  I mean, yes, we are starting to miss some of that granularity  and some of that control,  but we're also getting past stages where you need that.  Now I got it.  If you're not on Wi-Fi rebooting  when you don't have an internet connection  with modern devices, it's a pain in the butt,  but as long as you have a connection,  it rebuilds itself using the recovery server.  So you don't really need that bootable USB anymore.  Although in the very beginning,  I screwed up this brand new computer out of the box,  trying to do a time machine backup, which I never do,  but I was lazy and it did not like that,  the switch to Catalina with the two volumes, the container.  But luckily, because I have a Docker based server  in the back and I know how Dockers work,  I just had to think of it like a Docker.

Transcript:  So that actually is another issue  that we will probably bite people.  I think what Apple's doing though  is probably gonna be for the best,  but there's gonna be some bumps.  If you're using time machine, for instance,  time machine will now use APFS,  but in order to do that,  you have to turn off time machine,  erase the hard drive and turn it back on,  reformat the hard drive APFS and turn it back on.  But at that point, time machine is actually  what it should have been all along, a real snapshot thing  instead of a bunch of hard SIM links and weird folders.  So there's gonna be a bump,  a bunch of bumps along the way, I think.

Did you notice the world?  Richard Stallman predicted in 1997,  the one Cory Doctorow also warned us about  and he's talking about how Mac OS,  you know, basically has a mind of as a life of its own.  He overstated what was going on.  This is one of the blog posts that said more information  is being sent to Apple.

Start time: 5365.72
End time: 5382.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I guess the question the question is,  is that does he do the users that buy it care?  No.  I just don't think that they, you know,  I think that that's the issue is that they don't,  you know, they're just they're fine with it.  I mean in the same way that people are fine.  People use Facebook.  I mean Facebook is just constantly pushing up information.  Or they use Chromebooks.

Transcript:  In fact, that's why I recommend the Chromebook.  It's a signed, you know, booter.  You can't modify the operating system  without the Chromebook saying,  hey, you've been hacked.  You can power wash it.  Yeah, it's completely an appliance.  I guess the problem is a little disconnect  because a lot of Mac users started using a Mac.  Yes.  Because it was a Unix machine, you know,  it wasn't an appliance very much.  So I don't think it's bad that it's an appliance now,  but it is something to be aware of, I guess.  Let's take another little break.  Now we can stop talking about Apple.

And then Nealey Patel and Matthew Panzerino  and a couple others said there's a big difference.  And it turned out that people with kids and pets  were trying to photograph their kids and pets  and people without them were photographing  like their computers.

Transcript:  It's like, no, no, no.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I want to tell you about the only credit card I use if I shop online.  The only one.  It's aptly named privacy privacy dot com.  This is going to be a big online shopping holiday season, right?  We're all staying home, shopping online, not just shopping online, donating to charities, supporting small businesses.  But you really want to do that safely.  You protect your financial life online with privacy privacy dot com slash twit.  It lets you generate unique credit cards every time you shop.  There are two things you can do.  You can have it a one time use credit card.  Boom.  It's done.  You use that credit card.  It's done.  It looks just like a regular mastercard or Visa card to the merchant, except they don't get any of your information.  I like that, too.  And boom, it can never be used again.  Or you can make a credit card that's tied to the merchant.  So I have an Amazon privacy card.  I have a privacy card for my Comcast subscription for any time I shop online for all the cases and so forth.  Privacy dot com.  What's great about this, I also use it to sign up for subscriptions.  You know how that is when you sign up for a subscription and then you forget to renew it and years later you go, why am I paying five bucks a month for this?  Well, with privacy dot com, you can just pause that credit card any time and that's it.  It's over.  You'll never be accidentally billed twice upgraded to another service without your consent.  You can set spending limits per month, per year, per charge.  You'll also anytime somebody uses your card at a different merchant, you'll immediately get notifications.  You can see all the declined uses and you'll immediately know how somebody's got that card and start using a new one.  If you just pause your privacy card, they'll block the charges anytime you don't want to use that card anymore or you can delete the card.  You can create a merchant or a single use card.  Easy to do.  There's a privacy Chrome extension.  There's I use the Firefox extension.  It will automatically fill out the credit card information for you, including number, the security, three digit or four digit security code.  It's also got built in sharing.  So for instance, I like to buy my mom dinner.  So I send her a card using privacy straight from the dashboard and just a few clicks, no copy, no paste, no screenshots.  She doesn't have a privacy account.  She doesn't need one.  It's a regular credit card and say, Mom, dinner's on me tonight.  Beautiful.  It's easy to track how much you've been spending with their account summary feature.  You can create custom tags so you can completely organize this.  It's just the best, safest way to make purchases online.  Ties to your US checking account or your debit card.  I should mention that it's not a charge card.  You're going to it's going to the money is immediately withdrawn.  But, you know, you shouldn't probably be using charge cards because the interest rates are so high.  This this is just like using a debit card.  You can have a limit, though, on it.  You can assign it to a merchant.  You could say it's only can be used once.  And that's a beautiful thing.  They have a variety of account levels.  I get one percent cash back more than payable.  I get one percent cash back more than pays for the pro card level that I've used.  To me, this is just the way you should be shopping online.  Privacy dot com slash twip.  Sign up for an account.  If you are a business, they have a card issuing API you can use.  They have a business size card you can give to your employees, that kind of thing.  And incidentally, just to encourage you to use that special address, you'll get five dollars to spend on your first purchase.  But you have to go to privacy dot com slash twit.  That way they know you saw it here.  You get the five dollars and we get the you know, they take the pat on the head.  Thank you. You did good to it.  Privacy dot com slash twit.  I could not recommend this more highly.  I've been using it for years and it's I just feel safer shopping online using it.  All my all my holiday shopping will be done with privacy dot com.  On we go with the show.  This is a big story that Google kind of dropped on people this week.  And I think there's some upset.  If you were using Google Photos because of their unlimited storage, it's over.  Starting in June, Google will count that storage against your Google Drive storage.  No more free unlimited storage.  We used to tell people with iPhones, I get calls all the time from people saying, oh, my phone's full.  I need a new phone.  No, put put Google Photos on there.  It uploads all your photos and it even has a button that says delete the photos that are backed up and it saves space on your phone.  But now it's the same as iCloud.  You're going to pay for the storage that you're using.

If you had a Pixel phone back in the day, you'd get unlimited original storage.  Anything you've got stored there is going to stay there.

Transcript:  Willa Ramis writing on Medium at 1-0 says this is Google's anti-competitive behavior.  I don't think I agree with this, but he said Google Photos crushed a lot of other photo storage servers services on the way to the top because they were free.  So they put them out of business and now they're going to charge.  I guess that is kind of classic anti-competitive behavior.  I don't even remember ever picks or loom or picture life, but he says those startups basically could not compete against free.  One billion people use Google Photos.  And I guess once you have all those photos there, you're kind of duty bound to keep using it.  Amazon still offers unlimited free original storage.  If you're an Amazon Prime member, sites like Shutterfly that do photo printing will let you store unlimited photos there as well.  So there are still some competitors.  But do you think this is anti-competitive of Google that this is as Willa Ramis says, Google just made the case for breaking up big tech?

Transcript:  I don't. I have to admit, I don't think that there was a big conspiracy with Google.  I think they just realized they're not that organized kids.  Yeah, they're they're they're they're they're like, wow, we're spending a lot of money on storage, you know, and there's a lot of you know, there's a lot of energy being consumed to do 28.  What is it? 28 billion photos a week or something like that.  Yeah.  It's so at some point you do have to.  And again, the stuff that's been there for two years that you haven't touched that you're not paying for starts that really add up to a lot of storage and a lot of power and a lot of other things.  And so, you know, I while I could be theoretically upset if stuff disappeared, I don't.  It's not going to though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, the funny part about this, I think that no one wants to wrap their head around the reason why you're upset.  Let's get let's be honest. I like to be honest.  OK, the reason why you're upset is because Google wants to take away, let's just say, two terabytes of your photos because you store them there for free because you didn't want to buy a hard drive for you to store them at your house.  So you're mad that someone else is going to stop paying for your story.  Yeah.  That's a good terabyte drive is 50 bucks at Costco right now.  I was there yesterday. Go get it.  Press download. Get it all.  And then start again. Like take what's up there on their off and then put the new stuff.  You got 15 gigs. But I mean, yeah, you're complaining because you're mad.

I have to admit, I don't want things for free because I want to know that they're going to last.  But you were paying for it. I have a better sense that they're going to actually be there next week as opposed to if it's free.  It's just a draw on resources. Eventually, something's going to happen.

Transcript:  But I think the worst and they're free customers typically like I had a paid Google account for a while.  We got features later. It didn't work well.  They would cause problems with new Android devices when you logged on with your paid account versus your free account.  It's a really freezing Google has turned out to be a really interesting thing because it's enabled access to services that a lot of people financially just wouldn't or couldn't afford.  But the capriciousness with which Google annihilates those services, I think, is something you always have to remember before you go in.  Like go in with your eyes wide open. Take advantage of it. Never depend on it.

Contending.  I don't know what to think of this.  That Google.  Why you Google is using Android users limited cellular data allowances without permission to transmit information about those individuals that's unrelated to their use of Google services.  260 megabytes a month via cellular data when the phones are not even in use.  I don't know yet what that data is or why it's being sent.  Of course, you agree to it.  I'm sure somewhere in the fine print and all of that.  Eight point eight megabytes of day a day of data.  Is that a problem?  I mean, I guess it is if you're if you have a very small cap.

I think eventually it'll become more and more like you're paying with your data.  And for some people, you know, especially if it's costing you cellular or it's costing you some otherwise, you might decide they should actually pay for that data.  And rather than just charge you for it, it's probably telemetry or something.  Google.  Google feeds its machine.  They are letting you use Google services inexpensively or freely because they are using all that data to make Google better.  Right. And that's sort of the bargain that you're signing up for.

Cyprus is one of a number of countries doing this, allowing you to effectively buy citizenship,  skirting residency requirements, just, you know, give us a little money.  Eric did it not only for himself, but his family.  So they're all doesn't mean I don't know.  Do you have to give up your US citizenship if you become a citizen of Cyprus?

Transcript:  I feel so weird about this.  I feel like this is YouTube sort of copping out on one sense because 2020 has not been like YouTube rewind was originally a way to sort of celebrate YouTube.  And eventually it became a way to sell YouTube to advertisers.  And it became increasingly separate from what the platform actually was and sort of cringy for the people who were involved with it, culminating in I think one of the most disliked videos in the history of YouTube.  Was that last year or the year before?  I think it was the year before.  Last year, they went back to the top 10 list.  They did basically the watch mojo thing.  But it feels like there's been a lot of people struggling really hard on YouTube and they could tell that story and they maybe because it's not an advertiser friendly story.  They're just abdicating it completely.

Yeah. EU is really cranky about what they don't like it if you're a store.  What's going on?  What's going on? We're looking at space.  Was that the deed that was at the main engine shutdown?  John's my space expert.  We're nine minutes into the launch.  Oh, oh, oh, that was I love it when they do that.  That was the recovery of the rocket landing on the platform.  That's what that was.  I love it. Watching a miracle every time.  Every time. Only one of them this time, John.  Only one recovered.  All right. There was only one.  You only needed one, huh?  All right.  YouTube. I'm sorry, YouTube.  European Union and YouTube.  I confuse them all the time.  The EU has unveiled formal antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in online shopping.  They've also opened a second investigation into the company's business practices.  The investigation for the first part started last year to probe its dual role as a marketplace  and retailer.  The concern is that Amazon uses information it gains from being a marketplace for third parties to create its own competing products.  The investigation found Amazon feeds nonpublic seller data such as number of products ordered and selling or revenue into its own retail algorithms to help decide which new products to launch and the price of each new author.  Kind of like what grocery stores probably do when they-  With house brands.  With house brands, right?  It is, but at a whole different scale.

Start time: 7641.23
End time: 7712.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah.  So everything Amazon does is-  Whole different scale.  Whole different scale.  And I think that that is the- I don't know how you solve this problem.  I mean, I do think that Amazon's in a very- it's obviously a very advantageous position for them to be in, but I think that it is starting to get to a point where people need to look at it at least.  And as you know, I don't usually say that, but it is starting to get to a point where as a retailer, as someone who's coming up with a new product, how do you come up with that new product without just being run over?  As soon as you start being successful, they're going to take it away.  And that's the- so I think that that's a really interesting problem that I don't have a solution for, but it's complicated.  Because it doesn't necessarily hurt the consumer directly.  The consumer will pay the same or less for something of equal- but does it stifle innovation because people can't?  Because I know for me, the moment someone says there's a product, I immediately want to go to- I immediately just see, is it on Amazon?  Because I don't want to put in a new credit card.  I don't want to go through the signup process.  I want to just go to Amazon and have it shipped to me.

Start time: 7713.91
End time: 7776.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For you in two days.  Yep.  Yep.  The part that gets crazy is when- because the common question, Alex, is is it stifling technology or innovation, as you put it?  Or there's many products out there that are very good that don't exist on Amazon, but they still sell lots of, right?  For instance, Rode doesn't sell on Amazon.  You can buy Rode stuff there because people resell it.  Other people sell it.  But you can't go to Amazon and buy a PodMic or a Rodecaster Pro or direct from Rode.  Rode is now one of the top microphone companies in the game.  So like, how do you say that Amazon did take a very similar S-Mic and made an Amazon basic version, but nobody on YouTube wants the Amazon basic one.  Everybody wants the Rode PodMic.  You can't get one.  So like, I get it.  And they're normally talking about like nuts and like, you know, hats and socks and things like that.  But I don't know.  Walmart's been doing it.

Start time: 7776.60
End time: 7856.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think this gets back into- I mean, to your point, what's important for a lot of retailers or anyone making something is your brand.  And it's how many people trust that brand.  The reason that Rode can still sell these things outside of Amazon and Amazon can even copy it and doesn't matter is because Rode has built a level of trust with their users.  With the public in the same way that, you know, whether it's Blackmagic or Sony or other people, we have some level of trust that that's going to be a certain thing.  So Rode has benefited from that.  But, you know, you look at in a lot of ways, you know, if I'm buying a- if I come up with something that's remotely interesting, you know, whether it's Amazon or, you know, Chinese manufacturers, you end up with a- you know, it's hard to get something out there that isn't- that's simple.  That might be ingenuity, you know, it might have some ingenuity, but might not be patented.  It's hard to, you know, make that work.  And so I think Amazon is kind of this giant snake that's kind of just grabbing onto all those things.  And again, as individual users, I don't think that we necessarily are impacted by it.  But I do think that I know that when we've worked with, you know, large information companies, we've got a lot of innovations that we want to do that we're very careful not to show them.  Because we're just like, well, that'll be it.  You know, like that, you know, they'll just take it away and they'll run off with it.

They had Singles Day was 1111, was four days ago.  $56 billion in sales in one day.  In one day, they're spreading it out.  Now it's going to continue for well, started November 1st, I guess it ended November 12th.  Gross merchandise value surpassed $56.42 billion as of Wednesday.  That's not a final figure.  So I think you've got two mammoths.  You've got one in the East, one in the West.  It's going to be very interesting to see at some point they're going to come head to head.  Right. That's going to be the next world war.  It's not going to be between nations.  It's between online shopping giants.  Tick tock. We mentioned the tick tock was saying, hey, hey, what up?  What's going on?  Are you going to still shut us down?  They did get an extension.  Cepheus responded saying you may now have till November 27th.  It's complicated though, because a judge stated so I don't know what's exactly going on.  Cepheus, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US said you have till the 27th to divest.  Is Oracle going to buy it? I don't even know.  Oracle and Walmart, right?  And Walmart. I don't even know.  Tick tock was saying, hey, we haven't heard from anybody.  Commerce Department says it cannot, thanks to the court order, shut down tick tock.  They were going to ban companies from providing internet hosting or services for the app.  But the judge, Wendy Betelstone, my favorite judge in Philadelphia said the lawsuit was brought by three tick tock stars.  Comedian Douglas Marlin, fashion guru, cassette renab and musician Alex Chambers.  They said, Your Honor, you shut down tick tock, you shut down all my income.  And the judge said, yeah, that would be bad.  So the judge stated the tick tock is petitioned for the divestiture order to be invalidated.  You know, there was then there was an election.

And it was, you know, and it does kind of lean towards the capriciousness of the current political atmosphere that we're going to go down some crazy path for no real reason.

They talk the story a lot because at the end of the day, they're losing eyeball time to the burgeoning media is if you would call them.  And if you remember, say what circa 2000, I want to say three when Viacom just wanted to I'm sorry, I take that back.  Back 2007 when Viacom wanted to blow up YouTube and there was all these fights and stuff.  And then they went to a room and they shook hands and they shook it out.  And all of a sudden, lots of Viacom shows had YouTube channels that got millions and millions of views.  And they still exist to this day. So like initially you were the threat.  And then they figured out how they could use you.  So they put the lawsuit away, worked it into let's make it work to our benefit as well.  And then now it's normal. Right.
