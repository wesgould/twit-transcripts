That's the way I see it.  John C. Dvorak over here to my right. OMG. Nice to see you again, John.  It has been a while. Was glad to have you back. Good to be here, Leo.  Also from Giga. Oh man, points north in his cabin by the lake. Matthew Igram. Good to have you.  I'm a curmudgeon actually. You're now going to earn a title as a curmudgeon because of your... well, we'll talk about it.

Start time: 170.14
End time: 175.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What? I'm not a curmudgeon. I don't want video in my Instagram, says Matthew Igram.

Start time: 175.08
End time: 184.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Okay.  Also here, a first timer from Engadget, in charge of mobile devices at Engadget. I don't know if you're in charge.

Start time: 185.18
End time: 192.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't say I'm in charge. Responsible for. I don't really know what I'm in charge of.  Great to have you, Miriam. Hi, thanks for having me, Leo.

Start time: 195.00
End time: 243.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  First time. You've been on Twitter before on TNT, but first time on the big shoe. So thank you. That's correct. Thanks for having me.  I ran into Miriam at Google I.O. and she said, I want to be on Twitter. And I said, okay. Ta-da. Ta-da.  Look how fast that happened.  Do you see what I got here? Now this is actually a call back to last week's Twitter. Somebody, some anonymous person sent me two, not one, but two copies of the ET game cartridge from Atari.  Widely agreed. Film Girl agreed. The worst video game of all time.  Oh, right.  And in fact, so bad, they had, Atari had to write it in five weeks because they wanted to coincide with the release of the movie ET. And they had very little time.  Yeah. So it was, you know, bad in that respect. In fact, so bad that it's rumored, it's legend that Microsoft  plowed it under in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

Start time: 244.28
End time: 253.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft, you mean Atari? Did I say Microsoft? Atari. Yeah.  Yeah. There's a bunch of stuff that's been plowed under. People dig them up every once in a while.

Start time: 254.00
End time: 264.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's a Canadian film crew, which has got permission for the city of Alamogordo to, in honor of the 30th anniversary of the game, to dig it up, to see if it really is there.  To see if it really is there. Because no one knows if it's an urban legend or.  It probably is.

Start time: 269.20
End time: 269.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a

Start time: 274.52
End time: 288.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wasn't involved with it, but I knew about this. There was a bunch of B and G wine in the 70s that was thrown into a tons of it.  No, there was too much in the market and they wanted to.  It's like that. It's like being depressed. Yeah. It was like Roosevelt when he dumped the milk.

Start time: 289.88
End time: 293.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't hear about that one either. Were you around for that? Yes, I was. As a matter of fact, I missed that. I was against it.

Start time: 296.39
End time: 298.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or the tea in the harbor. Were you around for that too, John?

Start time: 298.88
End time: 321.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tea in the harbor, he was definitely there for. He was the one in the Indian suit.  I was just a kid. I was a little kid.  I guess the reasoning for this was, Atari was already having trouble with the quality of video games. They were letting third parties make video games.  Oh no. And the quality was so bad and they said we cannot let this one out. And so they buried them.  So you have two of the few copies left. They're selling for $260 on eBay. I don't know whoever. What?  Because it's legendary. I'm surprised it's not $2,600.

Start time: 325.46
End time: 329.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what I can get. Oh, I like it. It's very funny. I wonder what I can get from my book and disk of Apple Basic.

Start time: 337.46
End time: 361.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it buried in a landfill in Alamogordo? It was never released. Really? Oh, Apple Basic. Yeah, Apple Basic.  I had Apple Basic on my BBS. This is a sad story. Microsoft, which of course kind of owned Basic,  was really miffed that Apple wrote this beautiful Basic. It seemed to be a good Basic at the time.  It was gorgeous. I had a copy. And the story, and you maybe can confirm it, the rumor goes that Microsoft went to Apple and paid them big bucks to suppress it.

Start time: 365.58
End time: 376.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not my understanding. What happened? My understanding is that they threatened them that they're not going to release Office or any other Microsoft products if they release that.  We'll pull out of the platform if they release it. That may be more accurate. They're cheap. That makes more sense.

Start time: 378.10
End time: 392.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because there was a not so good Basic for Macintosh, but Microsoft had no taste at the time. Well, what can I say?  I had a copy of that Mac Basic. It was amazing. We put a pirated copy up on my BBS. Oh, you did. That Apple II BBS that you used? No, it was a Mac BBS.

Start time: 392.92
End time: 429.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought it was an Apple II BBS. No, you did. Anyway, enough history. Let's talk about this week's tech news.  Be careful installing it because you have to reinstall everything. I have a sandbox machine that I put all that stuff on. That's probably a good idea. Although you can download it now.

Start time: 435.92
End time: 475.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some nice, I don't know, nice, definitely step back and some improvements in the sense that you can boot to desktop now.  That there is a window button, a start button, which doesn't open a start menu, puts you back into the tiled Metro start menu.  You can set it up, you can configure it with a couple of presses of the button so that the start button puts you to what is close to a menu. Alex Gumpel showed us.  I should have probably loaded this thing. There it is. It gives you this list of apps instead of this. It doesn't look very good.  It's not what people want. No comment from any of you, huh? I think Classic Shell is still the way to go.

Start time: 476.74
End time: 485.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. I was going to say Classic Shell solves all this. I don't really see what the point is of even bothering from Microsoft at this point since they dug themselves into a hole in the first place.

Start time: 486.74
End time: 493.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't think they should try to get out of the hole? Well yeah, but they're obviously doing a half-assed job at it, right? Yeah, half-assed is nothing. They're digging the wrong way.

Start time: 495.00
End time: 498.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. Thank you, John. They're going down. I'm waiting on 8.2.

Start time: 501.32
End time: 514.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's going to be the good one. They also built Skype-in, so no Windows Messenger anymore, of course.  But Skype, which Microsoft has wanted people to use as their default messenger, is now part of all installs of Windows. That's interesting.

Start time: 516.56
End time: 522.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's not that interesting. Apparently not. God, this is getting off my... It's going right off the track right away.

Start time: 524.46
End time: 527.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I started off with ET. Should I have started something more current? Well, that was a little dated.

Start time: 530.40
End time: 535.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think everyone's jealous that you have these things because I don't know anyone who owns those. I don't even have a 2600. I can't play it.

Start time: 538.46
End time: 547.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just saying that I was at Build and the keynote, they showed how you could answer a Skype call now when you're basically on the lock screen of your Windows 8 machine.

Start time: 548.34
End time: 617.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does Skype by default start up automatically when you start Windows? I presume so.  How do you pull that? You probably could turn that off. I hope so.  You're all on Skype, and we all like Skype, but I just feel like... I don't know.  Isn't this exactly what Microsoft got in trouble with in the last century for bundling Internet Explorer?  What's their competition, though, Skypes? There's lots of competition. It's not very well known compared to Skype.  What? What's really a competition? Oovoo. What? Excuse me? Tango. Oovoo. There's quite a few, especially on the mobile side.  Have you ever thought of using anything besides Skype for this show? We've tried everything. WebRTC. Google's got a solution that is browser-based.  Google Hangouts. You've tried that? There's competition. FaceTime from Apple.  There's competition. I wonder if we're going to get into a little trouble.  Well, you said so-what about Internet Explorer in 1998. I never did that.  It didn't bother you that Microsoft bundled the browser?

Start time: 618.84
End time: 621.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me that Microsoft bundles anything. It's their business.

Start time: 622.90
End time: 625.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's the point. The Department of Justice got them in a bit of trouble.

Start time: 626.66
End time: 642.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were abusing the privilege. That's the problem. They were going to schools and forcing them to use Internet Explorer.  They were abusing their monopoly position. That's why they got in trouble. Not because they had it as a bundle. They were abusing it. They're abusive. Can I say that again?

Start time: 643.76
End time: 644.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you said it.

Start time: 646.36
End time: 648.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay. All right. Moving right along.

Start time: 649.66
End time: 651.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do they like Windows 8 in Canada, Matthew?

Start time: 655.03
End time: 658.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know anybody that uses it. I don't know anybody that was waiting for it.

Start time: 659.48
End time: 661.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a Canadian answer. I don't know why.

Start time: 663.53
End time: 665.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Miriam, are you Canadian or you have a French accent?

Start time: 666.48
End time: 671.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have both citizenships from France and from Canada.  Wow. That's as French as you can get.

Start time: 675.50
End time: 676.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So how do they like it in France?

Start time: 678.50
End time: 680.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we should talk about something else.

Start time: 681.54
End time: 682.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I'll drop it.

Start time: 683.42
End time: 690.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody cares yet.  This is so pathetic that Microsoft products have become no use. We can't even talk about them.

Start time: 691.92
End time: 696.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Miriam, you were at Build. Tell me what else of interest happened at Build.

Start time: 697.42
End time: 727.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For me, focusing on mobile, they launched a couple of new phones for Sprint. Sprint finally has Windows phone devices. They're not on the market yet.  Big celebration.  They announced them and they're bespoke to Sprint, which is interesting. They're evolutions of existing products.  You have the HTC 8XT, which is an evolution of the HTC 8X.  And then I think the Samsung ATIV NEO, I believe, was called. It's like an evolution of the ATIV S.  So I mean, nothing too spectacular here or anything.

Start time: 728.12
End time: 730.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the 8X a lot for a Windows phone.

Start time: 731.22
End time: 734.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  8X is fantastic. So they added the boomsound, the dual speaker setup to it.

Start time: 734.98
End time: 739.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This looks a little like they took the HTC, because it's got an aluminum unibody, right? It's kind of like they took a little bit from the HTC One.

Start time: 741.34
End time: 746.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen it and I don't think it's aluminum. I think it's still the same kind of polycarb soft touch finish.

Start time: 747.94
End time: 749.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it does have the front facing dual speakers.

Start time: 750.94
End time: 761.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the latest in the BlackBerry technology?  The Q10 is out. Are you excited? Keyboards are here, baby.  Yeah. It's about time. It's a wonder when someone's going to do that.

Start time: 762.76
End time: 793.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  BlackBerry had a brief moment in the sun last week when some analysts said, get ready, BlackBerry's going to surprise you all with great quarterly results.  And then the results came out.  And they tanked the stock.  It's almost worse than downplaying it and having a better result to say, oh no, you're going to be surprised.  Oh no, you're not going to be surprised. It's terrible.  What does BlackBerry do? Some have said maybe they should go in the server business and just forget phones entirely.

Start time: 795.66
End time: 823.63

Transcript:  I think that actually might not be a bad idea. It would be radical.  But let's put it this way. They have a pretty good installed base inside companies running the best server.  They have pretty good security.  They have, although they may or may not give the keys to China and Turkey and whatever, but they still have that business. It's got to be worth something.  They just don't seem to be getting anywhere trying to get people to use their phones.

I mean, that's the same...  They're here. They're in the audience of the chat.  So of them, there are a couple of places you can go. You can go AOL.  AOL.  AOL is pretty good.  The DIG one just came out the last possible minute.  I'm trying to go to dig.com right now. Here it is. I just went to dig.com.  Feedly.  Yeah, have you tried Feedly?

It uses Google Reader's keystrokes like J and K and N and P and so forth.  It shares right now... Sharing is kind of limited.  Facebook and Twitter.  Doesn't that look a little bit like Google Reader?  It's just a more modern typography.

Just quit.  I can't.  I'll tell you in a second.  I'll take it back and I'll tell you why.  But I think everybody listening to this show, everybody in the studio audience, everybody in the chat room should immediately go to Facebook and delete their account.  I'll tell you why in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a Live Journal.  I put all my girlish thoughts there.  My hopes, my fears.  I wrote my name Mrs. John C. Dvorak over and over and over.  But first, a word from Jira.  Did you know that Jira, I just found this out.  Jira is an Atlassian product, enterprise product for ticket management.  But it was named after Godzilla because the Japanese name for Godzilla is what?

Start time: 1146.02

Start time: 1150.98
End time: 1166.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It means it's true.  It must be true.  It's totally true.  How do you say Godzilla in Japanese?  Chatroom?  Gojira, right?  Chatroom says Gojira.  A guy named Dendrite says, Hi!

Start time: 1168.85
End time: 1170.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chatroom is almost as right as Wikipedia.

Start time: 1173.78
End time: 1318.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Atlassian, you probably know about it.  And a lot of people in the chatroom who use Jira.

So first of all, Facebook has a horrendous leak which apparently has been around for a while and they now say it's as many as 6 million people have been affected by this.  Now admittedly Facebook's got a billion users so that's not a big percentage.  But if it's you, you might not like this.  Somebody can download their Facebook stuff, you know that button, download my Facebook information and you will get a bunch of information about your friends and your friends of friends.  Some of it information they didn't even submit to Facebook.

Start time: 1319.24
End time: 1322.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This hasn't been going on for a while though, hasn't it?

Start time: 1323.34
End time: 1350.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well Facebook finally admitted it on Friday but apparently it has been going on for years.  These shadow profiles, Facebook has been collecting information from other sources about you.  So even if you didn't for instance put in your home phone number in your Facebook profile, it would have it.  Yeah.  First it was the NSA now it's Facebook?  Well I mean I'm more scared of the NSA I guess but I'm more offended by Facebook.

Start time: 1351.49
End time: 1362.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So then you use the find friends feature and it would go and find people from your contact book and they basically saved information about those people as well.  So even if they didn't have Facebook.

Start time: 1364.04
End time: 1381.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah, and so yeah obviously they're getting it somewhere and they're getting it from your friends and friends and about your friends from you because when they download the contact list they just save everything.  This does not seem right to me. Has Facebook said they're not going to do it anymore?

Start time: 1385.05
End time: 1386.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My understanding was it was a bug and someone reported it.

Start time: 1388.70
End time: 1389.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bug.

Start time: 1391.82
End time: 1406.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The bug was that when you download your stuff you were getting other people's stuff.  The shadow profiles are not a bug.  It is Facebook trying to find out as much about everybody as they can.  Whether you gave permission or not.

Start time: 1407.54
End time: 1420.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Facebook has talked about this before, the shadow profiles, and their argument was let's say you eventually wanted to join Facebook then when you created an account they'd have all this information about you and that would help you.  It's not a bug, it's a feature.

Start time: 1421.92
End time: 1427.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The justification is we're getting ready for you to join Facebook.  Which you inevitably will.

Start time: 1429.27

Transcript:  How different is this from Google now looking at all this stuff and saying oh he's a Giants fan.  But it's stuff about me because I'm sharing it that's different.  Yeah, but okay.  Isn't it?  I don't like their auto-tagging.

Start time: 1447.34
End time: 1463.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you don't have to do that, any of that.  You can even use all of these Google features without participating.  They give you explicit opt-out.  Facebook doesn't even tell you it's doing this.  In fact, not only does it not tell you, it's not doing it about you, it's doing it about your friends.  It's getting information from you, John, about my own number.

Start time: 1488.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1523.37
End time: 1533.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably.  I don't care.  Even if you never told Facebook your phone number, it might have a record of it as well as your email addresses, home addresses, other things that are in your friends' contact list.

Start time: 1535.04
End time: 1538.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I gave this to you.  In the olden days, you used to list your phone number anyway, so who cares?

Start time: 1540.45
End time: 1559.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because, I'll tell you why.  In my address book, I have the names of some very famous people.  Yeah?  Who are very protective of their privacy.  Okay.  And Facebook apparently now has that information because I, without knowing it, gave Facebook permission to look at my contacts.  Well, it's not your fault.

Start time: 1561.02
End time: 1569.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is my fault.  You did agree to it though.  You agreed to it.  You signed on the dotted line.

Start time: 1570.72
End time: 1578.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The next point is, they told you about that when you signed up.  They said, we're going to look at your contacts and get all kinds of information so we can suggest new friends to you.

Start time: 1579.86
End time: 1580.62
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So you agreed to it.

Start time: 1581.62
End time: 1601.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's their argument.  But my understanding with that would be that they would have information about who I know in a database associated with me.  But that wouldn't, well, I guess, so that means to you when they say that.  And by the way, we're going to save everybody's phone numbers in that contact list.

Start time: 1602.44
End time: 1603.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're speaking in riddles.

Start time: 1604.48
End time: 1623.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing is, they're not giving you a lot of detail, right?  They're saying, yes, we're going to do this.  But I don't think the average user realizes what that means.  So that's why these shadow profiles are surprising.  They don't say, we're going to collect all the information on all your friends and put it in a secret file and then we'll let people download it accidentally.

Start time: 1626.56
End time: 1632.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In Europe, it might be illegal.  It's probably illegal in the US.  It might be illegal because they have much stronger data protection laws.

Start time: 1633.28
End time: 1637.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I don't think you're allowed to collect information about third parties.

Start time: 1638.70
End time: 1653.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And furthermore, because of a bug in Facebook for over a year, they've been giving that information out to somebody else.  So not only are they collecting, in my opinion, over collecting information, but they're also giving it to anybody, to other people.  Sure.

Start time: 1655.35
End time: 1660.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1664.08
End time: 1665.98

Start time: 1667.08
End time: 1676.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1677.58
End time: 1687.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think the NSA needs to offer some kind of automated backup.  If they've got all my email and voice messages and whatnot, they could just sell me.  Right.

Start time: 1688.90
End time: 1699.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh man, my machine blew up.  People make that joke, but seriously, if they did offer that as a feature, wouldn't people feel better about it?  I would.  I hate that offsite backup.  You're collecting everything, so that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a technology story.  It is.  There's been some studies that show that the way people accept things, it varies, and it's already been accepted.  But the problem that they have is everyone kind of knew this was going on, but when somebody came out and proved it, then it was like, oh my God!  But you already knew, but now somebody proved it, so now you're all upset.  We know, but we don't want to know.  That's an element.

Start time: 1771.38
End time: 1794.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess I just didn't think that they were storing the numbers of the people that I know and cross-referencing that.  I mean, I thought, oh, okay, that makes sense.  What they're doing is they're making a database associated with Leo Laporte, with all of my friends' email addresses, maybe phone numbers.  That data is kind of segregated so that if that person joins Facebook, they can... I guess you're right. I guess I knew.

Start time: 1795.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The last time I quit Facebook was when they changed their privacy policy so dramatically and so unexpectedly that it was clear that they couldn't care less.  And so I said in protest I quit.  And then a month later I realized I have to be on Facebook if only to cover it.  And frankly, it's a useful platform for reaching our audience.

I mean, how much more ways do you want to reach the audience?  I don't see it as anything that valuable.  I'm a tech journalist. I don't have one.  Yeah, but you're out of touch. You can't talk about Facebook.  I don't want to talk about Facebook.  That's the only thing I don't get is that I can't talk about Facebook.  Not to mention it. I don't have to be on Facebook wasting my time grinding away seeing what all my...  I lost friends have done since high school. I don't care.  I don't visit Facebook.  I'm done. That was my reaction.

It always seemed to me ever since that interview that law enforcement at almost all levels,  and I worked in law enforcement actually when I was an air pollution inspector, are very lazy.  They would love to not do any work.  Did you carry a gun?  No, I didn't carry a gun.  John C. Dvorak, pollution inspector.  I hear there's pollution here.  Those fines were pretty nasty.

Transcript:  Wiretap Report 2012. Administrative Office of the Courts.  Summary here. Encryption was reported for 15 wiretaps in 2012 and for 7 wiretaps conducted during previous year.  And 4 of these... Now, this is interesting.  In 4 out of the 15, officials were unable to decipher the plain text of the messages.  So I'm getting a different thing from this.  Yes, they failed 4 times. They succeeded 9 times in getting through the encryption.  That's, to me, more telling.  Wow.  Yeah, isn't it? I mean, I think that headline...  I think the Virgin and the threat level blog are focusing on the wrong message here.  Government wiretaps were foiled by encryption for the first time, but only 4 out of the 15 wiretaps.  9? Eh, no problem. We got right through that encryption. That didn't work so good.  Yeah, they took the wrong angle on the story. It's very funny.  A secret encoder key? I think they missed the point.

Start time: 2187.20
End time: 2194.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the point is that they got most of it.  And those other ones, if they went and took a second pass at it, they probably would have gotten half of them again.

Start time: 2195.85
End time: 2223.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I guess this is the other point of it.  In the 109 reported cases between 2000 and 2011 where they encountered encryption, they got it in every case.  They got through. 109 out of 109. They were able to decrypt.  So the reason that the story is, this is the first time ever that 4 people foiled them.  So this makes me think either people are misusing, they're not using encryption right, or really, encryption isn't as effective as we've been given to believe.

Start time: 2225.02
End time: 2265.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's some discussion along those lines.  You know, I remember before, it was a TrueCrypt that's out, there used to be a thing called DriveCrypt.  Remember that? They had an encryption thing on there. There was one type of encryption.  And I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, and I always thought it was going to show up again. It disappeared.  Completely disappeared. And that was the encryption techniques used by the Swiss banks.  And when I was at this RSA conference, they said the security people did not want Americans using this.  Because it's too good.  Apparently it worked. And then now it's completely gone. Maybe someone in the chat room could remember this type of encryption.  It was called Snowbank or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We don't know. Unfortunately, this report is not very explicit.  But I'm really curious as to why, A, they've broken 109 out of 109 up to now, and B, why only 4 out of the 15 from 2012, only 4 were unencryptable.  Are people so misusing encryption that, you know, are they saying, hey, well I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in fact, I remember the Secret Service saying, we don't worry so much about encryption. This was some years ago. This was maybe 2003.  We don't worry so much about encryption because mostly the guys just give us the password.  Most crooks, they go, yeah, here's the password. They don't fight it.  That's what they told me. I don't know.

I wrote about them last night.  Tell us about the metrics.  They're just going to keep dribbling these out.  That's really annoying to me. That is the worst kind of, in my opinion, link baiting.

Start time: 2518.42
End time: 2534.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both the Post and the Guardian have said that they've not released some because they're concerned about national security.  It's not just that they're waiting. It's that some of them have presumably information that could jeopardize something.

End time: 2577.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that came up after I wrote the post about the new Washington Post slides was a couple people pointed out...  All the interesting stuff is in the annotations beside the slide where Barton Gellman presumably talks about, interprets the slide.  And this is based on his reporting. But we don't have a whole lot of...  So we have basically his annotation saying there's equipment on company premises.

Start time: 2579.36
End time: 2590.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's something that consistently Google, Facebook, Yahoo, everybody has denied.  They say they do not have government access to our servers. Not according to these slides.

Start time: 2591.50
End time: 2617.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it all hinges on the interpretation of this term, direct access.  But according to the annotations on this slide, the FBI is operating equipment that is on company premises.  And then they take the data and they give it to the NSA or the CIA or whoever wants it.  And it can include real-time monitoring of voice conversations, text, chat, and voice chat.

Start time: 2619.38
End time: 2655.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this show... Well, I'm sure that was...  By the way, among the other annotations, the annotation of the Prism logo...  The program is called Prism after the Prism is used to split light which is used to carry information on fiber optic cables.  Steve Gibson nailed this.  And the further release of slides shows that in fact as Steve believed they were tapping upstream at the providers,  they actually explicitly say... In fact, they call it upstreaming.  Which means that they can get the data without the cooperation of Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, YouTube, Skype, AOL, and Apple.

Start time: 2656.68
End time: 2667.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you think about it, company premises could just refer to a server room somewhere at a co-location facility.  It doesn't have to mean inside the Google...

Start time: 2668.96
End time: 2672.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 2673.96
End time: 2702.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or just wiretapping their provider. That's what Steve said.  And I think Steve's argument is that even though of course these national security letters in the Patriot Act  kind of prevent Google, Microsoft, the others from saying anything, they wouldn't have...  There's nothing requiring them to do these explicit denials.  That these explicit denials, you know, they could say, you know, we're not going to talk about it, but these explicit denials, which would be absolute lies...  And Google's chief counsel has done farther than anybody.

Start time: 2703.96
End time: 2723.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did a Q&A with the Guardian and he probably went farther than any of the other companies in specifically saying  there's no direct access, there's no indirect access, there's no lockbox, there's no dropbox, there's no nothing.  So that's, you know, that just does not jive with the description of this slide.

Start time: 2726.14
End time: 2778.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep. And yet there is up streaming. They make a point, one of these slides, and this is for our international listeners,  that most traffic ends up going through the US even if it's not targeted to the US.  Yeah, may East, may West, those places.  Most of the world's communications flow through the United States.  A target's phone call, email, or chat will take the cheapest path, not the physically most direct path.  Your target's communications could easily be flowing into and out of the United States. Good news!  What are they getting from these providers? Email, chat, video, voice, videos, photos, stored data,  VoIP, file transfers, video conferencing, notifications of target activity like logins, online social networking details,  thank you, Facebook, and special requests.  Everything. Everything. Everything.

In business, we rely on sending and receiving important materials, not pizza, but things  like PowerPoint presentations, drawings, slides, images.  I send audio to the radio stations every single week.  Remotely.  And I do it with ShareFile.  I set it up with ShareFile.com.  I've used other solutions, never as good as Easy or as guaranteed as ShareFile.  Problem with email, of course, you've got bounce backs, these large files, also the  security involved.  Sending an email is like sending a postcard.  So that's why I use ShareFile from Citrix.  The file send is a link, so there's no bounce back.  I can see when it's been downloaded.  I get an email message.  You can also set access controls, password, how many times it can be downloaded, if it's  downloaded, for how long.  So for instance, I said radio ads, I say you can have it for a week because I don't want  to be downloaded after that time.  The files are stored in the cloud so I can access the files anywhere on my laptop or  mobile device.  I use the free ShareFile apps.  I don't have to have the file on my phone.  I just say the one in the cloud, send that along.  It really is great.  ShareFile.com.  Here, try it free for 30 days, no obligation.  for 30 days free.  Now remember, that microphone at the top is the one you want, not the one in the middle.  The one at the top, 30 days free.  It says radio listeners, but you get the idea.  ShareFile.com.  Who'd you make it this?  Brian Brushwood with Paula Deen.  Did you know that he had done that?  Everybody in the chat room seems to know.  In like 1997.

End time: 3621.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's easier to...  Well, all I have to do is point out the fact...  Wait a minute.  This graph doesn't look anything like I expected it to.  Vine has been hurt by Instagram.  Vine is Twitter's video sharing technology.  And the blue line is Instagram, which is actually kind of steady.  And the yellow line is Vine.  And Vine videos have dived.  Less than 900,000 Vine links shared on Twitter in one day.  That's 70% less than the week before.  On the June 27th.  So I don't know what that means.  If I were Twitter, I'd be peeved.  Twitter apparently missed out on buying Instagram.  Thought about it, but decided not to.  And one of the reasons they bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of with Matthew on the video issue.  You don't like it either?  Well, look, I like the idea of Vine originally as a separate thing.  And I think that Instagram has shown how to do it right.  The problem is that Instagram is already a photo service and I don't want to see videos on my photo service.  I was one of the early adopters of Instagram and I was bitchy when it moved to Android,  despite the fact that I'm a heavy Android user because I knew instantly that the quality would go down with the content I would see.  And that happened.  Thankfully, I dropped a bunch of people and I still had some pretty decent quality content on Instagram because of that.

Start time: 3702.34
End time: 3751.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus, I think that one of my points was that...  Well, A, what you said, Miriam, having video in a thing that's already devoted to doing photos is a little like chalk and cheese for me at least.  But if...  So photos, you know, you can take a half decent photo of things and I can sort of scroll past it and think,  Oh, that looks nice.  A video requires a whole bunch more time for you to make it any good, which most people don't have time or the skills to do.  It requires a whole bunch more time for me to sort of look at it and then realize that it's crap and I've just wasted 15 seconds of my time.  And it doesn't, you know, 15 seconds doesn't seem like a lot, but over time you watch enough crappy Instagram or Vine videos, you're thinking, you know, I'm wasting my life.

Start time: 3997.01
End time: 4055.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I have them as well.  I use pretty much every phone there is out there because that's my job.  I personally use a Nexus 4 as my main device, but I'm probably going to switch to an HTC One with stock Android at this point.  I believe the HTC One is the best piece of phone hardware in the universe right now.  It's a beautiful piece of hardware.  And Leo agrees.  It's just great in terms of everything.  The software is pretty good as Sense 5, but stock Android is just a whole new dimension of better.  Thankfully, they somehow fixed up all the imaging and camera stuff to be somewhat half-decent.  So the quality of the pictures you take with the stock Android versions of both these phones are very, very close, if not identical, to the quality coming out of the TouchWiz and Sense versions.  Of course, you lose some functionality, but I'm willing to live without that functionality.  Things like using the front and rear camera at the same time in the Galaxy S4.  That's stupid.

Start time: 4063.22
End time: 4086.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to miss the Zoe, to be honest.  What is the Zoe?  Zoe is this feature in the HTC One and the Sense 5 version that lets you basically capture something like 10 frames at full resolution and also an H.264 video.  I think it's six seconds long.  Three seconds.

Start time: 4088.36
End time: 4102.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it does a pre-record of another second, so you could get a total of four.  That's one of the things that's interesting. If I'm pointing it at you, it remembers the first second before I pressed the capture button.  And it picks the best still images out of those as well as you get this video. I really like that.

Start time: 4103.86
End time: 4126.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a bunch of effects you can use out of that too. You can make an effect where you can pick the best faces during that capture.  I was never able to get that work. Were you able to get that work?  It's in the gallery. The thing is, on the Samsung, all that stuff is a feature in the camera.  With HTC, you shoot the Zoe first and then later on in the gallery you can do this at your leisure anytime.

Transcript:  I've talked to our mobile guy, Kevin Topol, and he said the same thing about the HTC One being great hardware.  The problem is when you get a lot of, whether it's Samsung or Motorola, they put all this stuff on there of their own to try and turn it into their own thing.  Sometimes it just craps it up and gets in the way of what you want to do.

Transcript:  I'll give you an example of something that's telling.  The Galaxy S4 normally, the 16GB version, has 5GB free on the onboard storage with TouchWiz UI and all the S features.  Of course you can expand it with MicroSD, but with the stock Android it has 12GB free.  If that doesn't tell you something about the clutter and the uselessness of all these S features that Samsung keeps putting onto people, what does?

I always have one in my pocket.  That's what that is.  I noticed the ROMs are out. If I wanted to, I could make this unlocked European version into a Google Edition.  What I did, which I think is even better, is somebody has put the...  Probably is illegal. I don't know.  The camera and the gallery from the S4 stock edition, or Google Edition, out so you can download and install as an app.  I got rid of Samsung. Samsung's camera app is really crappy.  The Google app is much better. It's faster. Go ahead and play with it. Turn it into a Russian phone again.  Be my guest.  You're better than Brian Brushwood. You found money in my phone.

Anyway, I think that people should understand that when they get the Google Edition phones, there are real advantages.  I think, Mariam, you hit the number one advantage, which is that Galaxy S4 really doesn't have much...  It's locked.  Here, I'll unlock it for you.  No, I went off.  I'll show you that. Well, it's watching your eyes. Apparently, you have soulless eyes.  I'm a dead man.

Transcript:  It's interesting that the HTC One is cheaper than the Galaxy S4 and has more storage.  Now, there are drawbacks that you touched upon. Personally, I don't think there are drawbacks.  I think the wave of the future is a fully integrated device like Apple's been doing for a while.  Because you can then have polymer batteries that can be shaped into the shape of the chassis.  You can get a thinner, stronger chassis because of it.  I think Samsung is doing it wrong.  But the interchangeable battery, you're going to say, oh my God, oh my God.  Well, listen, that's what USB pluggable batteries do.  I mean...  I guess I could carry that around.  I carry one with me when I really know that I'm going to need one.  It's bigger and heavier.  Well, it depends. It comes in all sizes and shapes.  I have one that's the size of a credit card in footprint and about four credit cards thick or three credit cards thick.  And it gives me about a thousand milliamp hour.  So I can continue on for the rest of my day for a few hours.

Transcript:  I think the Xperia looks great.  I think that what's really interesting is there are cases on both sides.  You could say a Google experience phone is better.  I don't know if Google is the be-all and end-all for user interface design, frankly.  And I think that there are those who say that the manufacturers have really made additions that make them distinct.  The Galaxy S4 is a very different phone from the HTC One, like it or not.  So I think what's good in the bottom line is that there's a lot of choice out there.  Choice is great. And I think that people should pick what's best for them.  It's hard for users to know. I get this call a lot.  What should I get? HTC One, GS4.  A lot of people even in the know, in the tech industry, say, what should I get?  I don't necessarily feel as you do, Miriam, that the HTC One is head and shoulders above the rest.  It's beautiful, yes.  When somebody says I'm an iPhone user, I say get the One.  Because that's an aesthetic decision.

No, see it's got a little peek-a-boo window that shows you the time and notifications. Look at that.  And then when I open it up, the phone turns on. But when it's closed, I think that's nice.

Transcript:  I actually...  There are arguments to be made about the HTC One versus the GS4 and some of them go down to the display quality and the camera quality.  And there's not just about the industrial design and the materials used.  I mean, I think HTC is really trying to push the envelope in terms of technology and I don't think Samsung is.  I think Samsung is just doing what they have to do, the bare essential minimum to carry on.

Transcript:  I got into photography through camera phones in the early 2000s.  I was an early adopter of camera phones and it taught me everything I know about photography.  And now I use the highest-end DSLRs, etc.  Because the restriction put upon me by using camera phones and the advantages of being able to upload to the internet  anytime have to me far outweighed carrying a big heavy camera around.  And this is why in fact I still don't carry a big camera around.  The quality of these phones has gotten really, really good.  I think we've gotten into point-and-shoot territory in terms of performance on some of these devices.

If you've got no camera and you have your phone and you take a picture with the phone, it would be a great shot.  Yeah, if you've got nothing else going on.  But to take the phone into the woods like Leo did here when he's got tons of nice cameras is nuts.

And it's being made that the future photography is not about glass or sensors or pickups.  It's about software. And that computational photography really is where everything is happening.  And the key to this is you've got a very, very powerful computer behind this crappy lens that's always connected.  And there's some real advantages to that.  Things like the Zoe and the highlights show that you can do something with an HTC One you cannot do with a camera.

That the convenience of the fact that because I took these with Android they were immediately uploaded to Google Plus and Dropbox.  And I didn't have to worry about backup. I was actually able to share them before I even left.  Google did some amazing things. This is an Auto Awesome where it did a GIF.  An animated GIF out of the...  Is it GIF or GIF?

We're talking mysteries. We're talking thrillers.  Kids books, young adult books.  The final book in the Old Filth trilogy has just come out.  I have no idea what this is.

It's like as you grow up you don't have time to read anymore.  But now you have time in the car commuting. You have time walking the dog or at the gym.  Audio books just make that time fly by.

Glass has become a polluting factor, I have to say.  That makes it so much better.  I wish people wouldn't take pictures of Google Glass, especially of garbage.  But a lot of beautiful images, a lot of great shares.  And then, okay, here's another tip. Go to the What's Hot section and you can see what people are really engaging with.  Look at number one, George Kazooie. I'm watching Leo Laporte on Twitter and the subject of cursive writing came up.  And you can't read that, can you?  I can read it.

Because I really enjoy a good presentation and I never felt like Google reader was giving me that.  That's why I actually like to read the native websites, for example, in gadget.  But I think with flip board, I find the presentation is really appealing even though it's pulling content from various locations.  And Google reader could have been flip board.

Here's all the art of the new articles from all the sources I follow, now I got to go through them one by one.  And Dave even said, you know what, that's not how people consume information anymore.  They consume it as a river which they dip into.  They don't have to read, they don't have to get to inbox zero because nobody wants to have to do that.

I have Twitter lists that I came up with that basically duplicate all the things I was getting through Google reader or almost all of them.  And it makes so much, it's such a big difference using a tool where people are making recommendations to you about things to read instead of an automated feed of stuff coming punched out at a certain time of the day.

And the thing that flip board is missing, which is why I use Prismatic, and I've experimented with Zite and pretty much News 360, pretty much everything that comes out, I think flip board is missing the opportunity to really do smart recommendations.  I think that's the next sort of frontier in that type of news recommendation technology or whatever is to get good at showing me things I haven't already said I'm interested in.

The story I saw was, oh my God, somebody has hacked Instagram, is posting pictures of fruit in OME and Kevin's stream.  It's promoting this fruit, all fruit diet.  Instagram said, yeah, yeah, we got it.  Those few people who got bit, and I don't know how many it is, we're going to reset their passwords.  We're deleting all pictures of fruit from Instagram.

Transcript:  They look like stock photos to me.  I don't think this fruit diet company actually went out and had custom made photos.  Commissioned photos.  Probably a lot of stock photos.  My concern, and this comes from the fact that Instagram is owned by Facebook, which has not shown itself to be pretty any good at this stuff,  is that it's not that these people did something, but that in fact the database has been corrupted or somehow hacked.  Instagram said a small portion of our users experienced a spam incident where unwanted photos were posted from their accounts.

Transcript:  Our good friend, Dane Atkinson, who created Squarespace, has created this to bring business intelligence, the very sophisticated data analysis that big business has access to, to everybody.  So we've all got data that we might want to analyze from Google, Twitter, YouTube, PayPal, Amazon, Facebook.  If you're, well, for instance, for us, we sold t-shirts.  We want to see how did that campaign work?  Did any of our social media efforts work?  Was there a tie-in to the increase in sales when we mentioned it on the air?  Things like that.  Not easy to get all that stuff together.  SumAll makes it possible.  Connecting key data to give you graphs, insights, information from your social, your commerce, payments, website traffic.  They keep adding new sites.  They just added MailChimp, Google+, AdSense, SendGrid, Basecamp, Basecamp.  They're all in the Bitly WordPress constant contact.  I'll give you a good example.  A lot of us have Bitly accounts to kind of, you probably do this, to track when people click a link, a shortened link that you put in your Twitter.  Also have MailChimp.  Yeah. So you can see that graph, but what you don't see is, well, how did the Bitly traffic correspond to my mention on Twitter or whatever?  Now with SumAll.com, you go to one place, you get these great graphs, this great analysis.  Best of all, it's in beta. It's free.  Free, free, free.  Not freemium free, free.  SumAll, S-U-M-A-L-L.com.  They've just added an export and spreadsheet view so you can take projections and information, put them in an email.  In fact, they're always adding new features.  They just passed, listen to this, one half trillion social impressions tracked.  They've been growing fast, 30% in the last few weeks.  They're on a, on a tear right now.  And frankly, they're the only ones that are giving real people access to business intelligence in the kind of way that you can look at this and truly use it.  What are you tracking, Chad? Are you tracking Minecraft?

Transcript:  So right now, this is the OMGCraft website.  And so I can track visits.  That's Google Analytics probably, right?  And I can also see like, well, did that have any, if I got lots of hits on my website, did that have any effect on my subscribers?  You can kind of see, yes, there is right here.  Direct correlation, yeah.  If I wanted to, I could say, well, you know what, this was associated with a campaign.  So let me go ahead and add a note that this was, you know, with the fifth episode or whatever.  You posted a tweet and a couple of Google Plus posts or whatever.  Right, and then I can even say, you know what, I really would like to compare this with another week so I can click the compare button and then I actually get, I can overlap my, my grids.  Here we go, let's move that one out of the way there.  And you can do that against all of the things that, like I'm checking all of my fans.  Of course, this one was pulled not from Google Analytics, so it's checking, it's pulling, so I only started my poll on May so you can only see back to May.  But if I had it, had, you know, had signed up earlier, I could compare one week versus another and just overlay it on top of each other.

Then start connecting up your social networks and start just analyzing.  You know, it's hard to describe the value of this until you do it and then you realize what you can see.  Very powerful.  I think, John, you should enter in your pulled pork analytics into this and keep track of pulled pork from around the world and, you know, it'd be really give you some insight.  It's like an executive pulled pork dashboard.

I thought...  It's interesting because you're right in the sense that Phil Schiller said,  innovate, can't innovate my ass, look at our Mac Pro.  But this is not, in my opinion, what professionals want.  They wanted a cheese grater that had the latest chips in it.  They don't care if it looks like a tube.

You're going to get this entire ecosystem, which is what Apple wants, of these cylinders made by third parties like OWC that plug into the Thunderbolt 2 ports and contain driver arrays and contain mini PCIe expansions so you can actually put cards for your data acquisition in your lab or whatever.
