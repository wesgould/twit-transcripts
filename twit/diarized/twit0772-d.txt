Transcript:  It's great to have you. This is actually you're here for a very special reason because this week  Microsoft had its developer conference build conference for the first time ever entirely streaming. I  Saw some numbers like 300,000 people watched the streams was a huge number

Start time: 311.05
End time: 321.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep  compared to  6,000 or 4,000 I normally attend in person. Yeah, so I'd love to see this from now on from all the developer conferences

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nice to not have to get in a lottery to figure out, you know  If you get to go pay a lot of money to go and this way you can see it all  I just I just really liked it and I have to say I enjoyed the keynotes. We streamed the keynotes live on  Tuesday I  Never really quite know what such in Adele is talking about

Start time: 342.74
End time: 359.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we joke around about that too, there's a lot of words  There's a lot of you feel good, but you don't really know what's being said and why it's why it's important  It's funny cuz I a huge respect for you. Yeah, I mean he is clearly a great CEO who has pivoted Microsoft

Start time: 360.00
End time: 400.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  into a much more  Successful lane and there he's doing great. He's a he's a caring guy. He's a deep guy, but he I just I can't  Can't follow what he's saying. He did I did pick up though on a couple of things this fusion  He mentioned fusion. I thought wait a minute. What's that?  This is a new  Programming platform that brings together win 32 and  PW project reunion. I'm sorry reunion not fusion  Yeah, wpa apps the Windows Store apps and the in the win 32 apps  That seemed fairly important or maybe that was just my imagination

Start time: 401.26
End time: 542.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no that was and you know if you're not a developer or you're you know, like me you just follow Microsoft  But you don't actually write stuff. This was probably one of the biggest and most interesting announcements  In a way, it's not even new  It's what's been happening for the last few years already that they've been talking about  They just kind of gave it a name in a formality this time  And you know, it's really  It is a the next  Where this stuff is moving right for so they have multiple development platforms for their apps win 32 to something that goes back  You know 20 30 years is what makes Windows Windows so powerful  But then of course you have universal Windows apps and UWP  Which was more modern and they still encourage developers to go down that route if you're doing something on HoloLens  Surface hub or any of their future devices Windows 10x included UWP is that platform?  but what they're doing now is basically any API's that are coming out will target both of these systems and  They're they're trying to get rid of this idea of like  Developers can only have to choose one platform to develop on they can do whatever they feel comfortable with  What are their goals are what are their strategy is whatever their budget is as well?  And that's why you know PWA is progressive web apps are becoming increasingly popular too  And we see a lot of that with Microsoft Edge and announcements around there  and so all they're trying to do is get away from this idea of you know a single system that people need to rely on because  Even though UWP made more sense set on phones or at least had more of an argument for it  The fact is the UI system what's now part of when UI 3.0 is very modern  It's very fresh looking it's fast. It's dynamic. It allows  Scalable and resizable apps there's a lot of positive stuff about UWP that does make it the future of app development for  Microsoft and its platforms, but you can't just throw out Win32 as well due to all the legacy  so what the system allows devs to do now is take those old apps those old Win32 apps and  Bring in the stuff from UWP the positive stuff into it including the UI so you can actually make modern-looking  classic running applications and so  Like I said, that's been happening for the last few years behind the scenes  But this is more it's been kind of formalized and they're kind of laying it out with when UI and a couple other

Start time: 543.56
End time: 623.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New systems are coming out. This is a big deal because of course Microsoft unlike any other  Operating system really depends on legacy. You've got many many business users who are running old software  You'd like to bring them into the modern times not just for the way it looks and feels but for security reasons  Reliability reasons so if they can provide a platform that makes it easy for people who have  Win32 programs to bring it up to modern times that could be very important  Going forward for Microsoft. It's a way of handling this legacy problem. That's always been kind of tying them down  Yep  Good the other thing  And then we'll move on  The other thing I heard him mention that I thought was really interesting for years  It seems like Apple went through this Microsoft's gone through it in several different ways  They've wanted to reimagine the document that it's not just a collection of  Text or pictures smushed together in a single file that they can gets rendered by an application  But instead it's something alive that can have components from a variety of places  it's kind of that object model desktop that  Apple talked about and Microsoft talked about and now they've they've got something called the it's fluid

Start time: 626.68
End time: 629.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you the fluid you I heard that giggle it's

Start time: 631.04
End time: 636.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the flow is that what I'm talking about? That's yes, so IT windows IT pro explain this to me Lisa

Start time: 637.68
End time: 737.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the reason I'm laughing is when I was at info world my colleague Galen Grumman  Came up with the term fluid computing to describe the experience of beginning a computing task on  One device and then continuing it via the cloud through other devices and the example  He gave was in starting a story on his iPad and then finishing it on his laptop  It's sensible and I'm not sure the phrase fluid computing ever really gained traction  outside our office  but  The notion that we've uncoupled  The the task flow and the results of that task flow from a device is is not exactly new  And when I'm looking at what Microsoft's doing here, it's a really logical continuation of what they've been pushing  With how they want to affect  business productivity and  User experiences for the past few years. I've said in enough sessions at ignite or listen to enough streaming  Press press events or other  You know dev events where they've talked about  Breaking out of application silos  I don't know if they necessarily use that phrasing but that's that's the end result is the idea that instead of switching between  Applications and having to switch modes of working  they're envisioning pushing people into just one workspace and  Then thinking about your work in terms of how am I manipulating this data? Where is it coming from?  What do I want to do with it in the end? Yeah  It's fluid computing Galen Galen nailed it down in like 2011, right?

Start time: 739.08
End time: 758.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we've been we've been kind of tied to this notion that a  Document is like a physical it's kind of a skeuomorphic way of looking things piece of paper that you type on and that's what that's  Document and when we just made a digital version, so there it's a little confusing  Competing when they first introduced it. Yeah, we've taken. Yeah, I think you go back

Start time: 759.92
End time: 765.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're trying to find a new metaphor now. Exactly you go back to Doug Engelbart's, you know demo

Start time: 765.98
End time: 835.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole idea was well a document is a is a kind of this holder for a variety of things  So this new it I guess it's a new kind of office document  that uses  fluid components  To like this is the verge calls it like Lego blocks  That let it to me when we talked about this  It sounded a little bit like Google's wave that it was very short-lived  Where a document opportunity is the Minecraft metaphor instead of Lego metaphor. Yeah, maybe they should have called it Minecraft  Maybe I'm misunderstanding this but it's see we've tried to do this before and it's it seems like a great idea  You know remember the works programs where you'd have one document put a graph in and a database in it  You could this is even that on steroids. I mean it could be you know, a lot of different kinds of components  Well, this will give you some idea  This is this is the animated gif that Microsoft put out which is actually giving me a headache  but so am I  Characterizing this properly Daniel or is is that not what is because then there's also the fluid UI which is seems to be web design

Start time: 837.06
End time: 904.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, so there is this idea of the fluid computing concept is also  I think part of this larger goal that they have which is ambient computing this idea that you just have screens  Operating systems are streamed to your device  Everything's a lot more dynamic and yeah to use that word fluid right this idea that  Instead of you booting up a PC and have to load an application and then bring down the document  everything is kind of brought to you and  You're less restricted to the device itself and this idea of computing is gonna be really interesting how it's changing  You know desktop computing is always going to be a thing just like laptops  But how those evolve over the next five ten fifteen years, especially with 5g  And how operating systems are changing and you're going to see that with Windows 10 X of course  Which is more going down that route of what a future operating system looks like and I think that you know  What's been described here is that other piece of it the actual productivity end of how  Modern operating systems should behave and are less restricted to the actual physical hardware that where we use day-to-day

Start time: 904.40
End time: 915.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this idea. That's exactly right, but it's historically been difficult to do by the way  I just noticed you're wearing the surface earbuds. Do you like those? Yes, I do. I thought it was a fancy piece of jewelry. I did

Start time: 916.85
End time: 981.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  They're really nice. I mean, you know my review went up for him this week  I spent a good two weeks with them and spent a really a lot of detail into them and the bottom line  I gave him like a three out of five for a rating  So I personally really like them lot and I use them all the time big don't you think they're kind of large?  So they're large for a couple reasons  The battery life, you know, they get eight hours per charge  Which they're meant to be you put them in and leave them in all day  And you can kind of think of these as being sort of like lifestyle earphones and  This is a very niche and unique  Aspect to these and I gotta give Microsoft credit at least it's a way to differentiate themselves from every other earbud  But you're looking for little earbuds you put in for an hour or two just to listen to your music  You want to tune out the world?  These are not for you  These are meant to you can kind of think of in the future where you just carry around one earpiece  But you can hear ambient noise around you someone comes up to you and talks to you you don't have to wait what?  Because you're able to hear everything at the same time. You can hear from your devices. You can stream media

Start time: 981.24
End time: 985.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can take that conference call. Are you using the microphone right now or using a separate? No, okay

Start time: 985.94
End time: 1018.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could but yeah, you know, you know, you have a better sounding. Yeah, you have a much better  Yeah, but the mics are pretty good on them. But so the size is for a couple reasons  So the battery life is very good to their gesture supported  So on one side you do by mob flying down by swiping down and on the other side you go forward or back to skip tracks  There's also the double tap. So I think they had to have a large enough surface area right to actually  To because you're not looking at yourself when you're doing it. So you need a server target

Start time: 1018.54
End time: 1024.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they actually look good now that I'm kind of getting used to it. They look better than those drippy  AirPods

Start time: 1024.88
End time: 1030.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, so and yeah, I have a lot of thoughts about that, you know, cuz air pods are now accepted

Start time: 1030.68
End time: 1035.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody has them. We don't even notice it anymore. I'm watching CNN and that's all anybody's wearing

Start time: 1035.88
End time: 1073.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all you see. Yeah, and so they're still weird looking  We just all it's no different. Yeah, it's no different than bell bottoms and it is a fashion thing, right?  Bell bottoms were huge years ago, right in the 70s. You could go rock bell bottoms today  If people just look at you weird, you know, like that's different, but everybody started wearing them again  Just be that right. So what I do like about them is when I'm looking at you and the profile is actually very slim  You don't see it's only when you turn your head. Yeah, it's only when you turn your head  So the audio quality is very good. My issue with them is there I think they're a little expensive at $200

Start time: 1075.04
End time: 1082.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's the price point now. I mean air pod pros are 250  Any so the pros so gonna be that much

Start time: 1083.22
End time: 1116.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you look at like some like galaxy buds or the pixel buds or even just for that  Yeah, those are half and like even it, you know  I would compare these to regular air pods because they don't have noise cancellation on them either passive or  Inactive so there's there's none of that here the case, you know, which is right here is actually really nice  But it doesn't have wireless charging which I think a lot of people expect. Oh, you know, so not a battery case  It's a battery case but uses a type C plug, right? Oh, that's all right. That's the original air pods

Start time: 1116.42
End time: 1119.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's fine. As long as you can charge the buds in the case

Start time: 1120.58
End time: 1125.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can and so you get 24 hours you get eight hours of the initial charge and two more charges with this

Start time: 1125.68
End time: 1128.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that they're probably the longest lasting of anything out there right now

Start time: 1129.52
End time: 1182.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the other big thing. They're so comfortable like they really nailed the ergonomics of how this works  So you can wear them all day. I  Put these things in and you basically forget they're there they don't fall out that there's like I may lock into place into that ear  And I can wear them for eight hours and wouldn't even think about it and that's really different from  earbuds that go into the ear canal which you know, some people will enjoy but I  Challenge anyone where does for two or three hours and see how their ears feel because it's gonna be painful  Where these were meant to be you get up you put them on go to the office you work all day  And you just wear them and I think that's a neat  Market, it's not a mass market  Like I think most people will probably be okay with galaxy buds or pixel buds whatever  But for certain people who work in a professional environment who want all-day earphones, I think these are kind of awesome  I just wish the price was a little bit lower to be more competitive

Start time: 1183.60
End time: 1206.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a little sidelight because I because I am I am ADD and I noticed you were wearing them and I'm sorry  Yeah, we were talking  About build let me ask Lindsey because I don't know how much your attention you played to the build conference  But you've been covering Microsoft for almost as long as somebody like me has  This is a very different company from the company of ten even ten years ago

Start time: 1208.40
End time: 1302.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. What's not true is that I  Haven't actually been covering it very closely for a very long time  But what I will tell you is that the same Bill Gates Microsoft  This it is not or is it even I am  really impressed with the way  such as pushing us toward thinking about  Interconnected companies. Yeah, and  The way in which we think about how technology should work with technology from competitors, right?  He seems to have completely moved on from this very competitive world that we were in when I started in technology journalism  Where everything was a war? Yeah, I  And he he just kind of ignores that and moves on and says let's let's solve these problems  And that's what I really like and enjoy about watching this kind of from the sidelines  the other interesting thing that I'll say about Microsoft overall is  that there's this sort of newfound love for Microsoft and maybe I  don't know maybe it came from the from the young young gamers who fell in love with my with Minecraft, but  I am you know, I live with a lot of teenagers and Microsoft is not at all the word. Yeah  We have a  PlayStation but really almost all of the entertainment happens on hand-built computers  Oh interesting that kids had built themselves interesting. Yeah, and they run Windows and there I mean they're PC gamers and they're young  It's a young diverse set of PC gamers and it's just not a dirty word anymore

Start time: 1304.08
End time: 1416.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You nailed it because I mean Bill Gates with nothing else and people young people don't remember don't know about the old Bill Gates  They think he's that nice guy who's saving us from COVID-19  But or giving it to us or giving it to us depending on their political persuasion  Maybe he wants to microchip us. I don't know. I can't follow any of this conspiracy crap, but  the Bill Gates of  When he was CEO of Microsoft was a shark was a bloodthirsty shark who was feared and loathed by  Everybody else in the industry. Nobody that's a this is a very different. You nailed it. Lindsay. This is a very different Microsoft  It's even different from Steve Ballmer who said Linux open source is a cancer  And now all of a sudden  There Microsoft's shipping. That's what one of the things announced this week the Linux kernel  The Linux kernel in Windows home as well as Windows Pro the Linux subsystem or Windows subsystem for Linux is  Is basically Linux on Windows. They've got a terminal program  They bought you that Minecraft is a perfect example  Compare the Minecraft acquisition and the value it added to Microsoft to the Nokia  Acquisition under Steve Ballmer and the value it subtracted from  Microsoft this is it's a it's night and day and they with you know, when when they bought github  I think the open source community was angered and and disappointed and terrified and I think they've completely  Molified the open source community. They've embraced open source  Linux is the number one operating system running on Azure now. It comes with windows now  It's such a different world. It's it's nothing like the old  The old Microsoft were you impressed Daniel with the amount of open source embracing going on at build

Start time: 1417.88
End time: 1481.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, although, you know, it's not surprising. They have been talking about it for years now and just slowly rolling out things  You know, I know a lot of people are like are they're gonna open source windows itself  but I don't think that will happen ever but all these other technologies developer tools and  You know  They are returning to their roots in a lot of ways as a computing company and that's what they focus on now  And I think under Balmer they tried to do become a consumer company and compete with Apple and we know how that ended up  And listen, I know, you know, I see a Windows phone user  I love zoom, but those were definitely failed strategies and that's not that's not what Microsoft is  And so back, you know under Nadella. They're just returning to this idea of just  generalized computing everything they're building is for developers and  software engineers and they're building out the systems for the next five ten fifteen twenty years and  I think that's a nice change  And I think that's why people are really enjoying sort of this new Renaissance of Microsoft and yeah  No one really liked this idea of like, oh, we're gonna you know, crush everybody and know it's a story everyone

Start time: 1481.36
End time: 1577.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a cuddly. Yeah, it's a embrace. What was it?  Embrace and engulfing the finish. Yeah, great extinguish. It's like  Embrace and hug it's a whole different. It's a whole different Microsoft. It's very interesting  Nadella had was do you think that was his house or was that a set that he was on?  This whole thing was streamed had a very good be there. He has a nice house  Yeah, obviously he's got a nice out he had behind him though. You can tell already. I'm fascinated by what's behind people  He had behind him. What was the letters G?  V W C to C W  I can't remember the exact letters and we were looking at that's gone  There's a message there before the end of this stream. We did a live stream of his talk  Somebody tweeted. Oh  That's the words the word devs devs in base 64 encoded  It was an Easter egg a secret Easter eggs embracing devs that only a geeky dev whatever  Yet, I thought I thought it was great Scott Hanselman  followed and did I thought of  To me that is it was a work from home keynote where he showed off all his  His stuff is hue lights and the glow in the purple and it was having great fun and he was calling people and  And showing off stuff and it went  Ten times better than the average on stage demo much less stilted  Haven't I haven't seen the rest of the stuff, but it seemed like they really did a good job making build  engaging and entertaining and smart at the same time

Start time: 1577.74
End time: 1634.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a right balance between they had a lot of nerdy humor, which was nice  But they had a lot of good content right and they had a lot of likable people who were just  And that's tough to do. Yes, got to you know, really fantastic, but they also just a lot of good hosts  And that's a tough thing to pull off. They had to approach this differently and some getting up on stage  I'm gonna do my PowerPoint kind of thing, right?  It was more like a TV production where you had to have scripts and this idea of segues and you know  They did a lot of funny things too, but it was always it was just enough. I never got corny or cheesy  And I think that's why I kept people entertained and I think that's tough to do and I'm not sure that I don't know  it'll be interesting to see if Google and Apple and the rest of these companies can find that right balance because  Ultimately comes down to like talent like Scott Hanselman. It's not just a great developer  But he's able to be on camera and you know do all that and that's that's hard, right? You can't force that

Transcript:  We were googling RGB to CW  Through the whole thing and nothing came up, but now there's RG. What is it RG V to CW calm?  Somebody registered the domain name. Let me see if I could it'll come up somebody registered the domain name  No, it's not coming up and and made a site before the the keynote was over  I like that kind of geeky stuff. It'll be interesting Google cancelled their Google IO completely they're gonna do it later  But but Apple's developers conferences coming up next month and I think the gauntlets been thrown down  I think Apple's showed I mean Microsoft shown Apple the way to do it  I wonder if Apple will pick it up there historically so buttoned down and careful

Transcript:  we have been spending so much time thinking about this and  There are so many opportunities to talk about this kind of concept  What's so interesting about doing things only digitally is that it opens up avenues that you can't do with any sort of hybrid model  so think about just like the kind of meeting that you have over zoom or Skype in a conference room a  meeting where you have  Five people sitting in a board room and then five people calling in to a video platform. It's a horrible meeting  Yes, the people calling in can't really they don't feel like they're involved in the conversation that's happening in the room  They can't read the social cues that are happening in the room  But when everybody is on zoom or on the you know, the digital platform of choice  It's a completely different thing and everybody is on a level playing field and I wonder if we can get some of that with  Conferences now if there's gonna be really a chance for  One person who's not  Bill Gates to be giving a keynote and to get just as much attention as you know  Bill Gates would be getting if there are ten thousand people in the room when there are only 500 people in the room  I think it'll have a really  leveling effect

I actually find that it's  Almost easier to concentrate. Yeah with just audio and to really like  Home in on the sound and the words being spoken and not getting as wrapped up and what people are doing or what's going  on in their background  Obviously that's different when you have to share screens  You have to work on something together then you need that zoom setting or something similar  But when I when it's just about having a conversation more and more like please just call me

Yeah, and I what has been interesting in our experience is that we really haven't missed a beat  I mean journalism happens from everywhere and always has so in that sense  We were very well set up to to deal with this situation  But what I've been really impressed by is the ability for people across lots of different departments business settings  You know business intelligence  Finance everybody has been working extremely well together  And I don't I don't feel like we really missed a beat and I think a lot of that has to do with  The fact that we have so many options for how we communicate with each other in this moment  It's been it's been fascinating and I spent a lot of time thinking about how okay  Obviously we never wanted this to happen. We never want this to happen again. It's a terrible situation, but we are so much better  Able to handle it now than we would have been ten years ago. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I mean what we I mean

Transcript:  It's almost as if we were preparing for this  Many respects, you know zoom and all of these, you know meet and zoom and Skype and all of these things are relatively recent  Inventions I remember and I mentioned this before in 1965 when I was a kid went to the New York World's Fair and AT&T had a  You know TV phone and  This in the future all your phone calls will be video phone phone calls and I remember 10 20 years later  2001 it came out in the 70s  Where he went dr  Floyd went to the Mar or the moon and he calls his family and there's the kid there having a birthday party on a big screen  In a phone booth and it seemed like the future but it never caught on  Because nobody really everybody nobody really wanted to put on a big screen  Everybody really wanted to put on  Get pants on and stuff for a phone call. So it just never caught on except now. I think this is a  Flip moment in a watershed moment where we're just gonna expect all phone calls to be video  I think it's interesting that you're not as productive in video and you you've it depends on the setting

There's a there's a whole  Storyline about people having a sort of a video  Machine like the one you're describing is a very sort of a sci-fi  But basically FaceTime and then a whole sub economy grows up around  People who make masks that look just like you that you can put in front of the camera so that you can do things like pick  Your toenails all while you're on the video call that seems like you're there.

It's useful when you're wearing a mask  I wish I'd touch ID on my iPhone. In fact, I went back to the iPhone SE because it has touch ID  It's perfect for masks. You can unlock it even when you're wearing a mask  But also I think this is gonna hurt and we were talking about this today with Samable summit or a car guy on the radio show  It might hurt the future of autonomous vehicles and especially ride-sharing  Because nobody wants to ride an uber or a Lyft these days.

Transcript:  Possibly. I mean, I'm more concerned about movie theaters. I'm really wondering how movie theater exactly to survive. So  It really is an interesting time to think about and that's where to work from home stuff is really fascinating and Nadella talked about that  Too that you know more has happened in the last two months than in the last, you know  Five ten years of this and you're right all these companies have been pushing towards this  Although we've seen pushback to right IBM famously made everybody work from home or a large portion of their company  And then they reversed it and they said alright, you got all come back to work  This is all before the pandemic, of course  So there's been this kind of you know, pull and tug regarding work from home whether or not it's effective or not  But now everybody's been pushed into it and you have a lot of companies, you know  Twitter who you know come out and said that you know, we're gonna remain work from home  Microsoft is doing a lot of it as well and  It as good as the technology is it's also revealing a lot of holes in the game as well  So that's what's gonna be real interesting to see how companies pivot now to solve these problems including this idea of like zoom fatigue  Video fatigue that I write needs to do a video call. So how do you solve that?  One area that's been really sort of underplayed but because it's still too early  I think it's course virtual reality augmented reality and I think that's could solve, you know, we saw a mark stuff two years ago  Show off like was it hollow portation where you put on the HoloLens and but they had different cameras and you can actually kind of  You know be as a hologram in someone's room and talk to them physically now.

Transcript:  Generational norms is you're talking about the shift to say video conferencing  but if you look at people under 30 they have been sending each other snapchats and  communicating via images for good point nearly a decade good point and so for them going to video conferencing is a  Logical next step and they're the same people who have been driving the idea of the fluid workspace that we discussed earlier  Because these are kids who went through an entire school system using Google Docs and Google tools  Where they grew up with a model that all of their work would be reviewed by other people as they were doing it  it would be and and it was a really collaborative iterative model of work and  There have been people who study the workplace who have talked about there are real  generational shifts in how folks who went into the workplace in the 80s the 70s 80s and 90s  Regard task flow compared to people who have come in  Having come up on a say the Google Docs model  and I think we're gonna see the same thing when it comes to teleworking and  Having zoom fatigue and things like that because if you had a method of work  That's primarily self-contained and you've got these various structure communications that are either face-to-face or on the phone  You're probably not going to be used to the always-on  visually stimulating  Modes like zoom calls or image chats and things like that  Whereas for kids who have grown up with this is their normal we're gonna have the snap workplace, aren't we?

Start time: 2305.06
End time: 2350.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I actually I have it kind of a different take on that  Which is I think a lot of these kids are very able to be like three different versions of themselves at the same time  So there's the version that you're putting on snapchat and then there's the version on discord, which is mostly voice  And you're doing those things concurrently and they're very very  Able to show only part of themselves and it's the part that they choose and I actually think that the resistance to any sort of  Virtual appearance like the stuff that Facebook and oculus are most certainly working on the ability to let you  Show up in a room with your friends  I think that the resistance to that might be if I have to show up physically whether it's in a

They switch modes in real time though  It was so much it's so fascinating to watch them do it and to realize that their relationship the way they talk to people  compared to the way they talk or  Communicate online with their friends whether it's through texts or emojis or snapchats  It's I  Think that kind of mode switching since it's exhausting, but they're habituated to it  Yeah, and I think that's something that we're probably gonna see a lot more of this is a deep topic

I feel like the pandemic did that it was a catalyst  That's brought on a reaction that all this stuff that was just waiting  To happen has happened. It's fascinating to think about the new normal and what it's gonna look like  But I we do need to take a break. We will we got a great panel man  We're gonna get to get deep and get going on this one  Daniel Rubino from Windows Central.

I only got it about paging  You also dropped out of infant I drop out of everything. I never finished anything. I've been here 15 years  I can't believe it. It's like what is going on?  I'm suddenly suddenly finishing things our show today is brought maybe not it's not done yet our show today is brought to you by  Epson I am a fan of our Epson Eco tank printers these days as you're working from home  You got the kids home. They're doing their homework that printers working a lot harder  The last thing you want to worry about is running out of ink and the beauty of the Epson Eco tank  That's the that's the printer that makes this so easy  supersized easy to fill tanks  It comes when you buy it with a ridiculous amount of ink thousands of pages worth of ink in  In most average use cases, although we're not average anymore, but  Two years. I'm still using the set the I bought a second ink set  So I'd be ready and I'm still using the original set with our eco tank  And it's been almost two years thousands of pages. So, you know in the middle of a print job  You know the kids printing out the report or whatever no more rushing to the store to replace an ink cartridge in between jobs  You can kiss expensive ink cartridges. Goodbye. Eco tank is changing the way  People print look at Shaq there. That's cute  He makes that printer look really small  Go ahead and print all your work reports your task lists your kids homework assignments in  Beautiful color to the kids want the color eco tank makes it easy add it to your online shopping list  so like Shaq you could you too could just fill and  Chill check out Epson Eco tank printers  Their best buy office Depot office max staples and of course Epson comm slash eco tank Leo  Epsom we've I've been using Epson printers since I first got a computer going back to my mx-80 with a tractor feed  And what I love about Epson is they've just kept up with the times and I think the eco tank is the best printer made  Epsom comm slash eco tank Leo Epson exceed your vision  They actually have different sizes I don't I don't it's just his hand is so big  I don't know it's hard to tell it looks like you can hit palm that printer and just pick it up and  Throw it. He's a big guy  Actually, you may you brought this up  Earlier Daniel Twitter says you know what nobody's gonna have to come in and again ever again. That's it. We're all gonna work from home  Facebook said the same thing but then Mark Zuckerberg this week said but we met this was shocking to me  We may adjust your salary depending on where you live. I think a lot of Silicon Valley  Workers are saying great  I can move to Montana by an estate for the price of the rent of my apartment one-bedroom apartment in Silicon Valley and  And still make the same money, but Mark saying well, we're gonna take that and come on

Well, this is something I kept saying on Twitter is everybody was saying  Oh, this is gonna be the end of the California real estate market  This is the end of Silicon Valley because now the town can go anywhere and they'll still pull down these amazing prices  And I thought does nobody remember outsourcing  Because you know a company  In a in a fair and just world a company should pay  Employees by value, but they're always going to be looking at you know  Employee compensation as an expense to be managed and if they can find a way to manage it, that's true.

It's one of the reasons our studios are in Petaluma the rents less  The salaries can be less because it's you can live well in Petaluma  But I think I think I don't know it's this is one of the reasons women get paid less as you know  82 cents on the dollar because the because people still think well the man's got to support a family  So we got to pay him more.

Transcript:  This is really gonna happen with people organic. What's the first thing Marissa Meyer did when she went to Yahoo?  She just told all the work  You're coming in you're coming to work and  I think there is still a very persistent thought that people who are working from home are not working as hard as  People were in the office. There's also the value of having  Coworkers  Especially if you're an engineer or coder having colleagues that you can talk to during the work day  And that's one of the things Microsoft showed I thought in great detail  Hanselman was showing that is part pair programming and ways to work to collaborate even though you're not in the same space  But that's never

Transcript:  Isn't this sort of a live a B test right now? I guess  Yeah, if you continue to be as productive as they were and I assume that that will vary by  specialty and company and  Tools that they use but if a company does find that their workforce is just as productive  Working from home that sort of dispels the whole notion that you're not as productive anywhere from home and and there will in  Theory be no argument against that

Transcript:  Previously so so Lindsay my question to you is one of the deterrents  I've heard from engineers when it comes to the Bay Area is they don't  Like the workaholic lifestyle or the expectation that a 75-hour workweek is the bog is the bog standard  So if you do get a chance to widen your recruitment pool and you're able to pull from other other  You know talented people over the country  Do you think there's the possibility that the culture of Silicon Valley firms might be affected simply because they're gonna have a workforce  That's resistant to some of the cultural expectations that we take for granted around here

Transcript:  I think that's really hard to know but I will say that I hope that it changes  And I I I think that there it could go a couple of different ways and like with anything else  It may depend on the company and the culture of the company in question  But I do think that this time and this this experiment that we're in right now like it or not  Will help us sort out where how we draw boundaries as a corporation how individuals draw boundaries around the workday  We're sort of being forced to because we could in this moment work  200 hours a week and there's really nothing to stop us. And so I think people are gonna  Develop their coping mechanisms  On the other hand humans are humans and some will work themselves to death and some won't work enough and that may just

I roll into my job in five minutes  there's no without commuting without these massive lunch breaks and some of these forced meetings and  People can be more productive, but it does depend on the individual too  a lot of people work from home lots of distractions and  You know, that's that's what's going to change with you know, some people can't adjust to this lifestyle  so that's gonna be an interesting thing going forward I think for  People and how they get evaluated on work and whether or not they can actually, you know handle working from home  But there's something to be said from the lack of wasted time that people aren't being actually productive that counts as going to work

You've got a ham sandwich  Talking to you from the refrigerator  Yeah, what you don't want is the kids home at the same time as you are  Yeah, but if you but if if the kids had a workday where they went to work  IE school and you could stay home that wouldn't be that bad.

There was a yeah, they were even to the point where they were coordinating  their polo shirts to be  It's Microsoft green blue and red. Oh  I didn't catch that but it was a Hanselman told the verge we had scripts and storyboards  We put it on like it was an hour of television  There were there was the bouncing Amiga ball in  In one of the one of the screens during the build event. They were doing all sorts of stuff that only nerds  would notice  Scott had a program that was written an app that was written by Microsoft called presence light that  Changed his hue light bulbs to match his desktop theme.

I'm there for the actual content  It's I'm glad they did that and that goes to again why I felt like there was a lot of talent that got this  To be entertaining for people because a lot of people do enjoy that  For myself die.

Yeah, exactly  You know me you know me so well. I  Thought it was very good. I hope that  This is this is a parallel issue too because conference is one of the things people miss when conferences is the face-to-face  Sure, I think what might happen for both work at home and conferences is you carve out time for the face-to-face?  You have a special, you know a conference is just face-to-face  And and maybe people pay extra to go to build that's just face-to-face and the rest of it  Everybody can stay home and watch or your company has Friday  You know casual day where everybody comes to the office and you have a barbecue and you get some of that collaborative juices going  I think it's possible  Maybe that that's how an adaption adaptation we'd make to them

That's the problem. Yeah  Indoors is bad. Yeah, you know outdoors is less bad, right? You should still be very careful. Please wear a mask  But I've been thinking about how this affects different parts of the United States  You know when I think about my office in the Bay Area and things that we could do collaboratively over time  We might choose to do some of it outside  Manhattan is a different story. Yeah, and the weather will affect our ability to  Meet and greet and collaborate outdoors and is that an advantage for places with more temperate?  weather just during this next year or two when we're trying to

We do have the Windows Central team was using teams  And and teams is really good for just dropping in a video call like right in that chat, which is cool. But um  Now we've got all of future on to slack  That was my choice  I would prefer teams but we do have a bunch of other sites and everybody enjoys using slack  So that actually future wasn't even using a paid version of slack and now you can use a free one. Yeah  Yeah, now they're they're using the free the paid version for it  So but yeah, we just do yeah slack and then then we use telegram for the real  Really yeah, that's where that's where that's where the employees where we hang off  We're not gonna use no corporate spyware.

It's a very large organization. So different parts of the organization were using different technologies. We got  Really fast follow on about the right secure way to pursue  And and kept moving there wasn't a big moment where we all stopped using it  Although I do have kind of a funny  Story about my my son's school district, which is the Berkeley Unified School District. There was a high school class that  Basically shut down using zoom for e-learning because of a security breach or a perceived security breach which was some  The story was it was an adult man who basically took off his clothes and crashed a photography class

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was definitely a moment  I mean, I think it caused the district to really sort out what they needed to sort out the security perspective anyway  So it wasn't all a bad thing  But there's a lot of learning happening in a lot of places that are not that are not tech savvy  I mean all of our employers are pretty savvy  There are a lot of places right now sorting through a lot of questions. No, and I don't want to down

Transcript:  Downplay it because it is actually a big problem  Zoom bombing, but I think everybody by now has learned. I would reason I ask is zoom has made such a concerted effort  To look like they're working hard on security. I'm not sure how much of its  Real and how much of its theater that's kind of unknown. I mean they've hired  Or brought in consultants some of the biggest names in security  they they hired secure code warrior to  to start locking down the code they hired  The former yahoo and Facebook  a  security  Guru well-respected Alex Stamos. They hired Katie Masouras his company to find zero days  I mean they've done a lot. They said we're not gonna add any new features. They even missed a boat on a  Opportunity with Facebook they were working on something with Facebook and had to stop because they didn't want to work on new features  They just wanted to lock it down, but I don't know  I mean, it's great PR. They convinced. I think the world. Oh, yeah, we care about security and we're gonna work on it. I  Don't know how much of a difference it made it's not

Transcript:  Completely cool so much of this comes down to human error and behavior. That's right  I mean if people are going to openly distribute if they want their zoom call to be open and  They're gonna send a URL around right people are gonna join it people are gonna join it and yeah  You have to understand the risks. I think they've done a pretty good job communicating about the risks  at a certain point  people  Often as we know will sacrifice their privacy for convenience, right?  And I am honestly not sure that any company can do much about that

Transcript:  Well, my wife we use zoom we use a lot of different things zoom Google meet and slack  my wife  Was perturbed because we were we use zoom mostly with outside clients sales calls and things like that because they understand how to use it  And when zoom changed it so you had to have a password. It was annoying to her. It's like I don't want a password  I want everybody to be the risk. Yeah, I'll take the risk.

We can't let that happen  So they're taking it out. That's just silly. That's just  Geez Louise  Speaking of failing technology students are failing AP tests  Because they're using their iPhone to take pictures. Of course, the iPhone uses this high-efficiency image  codec and the AP exam apparently can't understand it so the  So when you attempt to upload it to the testing portal at least this is the experience of a high school senior in Los Angeles  He just completed his English literature and comp test last week  He snapped a photo of a written answer with his iPhone.

This is so dumb  But on the other hand, I have a lot of I'm not sure I can call empathy but sympathy for the College Board because  gosh  This scenario in which students could not take proctored exams. Well, that's definitely a feasible one  I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess at the College Board  Isn't the isn't hiring like  World-class engineers, they probably can't pay a world-class salary  And all of a sudden they have a month and a half to completely  Refactor the way that they test basically every college-bound student in the country  And they have to account for hand written tests, right?

To be sitting in an online class, you know three days a week for instance  And and I had to explain that well in a large urban district  There are a lot of kids who still don't have access to a computer  I think busd has handed out many hundreds of hot spots just to give some kids internet access so that they could learn  So big public school districts have been completely unable to make remote classes required  and as a result the teaching is just  It's a shadow of what it used to be not and not because these teachers aren't dedicated

I mean my kids have a fiber connection and so that they can they can upload anything that they need to  Um  But you know, I will say that that it's been interesting to watch the the the reaction overall even with very technically savvy families  To this kind of remote learning  The feedback that i've gotten from my friends and from my kids is that it's sometimes it is just extremely hard to motivate  When every day looks the same and then you're not there with your peers and if you're really into like ap us history  But what you're into is the conversation about us history in the classroom. Yep, and that's gone. Yep  They're just staring out the window. Yeah, I can I

Transcript:  A lot of feedback on zoom fatigue and yeah, lisa. How's your daughter doing?  So  A lot of the issues that lindsay mentioned we've had in alameda as well  I know for our school personally, we didn't start online instruction for two weeks because our elementary school wanted to wait until  every student in the school had both a chromebook and  Regular regular guaranteed internet access. So they did regular technology surveys  Arrange for drop-offs and pickups arrange for internet access and then we were able to start  so  We we started off with the awareness that not every kid was going to have an equal situation going into this to begin with  My daughter is nine and what has been  the predominant  theme that runs through this  Is she really misses working with her peers? Yeah  There's a lot of collaborative learning that goes on at that age  And for all that they have little breakout groups in zoom  that's not the same thing as being able to like bend over a paper with two or three other kids and puzzle things out back and  forth and  They try really hard over zoom and the teachers do a lot of small group work, too  I mean the teachers have really done their best to rise the challenge but  It's it's it's a struggle to remain engaged because you're either spending a lot of time staring at a screen  Or you're trying to work through a math game or you're trying to work through a typing test or something like that and  It is very different from a live living breathing type school situation where you can maybe take a break  Or you can have a friend that can troubleshoot with you if the teacher is busy or the teacher can come over the teacher's aid can come over  it's  It's been a mixed bag  Yeah, i'm grateful for the structure

It's it's  It's been very hard to plan for special education for anybody who needs it  um, you know technology only gets us so far and and  And then we rely on each other and when that last part is gone, I think it's been very very difficult

Like there's not gonna be that kind of level of engagement. What's really cool is I almost feel feel like that level in minecraft  Is sort of this idea of like where we're going today, right?  We're just talking about with work from home and this idea of  People and kids being already used to having these sort of virtual relationships  And you can do that with different levels of gaming and minecraft is I would say a high level because  You can sit there really get into conversations with people  It's already kind of training kids for that new world which we're in right now

They built a whole beautiful twit city  This is a video that he made  In 2013 when he was still at twit seven million views since then and i'm very happy for chad  He does it on his own now he said I at one point he said i'd like to do this  Myself, I think I can make some money at this and we said all right  And he is now at one million subscribers omgcraft. So we're very proud of chad johnson who we still love  one million subscribers  And I feel a little bit of proprietary joy for him because we did start that show way back  When in the twit cottage and I have a feeling that one of the reasons he's done so well is  He hung in there, but also minecraft has just taken off minecraft is huge  So congratulations chad used to produce this show  Was my one of my producers?  uh speaking of success joe rogan  Uh going to spotify the most successful podcaster of all time  According to joe rogan  Well, and I believe him he says he has 190 million downloads a month that I find a little  Mind boggling.

Transcript:  But I I look it's pretty clear joe is the number one podcast in the world and he he i'll tell you who's given him  Some validity spotify just took him over  Uh, he's gonna make they're gonna make the joe rogan podcast an exclusive on spotify wall street journal estimates. That's a deal worth more than  100 million dollars he is on youtube, but there will no longer be joe rogan shows on youtube just excerpts  Um all of his shows going back 11 years will be on spotify starting september 1st  And at some point before the end of the year  And this is the thing that worries me it will be exclusive to spotify spotify spent  They said they were daniel x their ceo said they were spending a half billion dollars  to acquire podcast networks  And they bought gimlet they bought parkast  They bought anchor fm. They bought the ringer  and they are trying to build an exclusive podcast empire and exclusive is an important word because  That makes them more valuable to advertisers because if you have to listen on the spotify app  Then advertisers will know exactly who listened when for how long  There won't be any and there's not any good way as you  I wish you hadn't said it but there's not a good way lisa as you pointed out  To measure that we don't know, you know, we can we can count downloads from our server, but that's about all we can do  Rss podcasts might suffer a little bit  With if spotify succeeds apple apparently  Does not want to let spotify succeed they're beefing up their podcast operation. In fact, they apparently are looking for people to  to hire  to run  I don't know if they'll be exclusive  But uh to run podcasts at apple so i'm glad i'm in a in a growing industry

I mean if I were a big joe rogan fan, which I am not but I I am one of the yes  I'm one of the apple music people like I never got in deep with spotify  But if I were a big fan, I might be like, okay.

No, it didn't not not with those youtube shows and you know, there's been  Hits and misses there and it'll be interesting to see what happens with podcasts  I know the thing about podcasts that really drives people nuts is there's a very very diy element to it both in creating  The actual show anyone can do it, you know and then build up  But there's also a diy aspect in terms of listening to it because you can get any sort of podcast app  Subscribe to drss feed and download it and control it and there's been a whole sub market of those kind of apps and now with  you know it going to spotify and you know a lot of other podcasts going to spotify and  I guarantee you apple and everybody else will start doing this as well  That whole industry is going to die and people are going to lose the control  They're going to go to these specific apps no different than what we're seeing with video on demand in terms of amazon and netflix  You don't know where this show you want to watch lives it's frustrating right and so this is going to same thing

It's gonna get  There's usually a land rush on afterwards to try to create networks  Or try to create the walled garden  Or to try to create an exclusive channel and monetize under the premise that people will be willing to pay for it  and but  On the I think what i'm getting at is  Will it be?  Not great if you're a joe rogan fan and you cannot or will not subscribe to spotify for whatever reason and you're going to miss out  On back shows and archives and this thing you've that you've loved.

You guys should listen but  um  We haven't we haven't obviously pursued any sort of exclusivity and one of the things that's charming about podcasts right now  And I am frankly surprised it took this long  For this joe rogan style  Turf war to happen  Because it has been such a joy to say get our podcast on your podcasting platform

I don't think that um, I think that it will work  I think that you know, we all know that it's a truism that content is king and if you have content that you can't get  Somewhere else you'll go to that place and that and that's why the streaming landscape is so confusing right now  And and all of the networks have proven that if you have a piece of content that has a huge fan base  They will sign up for one more account to get it  So we haven't gone there yet with the podcasts that we're producing in the in the group that I manage but  But but I wouldn't be surprised if the industry moves there.

We we actually were a launch partner when spotify started doing podcasts  We were very glad to be on the stage there with daniel eck  but I would never go exclusive to any platform I wouldn't want to go exclusive to any platform because  Kind of my ethos is well, it should be wherever anybody goes.

I know at absolutely zero  Uh faulting of joe  I'm just i'm i'm i'm hoping that spotify's strategy  does not hurt  Traditional rss podcasting because I think there's a lot to be said for  This and it's somewhat freewheeling. You could start a wrestling podcast. You could start a cheapskate show  Uh, that's the beauty of it. Um, you know anybody could start a show and it can do well  Because you don't have to make a deal with a content  Gatekeeper you can just put it out there and I want to I want to see it that way  It's kind of like blogging, uh, too and I want to see it stay

Start time: 6191.52
End time: 6243.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the big challenges with podcasts and it's both leveling and um and frustrating and and i'm sure you know this is that  If you are just a person who and this happened with blogging too  If you're a person who just puts it out there and you diy your content and it's good  It is so hard now to be discovered  Yes  It was five years ago in the podcast world  It's a huge problem now and I think the one benefit that could come from more structure in the podcast world is discoverability. I mean  you know apple has  Squandered this a little bit but they but they do spend some time curating  Podcasts for for the public that is a little bit of a service. I am surprised that there aren't more  Services out there further curating the podcast world  But but we're missing that guidance and I think hopefully it'll come from from what's happening now in one way or another

I mean some of it is that you know, like chad johnson  He spent years  Working really hard producing a ton of great content  And i'm sure it was frustrating and and in the beginning and and challenging in the beginning  But eventually he built a big audience and now i'm sure he's doing fine

It's what happens with maturity in any industry  The money gets in  But I just I love I'm just i'm kind of an old hippie  I just I like the idea that anybody can do a blog anybody can do a podcast  You know that was what the internet changed was you didn't have gatekeepers anymore. You didn't have to  You know talk a  Publisher into publishing your book. You could just self publish it  You didn't have to talk a record company into producing your record  You could just put it out and you could succeed

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that the downside the flip side of what you're describing leo is that  So now that you can self publish say a novel, let's talk about the the book industry for a minute  You can self publish a novel  You probably won't get attention unless you know somebody who knows somebody  Or unless there's something so astounding about it that it gets kind of picked up  um  It used to be that you could talk a publisher into publishing your novel if it was good and you could and you could go through the traditional  routes through an agent find an agent find a publisher  Now it's almost even harder because publishers have been stretched so thin  Right that they go to just where the money is  They're less likely because they have so much data at their hands to take a risk on somebody who's unknown  And it's almost like this flattening had this really good effect for access in the beginning  and now  People are finding themselves wishing

We'll talk about that last pass  Is a very good partner to have today  As we have more and more employees working from home. It's really been a  Lifesaver for us you you've got a plan for the unexpected and the beauty of last pass  I'm very I feel very fortunate that we moved to last pass a few years ago last pass enterprise. I've always used it at home  It's it's you know, initially it was a password manager, but now it's much more now  It really is about making sure that the right people are using  The resources that they're entitled to keeping control of those things and when you have employees going home  Employees who have access to our bank accounts to our databases to our servers  It's important that we secure all of that last pass can be deployed quickly  In the midst of any event to ensure that your business  Continues to run smoothly that every employee that login is secure  They do in a lot of ways now much more than just password management singles a single sign-on is a big one  I love this about 1200 plus single sign-on apps that work with last pass  I I like it because it's more secure and employees like it because it's easier to use  And it continues to have control and and insight access to who's accessing what from where and that's really important  Of course, they have the best password management  They always have and you get complete oversight of shadow it enforceable policies across all password protected accounts  They've also added some interesting multi-factor authentication  So of course, you've got biometric authentication on most phones now, but in addition to that  You've got contextual  Factors like geo location  IP address that help you make sure the right people are using the right tools if you're using a vpn for instance  Of course the vpn is a login  Your employees are using that login  But you can also use last pass to add multi-factors of that login making sure that you've got the right people accessing  Your network and some of the things last pass does is so smart  Don't they never send or store the master password?  That means last pass can't access your data. And if they can't neither can hackers  Encryption happens exclusively at the device level before you sync to last pass  Only users can decrypt their data only at the device level and by the way every device windows mac linux android ios  I use last pass everywhere password sharing can be done securely and easily even if employees are at home  I just I can't recommend last pass more highly it is the way to secure your business  I am so glad we're using it especially now that many of our most of our employees are working from home  You should be using it too last pass can make remote work simple and secure last pass.com  Find out how they can help your business stay productive last pass.com  twit a great partner  in this  special time  Special time and we're coming, you know, the other thing that's booming  Thanks to quarantine is streaming tv  This was it next week hbo max is coming  Even apple is starting to beef up its lineup on apple tv plus by both buying older tv shows  It turns out catalog is pretty important  On streaming networks and apple just spent 70  million dollars  To get the new tom hanks movie  Which was supposed to appear in theaters about now  and uh can't obviously normally what the what the  Producers have been doing is  Putting them on for 20 dollar rentals. I watched a number of movies that were supposed to come out. We just watched emma  The hunt that was wild paid 20 dollar rental but that we would have paid that much to go see in the theater  So that was okay  This is though interesting this movie greyhound  Which is all done  will premiere on  exclusively on apple tv  plus  and the bidding war for this sony pictures movie, which was  Supposed to come out father's day  Really heated up apple ended up paying according to deadline  70 million dollars for this movie, which was written and produced by tom hanks  wow  I think it's a it's a prestige play as much as a they're not going to make the money back with subscriptions

I would especially because I have technically a free subscription. I'd actually watch the content  Um  So that's where some companies, you know disney did a very good job  They on day one it was available everywhere and that's where but apple is gets into this  You know, they they it's cracking a little bit, right?

Transcript:  I think that it is the it's the hash. This is actually written by jones soulsman who covers streaming media for us and  um, I think that it has to do with the overlay of  The content providers the people who make the content like hbo. Yeah, it's all the tables the service providers  and so there's a lot in this article about the overlap of  At&t and hbo and what you're already paying for and whether you're getting this through your cable  Provider or you're getting it as a add-on  And that just creates this incredibly complicated landscape.

Start time: 7410.38
End time: 7427.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

They just come in. That's cashfly at work. They've been delivering content since 1999  We've been using them almost since the beginning of twit. I'm a huge fan of cashfly partly because they save us money  I mean they they are  30 faster than the competition and they cost less  They also do some really nice things. They smooth out the cost  Of your cdn by by you know, we're very peaky as as most downloads are whether it's podcasts or applications or data of any kind  You know tends to be peaky you kind of maybe worry on some cdns. Oh am I going over my contact cap?  Not with cashfly they average it out over a year  So, you know exactly what you're going to pay month after month and now they have something really cool  This is a little complicated, but if you use a cdn, you'll get it. It's called 100 cash shield  And it's going to save you so much money a drastic reduction in data transfers fees with  A aws's s3 and other cloud storage origins because your cash hit ratio with the cdn will be 100  Essentially you're putting your storage not on these third parties, but on cashfly  which means when  You get a a cash hit  When you get your cash items being evicted  For large one-off requests costing you a fortune in data transfer out fees  Well, it just doesn't happen with 100 cash shield and cash flies guaranteed availability. You just avoid that  It's a next generation content delivery solution for today and tomorrow. You keep your content and data closer to your customers  You don't have to go over the public internet traffic from other companies  You buy as much space as you want your data will always be fetched from 100 cash shield rather than the origin  Shielding can reduce your origin spend by thousands of dollars a month and  And this is no insignificant side benefit. There are no more cash misses  You're going to improve your download speeds. There'll be no more buffering  Guaranteed availability the highest quality of service if you're streaming video  It'll scale reliably to reach global audiences of any size if you're if you're doing gaming you get hyper fast download speeds  Low latency in a scalable solution your podcast will be delivered quickly and reliably without delays or timeouts and I can vouch  For that lightning fast digital download speeds for large digital files no matter where your customers are  I love cash fly  And because they're all over the world their global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses are delivered five times faster  than from your origins  just for twit listeners  Cash fly's giving away a complementary detailed analysis of your current cdn bill and usage trends  You may be paying as much as 20 more than you have to  This is no pressure. Just bring them your bill bring them your usage  And they could tell you if you'll save twit  dot cash fly  Dot com twit dot cash fly.com. Thank you cash fly  for saving me  big time  Oh, there's so many stories we haven't got to let me see um  What about the grandma ordered to delete her facebook pictures of her gram children?  This is just a silly story  A gdpr action apparently a mother and daughter were having a fight grandma was posting pictures of the grandkids  The daughter said knock it off grandma said no, they're my grandkids  They went to court  And the judge ruled that the matter was within the scope of the general data protection regulation gdpr  The grandma  Is ordered to remove the photos or pay a fine of 50 euros a day up to a thousand euros  And if she posts more images of the grandkids in the future she'll be fined an extra 50 euros a day

Transcript:  So  I actually did have this conversation with both sets of grandparents. Oh, okay  Okay  and my reasoning and my thinking was it's my job to  Be a responsible steward of my daughter's image and her name and whatever her profile online is right now  That's fair because she doesn't have the tools to do it. Yep. And so  Because they are part of her  Circle in the family. They also  My argument to them was they also have that obligation because they're adults. Yes  And so I wanted to make sure that if they were going to post pictures  That the people that they accepted as facebook friends were people they could vouch for in real life  that they were people they felt comfortable exposing this information to  and  That they would also understand if my daughter or I at any future point reserve the right to ask them to take it down  And it was a little bit of a weird conversation to have  because  One parent one grandparent was like how is this any different than throwing?  Student pictures in an envelope and sending them out with a christmas card  I had to say well, that's a good point

Transcript:  Replicated and reused and downloaded and like you lose control in a way that you don't have a physical object  And so we did have to work through the idea that we'd like to think that everybody that we know digitally online is a good actor  That's not always the case  Please be responsible about assessing and evaluating  And then once my daughter hit elementary school, we started  Passing everything by her like if I mentioned her on twitter  I make sure that I talk to her about it first and she's okay with what we tweet  Sometimes she's like you can tweet what I just said  And we do the same thing with pictures and it's an ongoing discussion with you know, this is your  You're you're gonna you're gonna have a public data trail and as your parents it's our job to start you off strong  And hopefully give you the skills to build it up over time on your own and take it over by the time you're in your teens

Transcript:  Good news with for section 230 fans  This is the communication decency act section that says that social networks are not responsible  They're not they're common carriers in effect. They're not publishers of the content  There was a lawsuit  Against facebook from back in 2016 because facebook hosted accounts  At least the lawsuit claimed knowingly belonging to hamas, which is of course classified as a terrorist organization  Under section 230 that you know, you can't sue a website for that  But the lawsuit said facebook's algorithm  There's the algorithm again promoted terrorist content to people who liked similar pages or posts  And as a result, they should be more liable their immunity should be reduced or eliminated  uh  They lost in court this lost in court facebook one second circuit court  Shot down the complaint saying there's no basis for making facebook liable because it arranged content with algorithms  It was appealed to the supreme court and this week the supreme court  Rejected the case letting these rulings stand so a victory for section 230, I guess you agree

Transcript:  This is always that tough case scenario, right?  It's I mean it comes down to freedom of speech not in this exact case  But those are the examples used it's never the things you want to hear that we all agree upon  It's always tough cases. Yeah, the ones that are like is this what we really want because no one is going to public  Oh, yeah, we should let terrorist groups and  Let them use these platforms for this stuff. But at the same time  Yeah, you can't have these companies being completely responsible  What needs to be done is put pressure on these companies to figure out how they can solve these problems with your algorithms and everything

Start time: 8130.97
End time: 8204.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I  you know  Yes  and I think that the the problem here is that when we talk about free speech we're often talking about the ability to share your  opinion even if it's controversial or or negative  And then the responsibility of a private company when it comes to that to what degree is facebook?  You know a utility right versus  Just a service that that makes it makes money through passing along information  I think that that an  Algorithm promoting something is in a way effectively an endorsement of that  Interesting not necessarily an endorsement of the content itself  But an endorsement of the power of the content and it gives it power amplifying something it amplifies it  Yeah, right. It's saying  More people should fire this we have decided right that more people should hear this and and we in this case is the algorithm  Um, and that's and that's where it gets really really tricky  But I I I tend to fall on the side of caution here, right? Like go ahead and put your stuff there  But but if it is dangerous and that's where it gets really easy

Transcript:  Spread it it's it's a tough. It's a it's really tough. I mean, I I we were talking about this at home the other day  and I I kind of think that  um the laws in this country around free speech and what that means and and how it was interpreted came before the ability for  Machines to amplify a thought right?  It's the same we have printing presses  But we but you had to you had to have the resources to do that and maybe we need to take another look at it

Transcript:  Well, very famously  Yeah  Mere months after the first amendment was passed the federal government passed the sedition act  Which was was completely against freedom of speech it permitted the deportation fine or imprisonment  Of anyone publishing false scandalous or even malicious writing in the united states against the government. So that was in 1798. So  We have a long and checkered history about the first amendment in this case. It's not the government  Restricting what face I guess it would be the government restricting what facebook could do  But it is facebook's right to publish or not publish  Stuff I think the algorithm argument is very interesting. We have the same problem with youtube promoting  Extremist content algorithmically. I don't I don't think that the youtube employees or staff or google wants to do that  But the algorithm does  At what point don't they become responsible for what the algorithm's doing?

Start time: 8290.82
End time: 8317.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and how is the algorithm you know humans have  You know, there's certainly, you know, there's the old pornography, you know when you see it  Issue and if you rely on humans and you know when you see it to make educated decisions about what is appropriate to share  And what isn't and then you that's one thing  Turning those decisions over to an algorithm is fully another thing because that algorithm is probably always going to move to our most base  Instincts not our most educated instinct. Yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, that's why they work  Exactly. Finally, I mean, I don't mean finally like this finally happened. I mean our final story  Walmart is discontinuing jet.com. It bought it for three billion dollars. It was an attempt to go after amazon  It had an interesting  Algorithmic base the pricing was based on  You know the situation I guess and how much you bought etc, etc  Walmart needed to get an online  You know to online sales to compete with amazon they bought jet four years later  They discontinuing it visits to the site have plummeted the brand is not taking off  That's a pretty big loss for walmart, although  I gotta point out walmart's doing all right in e-commerce 74 percent surge in online sales

Transcript:  It's I think the story of jet is interesting because the guy I founded at mark lore  Founded it because he hated amazon. He had started  um diapers.com and soap.com  In 2005 and amazon essentially took it down in a price war. They've done this before with other  uh other online stores by just undercutting them  And eventually he was forced to sell to amazon  Amazon acquired both brands for 545 million dollars the company the parent company's quid-c  He left quid-c in 2013  And then started jet.com three years later to try once again  To beat the amazon juggernaut juggernaut  uh, i'm sorry  He started at 2013 three years later. He sold it to walmart to walmart for 3.3 billion  And now here we are seven years later and amazon's a lot of money on

I was uh, I was doing a radio show in  1992 I was doing a syndicated  Computer talk show with the vorac  And I got a call from this guy halsey minor who was a hedge fund  You know boy boy wonder  Uh saying hey, we're starting we want to start a television network about computers  You seem to be the only one doing a national computer talk show  You should come to work for us. I said, okay, he made me I think I was a vp of marketing  There was only four of us. It was him shelby bonnie another hedge fund guy and financier  And I think there was one other person working there  Uh, the first job he gave me was well, how much is it going to cost for us to start a 24-hour tech network?  This is 1992  Then I came back saying let me give you an example  cnn  took them  50 million dollars a year for 10 years before they made any money. That's half a billion dollars. How much do you have halsey?  And at that point and I take some credit for this they pivoted to the website strategy with a little tv on the side  Uh, he also fired me but that was another man  That's another story for another day.

Oh, yes. Yes quite a character the weird thing about  Halsey, he never told me I didn't work for him. He just went radio silent  This was that shortly after and I boy I kicked myself he said  You know, we need some and if you could put ten thousand dollars into this i'd give you I don't know 20 percent  and uh  And I said, you know, I just bought a house halsey. I I don't have any cash  Anyway, little did I know what did I know i'm an idiot. Um  so  Six months later. He says come on and visit. This is when he was in the railroad car  Down on the waterfront  Yeah, I remember that office remember that yeah, he was in a railroad car. He said come on down  I'd like to show you my railroad car  and uh  Basically, he said, you know  zd  As if davis is looking for a tv guy.

They hired me so that went well, but that was a weird  Interregnum, I don't even know if they paid me. I can't even remember if I  The real reason halsey didn't like me is he wanted to go down to sigrath  And he said would you get the airplane tickets? We'll go down to sigrath  We'll see what's going on at the this a big was a big graphics conference conference  And I made the mistake of instead of buying  A nice jet airplane tickets.
