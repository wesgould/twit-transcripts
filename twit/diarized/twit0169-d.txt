Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm local so that means I just walked I walked to the office.  He walked to twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was great.  Wow.  So the twit limo did not pick him up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't necessary.  They it was it was offered.  I said no I'll just walk.  I need the exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Patrick Norton long time.  We haven't seen you.  It's good to have you back.  Thank you Patrick.  It's good to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been traveling for family deaths and I finished anathem so I was underground for a  couple of weeks thanks to those two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to get your review of anathem in just a second but before that let's say hello to the  fastest man on the planet zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds Jason Calacanis.  Hello everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm calling you live from the Tesla.  I'm on the 405 freeway right now.  Hold on.  Whoa.  The battery powered Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.  Yeah.  It's great to have you back everybody.  Oh well.  So.  Gosh I want to get a review of anathem but I want to get a review of the Tesla too.  I can't decide.  I'll flip a coin.  Well actually I get the first question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason did you get one of the major networks to videotape the unboxing or is it delivery  of your Tesla.  It doesn't come from the Tesla.  It comes from the Tesla.  It doesn't come in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't.  They prep it at the Tesla dealership in Santa Monica so they will drop it off to your house  actually and they sound like a sales rep and stuff like that.  But I wanted to go to the dealership to get it.  So this is exciting.  So did you get an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did you find out you were going to finally get because it's been how long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I ordered it I think two years ago.  Whoa.  I have the number 16 car.  So the serial number is like zero zero zero zero zero one six.  Oh that's good.  You can go on my Flickr account and actually I took some pictures and just sent them up  before the show.  Is that your VIN or.  That's the VIN number.  Yeah.  So the VIN number ends in like five zeros and then a one six.  Making it truly a collector's edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is your Flickr stream Calacanis.  What is the.  It's a Jason Calacanis.  All right.  I'm going to go look at those pictures and drool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yours is number 16.  Yes.  Tesla is claiming they've delivered around 60.  They've had deposits on 1200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And.  So there are 27 cars called the Founders series for the investors in the company.  Then they started the general production for people who you know like lined up and  bought cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so there was 27 and then and then your number 16 of the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the cars the cars don't go aren't delivered sequentially they're delivered at  because I had the same question because I was grilling them like where the hell is my  car.  And so I had a special custom.  Well I don't know if it's custom or whatever.  But I had a I got a unique color and unique interior and I think that added a little bit  of time.  And I also got a special coating for the paint that keeps it from chipping like a special  carbon fiber coating.  Did you have to pay extra for the orange.  No the orange is one of the available colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was your that was your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The best looking color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like a pumpkin.  It looks like an electric pumpkin.  I mean it's going to look good right now in this season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's always this season actually in L.A.  It's always summer.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what is it a mink lined interior.  What was the special interior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just this leather interior but it's two tone so it's pretty black and orange.  You know it looks like you know it looks like one of those Argentinian Vaya cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a little disappointed.  I was hoping for ostrich skin or mink or or you know stingray.  You know some good classic cowboy boot leather.  Actually I like the orange.  That's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look in your Skype window for the for two other URLs because there are some photos from my  China trip in the in between the Tesla photos.  So I just sent you two photos of the whole car and also the USB key.  It comes with a USB key.  It comes with a USB key.  And the reason it comes with a USB key is because you can download the data from the  car and actually send it to Tesla.  So let's say you were I don't know you drove somewhere for the weekend you can't get to  the Tesla dealership something's wrong.  You can upload the data and I think there's going to be some other uses for it.  But there's a USB key like under the dashboard you stick in this test USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We saw those Patrick before with the with the little devices that would record the  readings on the car's computer that you know how fast your kid went and that kind of  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I mean basically it's it's it's not IMDB per se but it's it's yeah same basic  concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be great if they had that you know with cameras you know you can with high end  cameras you can pop a smart a smart card in there and pull all the settings down.  So it'd be really good if you could just go from one person's Tesla to another and have  it just change all the settings for you know automatically.  Yeah exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually that's a really good idea.  But I think there's a lot of opportunity with actually doing like hacks to the car and  APIs.  Obviously you don't want to hack the you know drive train and stuff like that.  But I myself first thing does.  I'm having a hackaday guys work on a couple of hacks for it now that we have it.  Oh neat.  And one of the hacks is going to be to connect speakers on the outside of the car to the  RPMs so that it will make some noise because when you drive the car it literally sounds  like the Millennium Falcon which is what we've been we've been calling it the Falcon.  It goes.  It goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that's an electric motor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's the electric motors sound when they're 11 inches across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now do you find that you surprise people more often now like when you're coming up and  then they're not looking.  They don't even see you.  No of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to hit a pedestrian in the next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was talking to somebody and outside of our office and I was talking to them and then  I drove off and they said they turned around and I was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like Batman he was just gone.  There was actually.  Jason's the next Batman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Legislation is actually being proposed that electric cars are going to have to have some  kind of associated noise because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually is a company up here that makes a little thing it goes on a speaker on your  electric car that makes electric car sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like it's like your digital camera has to make that little clicking sound.  Yeah you have to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have that built but I'm going to put a thing on the dashboard where you  can pick what you want it to sound like.  So Ferrari and Lamborghini.  I want to be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to sound like like so Boba's pod in Star Wars you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm actually thinking of making it sound like slave one Boba Fett's car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a Tesla good tarp pick it comes with too.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it comes with a really like heavyweight keychain and it's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  60,000 you get a keychain.  Is there a T-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The base price is one hundred nine for the car.  I mean listen it's expensive.  You know I like what you said I get in my bus my chops busted about buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know and I really like what you said in Twitter about it which is that it's not for  you. It's not about buying an expensive car.  It's about forwarding doing doing what you can to forward electric car development.  I think that's really noble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I think it's awesome.  If I had your money and you know the kids college education was you know taking care  of and all that I would certainly be glad to spend one hundred and ten thousand on a  car. But it's just I really I really want Tesla to get through the financial situation  they're in so that they can start building more affordable cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They plan to. They're building a coupe right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to build a four door and I actually saw the early.  It's not publicly out yet but I know the CEO of the company and so he showed me the  mock ups the clay like life size mock ups of the four door and it is gorgeous.  I mean I told him immediately I want to be the number one person.  I'll put the deposit down now.  So I'm trying to angle for getting the first one of those but it's a sixty thousand dollar  thing and it looks sort of gosh I don't know what I'm allowed to say or not but basically  like an Austin Martin combined with a Porsche and a Maserati like sort of in that vein of  like a fast looking four door car.  It's a grand touring automobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't wait to get one. I'd like to be on that list too actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well actually I'll talk to him about that because you would actually be a good person to  have you know out there talking.  What is the deposit on.  I think they make you pay in full for the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo Leo you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you OK. Pay in full and you waited two years.  Somebody get the defibrillator.  I thought maybe I put 100 bucks down or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can. In order to test drive the current Tesla you have to put down a five thousand  dollar deposit. Yeah.  Which is refundable with one hundred dollar fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I you know I would I would actually just just like you I want to forward the development  of electric cars. My fear though is that in a couple of years there'll be five different  people making electric cars and there may be other models out there.  I mean I think Tesla is going to be the premier electric car for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they have a massive head start.  You know like whenever you are doing something truly innovative you you basically have to  fail a lot. Right.  Which is sort of I think why fail culture on the Internet.  You know fail whales and all that.  Yeah. I think fail culture is a testament to innovation.  You can't really innovate unless you deal with a lot of BS and a lot of pain and a lot  of failure. And you know Tesla had a lot of problems I think getting the car out but  they solved a lot of problems and I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm impressed. I mean this is a beautiful looking car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've delivered so many cars now and they're delivering.  That's a beef bowl from Tokyo.  OK. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is these are your Chinese and Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just got back to Japan. That's my new friend.  Oh she's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's low. It's awesome. I was supposed to speak at it but I actually can't right  now because we're in the middle of a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to. Alex you're leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.

Transcript:  And Patrick you and I are going to go to  Coney Island hot dog stand down at the end of Ocean Street I think a little later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Abby's in France right now she's loving it but no clue.  No free shipments back to Petaluma.  Not yet. I'm praying for them.  Oh we're going to pause for a moment while Alex gets his espresso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh thank you thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jolly good jolly good.  You're going to like espresso.  I have a macchiato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get some tech news in here before people send me nasty notes.  Nasty notes.  So in the interesting Obama's going to have to give up his blackberry.  And he's not.  People are not convinced he's going to be able to do it.  He's apparently quite the addict.  Anytime you see the president elect in pictures he's got.  In fact I saw that when he just after he got elected.  He and Michelle are coming out of the door there.  She's got the bouquet. He's got his blackberry.  He's not even looking where he's going.  He's got his face glued to the blackberry.  The whole time.  But apparently because of something called the Presidential Records Act.  I didn't know this but George W.  Bush gave up email when he became president eight years ago.  He actually sent out an email to 42 regular correspondents saying.  Given let me see I might find the quote that he sent out to his friends.  This is a New York Times article from Today's New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically they make them record everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The Presidential Records Act puts all presidential correspondents in the public  domain essentially.  It's up for public review. It's part of the official record.  It can be subpoenaed freedom of information acted.  So Bush said by the way did you know George Bush's email address before he became  president was G 94 B at AOL dot com.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.  He sent out an email saying since I don't want my private conversations looked at by  those out to embarrass the only course of action is not to correspond in cyberspace.  This saddens me. I've enjoyed conversing with each of you.  You sent this out to friends that he'd been emailing saying I can't do it now I'm  president. Now here we are eight years later.  Obama lives on his blackberry effect.  According to this story even his briefing books and his speech preparation was sent  to him on his blackberry.  They weren't printed out for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah but there's there's no there's no reason he cannot continue to use his blackberry  read on dot dot read only.  Well or or you know all with all if I understand the law all they have to do is record  every message he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well they will. And I guess that.  Yeah. OK. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean it's that's not that's just it's a matter of whether or not he is willing to  make you know I mean it's basically whether or not he is willing to involve everyone who  might communicate with him in that fashion.  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what happened public and what happens when his ex-girlfriend from college e-mail  smuts like hey remember that night when we got really trash and that's a good point.  That's and then like all of a sudden that's public record you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah but I think the the in the terms of the two year election somebody would have taken  advantage of that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah no you're right.  Well he's certainly been heavily vetted.  I think this is not your in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean people send me emails that I don't want published like I'm like why are you  putting that in email.  Come on.  You know like wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's a good point.  How many of us would want every email message we've ever gotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's that's part of the vetting process.  If you look at if you look at the there's like a 63 page questionnaire going out there  and one of them is have you ever seen sent any emails that you would be embarrassed  about in the future.  I'm like oh man worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen this questionnaire.  It is insane.  They not only say have you have you ever sent they say we want copies of every posting  you have ever made to the Internet.  They who's sending this out.  If you want to work in the White House the White House does to anybody who has applied  for a job in the White House.  Let me see if I could find it because I think I I bookmarked it on delicious.  If you're applying for a job in the White House they will.  There's a seven page questionnaire in which you're asked.  Here it is.  It's from a nine page questionnaire.  It requires all applicants to list and if possible provide copies of all quote posts  or comments on blogs or other websites they have ever made.  Also required all aliases or nicknames ever used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See what's interesting about that is does that mean like on one hand I can completely  understand the White House and it does.  I don't think it has this a you have to Democratic thing or probably.  Obviously they have they don't want to be blindsided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want to my space side from an aide to suddenly come out and you know they're  dancing naked on a table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This could also be their way of like telling people OK you can send it in and say like  nothing embarrassing but in the future don't do anything stupid online.  You know like it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's I mean it but it's an interesting thought like if people I mean can you imagine  if they they vetted and then they can track some.  I mean it's just it's just a fascinating like you know let's see how Luddite a community  we can force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's the problem is you're saying to the president you can't use any modern  technology which completely hobbles him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're saying to the president you're saying that you what you're saying is to the staff  the staff has to be able to account for everything they've ever done online which is  non-trivial.  Who could do that.  I can't do that.  I think it means if you're like 19 it's probably doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  19 forget it 19 is when you're at your worst.  But I mean like I know I mean here's what most 19 year olds haven't been through a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  shorter.  They have a shorter paper trail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's where's what's it.  Remember in the Clinton administration they didn't do a very good job of vetting  people they had Zoe Baird they had Lonnie Guigné they had all of these appointments  that you know had all sorts of trouble.  Kimber would remember because she had you know illegal alien nannies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I know but the thing is about all this stuff like actually I know Zoe Baird like  she's brilliant she's like awesome.  She would have been brilliant.  Absolutely.  It was incredible.  And like I don't know what the thing with her was I think maybe she had used a private  jet or something like that or I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No no I believe it was she was also a case of a nanny that they hadn't paid taxes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Give me a break.  It's like in L.A.  you you just see busloads of illegal immigrants stomping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah but that's and I guess that's the point of all of this is generally speaking it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  higher standard of behavior from the federal government.  And here's my question are we asking too high a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm not talking about Zoe Baird.  I'm talking about are we saying you can't use as chief executive the most important  business in the world the free world.  You can't use email because somebody might get a hold of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're confusing Leo you're confusing the issues the issue the issue of the president  the president and all of his communication being public property is a separate and I  think it's important to separate his issue with using technology which in the you know  Bush decided I don't want to deal with whatever mayhem may result in this.  I don't want my friends to tell me about you know I don't want a friend to email me and  say hey so and so is in the hospital and have that suddenly turn into a public debate.  What.  But what I think is considerably more interesting is you know vetting the White House staff  and the fact that if you want to work you know I mean it's it's there's a level of  transparency for anybody in government at this point that has never existed before.  You know from the relationship between you know the White House and Congress to the press  all the way down to I mean things like this a 63 page questionnaire and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how much of it is because bloggers and 24 hour news cycle we eat our young.  I mean how much of it is really appropriate and how much of it is if you had you know  one Piccadillo 40 years ago their press is going to eat you alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the dangerous thing here is that you end up with this lowest common denominator.  It's the same thing when you go into to be on a jury and you eliminate all the people  who can who you know who have who can't do this or have conflicts there or whatever and  you end up with a jury oftentimes that you wouldn't be that excited about being in front  of you know or most people wouldn't be.  The the issue is is that you're most technologically anybody who's been in tech for a while  is going to have posted something on the Internet.  They probably might cross where that is or have definitely have sent emails out.  I mean I know that I sent emails out that I was embarrassed about like last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This isn't a tech issue.  You know the Internet is no longer a tech thing.  Nobody I know most people I know who are on the Internet's are not technical.  Here's why it's here's a million of people on Facebook.  This is no longer a technical issue.  OK so we will hire generation.  But I mean think about it.  There's there's also an entire generation.  I mean it was it University of Texas the kid posting the text message from one of his  friends about.  Oh it's hideous.  His kid gets a text message from a friend that says we've got a delete expletive in the  White House. Get your guns.  We're going hunting.  It's immediately posted to his Facebook page or MySpace page.  And you know pretty much 24 hours later he's out of the service.  He's out of the well he's also you know he's basically out of the football program you  know and various and some other things.  I mean you know in some ways the Internet's great because there's a bunch of really stupid  people getting nailed to the floor by the Secret Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I can't say that's a problem.  Now here's what the Times article says.  And now we will decouple the questionnaire for the White House from what Obama is going  to have to do. But but the but the article says a decision has to be made.  It hasn't been made yet on whether he could become the first emailing president.  But AIDS said that seemed doubtful.  He's getting the advice.  Give up the BlackBerry Mr. President.  They don't think it's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that most people in illegal I mean and his is like almost super legal but  most lawyers that I know don't like email.  Like they don't email very long.  For the same reason. They know.  And I think a lot of us who deal with this on a day to day basis forget that email can  end up as a legal document.  You know it's like writing a letter oftentimes.  And I think that a lot of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bush White House tried to do to erase a bunch of email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they try using their personal emails.  I mean that was the big thing with Palin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was using a personal email to get around this and that doesn't work because it  doesn't matter. Right.  Technically yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it's also people don't realize that email lives on servers.  It's required to be you know it's required to be archived.  It's just it's amazing that people I mean I've seen email quite a bit.  I've seen email.  You know I've been forwarded questions in email that you just you don't want.  You know people send their credit card numbers or so security.  Well presumably.  Personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Presumably the White House counsel is going to sit Obama down and say look dude  this is what you may not do.  And I'm sure he's smart enough to know this already but just in case if.  Well let's say he's super circumspect.  He's very careful about how he uses his Blackbird.  You know the point out in the article that Vice Gore when he was vice president  towards the end of his term as vice president did in fact use his Blackberry  all the time.  Of course vice president is a little different than president.  If he gets good advice could he continue to use the Blackberry.  Is it read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think it's hard.  I think it's hard to.  It would be hard to discipline.  I know it would be hard to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The biggest problem is the stuff coming in.  I mean because those people don't know that it's going to come in.  So what they could do is every time you email to his account they could hold  that email and they could send you an email that says your email is going to be  recorded as part of the permanent record blah blah blah.  Are you sure you want to have this email sent to him.  That's a good idea.  Yes or no.  Then when it goes to him it could say you've received an email from you know ex  girlfriend from college.  Would you like it to be entered into your email box.  Yes or no.  And he could decide I want to receive this or not or he could say I only want to  receive emails from these 50 email addresses this way when who is the starlet  who was emailing him a whole bunch Scarlett Johansson.  I mean obviously Scarlett Johansson is sending him flirtatious emails.  Scarlett was hitting on Barack.  No doubt she said it and that was the big embarrassing thing.  She said Scarlett Johansson said that Obama was getting back to her in like a  couple of minutes after sending an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where you got to be careful with the black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then all of a sudden it's like OK now this guy's got his own Marilyn Monroe  thing going.  Even if it's not true you know somebody's going to get the statistics and be like  hey by the way he responded to you know this head of state within 15 minutes each  time.  He responded to Scarlett Johansson on average in three minutes.  Whoa what's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's taking the time to think about the future of the country when he's talking  to another head of state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or he just writes back to Scarlett Johansson hit me later baby.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like that baby hit me later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can I hit you later baby.  Somebody should do a fake you know email box like Obama's email box dot com and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just put like every day a fake email conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really the problem is that if he does in fact use email that that's the  kind of thing that's going to happen and it'll be very hard to deny it.  And I think he probably has to forego the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think that there is huge opportunities.  I'm really hoping that he that he twitters you know or someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter is actually I think he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have any idea how scheduled the president of the United States.  I know but wouldn't it be great if you had a Twitter like.  OK you're right.  In which case Twitter would be a perfect way to communicate with the nation in  between his weekly YouTube address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know but I just imagine just imagine just imagine a Twitter like going  into meeting with Putin.  Wish me luck.  You know that was a people would be watching this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody seriously says hold on hold on Vladimir.  I got a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't have to tweet himself but he could say can we send something to my  Twitter account about this new proposal that we're back in our fighting.  I'm sorry.  There's something to the white paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if I think Twitter is presidential.  Maybe that's just a sign that I'm just imagine he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about we have like a God forbid a terrible disaster and he wants to raise  money with the Red Cross for Katrina victims.  Well he goes on national television and more specifically more specifically

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  though that if he develops a person relationship people on Twitter rather than

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  addressing the three million people on Twitter and those 10 million people might

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be the people who actually go do something versus people on TV.  Well here's the channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the example.  There's already an example.  He got remember millions of SMS a message phone numbers when he said we're  going to announce the vice president on SMS.  He used that during the hurricane.  He they put out a message saying donate to the Red Cross.  The Red Cross said our site was knocked off the air.  We never expected so much result.  They got millions of donations.  So it is an effective tool.  Now that's SMS.  That's not Twitter but you could bet he's going to use those SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter is SMS.  That's all the same thing.  But I think that I think the database of every single person in the United States.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think that I think you get into a situation where you have I don't think  it's 100,000 I think if he Twittered as president it would be a million two  million three million people following him on Twitter and I think that the issue  is is that you know he could get people to change the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they do a presidential Twitter.  Yeah exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys are so biased.  I mean they're on late.  Just think about what you guys are saying.  You're saying that oh the fact that he's on the Daily Show and you're saying  Twitter is on presidential but the Daily Show isn't or Letterman isn't.  I mean why are you guys so.  But he was a candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a difference between campaigning and being the president.  But you guys are so biased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean what a bunch of.  Jason Jason.  This is this week in tech.  Not this week in tech.  Jason Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason stand down and let me finish the sentence for a second.  You seem to forget that there's 300 million Americans most of whom are not on  Twitter.  Most Twitter accounts aren't even accurate.  You know or are not even like on.  And it's like take.  I mean think about for a second.  SMS cell phone easy to integrate.  I'll give you that one.  But the reality is is how many presidents have gone on a you know or the Stuart  show or any other show.  I mean it would be it would be groundbreaking for somebody after the campaign to return  to the television shows while they were still in office as the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would be wrong with him using every tool to reach out to the people after he's  president.  You say how many how many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no no.  You know what it is.  How many how many different messaging systems have you screwed around with in the  last four years.  Well the president has better things to do than screw around with 32 million Web 2.0  messaging system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's nothing more important than him talking to his constituents.  I would take it even a step further.  The greatest thing the president could do is spend half an hour a day composing an email  to everybody in the United States about what's going on with our country how to make it  better what the issues are.  And he could email it and he doesn't have to be the person who distributes it.  He writes the email or dictates it or works on it with somebody and they put five URLs  in it.  These are the things as a country we should be focusing on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obama.org slash blog.  I mean why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the first time it's the greatest email to be so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Obama Daily email gets spoofed.  Fake email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying I'm just saying there's a reason you're coming up with every reason of  why the president can't embrace technology when technologies were gone in office.  So you're saying everything that he did to get an office all the constituents.  Let me ask you this.  Let me ask you.  Now you want to throw him out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me ask you this.  You're not listening to me Jason.  Not even a little presidential radio address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's doing the standard.  By the way I don't know of any president elect ever doing a presidential radio address but  that's another story for another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No that's I mean that started with FDR with the fireside chat.  He was a president though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Barack is not the president.  He's the office of the president elect which is made up.  Right.  But anyway that will leave that.  I think it's appropriate in this time for him to communicate.  He's got to be very careful not to tread on.  He is himself said there's only one president and me.  But anyway the question is is it symbolic that he put that on YouTube this week as  well as do the radio address or is it meaningful.  You don't think it's meaningful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's meaningful and appropriate.  I think embracing the 42 different messaging systems out there is a little more.  Maybe he doesn't do that.  Maybe he does.  No but I mean it's I think you know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about this Patrick change got gov.  He's already set up this website.  The whole point of the website is transparency.  We're going to we're going to show the American people what we're up to during the  transition.  I would hope and ask them to respond with their ideas.  I would hope they continue to use this once he's president.  Right.  Why doesn't he put up a post there.  There'll be no question about spoofing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The the other thing the other thing though is I think from a purely cynical political  point of view if I was president I would use stuff like Twitter because I would  develop three million people who followed that when I said call your congressman I  need to get this thing through it would crush that it would crush it.  It would really you know when you when you need to when you go to raise money down  the down the you know four years from now you'll have a pot that looks unlike  because you've developed a personal relationship with three million four million.  No he's already done that but but he could turn this keep doing it.  You know the Obama family could be in the presidency for 16 years if they decided  that they wanted to go down that path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How old's Malia and Sasha.  I mean it could maybe be a dynasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be you know.  No we don't we're not looking for that.  But what I'm saying is it's an incredible power that most politicians haven't taken  advantage of and they could take advantage of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can guarantee you in 2012 and 2016 and from now on any politician who doesn't use  these tools as Obama did this year is not going to stand a chance.  Right.  Not going to stand a chance.  You've got to.  And I think it's I think this is actually absolutely true.  The only thing we're arguing Patrick is what's the appropriate use of it  presidentially speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I guess I guess part of part of my issue is that you know every you know I'll  officially declare myself the Luddite of the group right while I'm sitting literally  in front of one two three computer monitors two notebooks you know and various  and sundry GPS gear and enough radio to basically follow a truck for the length of the  bottom.  We believe you're a geek.  We believe you're a geek.  No no no no no no no I'm saying like no I'm saying in the in present company I'm  officially the latest adopter because I find adopting you know there's there's stuff  full I'll get excited about it and I'll go after it but stuff like you know web  messaging systems and stuff like that like you and Leo Jason you jump on them at the  drop of a hat which is.  No we admit we're promiscuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You too Alex Lindsay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know and it's and it's and it's for a lot of people don't have the time to do that  and it's interesting you know if we have somebody is part of the White House staff whose  job is to deal with the thirty two hundred thousand startups that all want to carry the  president's message or if they can do something where they can add it or that or make it  available and accessible because you don't want Americans to be like you know what you  know if you know email I think it's pretty standard you know I don't think you can drop  a lot of the older forms of communication and I think I just don't want my president or  maybe I want to make sure there's somebody like way down on the decision tree that has  to deal with integrating the thirty two hundred clerks and other.  Well I don't think you'd do that is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying she used Twitter although Twitter might be enough of a de facto tool that  he could use it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah you know and I can you imagine like you know are we going to be able to get Twitter  to scale enough to deal with another 10 million users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think you should do change dot gov that way.  Why not use why not use a web site that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Webster I think used to fairly mainstream I think it's a great use.  I just I just so is it a dignity issue for you Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like. It's like you kept saying unpresidential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think I like I've been I've had some really interesting conversations with some  relatives of mine some of them in my own age bracket or a little younger and some of them  older. And you know I'm having one of those moments where it's like yes I've spent most of  the last 20 years of my life in beach towns or in New York City or San Francisco where  things are a little looser.  Right. And so there's been some interesting conversations because I remember people  reacting to Bill Clinton playing sax on.  Oh my goodness. The Arsenio Hall show and people being like you just kissed his.  You know I mean it's like you know the idea of what the president can do has certainly  broadened. Right.  And Obama has managed to embrace it and certainly through the way he embraces technology  has always been very presidential about it.  You know what I mean. Like I'm not looking at my you know I'm not getting like 32 tweets in  22 minutes and finding out that Obama had cutlets at lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I think he's kind of signaled already because the last post was November 4th  election day and it said get out the vote.  I think once he got elected he stopped using Twitter.  I think he's already said in effect by his use we're going to go to change dot gov.  They set up that site.  There there's there.  This is you know follow the transition online.  He's got a blog. He's got a newsroom.  He's got agenda.  They were at you know they changed it around a little bit.  They were asking for input.  They've stopped doing that and maybe because they don't feel like oh wait a minute.  Yeah it's your America.  Share your ideas.  I think it's important that the that the government embrace transparency and embrace  technology to do it.  And I just think we're only arguing about the best way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I guess my question is I think I think a lot of the ways because like I mean  you know Jason you're you're the man at embracing new feel.  I mean you know I mean like like look at your career.  You're an entrepreneur.  You're bleeding edge.  You're embracing new technologies.  You're pushing the boundary of professional communications in the sense of publishing  and certainly in your own life from what I've seen in personal communications.  And there are a lot of people that are way far behind that curve.  And it's like I wonder I wonder.  I don't think he should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you.  He shouldn't be bleeding edge.  He shouldn't be the guy like wow let me check out Tumblr.  Maybe I should flip that out.  Maybe I should have with this for a little bit.  You know I don't want him screwing around like that or like you know this looks like a  really cool Facebook application.  Maybe I should start Zambian people.  Of course.  But I think should he have a Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  My mother has a Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever the top 10 websites are top 20 websites whatever communication things.  You should have a presence on each.  He should have a missive that he does daily or multiple times a day.  If it's short and he should have a person who is the head of social media for the  office of the president.  What would we call that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well he's got he's already said we're going to have a CTO.  I presume that's a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a well this is part of his press aid.  This is part of his press group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more than press though.  I think social media secretary social media secretary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It still comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to it goes under the it gets if it gets handed out.  It's a White House communications office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they should have a social media secretary just like they have a press secretary.  And the social media secretary should take whatever he's working on and put it into  these social things so he can communicate with people because this is where people  are living right now.  So the same way this conversation is where many people are living right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well this is people don't spend a lot of time in this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go back to twit number negative one thousand four hundred thirty two in 1970 when  they were debating should presidents be on TV.  And that whole discussion is the same discussion we're having now instead of you  know going.  You're saying this is mainstream media.  This is mainstream.  There's a hundred million people going to my space every day from the United States.  I don't think 40 million Americans go to Facebook.  The these are the people these are the young people the future of our society.  That's where they're going to communicate with the president.  They're not going to watch him on TV.  They're going to watch him on YouTube and Facebook.  And that's the eventuality.  So the the fact that we as old people and everyone the phone call is over 30.  Probably some of us are over 40.  I'm not saying anybody in particular if Dvorak was here we'd have somebody over 50.  Yeah maybe even 60.  And the bottom line is we think old and we have to get young people in charge and into  politics because old people are going to be dead soon.  Well I think that I think people are going to inherit this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think none of this is going to displace what you're already going to do.  You're still going to have all the press you know events you're still going to do the  traditional media.  This is all adding to it.  And I think that the thing is is in many states where they went blue instead of red.  A lot of it was done by younger Americans who were more technologically astute and  pulling those and making sure that they stay in your fold from a cynical point of view  is very very important I think to keep you know to to be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess the real thing is is this a political thing.  You know looking forward to the 2012 election or is this good government.  Is it.  I think it can be both.  I mean I think that if it's good government it'll be good for 2012 as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to say somebody a member of the Twitter army and the Twitter live at IRC  dot DSL extreme dot com has registered Obama's Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So get ready.  If his blackberry starts talking.  You know I have to say we're not going to do all politics this show but there's there  are a couple more political stories.  One is that on Friday the transition team named I think two very good choices to head  up the Federal Communications Commission review team Ken Werbach who I think many  people like Kevin Werbach I think many people know he was he organized a supernova  former FCC staffer he's a professor at Wharton and Susan Crawford is a professor at  University of Michigan Law School and this is what I loved about them.  I mean you not only is there no question that they're going to be promoting net  neutrality from the FCC but listen to this.  Susan Crawford was very outspoken.  She was at a telecom policy conference in Hollywood in March.  Ambassador Richard Russell the White House associate director on science and technology  policy was there.  She said very bluntly to him you're living in a fantasy land when you say the United  States rollout of broadband is going well.  She said quote I think it's magical thinking to imagine we're somehow doing fine  here and I just want to make sure we recognize that even the ITU says that between 99  and 2006 the U.S.  skipped from third to 20th place in broadband penetration.  She says we're not doing it all well for reasons that mostly have to do the fact  with that we failed to have a U.S.  industrial policy pushing forward.  This is the thing I'm excited about high speed Internet access penetration.  There's been completely inadequate competition in this country for high speed  Internet access and finally she said it's a utility.  This is like water electricity sewage systems something that each and all  American needs to succeed in the modern era.  Boy that's got to terrify AT&T and Comcast.  And it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's actually you know what else it teleifies a lot of startups who are  angling to you know become you know and you know what I think probably Jason could  address this more but the whole this that runs on some level so counter to the free  market philosophy and the idea that that the free market would provide and that  there are options because like the idea is no one has choices.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the free market has failed.  Exactly.  Look if you live in the backwoods of Tennessee where there are five people per  square mile there is no one in his right mind is going to for business reasons.  Why are you.  It has to be a government.  To me it is exactly like it should be a government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is this is the same thing that happened with the phone companies here in  the United States.  What happens with rural electrification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the phone company a monopoly so they would so they would basically be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a pretty easy way to do it.  You basically charge everybody who is giving Internet connection some small  amount of money you know for each one and part of that goes to rural  electrification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the TVA is what it is it's like the rural electrification projects of  the 30s where we said everybody in this country needs electricity.  Now it was good fortune because the depression was going on it was a chair.  It was like it was a Works Progress Administration task.  It was a way of getting jobs.  We happen to be in another depression any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe this is the this is the next thing.  It's embarrassing.  I mean that we're in San Francisco.  Well in San Francisco it's hard to get much past you know at a reasonable price  you know much past.  What do you what are you getting.  Patrick six megabits a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I say a little better than that but it's not you know I mean it's not a high  quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was told in Japan might the hotel room I'm going to has 55 megabits down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it's everything there has they have 100 megabits your house for like 20  bucks.  I don't know what to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speed is one issue but but look at there are people out there who are 36 K.  Dial up in and it's more than 20 or 30 percent of our population.  We need to wire.  We need everybody to get online at least.  I don't think it has to be 55 megabits but I think everybody should have a  megabit per second in every in every home in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How are they going to how are they going to do that because it's an interesting  you know obviously it has to be wireless which means they have to figure out  something better than why not.  You're a big fan of why Max.  I want to see why Max actually roll out in scale and why Max boy that's a lot of  why Max towers to cover northern Nevada and what's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the last why Max now there was somebody.  Seattle Seattle Seattle.  How is it going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the problem for me why Max was originally proposed as a way to get these  rural areas online and it's not all happened in metros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it was it was I don't know.  Well if somebody may have started that way but by the at least two or three years  ago they were well beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah two or three years ago everybody's saying well but that's what happens they  say or is the biggest population density that's where the most money is to be  made and that right.  And then as a result you get nobody wired at all in the rural areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Baltimore Baltimore has why Max apparently to the foot went for a why Max  tower is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I agree.  Maybe we just need new technology but I think we've got to address this anyway I  think it's very encouraging that Susan Crawford and Kevin were back are now part  of this you know transition and looking at FCC commissioners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we really want the FCC to be controlling.  I mean I just like FCC regulation.  Well I guess I just think like if the FCC regulates it can they start you know  putting FCC morality on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No no no separate the morality.  I'm just asking.  Separate the morality out the FCC are the ones that told the cable companies and  everybody else.  Now we're going to preserve the cable monopoly.  We you don't have to share your physical plants with other Internet service  providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which I make sense because they paid to build out those physical.  Well I'm saying the FCC.  This is not an unusual place for them to be.  I guess my I guess my question is is does the FCC you know what is the FCC going  to want back in exchange for network neutrality or are they actually going to  be sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they know look look what they did with Comcast they slapped him on the  wrist they said guys you cannot filter just BitTorrent.  You have to filter equally across all protocols Comcast didn't get fine but they  stepped back and they said OK we'll figure out a better way to do it.  We'll cap everybody and we'll charge you for tiered Internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get it one way we'll get our pound of flesh one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah that's that's the bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a break we're going to come back.  But we have to do some capitalism.  It is a free market economy still in this nation thriving.  And I just love hearing Jason go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't tell me.  Is this audible.  Does your Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does your Tesla have an iPod connector.  You know interestingly enough it does.  So you could if you wanted to you could talk about theoretically I could hook up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my iPod with audible audio books and drive the Tesla because it doesn't have  engine noise.  I could be a tune right into those audio books.  You could be plugged in as long as the top was up and maybe you would confuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the sound of what is it a tie fighter.  What is your car sound like Millennium Falcon Millennium Falcon you might be  listening let's say to a Star Trek book and hear the Millennium Falcon and  you confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  It's right.  I could be actually confused.  I could actually go psychotic and start thinking I'm Han Solo because I.  OK maybe this is a bad idea.  I wonder if there are Star Wars books on there.  I wonder if there's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is like every Star Wars book ever recorded is actually on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were a couple of good Star Wars books that came out after.  Yeah there were a couple of good ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you remember the names.  I'll look for them for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is interesting.  There's the Han Solo trilogy of all of all things.  I got it.  You know this is the thing.  There are some of these that were rated really highly so I got to go look and see  which ones have the most reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the audible is like having a giant bookstore or library on your computer.  You go there you search you find play poker like the pros.  You might like that Phil Helmets book.  I have it.  I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got that from a long time ago but there's also Star Wars Legacy of the Force

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number five sacrifice which has 71 ratings on it.  That's the one with the most ratings.  I may just grab that today.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ratings see this is I love that to me.  That's what made Amazon so useful is the reviews and this that's one of the things  they really do on audible.com 71 ratings 4.5 1.  That's one of the highest ratings I've ever seen for an audible book.  So you know it's going to be a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a 3D.  It's not the barcode it's the 3D pass isn't it.  It's a 3D scan.  Oh cool.  Well I mean that's what you like if you get a Southwest one that's a 3D.  It's not 3D.  It doesn't look 3D but it looks like a bunch of blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it a barcode but you're probably right.  It's not the lines.  It's right.  It's the blocks.  It's the blocks.  It says the barcode can be scanned at TSA security checkpoints in America Airlines gates.  So now you don't even have to bring that piece of paper with you.  In fact you can walk up and get the barcode via email.  They'll email it to you and then you just walk on.  It's going to be good at first only at LAX and John Wayne in Orange County.  What.  What.  That's me baby.  That's you baby.  They did it just for you.  They said what airline what airport and airline is Jason use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's in.  You'll see in Tokyo next week.  You can use your mobile phone for like everything.  You go to a any convenience store like 7-Eleven.  Boom.  You swipe your phone get your stuff.  Everybody does it.  You go to your ATM.  You put your phone on the ATM.  There's a scanner and they have these block barcodes.  What are those called the barcodes.  Those are the 3D barcodes.  Are those called 3D.  Anyway everybody has those everywhere.  So I took a picture of one of them on a billboard.  So you hold your iPhone or whatever phone up to the billboard and it launches a URL.  Then it's like the QCAT.  It's like the QCAT but it's everywhere.  But instead of having to buy a QCAT you use your phone.  Now where do you get the barcode.  I don't know.  You know what's really sad.  There's some organization that I think you can make them or the software you can make them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know it's really sad you can't do it with the iPhone because it doesn't have focus.  I think people.  You can do it with the G1 on T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do it with the iPhone.  People were doing with the iPhone.  I don't know how.  Yeah.  But people have them on their business cards.  So you just.  So imagine it's so amazing.  And the other thing I saw over there was this virtual.  They call this augmented reality.  It's a little cube.  I'll give you the URL.  I made a video of it but you can see it next week.  But it's a cube and it cost $100 to buy.  You put the cube on your desk.  You put your webcam on it.  And all of a sudden it films your desk and out of the cube comes an avatar.  And then it's a maid and then you interact with your maid and she's like oh master.  And then you have a little wand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this some sort of kinky thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not kinky at all.  There's nothing sexual about it overtly.  But basically you give her gifts and like you can give her a gift of like a cockroach and she gets all scared and runs around.  And you give her a gift of teddy bear.  And you basically spend $100 buying a cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so weird.  And then they have this other thing in Tokyo called made cafes.  Oh I know about that.  You guys know what cosplay is.  C.O.S. play.  No but I know somebody who does.  Yeah cosplay is basically you dress up like anime characters.  And so people go to this bridge in Tokyo and they dress up like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they have to get those contact lenses with the really big pupils.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And then in there's a place called Akihabara and Akihabara is where all the technology stuff is.  You have to go there Leo.  It's crazy.  I know I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is insane.  I'm not going to Tokyo.  I'm going to Fukuoka and Nagasaki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to get to Tokyo at some point.  But anyway in Akihabara there are like 10 story buildings and like one of the floors is for cases.  One floor is for motherboards.  Anyway there was a robot.  There was a store that was just robots.  It was crazy.  But they had these made cafes where Japanese girls dress up as maids and then serve your tea.  And there's nothing really sexual about it.  But when you're walking around Akihabara there are maids everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Giving you flyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like French maids like short skirts, poofy.  They are French maids and then some of them are like French maids.  Tim Street would love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As cats.  A lot of the stuff that goes on in Japan that's so pedestrian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually Colleen my assistant here lived in Japan for a year and I understand she did a research paper on those French made or whatever they call them made cafes.  Just type made cafe.  Do you still have your costume?  One of the first things.  She still has her costume.  Next week Colleen would you come in here in your maid costume?  She has pictures of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  It's on YouTube.  In Akihabara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just put it in the chat room.  I'm told there.  Our chat room tells me there's a company in the US called Scanlife.com that has an easy code system that they use that is very similar to this.  Problem is you've got to get widespread adoption before this before this works.  But it says bring your phone to life.  And it's the same system.  I would love to see this take over here.  Do you feel like when you're walking around in Tokyo you're you're kind of walking around in the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do actually actually especially when you go to the bathroom and the toilet seat has nine buttons in the in the future toilet seats will wash your bum for you.  No they have literally nine buttons.  So I'm looking at this thing I'm like what the hell is this.  So you didn't just press them by random I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well anyway I sit down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is the seat is hot because when you sit on the seat it knows you're sitting and it runs hot water through the seat.  So all of a sudden you're like oh this is kind of comfortable.  Anyway is that comfortable.  I don't have a hot seat.  It's actually quite nice it's quite nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But have you ever sat on a cold seat in an outhouse Leo.  Yes it is much better to have a warm toilet seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm looking at this thing and there's a control panel on the side and there's a picture of the letter W and there's water shooting up into the W.  And I'm like what the heck is that.  So I'm standing up and I'm looking at it so I press the button.  All of a sudden this little robot arm goes and it comes out and I'm like oh my God is that going to.  And before I know it shoots water in the eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It literally misses me like the matrix by like an inch.  And I move my head like bullet time.  Leo it shot up like eight feet in the air.  The whole hotel room is soaking wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop stop.  You have to be ready for the robot bidet.  And if you aren't ready mayhem ensues.  What's really great is if you get a phone call from somebody who's just had that happen and they have no idea what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My toilet just squirted at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The best part is there's two settings so the first shows like a letter W curvy which is your butt with water shooting into it.  OK.  Other button shows some weird piece of anatomy that is for the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say is it identifiable or is it obscure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sort of looks like a little man sort of like like anyway.  Are you saying this is there's a wee wee washer button.  There's a wee wee washer button but I couldn't tell from looking at the icon if the icon was made of over a modeled after a male or female.  I think it's a hybrid so it's sort of like this hermaphrodite.  It's generic wee wee.  It's a generic wee wee but it will clean your wee wee as well.  And anyway this is what you're in for at Tokyo but if you go you're ready.  I'm excited.  It's awesome.  Don't get too excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Evidently Will Smith is a big fan of these toilets.  Did he do a song about it.  No he didn't do a song about it but I saw this on the web a while ago but he's very excited about very.  Wee wee wah.  Evidently he doesn't want to.  Wee wee wah washer.  You know the reports were he didn't like to you know do his business outside of the house because he had this great washer.  I just posted to the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a company in Silicon Valley called Brondell B R O N D E L L that manufactures Japanese style toilets that wash your dairy.  You can get it here.  You can get it here.  And the Brondell was invented by the other Cuban.  Mark Cuban bought it.  Oh my God.  Mark Cuban has a clean butt.  There it is.  Mark Cuban knows how to live.  I'm looking at the Brondell right now.  Well I want to watch the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only is he an owner he's a client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not only a customer.  Can you imagine if Brondell sponsors it.  Oh man.  And can we have our clean butt moment with John Dvorak.  I don't know.  No it's even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been like ladies and gentlemen I've never had as clean a crack as I've had.  Oh jeez.  And adopted Brondell's auto washer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Dvorak for Brondell.  Oh.  John.  Hi.  This is John Dvorak for Brondell.  You see last night I had Mexican.  Now let me tell you.  My name's Brick.  When John Dvorak orders a chimichanga the next day is a disaster.  But not with Brondell.  Oh jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's never coming back on this show again.  You realize that.  You've just you've just chased him away permanently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should see the people in the chat room are going crazy.  They're enjoying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to move on because while we're all fascinated by toilet culture I think  perhaps we'll leave that for another show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we have named the show this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this week in Wee Wee Washers.  Wee Wee Washer.  This week.  Oh man.  Well after you know what.  There's a kind of a theme going on after last week but I'm not going to get into it.  Be glad.  Be glad you don't live in Argentina.  Did you see this.  You know who Diego Maradona is right.  No.  He believes himself to be the successor to Pelé one of the greatest soccer players of all time.  Plays for the Argentine national team I presume.  He among many others in Argentina has gone to court to sue Yahoo and Google to block all search results on his name.  What.  What.  Not only that judges a high profile judge Maria Servini de Kubria many of whom's rulings apparently been questioned in the blogosphere has sued saying block my name.  I don't want any searches Yahoo exceeded.  If you go to Yahoo.com in Argentina and you search for Diego Maradona the most famous soccer player in Argentina you'll get this message due to a court order requested by private parties.  We find ourselves obliged to temporarily suspend all or some of the results related to this search.  The only exceptions are major news sites.  So basically he doesn't want the gossip sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh please.  That is so lame.  OK.  So here's how we get around this.  What's the guy's name again.  Diego Maradona.  OK.  So now if you search for Diego Diego like San Diego.  Right.  So now switch to D and the M.  So you make it Diego.  Yeah.  M.  Ramona.  Yes.  Anybody who is going to write about this person on the gossip sites from now on his name is Diego Dargana.  Now every story should be made go Dargana.  Then if he doesn't if he blocks that we'll all switch it to a yoga a odd on a good point.  I was with you to be a go bad on.  What an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could put out a little bulletin every week.  What is his name this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His name is now Diego the donkey.  Everybody refer to him as Diego donkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  None of this much better.  Just let him go off in obscurity.  Yeah.  Let him do it.  No.  Let him be a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not harass the hell out of him for being an idiot.  Can you imagine suing to say I don't want you to find any results about me.  That's nuts.  Google's response to this by the way Google has not yet done it.  Yahoo said OK whatever.  Google said no we're going to fight this.  Google said it's completely illogical.  This is a spokesperson for Google Argentina.  It would be like suing the newsstand for what appears in the newspapers itself or  demanding the newsstand vendor tear out offending pages for the newspapers.  The lawsuits should be against the websites for crying out loud.  Not us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Donkey of the week this week's this week.  We can check them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Donkey of the week.  Donkey of the week today.  Diego Maradona.  And now you can't find this podcast in Argentina.  Brought to you by Audible.  That's a great idea.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'd like to apologize ahead of time to all of our listeners in Argentina.  This is the last show you'll ever hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And maybe we can get that toilet company to sponsor it or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In related news Britney Spears has.  Well imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is like Britney Spears says well I don't like some of the gossip sites.  Not all.  So what I'm going to do is going to tell Google look don't show results that I  don't like just show results that I approve of.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could just give them a form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get a hundred bucks that those lawyers somewhere within 50 miles of Jason right  now reading this article and going why didn't we think of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well there's apparently this is one lawyer in Argentina who has made a living  doing this.  He's been doing it for two years.  Ligizomon is his name.  He has apparently represented many well known people in Argentina.  He says actors models sports personalities and judges.  To who have apparently sued Yahoo Argentina and Yahoo just says OK whatever.  The problem is it's even easier really Jason because according to this article  in Time magazine all you have to do is go to the international version of Yahoo  instead of Yahoo dot right.  A.R. whatever it is go to Yahoo dot U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think the problem that that that Yahoo Argentina has is that if I was in  Argentina I would never go back to the local right.  Excite again.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I would move on.  Yeah.  Unbelievable unbelievable.  They're also demanding you know damages.  People were able to find information about me in the library horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm included through the library.  Kill the library.  You know what actually there's a point here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean what was that.  Devorak who was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah anyway we should give them we should give each celebrity a form and then they  can decide what's indexed in Google.  It would be called the donkey index.  They basically can go in like check off like OK Britney Spears would like to go  in like check off like OK Britney Spears would like TMZ and Perez Hilton to be  indexed but not delisted and Gawker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got another one for you.  This might be the other donkey of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone needs to send a sound effect in for that.  We need a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anthony Michaels last year went to a website noticed an ad from classmate dot  com saying some former school chums were trying to contact him.  Oh this is awesome.  I love.  Yes he pulled out his wallet upgraded to the premium membership so that he could  contact these long lost classmates maybe see if his secret crush still liked him.  Once he spent the 15 dollars he learned the shocking truth no one he knew was  trying to contact him at all.  He's suing classmates dot com.  He said they weren't really they weren't looking for me.  Jason you've created a new feature.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now here's a question Leo although I kind of like it though because it is  bait switch I guess if you could if you could figure out a way to sue eBay and  the guy who scammed you out of 2000 dollars for a non-existent camera.  Right.  Would you like that money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean I got it back actually the PayPal.  Well I think enough publicity they finally PayPal just said all right we'll  give you the money back.  But I don't think that that really had anything to do with their real policy it  had more to do with.  No.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our talkie of the week brought to you by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to get a sponsor for the week who would be the best sponsor for don't  get the toilet the week the toilets the toilets those toilets or Mark Cuban.  Yeah.  Mark Cuban.  Calacanis dot com is going to sponsor this.  I think you should sponsor it.  I'll charge you a dollar.  It's all right.  That's it.  Calacanis dot com official donkey of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The doggy of the week from Calacanis dot com.  You know the problem is how do you pick only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could be multiple.  There's nothing that says you can only have one or what you could do is you  could present three donkeys and one wins this guy out of the two who's the bigger  donkey the guy suing classmates or the guy suing Yahoo and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the thing is this guy is actually going to file a class action lawsuit  saying there are hundreds of thousands of people similarly duped in a way that's  true because that is the ad on classmates dot com.  Hey classmates are looking for you but I never thought it was my classmates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but variations on this I think more serious variations on this is how Spitzer  became the governor of New York.  I mean whoa wait I just got whiplash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the false advertising it is receiving false advertising.  And what does this have to do with Spitzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I mean Spitzer made his bones going after large companies.  Oh that's true.  Oh that's questionable.  Quite ethically questionable practices.  No you're right.  And this is this is this is you know this is essentially when you're the attorney  general of New York you swing a much bigger stick than you know insert name of  citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do we think is this guy is this guy legitimate.  Is this a legitimate lawsuit.  Yes it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Because they said they said somebody was he had I mean literally the classmates  are looking for you.  This is why we emailed you we've contacted you individually and they lied.  Yeah.  So in that case you know if if you know if it's I didn't want to get started on  this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We go to the next story.  It's obvious the guy has a point.  It's obvious the guy has no life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really.  Fifteen dollars.  Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know you know what is a lot of money to a lot of people.  Or maybe it's good to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should.  Yeah the principle of it is you could you could call people out who do false  advertising.  Well so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Donkey of the week.  We'll play it backwards.  We'll play it backwards.  So we're going to play it backwards.  We're going to take it back.  We take it back.  You know what's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You play it.  Donkey backwards sounds just like a one go forward.  Exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who knew it.  What does that mean.  Palindrome.  It's a palindrome.  Donkey's Bray is a palindrome.  It's an audio palindrome.  It should be called a yard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm going to bring you all down.  I'm going to bring you all down.  Sad news.  Best Buy saying Circuit City going out of business.  We're not surprised.  It's best by saying this is the most difficult climate it's ever seen.  If you look at the stock prices and all of these you know Circuit City's fly.  It's not only filed for a chapter.  It's reorganization right.  So chapter 11.  But they've said we're going to close another 150 stores.  Best Buy saying they're right.  It's bad news.  Sun lays off what seven thousand this week.  Seven thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sixty five hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the sad story is the guy who killed people at the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The toilet suddenly launched its video.  I'm so sorry.  I don't know where that came from.  I guess I've been downloading it the whole time and all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The guy was laid off Friday morning.  Scheduled a meeting at 30 with the VP of operations the head of HR and I guess his manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And shot all three of them dead.  This is in Silicon Valley.  This is one of those things that just scars a community.  It's just a terrible story.  I don't want to bring you down that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean listen you got to.  We can't ignore when something like that happens.  You got to at least discuss it.  I mean it's really terrible.  And it's laying people off.  It's hard.  And you know there are some people who you know either this is the if you're an engineer obviously you can get another job.  It's not the you know the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were saying you were saying you and Kevin were talking weren't you and saying how many high quality applicants you're getting now.  Yes.  You can't hire them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So it's going to be hard but it's going to be hard for a couple of years and then it will get better and then it will be you know better than it ever was again and then it will be horrible again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what this is it's tough to ride out after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I mean listen engineers get paid you know so much more than the average person in America.  You know the real issue here is there are some people who have you know underlying problems and this is a thing that sets them off.  It shouldn't.  It is not the proper response to being laid off obviously.  And so there are people who are you know have problems and this is what can happen.  These kind of bad events can be the thing that pushes them over the edge.  Women killed herself like because they were going to close on her home.  This has happened three or four times.  People have murdered their families and killed themselves over losing their homes.  Right.  It's like it's just a house.  Let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Do you think.  Easy to say.  Do you think that because the tech business the community has gone through something like this all recently in 2001 that we've been through this bus cycle that we might survive this new recession better because we've learned some lessons from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  We've we.  I mean the cuts that are being made right now are ones in a lot of cases that are preemptive you know and expecting bad news.  That's what happened in Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You laid off to add runway to survive.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what happened at rev three.  And that's what's happening all over the place.  People are realizing gee I can make these cuts now and you know that's a 10 20 percent cut or I can make it down the road and it's a 60 percent cut and maybe that won't even help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  So that's one thing we've learned.  We didn't we didn't also do the IPOs and the crazy valuations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes and we didn't do Super Bowl commercials and people are focused on revenue and revenue actually exists on the Internet.  So I think what people are doing everything right which means they should we should be able to innovate our way out of this which is really the only thing that's going to solve this problem is that people come up with really innovative solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think this is most people are saying this is just the beginning.  I mean we're going to get worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're you're a pessimist.  You're you're very much.  No you're very bearish in all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I am you know but but it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not alone.  Everybody I know who works in Wall Street in New York they're sort of whistling past the graveyard.  They have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have friends I have friends that put everything in the treasuries a year ago.  You know they were just like we're just going to we're just going to ride this one out.  And the thing is is that is that a lot of people you know saw this coming for a long from a long way out.  You know and.  But the thing is is that it's not going to be what we're seeing right now.  The layoffs that come after Christmas is going to be a much different thing than the layoffs that come before Christmas because I think a lot of people aren't going to go out there and buy as much as they bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's what this blockbuster rather a Best Buy and Circuit City story really is saying is we ain't seen nothing yet.  Wait till you see Black Friday which is in two weeks.  Wait till you see you know the sales over the holiday season.  If they're as bad as they look like they're going to be it's going to be January is going to be a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is this is also this is also you know consumer electronics and other areas catching up with durable goods have been getting their asses kicked.  I mean stuff like furniture big ticket items larger appliances have been getting hammered on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your family business is furniture.  Have you seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah the furniture industry you know it's people there's you know there gets to be a crisis in confidence like you know when the war started.  People stopped spending money on that and then you get the slowdown on new construction on housing and then you get the slowdown on on houses being purchased.  But furniture she just gets hammered.  It's kind of happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  What's happening right now is you know this the last recession was a business recession and this recession is a consumer recession.  Consumer consumers make up two thirds of our economy and what we've got right now is people are moving to a post consumer society and it's going to last for a couple of years.  Which is people are going to say I'm not going to buy the car.  I'm not going to upgrade the iPhone.  I'm not going to upgrade all the stuff.  So this group belt tightening effect is going to just ripple through the economy until such time as we get to the bottom and the bottom is defined as you have balanced your personal budget and balancing your personal budget means my house is worth more than I paid for it or at least as much.  I'm not underwater.  I'm not in tremendous credit card debt for individuals to do that.  You think that'll take only a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of people are way way behind.  Here's what really seems to be the people who are ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you have to think about like the average American Americans have been for a considerable amount of time saving less money than anybody else in the world and charging more on subsistence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean you could make the case that the last 10 years have been totally fueled by credit and that you're not going to see that kind of boom boom ever again.  That's right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's going to take a couple of years for on average people to get through that.  And it's like it's like indigestion.  You know you have to stop eating.  You know step one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it sounds like you probably don't want to buy a self bathing toilet anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually you know what I think little people who are going to do well are things that are related to experiences.  So if you look at what did well the last time in the Internet business blogging Flickr Facebook MySpace all these things were built in the last down market.  If you look at the common thread there all of those things are related online things meetup.com that are related to offline lifestyle and sort of expressing yourself for in a non cash way as opposed to buying things you know cars and whatever.  So experiences over expenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think also low cost low cost solutions to things you know whether I think probably Walmart probably will do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart has done well.  Walmart.  Blue was grown in the last down market.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Walmart's reported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean we provide low we put we provide low low cost services for what we do and we're booming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Walmart pays its employees.  You know the average salary is eighteen thousand dollars a year with no health care.  So you expect Walmart to do well.  It doesn't I mean it's a little bit of a sad state that we're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you know most of the goods there are not made in the United States.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well but I mean but overseas I mean China's having the same problems that we're having.  And I would argue apparently everybody is everybody's having a problem.  You know this is not you know you know it's going to be I think China has more challenges in some ways than than we do because their population you know won't put up with it for very long.  Hey yeah.  This is the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah this is the toilet movie.  I just thought I'd throw that up there for people.  Look at that.  There it is.  There's the there's the device.  Who makes that.  Rondell.  A mark Cuban company.  Oh wait there's the there's the nine buttons.  I saw that.  Let's go back.  Now of course nobody listening at home knows what we're talking about.  But if you go to Brandell dot com you can you can watch this video.  There's the there's the spigot.  Oh for him for her.  See they put English on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well that's because they're selling them in the United States Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you've got for him for her you've got front you've got back you've got water  temperature seat temperature you've even got warm air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's that.  Where's the lower back massage.  That's what I want to know.  Here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does look like another product that's sold for the living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break while we watch this run.  Brandell movie.  And they're happy customers to mention the folks that go to my PC.  Well I'm sure very happy to have this placement in the show right now.  They're not a sponsor.  No they're a spot.  We love go to my PC.  They're from go to my PC.  You know them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey guys I'm sorry I get a I get a scoot out.  Thank you so much for letting me thank you.  Patrick.  Great to talk to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't forget Patrick at Tekzilla dot com T E K Z I L L A dot com and on system.  He is he is and everything's going well at revision three despite the the layoffs.  This is just to keep you keep keep it going right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well yeah you know you know the the model based on what happened when money dried  up in the dot bomb was that people didn't make heavy immediate cuts ended up dying  the death of a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is an example of having learned something from 2001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah yeah.  And it was just it was basically tightening down to the most profitable shows and you  know kind of just tightening everybody's belts quite a bit actually.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's good to talk to you.  I'm glad you're still there and still working and we look forward to seeing you on system  and the tech zone.  Thanks so much.  Thank you Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks guys.  Patrick Norton everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen.  He just doesn't have the stamina to do a two hour show like the rest of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No actually I have to pee really badly and if I go upstairs the baby's going to see me  and it's going to be quality time with the baby.  So be like dad which is great.  So basically I like my.  Take advantage of it.  Yeah.  I'll talk to you guys later.  I hope you have a Brondell toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll look for that.  This show brought to you not by Brondell but by go to my PC.  Go to my PC is the great software from Citrix that lets you access your computer from  anywhere.

And I really want to get the Brandell toilet people on with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want to get a brand new toilet.  You know $150 on Amazon.  They should do donkey of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There would there you go.  They do the donkey.  They would be there in the toilet with Brandell.  You know Brandell in the toilet never felt so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't be a donkey.  Get a brand new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we just did an ad on spec for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're obligated now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got to baby.  We gave it to them for free.  Their IT guys are going to come in tomorrow and say what the heck happened to the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you haven't really told us yet how much you love the Tesla.  You've been you've only been driving it for a day right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's correct.  I've driven the I drove one of the prototypes for three or four days a while ago.  It's incredible.  It drives very fast.  It's a very weird feeling because there's no gear change because it's just a straight torque curve.  So you just go zoop right up to 100.  Not that I've taken I haven't taken in 100 obviously I wouldn't drive over the speed limit.  But if I did it would be one continuous straight up.  It's it drives like a race car.  You know it's got like the steering is not like soft power steering like you actually have to turn it and stuff.  But other than that it drives like a regular car except extremely fast and there's no sound.  And the pickup is just like it pins you to your seat because the electricity goes directly to the tires.  It just like there's no like waiting for the combustion to start I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I've seen that there are some there are people saying that as electric drive trains take over you're going to find that cars actually have a much higher performance.  Especially with acceleration and so on and so forth than with with the gas cars.  Specifically because you can just you can just apply it directly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long does it take to charge.  I am getting the fast charger which means I'm actually having like a couple thousand dollars in electrical work done at my house.  But you can.  Otherwise you plug it into a regular 120.  There's three different ways you can charge it.  One is there you can plug it into a 120 and then it's like plugging like plugging in your laptop.  Takes forever.  It takes like 30 hours.  So that's really not the trickle charge.  That's intended for like topping off like if you went somewhere and you're going to just you know top it off a little bit.  But the two charging options of the 220 or whatever is it can take like six or seven hours or you can get like this little extra amperage or whatever and get to three hours.  So I'm getting the three this way but it doesn't really matter.  Another interesting thing it does is you can set what type of performance you want to get out of the car.  Oh interesting.  In order to.  So there's a little like LCD panel and on the LCD panel there's two interesting things.  One is you can set it to performance mode or regular.  In performance mode you can get that like 3.9 second you know 0 to 60 or you can put on regular and it's a little slower but you get more range.  And then it only charges up to 90 percent and it zero is actually 10 percent.  So when you see the actual mileage you're going to get on a full I'm using air quotes here charge it's like 180 miles or something like wait a second isn't it 220.  Well that's 20 percent that is taken off.  Only charges up to 90 unless you turn the option on to charge to 100 because it increases the battery's lifespan the battery packs lifespan and it only goes down to zero again because if you go down to zero that's not good for the battery pack I understand.  So they do all these interesting things and then one of the most interesting is they have a valet mode.  So you press valet mode and the car can only go up to half the number of RPMs and it records how far the car has traveled and what the top speed was.  So when you hand it to the valet you tell them it's in valet mode and they can see on the thing how fast they're going or whatever.  And it's like a pin number to get it out of valet mode so you can't have like a Ferris Bueller's day off situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good thing because a valet would be very tempted.  With a Tesla I'm tempted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody would be.  I think I just dressed up as valet if I knew someone was coming.  How many miles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went in I went to Korean food in K-Town last night and I told the guy you know I have to park it myself and he let me so I parked it myself.  I was like I don't want anybody driving this thing because I don't think they understand.  You don't know the cars on so you hit the gas hard you're going to go flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is your insurance through the roof on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't so bad.  It was a couple thousand dollars.  I mean I have a year.  Yeah I have four.  I have four cars now because I have the Corvette that I'm getting rid of and I think all four cars is eight thousand so I think each one's two thousand on average or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's typical for a high-priced performance car.  It's a little yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean it's obviously it's a lot to replace the car so there's a little bit cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about mileage?  How far can you go on a charge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you drive like grandma you will get over 220 mile range.  If you drive like Jason you might get a hundred and twenty five or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now is that their estimate or is that what you really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's real world because I've given it before.  Yeah.  So I mean basically if you're going to you know speed to every you know light or something like that you're going to get half the amount.  But the thing is you know most people don't drive more than like I don't know 50 miles each time they go out of their house.  So if you have a two car household you could actually have this one and really not have a fear of running out of gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not going to go to Tahoe in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not going to like from here we could go.  It's 42 miles from here to downtown San Francisco.  Yeah we go to San Francisco.  Easily. No problem.  No problem.  And if you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think what's going to happen over time is they're going to be charging stations at places.  What's really cool about this in California is I get a white sticker for my car.  I can drive in any carpool lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your HOV automatically.  Yeah that's true.  You got a high performance high performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not giving them out for Priuses anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not giving them out for Priuses anymore.  No.  There's too many.  So they stopped doing that.  And then also I can park in any parking spot in SoCal and not put quarters in the meter.  Really.  That's that's that's worth it.  Man this is.  Only for electric cars not for Prius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's for electric cars.  Now if they had a I see by the way at the I think it's Oakland Airport they have plugs for electric cars.  So but it would only make sense if you drive to an airport and you're going to leave it overnight because it takes long enough to charge that.  You're not going to go up to a filling station and charge.  Or are you.  I mean what are you going to have dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I what I think will happen is which already happened in Southern California already which is Santa Monica has like parking for parking structures so you know public parking structures will have five spots automatically to charge.  And things like that.  So and it's possible hotels will have them as well.  I could see places in Vegas having them or whatever.  You know.  So I think eventually we'll get to that point.  I mean we have gas stations you know within you know every X number of feet.  So it's quite and also the battery life.  My estimate is they'll have twice the battery life you know a couple of years from now.  And I think one of the cool things about owning the car from people I've talked to inside the company is they you might have this car for a long time because it's built really well on carbon fiber and they can just upgrade the battery pack upgrade the drive train and upgrade the computer system.  And the software like pretty regularly as opposed to a physical car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's just a bunch of laptop batteries back there isn't it.  Exactly so they can just pull that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the battery pack is probably 10 or 15 thousand dollars of the cost of the car.  So when I replace it in I don't know seven years or something like that you know it will be a brand new car essentially with a new range.  So your fear of upgrading goes out the window because you upgrade might be ten thousand dollars or fifteen thousand dollars.  Also they keep upgrading the software and you go to the dealership and the dealership is like blown out with coffee machines and a cafe and they're going to be able to upgrade your software and the drive train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New firmware for my car.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically and they're also coming out with I got the inside line on a couple of features they're going to come out with but there's going to be what can I say performance enhancements to the car.  So as great as the performance is right now there's going to be some performance enhancements from what I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think this technology technology is feasible for widespread use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean we've had electric cars.  I mean Thomas Edison had an electric car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know there's a great documentary who killed the electric car that talks about what what happened.  Do you believe that conspiracy theory that really there's nothing wrong with the electric car.  They just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is nothing wrong with it.  I mean I'm I would I have one in my driveway and I'm driving it and I'm saying to myself OK it's a little expensive but they've obviously going to be able to cut the price of the electric car.  I mean they're going to be able to do this in half and if it wasn't made out of carbon fiber and you know if it wasn't as fancy around the edges they could make one that was under fifty thousand dollars today and I think they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My question is is I mean we look at California California was trying to press these American American car.  I mean everyone but especially you know GM and Ford and so on so forth.  They were trying to press these guys to have better gas mileage more electric cars and they fought it tooth and nail.  Now they're paying for it.  I don't really care if they get supported or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like give them money and you say OK all like you've got to do 20 percent of your fleet has to be you know I'd say in 10 years in 10 years every passenger car has to be electric drivetrain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could give them the money if you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah that's what they should do.  I mean this idea of bailing out GM is like it's why we have terrible airlines in this country.  It's because we bail out the ones that are getting killed by you know Southwest and you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Admittedly they should be the management of GM should be punished but there are also 50,000 workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But if you can those it's just I mean I know it's hard to say but they they shouldn't we shouldn't be doing that in this country.  We can do other things and it's just a little bit of short term paying for a long term game.  Well the other thing and we should give the money to companies like Tesla.  Why not give a bailout to Tesla.  Give them 100 million dollars.  I would much rather do that as a as a taxpayer than give it to GM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the other thing I think is interesting is that is that you know Japanese car companies are barely Japanese car companies anymore.  I mean their manufacturing plants are in Alabama North Carolina and Tennessee.  Non-union.  Non-union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't think like a protectionist in a global economy.  I mean it's just not it doesn't work anymore.  So it's not like those jobs are not going to stay here.  And if we keep we're spending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you say bite the bullet take the pain re reorg the way the country works.  Absolutely because industrial base make it be a little bit an information economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'd be better off giving those people two years of salary and job training than giving it to GM.  You know that's a good point.  Take it.  They'll be coming back to us.  They'll be coming back to the United States in five years and they're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so so maybe you take 100 billion and you say we'll retrain the entire workforce.  We'll give them extended unemployment benefits and we're much better.  Are there enough technical jobs though for that.  We with the innovation we do we're laying off people it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean I think I think it will be.  I mean I think that will be.  I think that we're going to get to a point where we I know from our business our business model is largely based around the idea that we're going to get to a point where we want everything visualized.  You know we're going to want to know how we want a video on how we use our phones how we use our cameras how we use our cars.  You know we're going to expect that you know and we're going to expect that all kinds of information to be at our fingertips and we've only created point one percent of that so far.  And so I think that there's going to be a huge opportunity for in the tech industry.  You know maybe not maybe the heavy gear maybe not the heavy gear but definitely in the content area I think that it's going to continue to grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  About 15 years ago Jeremy Rifkin wrote a book 1995 called The End of Work in which he basically predicts exactly what's happening right now a readjustment of how you know work happens in this country.  I don't know if he really saw glow.  Well I think he did. I think he predicted the globalism that he saw.  I mean we've known this is coming.  It's a freight train coming our way.  I guess though if you're going to make policy you've got to figure out a way to take care of your people.  And you've got to find a way to employ hundreds of millions of people in this new economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and there's still lots and lots of me in the industry that I'm in.  There's lots of rote work.  There's lots of work that doesn't require a PhD or even a college degree.  There's plenty of work you know out there for you know every American in the information age.  It is it's just that we don't look at it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think oftentimes he says we've got to move beyond the delusion of retraining for non-existent jobs and start and say essentially that we have to prepare ourselves and our institutions for a world that is phasing out mass employment in the production and marketing of goods and services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and I think that we think of a lot of times as this being an outsourcing issue.  But if it wasn't the jobs are going overseas if it wasn't an outsourcing issue what's really happening is is if it wasn't an outsourcing issue it would be a mechanical.  I mean we're going to you know you go to some of these modern car companies and the reason how they've saved money is not so much lower labor costs but has been extreme automation.  You know and I think that we're going to continue to see more and more.  I know that.  Well that's more people out of work.  I worked at like I worked in an electronics company and the minimum you know almost everybody worked at minimum wage is right out of high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so my kid 15 years old what should he be studying what should he be preparing for what's the economy going to be like in 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think that I think that you have.  In the U.S.  Well I think on top of reading the West personally I think that on top of reading writing reading writing arithmetic or whatever they have there you need to be able to communicate effectively.  You know on the Internet with you know with video with you know with PDFs with keynotes with whatever it is you need to be able to be part of that.  Learn the technological tool.  Yeah you need to learn the technology.  Technological I think another thing we have to think about is that we don't really need to pack our kids heads you know with so much road information.  I mean it because that's clearly true.  It is not what you know it's how you look it up.  Yeah you know you know I knew I we had a conversation about whether it was what the difference between a geostationary and a geosynchronous orbit of satellites.  It took us about 30 seconds to go up on Wikipedia and know who you don't know that I don't need it.  We don't need to memorize what happened in 17.  We just need to know how to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about you Jason.  What's your opinion on this.  What should a 15 year old or a 20 year old be thinking about so that he's employable or she's employable in the years to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that we need to make engineering and technical jobs and getting you know graduate degrees in engineering you know like the new goal again.  Too many people got into business sort of degrees and we need more PhDs in engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too many middle managers not enough innovators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I think innovation is what gets you through tough times and Google is a perfect example of that.  Google on an economic basis really has contributed a lot to the economy and not just for their employees but for employees all over because they created technology that increased consumption increased marketing dollars.  It made them more efficient right because spending money through Google's ad sense system is more efficient than buying things on the radio or television.  So you really need to innovate your way out of problems like this and you can only innovate if you have dreamers out there and you have people who are going to be able to do that.  Who are really hardworking technical people.  We did this once before in the Sputnik era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The United States committed to science and technology education and actually were reaping the benefits of that decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and I think that thinking out creating you know kids that are thinking outside the box you know you know thinking outside the box are able to work in a large group.  You know one of the things that I find over and over again I talk to production companies because one of our jobs is to find people to fit into production companies.  The number one thing they're interested in is how well they work on a team.  The details of what they know are not nearly as important and we're in a technical realm.  I mean obviously they need to know those things but what's going to set the differences is how well they interact with the group.  How well they you know how dependable they are you know whether they're going to you know those types of things.  And that's something I don't think our schools do very well.  You know I think that's something that they need to become you know that's more important oftentimes especially as we get into this the next era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can tell you what's not going to get us out of this is more people doing financial engineering to try to create value.  We're done with the hybrids.  Yeah well no the financial engineering that's going on.  Yeah I mean it's just like these are the people who really are the bastards in our society.  You know what's sad is this is the cream.  Have destroyed some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the people who create these derivatives were the cream of the mathematical crop coming out of MIT and the technical universities.  These are the guys who could have created great innovations instead they said hey I'm going to go for the goal on Wall Street and absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's self motivated selfish people who decided instead of increasing value they were going to move value around and take a percentage of it.  And they basically game the system to the point at which they've destroyed the system and bankers should get zero bailout.  I agree.  They should all lose their jobs.  I agree.  And have to go back to school because you know what they damaged this country in a really big way.  And it's you know they they did it for very selfish reasons.  And you know everybody wants to be you know a mortgage broker because they can sign these people up for mortgages they can't pay back.  And they just want to get their doesn't matter.  I'm 10 20 thousand dollar commission.  That's right.  They shouldn't get any zero commission until a foreclosure.  You know.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  They should have to pay back the commission they got if the person forecloses have some responsibility for it.  And they shouldn't.  They should have their compensation based upon how risky how the chances of return on the mortgage.  If they do something risky they should get so little that it's not worth them selling the risky ones and they should get a bigger return on the ones that aren't.  They should get it over time.  So they're incentivized to have their clients that mortgage holders actually return you know the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the argument of course is that some of the reason that we got that we went down this path is because our government was pushing banks.  My my my father sat on a board of a bank in the early 90s and started with Clinton saying saying you have we want we want you to lend to more risky clients and force them to and say we're going to show you how to package this so that you can a lot of this came out of the government saying we're going to show  now.  And people would argue is letting people in investments you know the government started creating these packages and allowing people to allowing this is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Allowing them to giving this to people that normally move money around and so on so forth and giving them these new tools and pushing them into those new tools was you know a little bit like you know throwing food into the vipers.  I mean you know you gave them the new tools.  They took it up readily.  And they did they did what they would naturally do you know you know that's the whole thing and I think that you know so we have to be careful of you know it's not all them.  I mean there was a lot of pressure in the early 90s to to expand this and this is an unintended consequence of pushing people into an area that I could also argue it's also a result of a kind of treating free markets as a religion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Free markets are good for some things but there are also some things it's not so good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also an obsession with growth you know and so that's a very big good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People want to have growth at any cost and the problem is you know you having growth you know for a couple of years and then having a collapse is not necessarily a great idea.  So we had 60 percent on a percentage basis on ownership in the country and we we pushed it pushed it pushed it almost to 70 percent.  You know those last couple of percentage points weren't ready to own a home.  You know I wasn't ready to own a home in my 20s and then when people were buying houses out here I saw people in their 20s who were trying to buy homes and it sounds like a noble pursuit.  Yeah get people in a home except it's not noble to set somebody up for failure.  They should have to save some amount of money and if the market moves a little bit slower and consumption goes down that's OK because the people who wind up getting screwed are the are the little guy in the end.  Everybody's getting their commission on Wall Street everybody's getting their money and the little guy then gets a variable mortgage can't pay it back loses their home and then they get seven years of bankruptcy and they could never buy a home again and they're screwed for life.  The whole decade of their life is gone and it's painful and some of these people go and kill themselves or whatever and their lives are ruined.  So it's like setting somebody up for failure.  It's absolutely the fault of these banks because they're pursuing you know massive growth for no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well let's hope we can dig our way out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be a couple of years.  We will.  I have a hundred percent faith we'll get out of this and the way we're going to get out of it is innovation.  I'm with you.  And that's the topic of the show and that I mean that's really what's going to get us out of it is people creating truly innovative products that make the market more efficient make users more efficient and provide value on not just a United States basis but most importantly a global basis.  That's why I've been traveling around the world global products.  Create value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and I think it's very simple.  I think that especially people listening to this is not about you can look at the economy.  The overall economy may not recover very quickly.  It may take some time.  The thing we have to remember is that that the crash of 29 didn't hit the bottom for three years or two years took us a decade in a war a world war to get out of it.  Exactly.  So it was a it took a long time when this happened before but it didn't mean that nobody during that decade did well.  Nobody in that decade did.  You know when you look at the overall indicators it was it was a slow time and it may be a slow time for some time to come.  But individuals if you if you are doing exactly what you guys are talking about innovating if you're finding if you're providing real services to a lot of people you can still be very very successful and perhaps sometimes more successful in an economy like this if you know how to manage that process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason I'd love to get you.  We're running out of time.  I'd love to get you back on though to talk about your trip to Asia.  I think there's a lot to say about that.  Besides meatballs and and watery toilets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now they're definitely pretty pretty advanced and the penetration of broadband is amazing to the point at which they've run out of uses for it.  You know like they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well we could we could come up with some uses for them.  I guarantee you.  You know everything that I do more and more relies on bandwidth.  It relies on broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The most impressive thing I saw when I was over there was a guy pulled out his phone from China and started showing me a massively multiplayer online game on his phone.  And so they have phones that are sort of like the iPhone size screen on a flip up.  And you know he's basically battling characters and you know leveling up and buying swords and there's like six or seven thousand people playing you know essentially like a World of Warcraft on their phone together.  And so he's like OK look I'm going into this city and here I am and oh there's three other users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See this I can't get behind because talk about a waste of productivity talent and time.  I mean this is just that's just leveling up.  Yeah I think in decades to come we're going to we may have the same conversation in 20 years saying you know the real problem was all those idiots playing video games.  That's where all the that's where all the productivity went.  World Warcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want cognitive cycles being put in video.  There's actually I don't know if it was William Gibson or somebody had this in science fiction but people playing a game.  The problems being given to them were actually real problems of like DNA or whatever and they were curing cancer by playing that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ender Ender saved the galaxy by playing a game solve that problem figure out how to take all those useless.  But is it a game or not.  Yeah.  Ender's Game on Audible.com.  A great book.  By the way a great book which we've just spoiled for you so please stop listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please don't edit this part of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Donkey of the Week Jason Calacanis for ruining a perfectly good book.  Jason thank you for being here really appreciate it always great to talk to you you're fantastic.  Mahalo.com M-A-H-A-L-O.com.  Let's give him a plug in of course on Twitter.  Twitter.com slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're so creative.  That's the key to getting in early.  See every time I see a new one I just get in.  I don't really do anything with it.  I just go in and get my name so I have the same name everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I reserved on the Twitter army I reserved a few names so that people like Scoble wouldn't complain to me that somebody else had Scoble.  Alex is at Pixelcore.com.  That's the boy more important than ever.  Exactly what you're talking about.  This is what it was designed for.  The guild of multimedia artists who are learning together and then working and that's the key.  Also Pixelcore.tv for the podcasts.  I'm Leo Laporte.
