And yeah, I was working for about nine and a half months to help relaunch the new Daily Show with Trevor Noah from last August to May.  And I just didn't in part have time.  That job is insanely demanding and also required some approvals to do things that had normally come naturally.  So it was more of a pain logistically and bureaucratically to be here.  Yeah, I understand.  Good to be in my voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're to the way left.  No, actually, I'm going to I'm going to cop to something because after you listened to  last week's show, Baratunde, they said you were very upset and oh yeah, and direct messaged  me, which I was and I was grateful because you didn't do it.  You didn't publicly, you know, you didn't tweet me in public.  You'd you DMed me and and and I think we talked it through, right?

Start time: 400.71
End time: 450.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we definitely did.  And I think, look, I'm trying to practice good citizenry in all forms, and that includes,  like, if I disagree with someone not going straight to the public, but actually talking  directly to the person, it's something that gentrifiers don't do.  They call the cops instead of just talking to their neighbors about turning the music  down.  So I didn't want to do that to you.  And I appreciate the back and forth that we had.  And honestly, I feel a lot better.  Look, the election is very hot topic.  I was specifically I've messaged Leo for those who are like, why were you mad?  Because I just thought he was cutting people off a bit much when they thought that Facebook  and all had some responsibility.  And as the show went on, that conversation did open up.  Obviously, that topic has opened up even more this week.  And I've done a lot more boxing and yoga and housework.  I've burned off a lot of my aggression.

Transcript:  You know what I was doing?  I was I was the guy at Thanksgiving dinner who said, can we not talk about politics,  please?  And I was I lost that battle.  And I understand.  I mean, it's part of it really is part of the nation's dialogue right now.  How about Canada, Georgia?  Is it different up north?  Or do you look down at us below the 49th parallel?

Start time: 472.40
End time: 475.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, already I'm being Eurocentric.  I know Canada is not above us.  It's kind of over there.  But do you do?  Do you?  What?  What do they?  Well, no, because on the map, you know, on the map, it looks like, you know,  Canada, the United States, Mexico.  But that's just a map.  It's not like they're really above us.  They're north of us.  You know what I'm saying?  In fact, my kid's school has an upside down map just to kind of break through the Eurocentric.

Start time: 527.02
End time: 588.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably it was foolish in hindsight.  It was foolish to try to curtail the conversations.  Let's talk about tech.  And one of the things that really is true, while we do focus on tech and we've had a lot of conversation behind the scenes,  all the hosts about how much we want to talk about politics.  And we decided that really our charter is to talk about tech.  And to the degree that politics interferes with tech or involves tech, we certainly will talk about it.  And there's quite a bit to talk about there, including fake news on Facebook and so forth.  But FCC, moving forward, there's a lot of stuff.  There's a lot there.  But what I don't want to do is have our audience, which comes to us, I think, somewhat for a respite from the fact that we're  from what was incessant political talk to just say, well, there's nowhere I can turn now because that's all anybody's talking about.  Right. Right.  But I completely understood what you were saying and I didn't disagree with you.  I'm trying to mediate my own progressive tongue as much as anything.

Start time: 589.89
End time: 622.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think we're good.  And I think, look, if there's a tech angle to even what we're talking about now,  for me, it's that we have the ability to message each other and actually have conversation.  We often choose to heighten discord and tension for the sake of performing our disagreements rather than honestly seeking to deal with them.  Well, and Twitter facilitates that in ways that is highly, in my opinion, destructive.  Many of these networks encourage it.  Yeah.  If your message is not public, it can't be monetized.

Start time: 622.36
End time: 641.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have had horrible Twitter fights with people, lost friends on Twitter because of intemperate things I've said and probably would never have said in public in person.  But Twitter just kind of lends itself.  I know you don't like Twitter because you just be Twitter bashing.

Start time: 641.42
End time: 678.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter is like the kid you just don't like and you be telling everybody all the time how that kid is always messing up.  My last podcast was called Facebook Power Ticket.  I didn't have a basic story.  I sit in the middle.  I see both sides.  I say, well, they mean this and they mean that.  And I try to have a conversation.  I had somebody come into my comment and say, you don't support Owen if you voted for Trump.  You're just a racist, blah, blah, blah.  Now, this is a white woman that I happen to sleep with.  And I'm saying, why are you yelling at this person and calling him a racist, Tony?  Hey, you don't know my relationship with this person.  But people go insane in their mind when they pick their size and they play their games.  But Twitter, they said, talking to each other.  Twitter.

Start time: 679.02
End time: 683.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People, you know, Twitter facilitates this.  Twitter's an imaginary person.

Start time: 684.00
End time: 685.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it facilitates it.  Don't pay attention to it.

Start time: 686.47
End time: 689.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't.  I think you shouldn't pay attention to it.

Start time: 689.22
End time: 692.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Internet does it, Leo.  The Internet.  It's the Internet.

Start time: 693.26
End time: 712.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I feel like I contributed to some derailing, Leo, because I'm going to try to help maintain the thread and undo some of the damage I may have done by taking this awkward.  You were asking, Georgia, how things were going up north.  Up north.  Down north.  But up north, side north in Canada.  Yeah.  I said Apple.

Start time: 714.83
End time: 717.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Usually when I say Apple, he's like, Apple?  Oh, I got a lot to say about Apple, buddy.

Start time: 718.00
End time: 719.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am pissed off about Apple.

Start time: 720.02
End time: 726.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me tell you something.  Tell me.  We're going to get to that in a second.  But Georgia?  We're in shock.

Start time: 729.34
End time: 732.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canadians are in shock.  Is there a sense?

Start time: 733.00
End time: 743.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, everybody's in shock.  But is there a sense that it could be bad news for Canada or are you just worried about a whole bunch of people moving there?

Start time: 743.00
End time: 774.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of people.  There's a lot of people planning on moving here.  It isn't as easy to immigrate to Canada as people think.  But no, I think that people are genuinely worried what's going to happen with our trade agreements.  The U.S. is our biggest trade partner.  So a lot of things could be changed because of that.  And also just to see the strife that's happening to our neighbors is hard for us because, you know, this is something that we can't actually apologize for.  Perfect.

Start time: 778.06
End time: 779.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so glad we brought it back to Canada.

Start time: 780.48

Transcript:  That was the best.

Start time: 782.29
End time: 886.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  I'll tell you what.  Let's defer.  Let's let's deflect it to England for a moment because they have now passed the Snoopers Charter.  Theresa May, who is the current prime minister after Brexit in Great Britain, had proposed this years ago and has pushed it several times, never been able to get it through Parliament.  Now both Houses of Parliament, Commons and Lords have approved it.  It awaits the sovereign's approval, believe it or not.  And once the Queen says yes, once the Queen says OK, which apparently is the right thing to do,  I don't think she will weigh in on this.  The actual name of it is the Investigatory Powers Act.  It is, according to what I'll read what Corey Doctorow says in Boing Boing.  And by the way, Corey lived in London for many years and is very well aware of the issues there.  The most extreme surveillance law in Europe, more extreme than the Patriot Act.  And Snowden, in fact, tweeted at I think yesterday, he says it goes farther than many autocracies.  New spying powers to the government.  The government now will require all ISPs to save everything you do online to make it available to the government on demand.  It also undermines cryptography.  This is kind of a this picture of Theresa May shaking Putin's hand is a little bit inflammatory because I don't know if they're really related to the story.  But it is it is the law that we have in the United States been very afraid of.  There have been rumblings that this would happen in the United States as well.  Extreme surveillance.

Start time: 888.00
End time: 890.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how did they justify it?

Start time: 891.18
End time: 976.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the interesting thing.  I mean, I guess the overall justification for this and the Patriot Act was a fear of terrorism.  And it's felt that, you know, law enforcement needs these tools to fight terrorism.  And I presume that that's the argument made in the UK, although I don't I don't I don't see much of that.  Snowden tweeted the UK just legalized the most extreme surveillance in the history of Western democracy.  It goes further than many autocracy.  It includes bulk data collection by the GCHQ.  And by the way, GCHQ works with the NSA.  So this is this is something, you know, that probably the NSA would like to pass as well.  And apparently, President-elect Trump's nominee for the CIA head is kind of an interesting.  Again, we seem to have to read a lot of tea leaves when it comes to what Donald Trump wants to do.  But Mike Pompeo, who is a member of Congress, he's on the Intelligence Committee,  has both said he wants to increase mass surveillance.  He has said he thinks using encryption is a red flag and I use encryption whenever I can.  But he also says he doesn't believe in back doors in encryption.  OK, that's good. So it's an interesting mix, isn't it?

Start time: 978.08
End time: 1020.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like we've been here before.  Yeah. And it's. We should all be taking care to erase things that we think shouldn't just exist in the hands of these companies  who already have shown that they can't hold on to it with or without government orders like Yahoo, Target.  Name a company. They've lost your data. So we don't exactly need the government to come along and ask for it.  They will probably be leaking it out a side door as we speak and then using encryption tools.  Just good, healthy Internet practice like something I'm trying to be better about myself.  But yeah, this seems like an obviously not good thing, like an obviously bad thing.  Anybody want to argue in favor of a digital police state?

Start time: 1027.40
End time: 1036.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not as a non-criminal entity, a person who's not somewhere in a basement and an underclosed location.  I have nothing to fear. I love your background. You're just in a black room.

Start time: 1041.04
End time: 1064.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we should. By the way, he'll never say that on the air.  But we should point out that Owen has rarely been arrested when he's pulled over for driving while black.  So that's good, too. Right. That's great. Yeah, that's great.  It works out my favor. How many times this year? What is your what is the current count?  Twenty four. I'm just going to let that six in.  Let's sink in a little bit. Sixty three times.

Start time: 1065.84
End time: 1074.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sixty three times in the last three years, and I've only gotten 16 tickets.  So most of the time they pull me over.  They realize that I'm a black guy named Owen and they say, hey, and then they let me go.

Start time: 1075.14
End time: 1080.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? Because it's the Owen is getting you off the hook.  A guy pulled a cop pulled me over one time when I was in my hybrid.

Start time: 1081.00
End time: 1088.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's like, Owen. And I'm like, yeah, hybrid, huh?  I'm like, yep, not thugging and bugging and Alexis with rims. Sorry.

Start time: 1088.50
End time: 1103.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're pulling you over because you are a curiosity.  They're like, wait, that is a black man in a hybrid.  I got pulled over. Owen. Oh, my God.  They probably have a back channel where they just swap your picture amongst themselves.  I got him, too. You got to pull this guy over. He's a hoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I drove by a cop. I got a really loud radio.  There's like 3000 watts. I'll be bumping.  I rode by a cop bumping Taylor Swift and he pulled me over.  I'm like, is Taylor Swift?

Start time: 1128.30
End time: 1149.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the excuse is used and, you know, for I mean, it's clearly racial profiling,  but the excuse is used. The same excuse that's the Snoopers Charter and the Patriot Act,  that as long as you're doing nothing wrong, we're doing everything we can to protect our neighborhoods,  to protect against terrorism.  And as long as you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear.  This is no stop and frisk. This is just.

Start time: 1150.68
End time: 1170.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think, look, to take the metaphor further, it's not like, Owen, you've somehow you are a unicorn,  not because you love Taylor Swift, Java, hybrid, and are named Owen,  but because you've survived all these encounters.  That's your way beyond the data plot for any reasonable cluster.  Like you're an outlier.

Transcript:  And because of how many times you've lived, like you've lived 63 times.  And that's the system.  That's a terrible way to think of it. Oh, my God.  That's the scary thing.  And when you take the take all this abuse of power, right?  Most cops don't abuse power. It just takes a few to really skew the system.  Let's say it's five percent. That's still way too many now.  But because they have guns and badges which shield them from accountability for use of those guns,  they are encouraged, the bad ones, to keep doing bad things.  So now you give the government all this surveillance, snooping, history, you know, browsing and hacking power.  And five, ten percent to what is the digital version of pulling over Owen?  Who are the communities that are going to be subject to abuse by this power?  It's probably not Leo Laporte in general.  It's probably our Muslim brothers and sisters.  Like, depending on the society we're talking about, different groups are going to be targeted by this.  So that burden of non-accountability is going to be borne by some people who really are already going through some tough times as it is.  It's just the risk of abuse, which has been proven to happen, is one of the main reasons why you don't concentrate this much power in such narrow hands.  It's so obvious.

Transcript:  People, we're, unfortunately we become complacent way too easily.  If it's not about us, if it doesn't directly affect us, rarely do people do something because that puts them in an eye  and that makes them feel like they're going to be targeted.  And so unfortunately it only, it takes things to become really bad before people decide now I have to get up and fight  because this is for all of us, right?  Like if this can be done to one person, then it could eventually be done to you as well.  But people only get upset when it's something that affects themselves or a loved one.  And we're becoming more and more boxed in.  Like as we become more attached to like the internet and social media and other things that kind of keep us away from general people at large,  we become able to survive without having to actually deal with things.  Like we don't have to open up a browser that's dealing with a difficult subject that we don't really want to deal with.  So it's much easier for us to turn a blind eye and feel like everything's going to be okay.  And when things get really bad, but it has to be, it's becoming unfortunately worse and worse before people will actually take up a stand  and say, this is something that I need to fight for.  And that's a really dangerous area of social psychology because we end up with that group think of like,  us and them. And that's really, really dangerous because in the end it's all us.

Transcript:  So when we talk about privacy, there's really a couple of issues.  It's not merely government snooping.  And I think at least so far that might have been an over that might be an overblown concern.  There's also the issue of commercial snooping.  Uber, for instance, has just changed its terms of service for people who use the Uber car service.  Uber may and you, Uber's sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to Uber textual audio and visual content, commentary and feedback.  By providing user content to Uber, you grant Uber a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty free license.  We've all seen this. To sub license, use, copy.  In other words, Uber is saying anything we get from you, we can use without further notice or consent from you or without the requirement of payment to you.  Some are seeing this as a grab.  Remember, when you get an Uber, they're gathering all sorts of information about you, where you've been, where you're going, who you are.  If you've got Spotify, what you're listening to because they tie into your Spotify account.  And now apparently this is all becoming grist for the mill.  If I have an Amazon Echo and I do everywhere in my house, the Echo, as an example, could be listening to what TV shows I'm watching.  And then they make record of that and sell it to the networks as ratings information.  It would actually be the best ratings tool the networks ever had.  So that's another kind of snooping that is an issue.  And then there's a third issue with this, which is a security issue, because if the government can snoop on you, you have back doors in your encryption or whatever.  If commercial entities can snoop on you, hackers can also use these avenues to not only snoop on you, but to mess with you.  So all three of these are issues.  The government is the only one of these three that owns guns, of course, and nuclear weapons.  But they're all to be concerned about, yes?

Transcript:  Absolutely. And I think we also, when we went digital, we stopped physically owning a lot of the production of our lives.  Like if you took a picture before in the analog world, you developed that.  You could develop it yourself or you could go to one hour photo and hope they didn't make copies.  But that was yours to lose in a fire, to sell, to misplace in an attic and discover 50 years later and be really excited by it.  But now so much of that that we produce about ourselves, our location, our thoughts, our memos, our notes to self are physically owned by someone else.  And we have there's a land grab that's been made.  Like you're not just a phone company customer.  You're like a rich source of data and insights that's monetizable that you didn't really sign up for, not actively.  Right. It's this sort of retroactive.  Oh, by the way, we own your family and your children in perpetuity in all forms of media, in all modes of time and space and the intersection thereof.  And we have been late as citizens, much less consumers, but as citizens to claim ourselves.  And this is something you mentioned, SEC earlier, Dr.  Tom Wheeler released a recent policy, which is like with respect to the telcos, that data is ours and you have to like check with us before you do all kinds of things.  So what Uber is doing is sadly common because everybody's got the same lawyers and they're all working with the same generally behind the times,  overwhelmed and perhaps totally unaware user base that doesn't know what to do about this, even if made aware of it.  Like what are we supposed to do? And saying don't use stuff is just like saying just say no.  Like these services have been made so integral and so addictive in our lives that saying not to use them is pretty meaningless for a significant portion of the population whose employers demand it, whose friend networks demand it, whose sense of self is so tied into it, which was it's like a perfect drug.  So how do we fight it? What do we do?

Transcript:  Listen, listen to my joke to how it rolls in that for you cut me off and let me go ahead.  That's the general way to do this because the layman people, people that are not in you or your bubble or even my bubble don't understand these things.  But once the crowd gets to hear about you just say Uber is going to steal all your stuff.  Who's going to sell myself? Hey, man, you hear who's going to sell myself? Uber is stealing my stuff.  Next thing you know, everybody doesn't really know what's going on, but at least they look and they check because when you sign up for Uber and you scroll through that five page thing and click OK, because you're trying to get a ride home in the rain, you don't have time to read that.  These people do a very good job of not informing their customer base about what they're doing.  And usually what happens is, again, somebody gets screwed over and something bad happens and then everybody will know about it.  And then they have an upward like with Facebook and taking people's pictures and things like that.  So we just need to inform people better. There needs to be some law that puts in chunk form, simple bite form.  Hey, we're using your stuff. And if you want to opt out, do it.  If not, don't use our service because it's all hidden away in those long form contracts.  People don't know about.

We're constantly sacrificing our future for the things that we want in the present.  We don't think about the repercussions for our actions and we are way too short sighted and nepotistic to really care.  And like what, you know, Orwell really didn't think about is that we're the ones sticking our cameras everywhere, you know, installing them in our private rooms, carrying them wherever we go.  And in the end, our biggest fear isn't that people are going to be watching us, but that people might not be.  So we've we've created this ourselves.

Coca Cola, instead of creating this one way data flow from the from the customer back to Coca Cola server so that they can monetize your image to get other people to create a relationship from themselves to other Coca Cola servers.  They could have created something that connected you to other Coca Cola drinkers.  They could have encouraged some level like community find someone in your neighborhood like I don't know.  I'm being a little cheesy right now, but I just I think there's such a narrow imagination around how all these organizations and all these incentives are built, which is just like they're treating us like the natural resource that they're mining and they'll discard us.  We're not. That's the new way of business.  Yeah, and it's so extractive and it's so lazy.  Ultimately, this is pretty lazy.  So I want them to like step up if you're going to exploit me like at least make it more interesting.  But a selfie camera taped to the bottom of a Coke bottle is pretty low rent.

So they recognize the power of these nonlinear formats to extend story.  That's been pretty exciting to see.  And then I think the thing that honestly, the thing that got me the most excited was that third type.  Like, how do you create new stuff that is inspired by and in the voice of the Daily Show, but not in a 22 minute video format for distribution through proprietary cable network?  But instead, how do you make an interactive app or a mockery of the March Madness?  March Madness.  And in this case, we did a third month mania where instead of basketball teams, it was issues and people and who you hated the most, like who which made you mad or Bill Cosby or Martin Shkreli.  And is it tangled headphones or taco trucks?

And which one do America or Americans the most mad at?  And in a prescient move, Trump supporters beat out climate change.  So this is obviously a satirical construct, but it was a technically sound build, like it was super fascinating interactive and lots of jokes in it.  So that was that's a flavor of what the job was.  And I think if I'll say one last thing off the pedestal, because I think people are listening that this may matter for.  It was so much less about what I brought to that show in terms of like I came in with 50 ideas and we did 13 of them or something like that.  And I think for me, it was the humbling excitement of being able to unlock what was already there and just showing people a new way.  It's almost like being a language instructor.  And when people can start to like express themselves in a new language, you can once you can make a joke in another language like you're really right.  You get the language.  So once you can make a joke with the Internet or a joke with technology or with VR with various flavors of these things, you're first of all, you realize like, you know, I'm really funny.  Like I can do this in multiple languages, but not just spoken ones.  And so I think we were able our team to work with folks who are already there, show them some new things and like collaboratively unlock some more creative and comedic potential that didn't necessarily fit in that 22 minute video.

So if you get to start right now and the future is just a second ahead of you, you're going to be more futuristic.  If you have to adapt a 20 year operating strategy and maintain all the legacy networks and personalities and billing systems, it's just it's hard.  And I've been in this position multiple times now with like older media organizations stepping more aggressively into the future.  And you were to the onion. The onion got it right.  I was there for five years. Yeah.  I mean, that was another great job, one of the best jobs I ever had.  And the onion went pretty blazing into the future.  But it wasn't I mean, I had a lot of internal conversation, shall we say, to try to justify and explain and convince and show why this matters, why it's not just some kind of vanity project, but why it's maintaining relevance and interestingness.

Transcript:  And then I'll be I am on the National Geographic as a correspondent.  Oh, neat.  There's a new show called Explorer.  It airs right after their Mars show on Monday nights.  And I am all up in the second episode on November 21st.  So for those who are listening in time to catch it or catch it on on demand, tune into Nat Geo Explorer, where you'll see me doing field pieces and panel discussions and all kinds of fun stuff.  And what is the topic of this episode?  The topic of this episode largely has to deal with criminal justice in America.  Interesting.  So Nat Geo obviously goes to the bottom of the sea, satellites, ancient pyramids.  But they're taking this Explorer concept into also social issues and human interest and whatnot.  So I did a story about policing outside of New Orleans.  There's a story about private prisons.  And there's a really amazing story about honey that I think helps helps bring money seekers pursue a new high.

We're talking about the week's tech news.  We have...  Actually, it's in the other room, the new Apple MacBook.  We did an interview yesterday on the new screensavers with Kyle Weins.  He's at ifixit.com.  And as you know, ifixit does teardowns of all of the new stuff whenever it comes out.  They did a teardown on the new MacBook.  It's kind of part of their mission, which is to kind of make repair manuals, tools,  and parts available for everything.  So one of the things they do when they do a teardown is they rate these things on how  easily you can repair them.  The new MacBook got a repair factor of one, repairability of one...  On a scale of what?  Out of 10.  The lowest...  I said, could you go lower?  He said, well, I guess you could get a zero.

Transcript:  That's what Tim Cook says.  It's a beautiful thing.  But in their haze to make thinner, lighter notebooks, what Apple's really done is make  notebooks that is not upgradable.  You can't add RAM.  It's a big iPhone.  It's a big iPhone.  It's exactly the model.  Even down to the point where not only the battery is not removable, they're so heavily  glued in.  Kyle said it was almost impossible to get them out.  We had infinite patience.  And this is the thing that really bugs me.  Not recyclable.  Really?  Yeah.  He says, we hear from recyclers all the time who have fires from lithium ion batteries.  They're either left in by accident or we didn't find it.  And when they grind it up, of course, as with any lithium ion battery, it explodes and it  bursts into flame.  And it's a real problem for recyclers to the point where this is going in the landfill.  This is not going to be recycled.

But they came back and they're like, oh, no, but we do this and we have our new building  is going to be LEED certified.  It's a spaceship.  It can take us to Mars.  If the earth ever melts down.

Transcript:  And they're a member of EP.  And their stuff is EP certified.  But I have to think it has a little bit to do with the millions of dollars they gave  EP more than the sustainability of the electronics.  Here's what I'm going to propose.  By the way, it's not just Apple.  It's everybody.  This is the Google Pixel sealed battery.  Right now, it may be possible to take it apart and take the battery out easily.  I don't know.  But I think increasingly the drive towards thinner electronics is driving us towards  sealed cases and batteries.  Remember the days when you could take the back of a phone and replace the battery or  pop the battery out of a laptop and put a new one in.  I mean, the battery goes bad in a few years anyway.  These are they're essentially making disposable electronics.  And this is an awful big chunk of disposable electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you're supposed to bring your old stuff back to Apple.  He said, I know the recycler that Apple uses and no.  And so here's the issue.  Going forward, I think we as consumers for our own benefit, because replaceable batteries  are good for us.  It keeps electronics lasting longer.  If you have a cell phone with a replaceable battery, you can put a second battery in.  And it's good for the environment.  Shouldn't we start demanding not thinner and lighter, but removable batteries and recycling?  First of all, I'll go ahead.

She's still rocking with one of those old white MacBooks.  And I'm like, is this something from like, it's like from 2005 and she still uses it.

Transcript:  At least the computers now that they're making now that they're making super sized iPhones.  I don't know if that's going to be true anymore.  I mean, this is a, this is a weird shift and it doesn't have the creative power.  Like you said yourself, I'm look, I'm honestly thinking, this is not a commitment, but it  is a public exploration.  Like I've been in this Apple ecosystem for a long time.  I used to build my own PCs.  I used to try to play with Linux on the side and then I just got suckered because Apple  made it easy and I was like, I could do other things with my time, but I feel a loss of  freedom and self and I'm just not, I'm not trying to have that.  So I'm really considering doing the PC thing just to diversify my interface.  Every once in a while I'll switch my mail app, my calendar app, just to change the interface.  So I don't get too hooked on what somebody thinks I should see the world as.  And Apple has gotten me like deep into their world with Apple TV and iTunes and everything  else.  And this laptop, I'm probably not going to get it, but it's like another little symbol.  Like why would I give them everything and at least spread pieces of me around?  Like if you're going to exploit me, I'm going to make it as hard as I can and still, I know  have a life that functions in the modern world.  Here's Colbert.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to talk about something else that you probably don't want to do around this time of year, and that's go to the post office.  The holidays are coming.  You know what they call that at the post office?  Amateur hour.  If you use the postal service for business, maybe you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon, or maybe you send out bills or invoices or brochures.  If you're doing business in the post office, you don't want to go to the post office when all the non-business users are there.  Tying up the post office, traffic, parking.  It's going to be packed.  Everybody mailing holiday gifts.  But the truth is year-round, you can save time, save money, save anxiety by using Stamps.com.  Stamps.com online lets you buy and print official U.S. postage from your computer, your printer.  It's not a postage meter.  You can use what you've already got.  In fact, they will send you for free a digital scale worth 50 bucks so that you can weigh every package and have exactly the right postage.  You can print the postage right on the envelope or you can print a label for a box.  Any kind of mailing.  Any kind of mailing.  You can print on plain paper, an envelope.  They have Stamps.com labels that let you print, actually print stamps.  You can have your company logo on it.  The return address is automatically filled in.  It's great.  It's all true.  It's all true.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's more.  If you go to Stamps.com right now and click the microphone in the upper right hand corner, use the offer code TWIT.  And not only will you get the scale, you will get $55 in coupons for free postage.  What?

Transcript:  And because they do charge you for shipping of the scale, it's five bucks.  They'll give you a $5 supply kit and of course a month free of Stamps.com.  So it all works out to about $110 value.  And I'm telling you, it is the most professional way.  You want to look professional.  If you sell on Etsy, maybe on Etsy you don't mind having a brown paper package wrapped with Twine and about 100 Amelia Earhart stamps on it.  But most of us would like to look a little more professional.  And this is what it will do.  Plus it will save you time.  It even fills out the forms for certified mail and customs forms for overseas mail, stuff like that.  It's so great.  And then the mail carrier comes to you and picks it up.  You can have a nice conversation.  You can ask the mail carrier, do you like me?  Stamps.

Whatever is grabbing these many minutes of people's time a day, people assume is worth something.  Whether they can get that money back, we'll see.  I'm not so sure.  I don't know if they should be able to, honestly.  But the size doesn't shock me, given how obsessive the use is and just how fun the thing is.  It's kind of like a game and a social environment.

I understand the marketing because you Snapchat.  But I'm saying the demographic is like 13 and 19.  What money do they got to buy the stuff that you're trying to sell that you think you're going to advertise to a 13-year-old that don't even cut grass because he's Snapchatting all day and got no time, had no real time because he's a lazy millennial or whatever the generation is now.

I understand the power, I understand the uses of it.  I just think the inflation and the hype on this product is not worth the money that they're trying to get when they go public.

I much preferred to just put weird things next to each other or try to tell an actual story.  I do ride alongs and point of view.  Most of the time the camera's not actually on my face.  It's on the world because I happen to think the world is still interesting.  Yeah.  I try to share my view of it rather than just people can just look at my profile pictures and see my face.  I think I will show them what I'm actually seeing often more interesting.

And he's like the next stage in the evolution of media.  Yes.  We used to have big networks and gatekeepers and only a few people had a voice.  Then we get radio, we get cable, we get all kinds of other modes of media that basically give more people the power to speak.  And as we do that, our attention span gets shorter and shorter and shorter.  So we have to get more and more stimulus in order to pay any kind of attention.  And he knows that we have infinite channels now because of the Internet.  We have reddits and then subreddits.  We have all this stuff.  And he is like a walking, talking, animated gif of noise.  He is basically like I described him as a denial of service attack because he floods the system with so much that you can't actually respond.  And legitimate requests get blocked because he keeps talking about Hamilton and how they attacked his vice president, how it's unfair.  It's really interesting.

It's in their interest to do that, right?  To continually do that.  I have to tell my mom, who's 83, she watches CNN.  I have to say, stop it.  Because what you see, for her, everything is burning down all the time.  Because that's all, of course, that's all it shows.  We've tried good news.  Nobody wants good news.  So this is just, we live in a media environment.  And this is why I hate Twitter, because I think Twitter's kind of the epitome of this, of just this constant barrage of factoids.  The whole fake news thing to me is a meaningless argument.  Because fake news wouldn't work if people didn't want to believe it and didn't want to spread it.  We live in an environment where there is no truth, because it's all, it's not just Mr. Trump, it's everybody spewing all the time.  And that's the environment we live in.

Like people fall off of things all the time without taking a selfie.  I think that people need to learn, you know, sometimes by tripping and falling and hurting yourself, you learn, you know what, maybe I shouldn't have done that.  We sometimes get so wrapped up in ourselves that we're not really thinking about it.  I don't think that they need to give us any warning.  How about distracted driving?  Be careful.  That should be illegal.  That's what we have laws in Canada that you get arrested and you're going to lose demerit points if you get caught.  And there's cops that just, you know, take a look and see if you're using your phone while you're on there and you're going to lose demerit points and lose your license for that.

We never have any downtime.  And that causes an addiction reaction inside of us.  And so you end up going through withdrawal if you're even driving on a long trip and you can't message it.

Transcript:  And it's not our fault.  What if it's not our fault?  No, it's not. I'll tell you why.  Society of Neuroscience meeting in San Diego this week.  They they there was a study they took young mice and they exposed them to six hours daily of a sound and light show reminiscent of a video game.  According to the director of the Center for Integrative Brain Research at Seattle's Children's Hospital, the mice showed dramatic changes everywhere in the brain.  Many of those changes suggest that you have a brain that is wired up at a much more baseline excited level.  You need more stimulation to get the brain's attention.  What are we doing to our kids now?  We're plunking them down in front of screens as young as one and two years old and they have many more than six hours of screen time nonstop.  Now, the debate at this event was, well, the benefits may outweigh the negative sides to this.  The American Academy of Pediatrics said a less sensitive brain might thrive in a world where overstimulation overstimulation overstimulate overstimulation is a common problem.  The American Academy of Pediatrics relaxed its longstanding recommendation against any screen time for kids under two.  Now, it's just mice.

Transcript:  But but we already know that look, you don't hire psychologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, applied mathematicians and other forms of mental manipulation artists for your various startups because you're trying to support science.  You do that.  Let's gamify everything.  Not for like some general credit.  You're not a university here.  You're not trying to educate the public.  You're trying to maximize shareholder value.  And so the thing that these companies are doing and Tristan Harris is my public service announcement is my plug for somebody not named Baratunde.  Everybody check out time well spent dot I.O. and he is a former product philosopher at Google.  He's worked in the tech industry.  He's worked in UX and he's made the case that this this black mirror in our hands is a slot machine and it is the most advanced slot machine ever invented.  It hacks into it pushes all the low level buttons and we don't actually control it.  We are we are small little tiny specs against the great onslaught of trillions of dollars of investment in breaking down our willpower.  And so we and we're encouraged all the default settings to share more to open more to feel socially obligated to follow people back to add more friends on something called LinkedIn for some reason.  So I really I don't think it's as simple as we could stop and just take personal responsibility because there's this collective irresponsible action happening with the backing of trillions of dollars.  That's financially very lucrative for them to win.  And us standing alone against that is futile.  Like we need some way smarter systems on our side to help sway the balance a little bit.  This is a good resource.

Start time: 5693.00
End time: 5801.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like that's that's never going to happen.  It's not the way that our economies work.  Unfortunately, you we have to know and and understand what we let our kids it starts off with them consume.  So I deal in technology all day like I have every single video game system under the sun.  But my kids don't get to play but for maybe an hour to a week of video games and TV because I know what happens to their brains.  Like I just see it in my sessions all the time.  You look your kid looks like they're really calm but their brain waves are flying.  And after that you get better at whatever you do.  You are constantly at every moment of every second of every day.  Whatever you are doing, you are neuro.  You're you're firing neurons together that will wire together to get better at whatever that activity is.  So if you're consuming a lot of fast paced media, you're going to get better at consuming fast paced media.  But then without that media, exactly as you said, there Monday is that you know, you end up going through that withdrawal effect because of that, because no longer are you hooked up to something that you have gotten used to.  And so we need to talk about it is the first thing so that people understand because they don't know how addicted they are until they end up going somewhere where they don't have any signal or they lose battery power and they feel that feeling of, oh, my goodness, I feel like I've been disconnected from the world.  And I no longer feel as comfortable as I did before.  So I think that, yeah, we are a certain amount responsible.  And yes, companies definitely are spending a lot of money paying people in my field in order to make our levels of addiction even greater so that you'll buy more products.  But that doesn't take us out of the equation.  I think that that, you know, we are not mindless sheep going through to the slaughter.  We are choosing to consume these products.  And we need to say, when are we going to let ourselves calm down and shut ourselves down from them?  And that's important.

Start time: 5801.89
End time: 5883.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we definitely need to.  I'm sorry, I was going to say it's definitely a lot to do with like your own personal control, even though the system is against you, because parents, especially with children.  Now, when you're an adult, you make your own decisions.  Look at that screen for 12 hours a day.  That's on you.  When you have kids, if you're not a parent, you just stick that in front of them.  Instead of giving them a book to read.  That's on you.  Like my daughter, you know, she's got the phone got tablet all stuff, but in the car, she's not allowed to play on a tablet.  She has to read books.  And when we get home, she has to read for hours for she can get on the thing.  But she's watching this one show.  It's called Pat and Jen.  She doesn't want to watch any TV shows.  All she wants to do is watch Pat and Jen.  And I'm like, what is this Pat and Jen?  I turn around, I look at him like, okay, it's something stupid.  I went to her room when she was sleeping, she was talking to her sleep.  Now she's never cussed in her life.  I never heard her cuss.  Now they say hell and damn on there.  And she's cussing in her sleep, repeating Pat and Jen.  I was like, yo, she woke up next to me and I'm like, ain't no more Pat and Jen for two weeks.  She's like, what happened?  I'm like, no, like you in here repeating.  She's like, I did.  I'm like, yes, like it's in your brain and there's no more Pat and Jen.  You can watch something else.  You can read more, but you can't watch that show because it does program children, especially like adults.  Like I said, that's your own personal choice.  You don't do it as an adult.  We need to watch out for our kids and help them not be a dick.  That's why I cut her off in the car and all her friends complain.  I'm like, you don't need you got music.  You got each other.  Let's talk.  Listen to the radio, but you don't need to have your face in a screen 24 seven.  So there is some personal accountability.  You know, the machine is against us.  It is against us.

Transcript:  So to lower your amazing.  Yeah, I, I, I thank you, Georgia, for making such a strong case for the power of humans.  And, and I definitely don't mean to imply that we are not part of the equation.  And you're right.  We do have some choice in it.  But so did companies have some responsibilities.  But I think our power as individuals is overrated in this, in a case like this, where they're using the best of science against us and no individual has those resources to combat it.  But I also think it's a little too defeatist to say we can't do anything about it beyond individual action.  And that's like some of the greatest changes in the history of the world is when we've come together and said that's not acceptable.  We don't have children working in labor camps for the most part anymore.  Even though that was normal, like the economy was powered by it, but it no longer is because we kind of drew some line and it wasn't just the goodwill of people.  It was like a lot of sticking together from folks who had something to lose and others who felt like I lied with it.  And this I'm not even trying to fully equate to child labor, but I'm just saying like that was a big deal that people could never have imagined not existing anymore.  And I just I think if we don't acknowledge that the power to combat this has to involve something on par with the power that's suppressing our individuality, which isn't just personal choice, then we're not going to fight it the right way.  And so at a minimum, just like you have people trying to get unaddicted to cigarettes and they use nicotine patches and there's programs like if that's just for cigarettes, which is relatively minor compared to all the mind hacking going on in your Instagram feed alone.  Like why is why is the feed bottomless? This is one of Tristan's major points like any service that gives you an infinite scroll is attacking your mind because it's luring you constantly.  You never finish. What if you a book that had infinite pages?  You would never finish the book, right? That's psychotic.  Wow. But that's Instagram and Facebook and Twitter.  That's the default setting because it benefits them and not us to stay on that system all the time.  And we can't just fight that one person at a time.  We can at a minimum have some tech tools to help us know how much time we've spent to set some personal limits, at least assist us in maintaining our willpower and those declarations that we make.  Otherwise, those declarations are pretty meaningless compared to all the science that's fighting us.

Well, I don't want to waste that time, but I quickly need to take a break and we'll have more Baratunde's here.  Georgia Dow. Oh, doctor. I love these guys and I love this panel.  Thank you for being here today. Really is fantastic.  Our show today brought to you by Harry's for guys who want a great shave experience for a fraction of what you're paying now.  You know, I started growing a beard. I wanted to be like Baratunde.  And, man, I went out. It's expensive having a beard. I thought this would save me time and money.  I had to get beard oil, beard balm, beard comb, beard brush, beard shampoo.  And then I said, screw it. I'm going back to Harry's and I shaved a whole beard ecosystem.  I had a beard ecosystem and now I don't know. I'll send it to you.  Harry's is awesome. In fact, they've got the brand new.  This is a great gift idea. Certainly, if you if everybody even if you have a beard, you have to shave unless you want to have a beard that goes all the way down to your navel.  Harry's has a great deal for holiday shopping for anybody.  A thoughtful gift that's useful and practical and affordable like this.  The Winter Winston. This is beautiful. It's a limited edition.  They did this last year with Winter Winston was a copper handle.  Now they've got a midnight blue chrome razor handle.  You can get it engraved with initials. It makes it extra special.  And, of course, as with all of Harry's shaving kits, you get three of their German engineered five blade cartridges.  They give you a beautiful close comfortable shave foaming shave gel that smells amazing.  The beautifully designed gift box.  Now it is normally thirty dollars on Harry's dot com, but we've partnered with Harry's to give you five dollars off on your order.  Just use the offer code TWIT5 and you're going to five dollars off.  And this is a really nice gift.  And if you really want a gift that keeps on giving, get a subscription for the blades and the shave gel or the shave cream.  And you're going to make somebody very happy.  Harry's blades are better than the drugstore blades at half the cost because they bought the factory in Germany.  And I have to admit, I was growing that beard. I kind of missed my Harry's.  It was like a reunion with a loved one.  I shaved off that beard and I got back with Harry's.  Go to Harry's dot com right now to get five dollars off a limited edition holiday shave set while supplies last.  And don't forget to enter the code TWIT5 at checkout.  Free shipping ends December 9th.  So if you want to get it for the holidays, do not delay Harry's dot com.  Don't forget the offer code TWIT number five.  That's for five dollars off.

Especially this kind of fake news. It's visceral. It's about my beliefs.  And I just don't think... I think the way to get rid of fake news is to give people information.  And I think, you know, Jeff Jarvis had a great medium post in which he proposed exactly that.  Not censoring Facebook, but getting tools on Facebook for making it easier for people to report something that's blatantly false.  To have Facebook maybe add additional links.  He did this with John Borthwick of Buzzfeed to sites like Snopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think what we've done... And I can't take full credit for some of this language, but I agree with it fully.  And I'm the one saying it now, so you can say you heard it from me, but I didn't create it.  We have torn down a lot.  The Internet has destroyed so much of how we knew the world to work.  It destroyed some real heinous things like the music industry, which were not operating in the best interest of many,  though a lot of good people have lost in the way the new system is starting to emerge.  It's destroyed. Most incumbent institutions will not either survive or look at all like the way they have and how they achieve their power.  And media as a structure, not just the media business, not just the news in particular, but all kinds of content, totally different.  And we've torn down the way it used to be done, and we haven't fully established what it's going to be.  And so we've mostly broken the world.  And that's true in every, as you say, in every industry.  Exactly. In every education, in banking, in politics. Like you just see everything will fall.  And that sounds like ominous. But I think it's just a fact.  And we haven't even redesigned, much less rebuilt, what we want it to look like.  And so we developed norms in the old media system, as lazy as it could be, as corrupt as it could be.  It had norms. It had expectations. You had some understanding, some semblance of what fairness was.  This new system ripped all that to shreds.  And so when it's profitable, when it's extremely profitable to traffic in absolute lies and there's no check on that, like that's a feature.  Because we're in the in between. Right. We're in the upside down of the real world right now.  We haven't been able to come back through. I'm throwing a lot of metaphors out there.  I think people are keeping up. So I get a little bit distraught and depressed and upset.  But then it helps for me to remember that it's actually a great opportunity for us in all this chaos,  because this is just officially the chaos era, to define what some of that new order might look like.  And can it distribute power more fairly than the last system?  We all have superpowers in the palm of our hands now. That's pretty cool.  That wasn't the case before. But we're also super vulnerable in ways that we weren't before because we didn't get our news from our uncles and our grandparents and our nephews and our cousins.  We got it from people who had some sense of training and narrow and undiverse as they were.  They had some basic shared set of rules that have been thrown out the window and we haven't rewritten new ones.  So I think that's to me, that's part of the bigger issue is that we just haven't redefined and redesigned the world as we'd like to live in it yet.  And we're suffering through the chaos and just being mad at being stuck in between both.

Transcript:  I think that's very insightful and exactly the right long view on this is we live, you know, the old Chinese curse, may you live in interesting times.  This is the disruption that we knew would happen. In fact, and this is where I feel bad.  I wanted it to happen because I looked at the Internet and thought this is the ultimate democratizing force. Everybody gets a voice.  And you realize democracy sucks.  Yeah, I didn't anticipate and I don't think any of us anticipated some of the downsides of everybody having a voice.  But that's fine because we will reinvent this and we just have to do it.  We just have to all be human and be respectful and loving of one another and do the best we can to make remake the world in a way that works for everybody.  I think it's possible.

I mean, unless we get to Star Trek time, there are good people, there are bad people.  And that's kind of where the cookie crumbles. You gave everybody a voice, of course, a third or a half or a quarter of those voices are going to be terrible voices.  And they have the right to have their voice and gamma rating and pontificate with themselves.  It's just when they spill off and attack others with their rhetoric, that's a problem.  But I mean, you are a butterfly unicorn happy man.  Because you'll be out here thinking about the world.  I believe.  Yeah, you do believe. I don't believe.  No, Owen, you're right.

Transcript:  We just had everyone to get to the OK.  Look, I'm going to just cut this short.  Yes, we're doing better.  The one thing I am very happy and thankful for about a Trump victory is that a lot of people that were doing misdeeds and empower positions of power were doing things to people without making their voice heard.  Now we have mayors talking about the First Lady being a monkey.  We have police officers on their Facebook talking about people in their district and in their community.  And they get fired.  So I thank Donald Trump so much for cutting the grass so we can see the snakes and we get rid of the snakes that are stupid enough to put their voice out there for the public.  That's the best thing about what's going on right now.  You want to try and destroy somebody else's livelihood and make someone downtrodden.  Go ahead and do it now because now we got to pitch.  We got your face.  We got your name.  You're going to lose your job and be sitting at home and have something really important to cry about.  That's the only thing that's going on good right now with people acting crazy.  I think there are lots of bad things going on.

Transcript:  No, I think that you're absolutely right.  We are we we are in the safest part of the world, time of the world that we have ever lived in.  If we talk about even all the world, this is the safest that we've ever been.  But the problem is, is with us, like the only thing that can really fight this, it's not it's not Facebook.  It's not the problem with fake news.  It's education.  If we need to have education and it needs to be free and it needs to be for everyone,  that is the only way that we will really battle this.  Because unfortunately, if you do not have the education to understand the economics of what we are dealing with in what would be fake news,  we are made if we see something enough, we believe it, whether it be true or not.  Your parents tell you that you are stupid.  You might be the most brilliant person on this planet, but you believe it.  You hear it enough.  You will start to believe it.  It's the way we're made to be mimics.  And so and that's one of the things that kept loudest to survive.  But it's also a really big issue because if we don't have any other facts to be able to refute that,  we're going to be falling into cognitive bias and then cognitive dissonance,  which means that we have a certain belief system.  We actually don't like to hear any other views that are opposed to whatever we already believe.  And that becomes an issue that we will.  We don't want the truth.  We want things that say that whatever I believe already is true because that makes us feel comfortable.  We end up feeling anxiety and disdain when other opposing views are going to conflict with us.  And that's very distressing for our system.  So we need to be able to get out there.  We need to talk about it.  But in the end, we need to give education to everyone.  And it's something that everyone should fight for behind.  And I think that everyone can stand behind that.  It's so very important.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo.  Here's a look at just a few of the stories that we'll be watching in the week ahead.  Now, this week is a short one since it's Thanksgiving here in the United States.  So the studio will be dark on Thursday and Friday.  So we can all spend some time thinking about what we're grateful for.  And speaking of Thanksgiving, the first episode of the nine part football VR series is set to launch on YouTube and the Google Daydream headset this week on Thanksgiving Day.  So gather your family and all your VR goggles to watch because nothing spells togetherness more than a family in their own virtual worlds.  But before that, Tuesday is the official launch of the OnePlus 3T.  The phone starts at four hundred and thirty nine dollars.  It has a faster processor, bigger battery, and there's a new one hundred and twenty eight gigabyte version.  This Wednesday is Fibonacci Day.  That's eleven twenty three or one one two three, which starts the Fibonacci sequence or each number in the series.  This is some of the two numbers behind it.  And I must say Fibonacci is my favorite sequence.  Wednesday is also the deadline for trading in your old MacBook to Microsoft for six hundred and fifty big ones off a new service book.  That's six hundred and fifty dollars.  Does that convince you to be a switcher?  And yes, of course, this week is Black Friday where you can do all your shopping with some crazy online sales.  But some of you might also choose to celebrate it as by nothing day.  And I personally think we should all celebrate it as update your parents browser day.  It doesn't have to be your parents either.  If you're spending this holiday with any family less technical than you are, remind them to update everything, especially all of their passwords.  And while you're at it, why not encourage them to turn on some two factor authentication?  We'll be covering these stories and a whole lot more this week on tech news today with Jason Howell.  It's every day at four p.m. Pacific right here on this channel.  You're watching back to you, Leo. Thank you, Megan.

Transcript:  This thing, this little thing, have you ever seen this?  This is the Eero E E R O.  Our show today brought to you by Eero.  And I have to say, when I'm at home, I have two networks so I can test stuff.  I have Comcast business and Comcast consumer, and I have two different router systems.  And every time I get home, every device in my pocket, every laptop, they all switch over to the Eero.  They go, oh, this is good. I like this.  I can't get them to use that other system.  That's because Eero really works.  It is a better Wi-Fi.  Of course, it does all the things right.  We talk about WPA2 encryption built in.  You don't have to hide it.  It looks great in your house.  The phone support is good.  In fact, I tested them.  I had, well, OK, I wasn't just testing them.  I was having I couldn't figure out what was going on with my port forwarding.  And they really did a great job.  They stuck with me till we figured it out and they solved it.  They're good.  The way you set up the Eero is also cool.  Now you can buy an individual Eero, but most of the time you're going to get three of them, the three pack.  And then you set up the first one.  You connect that to your cable modem or router and then use the app to place the other two to spread using a mesh network throughout your house.  If you have other Ethernet drops, you can actually connect the other Eero's to Ethernet as well.  It's smart enough to know exactly what to do.  It's not just repeaters.  This is a mesh network.  In fact, they just introduced something they're calling True Mesh and even better wireless mesh technology,  which makes the Eero network work even better within the house.  No matter how far away you are from the base unit, you're going to have the fastest networking possible.  Eero users will see if you already have an Eero, you get updated automatically up to two times the land speed between Eero's.  That means if you're in your network, you're going to get HD 4K quality in many cases, depending, of course, on your Internet service provider.  But that's going to be the bottleneck on your network.  I really love these Eero systems.  What is so important with any network router, and it's unfortunately not true of most, this has got to be updateable.  And Eero updates on average about every week.  In fact, you're going to automatically get the new Eero software, True Mesh, because it just updates all the time.  It's always looking at your network.  It's always optimizing for what you have, the devices.  It has some really nice features.  For instance, I can assign all the devices in the house to our teenager that he uses.  And then I can go to the Amazon Echo and say, pause Michael's Internet.  That is. Oh, and I love the howl.  Hey, the Internet's down.  Yes, it is, Michael.  Yes, it is.

It will give you an you can do this on the Alexa or the Echo.  I don't want to say the A word.  You can do this on the Amazon Echo.  You can ask the Echo to find your phone or any device that's on Wi-Fi in your house.  You can have it turn off your Eero LED if it's nighttime and you don't want any blinking in your bedroom.  Plus, like I said, you can pause.  You can put this is the greatest stuff ever.  No more.

In fact, a good article from Ben Thompson, who has been on this show many times and writes  great stuff, why we've got to save Twitter.  And it may not, maybe the best way to save Twitter is not to let it continue as a private  company run by these guys who don't really seem to be doing a good job as stewards of  Twitter.  But maybe there's some way, he says, why Twitter must be saved.  And let me see if I can find the money quote here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't read that, but I believe that with all my heart.  Yeah.  The word, like, people that complain about Twitter or think Twitter's not useful, when  Twitter's gone, you will feel it.  Like, you will feel it.  It is the communication of the world and speed and time.  And there are certain times, maybe their numbers aren't as big and maybe they're not growing  the way they're supposed to grow, but it is a necessity and a way of life, especially  for people in unserved markets and areas.  I don't know what we would do without Twitter.

Transcript:  Well, and the fake news problem is less of a problem on Twitter, not because there's  lots of fake news on Twitter, but people respond immediately.  So, there is this kind of, because it's kind of a live feed, this natural tendency to move  towards correct information.  But he quotes in this, Justice Louis Brandeis from the Supreme Court, the greatest menace  to freedom is in inert people.  Political discussion is a political duty and that this should be fundamental principle  of American government.  And that's where, according to Ben and I agree, the discussion is happening these days and  we need to have that conversation.  So, maybe somebody will say that.

Start time: 8130.00
End time: 8197.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what the problem with most social media is that it's not actually a discussion  among people that have different views.  You follow people that follow similar views to you.  We're usually inclined to like people better that have similar views to us.  We don't really want discourse with people of opposing views.  And Twitter is a huge microcosm of that, that most of the people that you send something  out that's slightly political, you'll notice your follower levels of people that believe  different things will actually drop off because they don't want to hear that.  And so, it's not really dealing with discourse.  It's a whole bunch of people banding together that are in the same in-group.  And so, we need to have more discourse of people with different views and we need to  learn that people that think different things than you are okay.  It's okay to believe different things.  That's how we grow.  We need to have, you know, differing parties or political stances to battle each other,  to keep each other in check.  And that's where the strength in a democracy really lies.  And we're starting to become more of in-group people.  And so, discussions on Twitter are usually with your own people and you're not really  bringing out the news of a differing view to many people.  Yeah.

Start time: 8198.44
End time: 8234.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In a positive light, there are, yes, echo chambers all around, all over the internet.  But there have been many a time where someone has said something to me and 140 characters,  I flipped their whole mindset around because I actually took the time and said something  to them directly.  So, yes, it does happen occasionally.  It needs to happen more.  But I'm very happy with the fact that a lot of times people say something to me.  Why would you say that?  And I say, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  And they're like, oh, I never thought of it that way.  And it does happen.  We need to have more of that happen with more people.  But I love getting out of my echo chamber.  I want to be in everybody's chamber.

Start time: 8235.04
End time: 8269.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's up to you.  And I think that that's the point is that Twitter gives you the option, if you want,  to hear from other people, to see other views.  And everybody should take that opportunity to broaden your Twitter feed, to find, you  know, find people with opposing viewpoints, not even necessarily to engage them, just  to see what the conversation is.  And so that's, to me, that's the real point.  Yes, you're right.  You could be in a filter bubble.  But Twitter and the Internet give you the tools to expand beyond that in a way we've  never had before, to hear as many voices as you're willing to hear.  And that's the opportunity.  And I think we need to take advantage of that opportunity.

Start time: 8270.06
End time: 8338.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why we're here.  Which is great.  But unfortunately, I think that one piece to Twitter, and I like Twitter.  I use Twitter.  It's one of the few social sets of social media that I actually use.  So I do like Twitter.  But the problem is, is that Twitter, like you end up getting the people that speak the  loudest and are the most polarizing, get the most followers from that and get retweeted  more often.  And if you actually want to change people's views, you need a moderate discussion.  Like what Owen, what you said is that you spoke to someone directly.  You came from the place where they were at, and you were able to make them think, you  know what, maybe I was wrong about what I was dealing with.  If you have someone that has a vastly opposing view, it doesn't actually help you change  your mind.  It actually usually reinforces your own belief of why that person is wrong.  And so we need to have also moderate discourse instead of having really angry, reactive  reactions.  And Twitter and much of social media reinforces and rewards people that are highly reactive  and really angry.  And that can actually cause people to be polarized against it.  So I think that we need to have moderate discussions about things of, you know, we're not so far  apart as we think that we are.  Yeah.

If you listen to this and you haven't had enough of politics and me talk about it, I did a podcast on Facebook politics and where I ramble and rant about stuff.  And then, like I said earlier, I did a podcast with a French guy, a German guy, a guy from South Africa.  What was that show?  I want to hear that.  It's the French spin.  It's on IQMZ.  In my Facebook politics post, I link to it so you can get to it.  But they talk about somebody changing your mind.  I totally have my.  This is Patrick Béja's show.  I know this show.

And I'm in the mentality of I'm tired of being everybody's big brother.  I'm tired of super duper socialism where we just give away all this money.  We got poor people in America.  And in their mind, all over the country, all over the world, they were like, look, bro, we need you.  Like we need that stuff that y'all are doing for us.  And they gave very rational points to it where it changed my mind.  I guess we can't stop being the world's big brother because we have a responsibility that I wish that we didn't have.  But we do.  So it's always great to get outside of yourself and listen to other people.  That's why I come on the show and learn something from Uncle Leo occasionally teach him stuff.
