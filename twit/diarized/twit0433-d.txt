Transcript:  that bridges generations game consoles no I mean you say that you say that  jokingly but if there ever was a game console that can bridge generations I  mean that's what Xbox one is banking on that you notice that to the chagrin of  gamers they didn't cater to the hardcore gaming audience at e3 they pissed them  off by saying we're gonna be the console that pretty much rules your living room  we're gonna let you watch TV talk to your friends via Skype do exercises with  Xbox one Xbox one fitness and while that seemed like a bad strategy at the  time in the bubble of hyper gamers now that the Xbox is coming out like the  press seems to be generally very positive on those features well yeah the

Start time: 393.72
End time: 412.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would say that the Xbox as it's coming out now is kind of a continuation of  what Gates's dream always was that he was gonna computerize your whole life  and that was the that was the means of doing it by taking over your

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft software but I remember that was the implication though wasn't it  wasn't when I first met Bill it was a Southern California computer club we're  meeting at Harvard School here in Studio City and he was about 18 at the time and  his major concern was that people were pirating his paper tape copies of  basic but even then he was talking about a computer in every home and in every  office and in every classroom yeah now that doesn't sound like much of a dream  now a day he got it in 1977 or thereabouts that was a really far out

End time: 517.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  vision of the world right and it was a before we envisioned a computer in every  pocket which of course is what we have today with the smartphone but clearly the  living room was always the battle remember Intel tried to conquer the  living room and I don't know how many CES is there Comdex is ago it's always  been the dream and Dell came out with living room computers everybody came out  with living room computers Google still is yet Microsoft and Sony in a sense  have done it through game consoles those are the living room computers that have  actually caught on and you're absolutely right that it's not just about gaming  it's about exercise about conversations about streaming video the dream is that  that becomes your set-top box and maybe you're only set-top box if if Microsoft

Start time: 524.40
End time: 568.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with it so I can only speculate but one of the things I really did like about  the things I've seen so far is the potential ubiquity of their method of  handling Skype because there's such a high resolution camera on the Xbox one  it has the ability to use software zoom yeah on different individuals in the  room and it recognizes the essentially the skeleton of each individual and if  there's two people it's like all right let me frame this so that both the people  the person in the foreground and in the background are in there and I was  thinking about it and you probably know more about this than me Leo like  traditionally for a telepresence setup for something for real-time  conversations with one group of people in Tokyo and another group of people in  New York you're looking at $500 plus for one of those setups back in the day

Start time: 568.92
End time: 582.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right oh yeah tens of thousands of dollars on some in-room conferencing  system so Skype is a big breakthrough and I think you're right I think this  could actually be used in business for $500 as an in-room concept a conferencing

Start time: 582.88
End time: 610.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  system it's very good quality certainly can right now but shortly you will I  mean in the setup we have here is obviously beyond what Xbox can do to  have four different people on four different lines right but I would not  think that many years away that it will just be a part of what you've got and it  will be built in and everybody can have a multi-line conference if that's what

Start time: 610.88
End time: 619.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they want yeah you could do Google Hangout on on on Xbox if they if Google  wanted to support that and you could have up to ten people having a

Start time: 619.46
End time: 690.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  conversation like this I have to I'm very impressed overall by the Xbox one  it's better than I thought when I played with both now and it's pretty clear to  me that the PlayStation 4 is really a game machine it wasn't merely the e3  demos they this really was what happened is that Sony said we're going for the  game and we're gonna make the best possible game machine and as gamers  pointed out quickly the specs are somewhat better on the Sony PlayStation  for the Xbox one Microsoft kind of to people's surprise at least in its  original announcement focused on what you could do with media and you can talk  to it it's almost what I thought the Apple TV might be where I can get walk  into the room I can say Xbox turn on it's always listening it turns on it  also turns on my AV receiver my cat my cable box it doesn't recognize my TV but  in most TVs it would also turn on the TV it then the Kinect camera sees you  recognizes you and logs you in you're gonna have up to six people with  accounts the camera recognition is quite good and it's a little eerie to see a  picture of me with my name in a bubble floating over my head so tell me this

Start time: 690.52
End time: 714.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo like one of the things that intrigues me and I haven't been hands-on  with this but I am shocked at how many things over the last year or two I have  started to ask Siri to do on my iPhone rather than open myself yeah even though  like for example call my wife just because it takes less time than opening  finding and that kind of thing do you find yourself immediately using the  voice interface on the Xbox to find things like Netflix or any of the other

Start time: 714.92
End time: 751.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a lot like Siri in the sense that it's seems like a great thing and then  in practice it's not of course my Kinect is sitting on my center channel speaker  so it's there's a lot of other stuff going on but you can in theory say Xbox  watch HBO it knows where HBO is on my system and changes the channel to it  that actually works you could say Xbox pause and it will pause what I'm  watching Xbox rewind Xbox play those things do work yeah and and it always  listening makes a big is a big difference to what Siri does and what  the Xbox does I've got the button or do anything it just it's like okay Google

Start time: 751.12
End time: 787.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  now on the yeah I've got the Google Nexus 5 I mean I can't see too well which is  running KitKat and I find myself using it all the time I mean I'm surprised at  how often I tell the phone what I want to do rather than type it in especially  I'm driving of course when you really are not supposed to be touching it but  even even at home or walking around I I'm finding voice commands to really when  they work and when you can depend on them if you kind of can on the on the on  KitKat in this phone they're enormously helpful when they don't work like with  Siri on my iPhone it works maybe 70% of the time if I'm lucky and that's not  enough it seems to just enough failure rate to get me not to want to do yeah

Start time: 788.24
End time: 813.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  who wants to say my experience with Siri it works just enough to make it  intriguing but it really isn't something you can rely on yeah yeah I think that's  this step you will understand I think that if if jobs had not got sick and  what been dying for the last two years of his life I think you might see

Start time: 814.02
End time: 830.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something like Xbox on Apple now yeah I know I agree with you although didn't  Apple try I don't remember if it was under Steve I think it wasn't the Pippen  remember they had a game they had a wedge into the living room that did not  take off it wasn't anything that jobs allowed well only his return basically

Start time: 835.94
End time: 841.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but I think that had he lived he would be into that now oh I think that's what

Start time: 841.68
End time: 845.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he was alluding to I think the Apple TV never never fulfilled its promise all

Start time: 849.28
End time: 861.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right maybe it will someday but it isn't even close I actually like the Roku which  is you can buy them for 50 bucks to start with better than I like the Apple  TV I think they've actually nailed it you know the Xbox one does much of what

Start time: 861.74
End time: 890.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Roku does it does everything I needed to do which is Netflix Amazon it  does YouTube which the Roku does not do and it does it does unfortunately Xbox  music not Pandora or any of the other music players but in all of that is  voice-commanded which I think is an always on voice command so if you're in  the living room and you're talking to your TV it seems to work pretty well I  think this is a very interesting first attempt it's not clearly not done

Start time: 891.14
End time: 919.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo I got a question for you yeah so so Leo have you had the chance to try out  any of the Xbox live fitness programs because if you have an Xbox live gold  account which of course you have to pay for you have there's P90X there's  insanity there's the Jillian what's-her-name thing there's there's all  of these that that that essentially grade you on your ability to follow along  with the video and post your results but more importantly they're able to to  basically watch the skin tone of your body and amazing I haven't tried those

Start time: 919.76
End time: 923.24

Start time: 943.46
End time: 983.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they have connect rivals which is a sports program and there's a beta of  that and the thing I do like and so I've done a limited amount of it but the  thing I do like is the old connect on the Xbox 360 I had to move furniture  because you have to get far back from it and or it wouldn't work this one you it  seems like you stand right in front of the TV and I was at her angle is much  more much better and that boy the picture I had to run it put on pants the  picture is so clear I didn't expect that you're laughing that is but an issue  that some raises a privacy issue here I have in my living room a camera that's  apparently always on in a microphone that's always on should I be concerned

Start time: 984.20
End time: 990.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and and the mental picture you have just generated in I did that for the NSA

Start time: 992.48
End time: 1020.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  let's move along the next step here is really to find all these these  functions inside the TV you mentioned the Apple TV we are still to see what  the last big thing that Steve Jobs worked on is gonna turn out to be which  is an actual TV I had someone on a podcast we do here an ex-vp at Apple the  head of Apple or Apple Europe saying yeah he didn't say yeah it's coming out  but he said yeah that we really to wait the problem I have with that Cedric is

Start time: 1021.24
End time: 1037.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that TVs are expensive so you spend two grand for a TV which is what you pay  for a nice big screen two years from now whatever that technology is it's built  into any of these smart TVs is gonna be old isn't it better to just spend a  hundred bucks every couple years to buy a new set-top box rather than having to

Start time: 1037.18
End time: 1076.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  buy a brand new screen except except that and Steve said that it sucks to be  if you're a device it sucks to be HDMI one you want to be there when you turn  the TV on you want to be the main interface you want to be what sits  between the user and all the experiences and that's what none of these guys are  really I mean it's I wish Samsung would come out maybe next year yes with better  voice recognition and and you know they actually tell you what you need to watch  based based on what you've already watched this needs to get way better or  it will leave some place for at the apples and Microsoft's and Google's to

Start time: 1076.50
End time: 1097.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to actually come up with something it has to be upgradable you can't you know  I don't know how often you guys replace your TV sets but in my case you know I  still got a 20 year old Sony Trinitron in my in one of my rooms but I don't  replace my TV every couple years the way I replace almost every other piece of  technology that I use so I know Samsung TV that has a breakout box all the

Start time: 1097.44
End time: 1125.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  electronics are in the separate box that would you are this TV also has a Skype  camera Skype is built into it and has a lot of smart software built into it but  and in fact even the remote control has a microphone and it takes voice commands  I don't find it anywhere near as sophisticated and I think companies like  Samsung and Panasonic Vizio LG sharp all of these companies are not as good at  software as they are hardware whereas Microsoft is a software company I think  and Apple is a software company and these guys are I think you're doing a

Start time: 1125.38
End time: 1172.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  better job frankly this is the whole problem with building stuff into TVs you  know one thing that you know the the iPod got smaller and smaller from the  you know from the mini to the Nano to essentially invisible when it became  part of your phone but I don't feel like the same thing's gonna happen with  televisions with with with mobile phones we replace that every year or two with  televisions there's usually a seven-year replacement cycle on there so  if you're gonna tie yourself to a software platform and a hardware  platform of eat whether it be Roku or boxy or any of these things built into a  display I think it's a fool's errand consumers only want one thing and that's  for their monitors to explain to display exquisitely awesome content and that's  it everything else should be external from the display I agree so how often do

Start time: 1191.16
End time: 1217.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bought in anything three years ago I agree but it's but it's still fundamentally  a PC with a hard drive with firmware with a CPU with an optical drive and in  fact when you want to play a blu-ray disc it has a blu-ray disc thank God  when you want to play it you have to download the blu-ray player and install  it just like a very much feels like a PC and so you are getting upgrades but  software upgrades all the time I'm sure well and keep the original Xbox and go

Start time: 1224.48
End time: 1280.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  just going to point out that the the Xbox especially the Xbox 360 we saw a  number of revisions as over time we saw the Xbox live interface change to  something closely resembling the formerly known as Metro interface we saw  the hardware get better with the Xbox slim and the black Xbox in many ways the  Xbox one is not a revolution but it but an iterative evolution of this unit and  the fact that that the Xbox one defines the new platform moving forward I  guarantee you in three years we're gonna see a slimmer interface a slimmer  design for the whole thing we're gonna see software upgrades to the way you  interact with it it will be very PC like and that everything will be iterative  and that if there's a complaint you have about the new Xbox one it's that it's  not a revolution to which I say good that means Microsoft understands that  evolution is the answer not revolution go ahead always have yeah that that that

Start time: 1280.74
End time: 1312.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is both the the pain and the glory of Microsoft the thing that they've been  criticized for the most is not being revolutionary right and at the same time  over time they have been revolutionary do you remember when Gates finally  decided that the internet was important and launched the Internet Explorer had  that conference up in San Francisco 95 94 something yeah somewhere in there and  he said you know well one thing about it is the price is right free you there I

Transcript:  that's what I said in the first bite column that I did immediately after  after Bill's yeah it was clear once he turned his attention on it he was going  to influence the internet in ways that nobody else ever had but he was still  alive and and and dreaming his company then he's lost interest in that now my  question earlier was how rapidly will the soft will the hardware make itself  obsolete Moore's law is continuing and when you double when you're already at  50 X and you double to 100 X and then you double at 200 X at what point can  you just finally say that's good enough I don't ever need to upgrade the

Start time: 1387.46
End time: 1434.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  hardware anymore I think I think we've already seen that which is the answer is  keep in mind that when you go to the movie theater and you see a movie  that's allegedly you know on a 4k projector odds are it's in 2k which is  slightly more than 1080p we don't notice that that's the same display that we  have in our home computers or in our in our home box office or whatever on our  televisions and what we're seeing is that increase in processor power is  being used in ancillary ways that I think are fantastic for the home  consumer the fact that we have the ability to casually mention hey Xbox  I don't know where it is just find it and they can do it that's where that  extra processor power is going but you're absolutely right when in as far as  they're diminishing returns in the visual fidelity of the video games that  we're seeing now I wasn't well this is 4k ready everything's 4k ready right no I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  who's in the top of her classes and is obviously headed for you know university education what would you get her when she was that well I would I would find out what they're using at school and what are peer views I mean the advantage of the iPad isn't that it's a better device but it's got a bigger ecosystem and it's heavily supported by a lot of schools but actually I think that the RT is not a bad device if the if the if you can get a keyboard and there will be a keyboard for the Nokia one office on it

Start time: 2427.34
End time: 2457.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  again is the ecosystem ready for what she wants to do you know if you want if you're in middle school and you need to write reports and surf the internet stuff that seems like a good choice you can add a keyboard to an iPad but it's never really a natural fit yeah doesn't fit except for Harry McCracken you know time magazine he writes all of his stories and Mike Elgin too they'll show up with their laptop which is an iPad with a keyboard and that's like yeah just show you know there's enough power enough enough flexibility and in these devices that they can do other things

Transcript:  there's value to the name I mean I'll tell you why because I a decade after it ceased to be relevant continue to use it as my primary media it's a great program it's felt it's small it's it's highly customizable as a matter of fact you know my stage show I get on stage and I I used to have a freaking CD with tracks that I would have the sound guy play audio cues at various times and they would screw up so often that I eventually went and decided to design my own system where I could run sound for my  stage magic show while I was performing it and I grabbed two keyless entry systems to cars I spliced some leads to old keyboard buttons attach them to the back of my shoes and I used a plug in for win amp that allowed me to hit play pause fade in advance queue up everything so to this very day here we are 2013 I still use win amp as my primary method to run all the video and sound during my stage show there's like 47 sound and visual cues throughout the whole show but  because it was so customizable this program this plug-in was written by some guy in Russia but and I got it 10 years ago send him 50 bucks and continue to use it to this very day so I was really sad to see it shut down but if they could keep that spirit of openness alive and just you know new boss same as the old boss that'd be fine by me I'd be thrilled win amp was created in 1996 you remember by a guy named Justin Frankel it was just him although in the first year they had 15 million downloads

End time: 2658.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in 1996 that's a lot they named Justin named his company nullsoft in a parody of Microsoft so it'll be very ironic if Microsoft picks up win amp and nullsoft according to an article on crave written by Bonnie Burton who used to work at nullsoft the the slogan win amp it really whips the llama's butt is a line inspired by the schizophrenic singer songwriter Wesley Willis so it's not supposed to make sense you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  zediva was uh the problem that shut down zediva is that they actually had the hardware but they  were definitely retransmitting without authorization whereas uh the ario is in a very  different position because what they're doing is renting specific antennas there's never more than  one antenna being used by one individual at a time and and there and we've already seen precedent  established by our friends over at slingbox where it's like you are allowed to access your own antenna  over the i over the internet and so the different area is in a little bit different place you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
