Start time: 456.08
End time: 470.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all up in the air based on the the percentage of bots  that are the fake accounts that are on Twitter of which  It doesn't appear. There's any third party. That's verifying these it just seems. Oh there. There is absolutely

Start time: 471.98
End time: 503.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no there are third parties that are verifying it  There's been a couple of academics that and there's a there's an independent group that to be fair like built some type of tool  It's not Bob or not  I forgot who it was but that there are groups that are pulling as much data as they can by doing  Samples and to be fair, you know, it's hard to get a huge sample size  But I mean, I think we all know even anna like I even know anecdotally like there's a tremendous amount of thought activity  And there always has I think it's way over 20% though. That's the thing

Start time: 504.12
End time: 509.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  None of none of it matters. He's trying to use this as a wedge to get out of the deal  And why did he try to get maybe he's I don't know maybe  The number of the number of bots  Thwarting his investment is sort of a red herring, right?

Start time: 526.76
End time: 531.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think just what we really wants to get out of it that that's really what's going on is he's I think what what?

Start time: 532.04
End time: 572.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happened is that he bought up a bunch of shares  He got invited to be on the board realized that he had a fiduciary responsibility  As a board of directors member and he couldn't go around trash-talking the CEO or others or the edit buttoners pick pick  Whatever you want free speech  Then left because Elon doesn't want people telling him what to do and I now think he just you know  He's got that had that had repercussions. It had repercussions on the other businesses  Where his finances are tied up? So why tank Tesla?  over a social media which a lot of us use but let's face it has a limited number of DAUs and like

Start time: 573.14
End time: 585.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it was never a ton of money  It's never made more than a billion dollars in a year if you pay 44 billion dollars for something that's a beta is  Less than a billion. It's gonna take you a long time

Start time: 587.34
End time: 594.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there I'm sorry is there any history of any company being purchased at that level of multiple of yearly revenue? Oh, yeah

Start time: 594.58
End time: 659.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so. That's 44 X that seems I mean, I don't think it's that I don't know if anyone's purchased anything at that  And then I've heard people say oh now that it's off  Watch while Microsoft swoops in no Microsoft doesn't want Twitter. No one wants Twitter  That's the whole point Twitter's been trying to sell itself for years  And not succeeded  So I don't know if Elon legitimately wanted it. I think he did  I think he found out that when he would get down to it  He was gonna have to come up with 21 billion of his own money  He ever he leveraged himself against Tesla stock that opens him up as the stock drops which it has it's plummeted as a result  To to to a margin call which could put him out of business. It also  It's also hard to get the rest of it  Although he seems to have found Larry Ellison gave him a billion seems to found a few other suckers  I mean investors who are willing to give him money for something that is never gonna pay off  So he's got a little bit negotiation tactic  It could it probably is, you know an attempt to get because the stock went down because of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know showing how much it's going down because of his suspicions of the high percentage of fake accounts  Then he could say well, it doesn't really have X million of users. It has this percentage of users

Start time: 682.34
End time: 697.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So doesn't matter here's I'm lowering but it doesn't matter as he well knows because he made the deal in fact  Waving due diligence. You don't get to say I don't do due diligence.

Transcript:  This is William Cohen who is a M&A guy writing for puck news, I like puck news a lot Elon's next moves  He says Elon played it like a Jedi up to a point  Listening to his financial advisors Sachs Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase Allen and company  his advisor Rob Kindler  Who was Cohen's old boss so Cohen knows him well at Morgan Stanley now vice chairman  global head of the M&A group  Followed all their instructions up to a point  But after this is what Cohen writes after make after he won his prize what seemed with what seemed like a minimum effort  Elon started to lose his deal making poise  He neglected to tell the SEC  He he  He basically started, you know trolling at Twitter violating his nondisclosure  And and he points out Elon's equity hole is still 14 billion dollars even with a billion from  Ellison and Prince Allah weed who put in 1.9 billion  And of course the 4 billion in shares that he's already got that he doesn't have to buy again  He still has to come up with 14 billion dollars. It could just be that Elon  Just kind of lost his head and  Now is trying to get out of it Twitter's response is yeah. No, we're holding you. They told the shareholders  Let's go  That that's a good price. We're gonna take it. Elon says he can't move forward. He already he already agreed says Twitter  They're gonna make him

Start time: 813.64
End time: 837.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know Twitter doesn't have to make money because Twitter makes power if you stop and think about the  The sort of Venn diagram of who's using Twitter obviously looks there are many many bots  But it's media people like I'm a Twitter og and you know a lot  so it has an outside importance in the in the  in the media community community, right and and tech community and

Transcript:  Would you grant that it is the public square I don't think it's the public square

Start time: 843.58
End time: 872.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I but here's the question that I would be raising which is think of the amount of influence  He's wielded in the past over the market  I mean he made a crypto that nobody cared about become a thing right for some people  Right. So another way to look at this is that Twitter doesn't have to make money  It just has to continue to make waves and if you continue to get the right nexus of powerful people  In that space talking do you think Larry Ellis never has to earn revenue is putting in a billion dollars Prince

Start time: 872.70
End time: 878.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Allah we'd putting in 1.9 billion not because they expect return on their investment, but because they expect power they expect access

Start time: 878.90
End time: 885.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I that's no other scenario makes sense to me. There is a risk though because if

Start time: 892.48
End time: 903.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not they don't have to tweet right the point is if you so this is a  Sort of deep state stuff if you want politics political decisions policy to go a certain way

Start time: 903.74
End time: 914.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't speak out loud. You have others speak for you. You you want to be able to have  influence control and so they're control the Overton window as it were

Start time: 914.89
End time: 927.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right  And there could be an argument made at the moment that that's the real net benefit here that that this is not at all  Monetizing that's pretty ugly. Whatever else it's kind of dark. It's a dark point. It's well, that's my well, that's my thing

Start time: 927.60
End time: 965.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to say you make a very good point in that  you know think about just all of media on the internet how hyper decentralized and  Splintered it's become yes and  Bizarrely Twitter is the only or the largest megaphone I think left in all media  I mean, I don't even think you know, like network television doesn't even have the megaphone power that Twitter has and so  Amy you make a really really good point here  I mean, it's the last bastion of literally world power that that could be left and I mean you could actually buy it

Start time: 966.92
End time: 1023.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there are other places where people have sort of scurried off to discord keybase  Although I think I might literally be the only person  That I know on key base at this point, I know I  There are other spaces but the point is there's there is still some something to be said for  having a fairly high profile and you  You know tweeting a poop emoji at us at a CEO there is some power because it's being done in front of other people and  You know journalists  You know and a billion years ago that was my my first career  You know, they're they're looking at reddit  They're looking at at Twitter to start developing stories  and so there there is this sort of network right that goes between broadcast media, especially and  Twitter and really high profile powerful people like Elon on Twitter. I like your take

Start time: 1023.14
End time: 1049.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes it's the only thing it makes a lot of sense Cohen writes  My view is the Elons antics in the last week or so have made him into a fool  Who's grabbing defeat from the jaws of victory?  But in fact  He is playing 4d chess  If he can get the price he's gonna buy Twitter in other words you think he's gonna buy Twitter  He's trying to get the price down  He may end up buying it for 50 for 20 because he doesn't have any choice  But it's worth it is your point, right?

Start time: 1049.40
End time: 1076.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other point is now that we've got a financial like an honest conversation happening about financials  What other investor is gonna swoop in? Yeah, right and and I mean Twitter has been for sale  Value to begin with yeah, right nobody's gonna buy so he could force he could force the price down  Change some of the rules and then there would be a net benefit to getting  especially a lot of politicians back and getting them to talk openly because it's an

End time: 1139.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  both rate industries heavily  subsidized by the federal government  For Ilan in those businesses  Having control of the levers of power and federal government are vital to both those businesses  Yeah, so he doesn't need to make money on Twitter. He just needs the power Twitter confers. I think I mean, right

Start time: 1140.38
End time: 1161.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only that's the only that's the only part of this that makes any sense to me whatsoever that or he is  You know, he he has a mental health issue that would cause him to make I mean we're always asking that question  Delicately because you know, listen, it's

No, but it's it's well

Transcript:  But but just think about it power is can be  purchased up to a point but Amy made a great point there that  Twitter's got a level of power that there's no other  Mechanism that has that level and the thing that's also we've seen in the media happening  This is what all always fascinates me  it's just think of the sheer number of news stories that are about a  Twitter feud or somebody said this on Twitter  I'm astonished by just the sheer number of news stories that are just commenting totally

Penny stamps two cents stamps so I can still use the picture with my head on it. That's the problem  Right the postage changes  Stamps comm solves this what is stamps that comm bus just the easiest way  To if you're a business to do mailings  All the services of the post office without going to the post office  So with your computer and your printer, you don't even need a postage meter  You can print real US postage for packages for envelopes for anything  You would want to mail discounts you won't get at the post office and now  And if you if you've been hearing these ads and saying well someday this should put you over the top now  It's ups as well as USPS  so you get the postal service and  ups and  Discounts you can't get anywhere else and stamps comm will even do the great thing  Stamps comm you'll you say okay? I want to print this package  It'll say you know it'd be cheaper to ship the ups or it'd be cheaper to suppose. It'll actually  Pit them one against the other to get you the best rate  Discounts like crazy up to 30% off postal service rates 86% off ups  That's going to save you every single time you mail a package  More than 1 million businesses use stamps comm  Because it's easy. It's fast. It'll save you on shipping  It'll save your time and it also looks more professional whether you're on Amazon or Etsy or  Or or eBay or your full-blown warehouse shipping out truckloads of orders those are the best  Packages look more professional  That you can print right on the envelopes with your company logo the return address  It's just a great mailing and now shipping solution for you  And it'll tip by the way save you time too because it'll take all the information from those websites  Automatically you fill out forms that you need whether it's  international shipping forms or  Or you know certified mail all that stuff just fills it out automatically and by the way easy  You'll be up and running in minutes  You can do it before the show's over printing official US postage for any letter any package anywhere you want to send  They've been a partner of this show since 2012 if you haven't signed up yet  You I don't know what you're waiting for do it right now  So start mailing and shipping now with stamps comm keep more money in your pocket every day go to stamps comm  click the link that says hurt us on a podcast and  Enter the offer code TW IT  Wow what a deal you're gonna get not only a four-week trial  You're gonna get a ton of free postage you can use over a period of time a digital scale  Stamps comm no long-term commitments no contracts  Just a chance to try it go to stamps comm click the microphone at the top of the page enter twit and  And enter a new world of mailing and shipping stamps  comm I  Think Mike Masnick's headline on tech dirt comm kind of says it all New York launches ridiculous blatantly  unconstitutional invest quote investigations end quote into twitch and discord  semicolon defecting deflecting blame from New York's own failings  We know that the shooter I'm not gonna by the way say his name not gonna give many publicity, but we know that  He opened a discord chat room before the shooting  Anybody can do that. It's free. We have a discord room  It's couldn't be simpler set up invited people in to discuss his plans  The police say it was as many as 15 people in there before he did anything those people knew what he was about to do  He then started up a twitch stream which only ran for a couple of minutes as he launched into his attack  Twitch pulled it down right away  I think I saw 40 people saw it on twitch but since then 40 million people have seen it as it's been passed around  David is is twitch or discord to blame for any of this

Transcript:  Scholar or lawyer. I made a last-minute decision not to go to law school. So I'm I'm with those caveats being said  I did pretty well in the all set  But with those caveats being said the First Amendment was written in 1791  And the point of it in 1791 was to was to require Congress  to restrict speech and  To restrict the press in promotion of the public good  So what's happened in the in the to prevent in the to require Congress to prevent Congress and  It requires con basically Congress shall make no law respecting

It's very simple. It says Congress shall make no law by the way  It says Congress shall make no law by the way  We should point out that almost immediately after this the Sedition Acts were passed which did exactly that and was used to prosecute people like crazy  So the history of enforcement of the First Amendment is not is very checkered to say the least

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but the again, I think the original intent of the founders. I wasn't there  So I don't have quantitative data on this but it's my interpretation that the founders originally were just  Trying to make it so that the public good was what was preserved and at the time  So again, this is like the seven this is 1700 1791  It was very expensive to create speech in written form right and hand it out. So like, you know eight  Functioning newspapers were sort of just getting started  And it was very very expensive. So free speech was meant to be not restricted in certain cases  But at that period of time when this was invented  There was no completely unfettered speech and certainly there were no algorithms. I would ask the question  Does a strict interpretation of the First Amendment which is it becomes one of these like super polarizing things?  there's just no room for nuance, I would ask in an age of algorithmic determinism and  On risk, you know completely unfettered speech that's also unedited and  Can be taken out of context, you know, does does our strict interpretation of free speech make sense?  And I don't think I I know that I'm in a minority here, but I actually don't think that it is does  I'm not saying we go the direction of China. So let's say we go down that direction

Transcript:  Amy, let's say we go down the direction then becomes the issue of who then decides who is the grand decision?  Who is the grand decider and that becomes a big issue in itself  I should mention that we have more updated laws since the First Amendment and I was feeling that  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act actually protects, you know  Or you know groups like discord and twitch which essentially and I'm quoting here  No provider user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publishers publisher or speaker of an in any information  Provided by another information content provider  So essentially they're not and we've dealt and this has come up many times and this is just for any like hate speech or pornography  Or anything else that appears on some type of service that they are protected  For liability because someone else published something.

This is and I disagree wholeheartedly  Because without section 230 there is no moderation  In fact Mike masochistic detector points out twitch might have been by the New Texas  Social media law  prevented by that law from pulling down  The the stream they would have to justify it and then could be sued over it by the New Texas

I was at  Journalism is at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism  So great great school if you want to be a journalist and pay a lot of money for the privilege of having a degree  I'm in the first ethics class and I had just moved back to the United States from Japan  And it was like I had traveled back in time from the future  Because of the technology that we had here and it was you know, not comparable in any way  So we spent an hour and a half looking at the Newsweek and Time magazine covers of OJ Simpson  some of you will remember that  It was Time magazine that ran the I think it was time that ran the unedited version  One of the magazines ran an unedited photo his mugshot. I remember the other one darkened it  Okay, so this is everybody's favorite it was first day of ethics class and the question that we were being asked was should  journalists be allowed to use  Digital cameras and digital editing software was that was that the right thing to do? Here's the Time magazine cover

Which I realize doesn't exist yet in the United States, but this phone in the year 2000  I've got a camera in this phone pretty soon  literally everybody is going to be taking pictures with their phones and we will be able to send things fast and  The question should journalists be allowed to do this is the wrong question  To me that is and I and I like nobody wanted to have that nobody wanted it

Transcript:  My point is we are hat we're asking the wrong questions. It's not should section 230 be scrapped or rewritten. It's not  you know it we have to be we have to approach these conversations with better questions and more nuance and  David I don't have an answer to who gets to be the arbiter of what the news rules look like  What I'm actually in favor of is in this particular case an incremental approach that that as technology chains  Changes we should not be playing catch-up  We should rather be creating policy and laws that are able to keep pace with the changes that actually makes that's a very reasonable

Transcript:  I'll just complete is what happens is  organizations trying to protect their own brand  Develop their own sort of rules and regulations of what can and cannot be on the platform  And the hope is they can do that look twitch, you know  If someone's doing something horrific on their platform, there's only a certain amount of speed that you can a catch it and stop it  The number of people who are monitoring it is an infinite. So some stuff slips through for a period of time and  Fortunately, you know twitch was able to take this down more. My concern is we need to  Educate the populace of when you see scary dialogue going online  You know, we don't want to get into a  Into a state where we're reporting on our neighbors  But there has to be a state of if someone's going to yell fire in a movie theater  We need to report that you know, there does there is a very clear line at that point

Start time: 2311.32
End time: 2324.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but so again just to untangle a few things. First of all from a technology point of view  There's absolutely a way to solve this problem. China is doing it every day through brute force and  Really smart machine learning but you did say you don't want it

Start time: 2325.10

Start time: 2330.44
End time: 2447.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I don't I don't think that's the right way  But here's the issue the challenge that we face in this country with just about everything is that there's a there's a monetary incentive  Tied to everything huge reason there is a reason that between  Whatever 2010 2011 2014  Over and over I was at Twitter talking about  Some of these issues and the problem is that if you make the bad parts of Twitter go away  You know, that's partially what drives people to have those, you know, that's what partially drives people there  So so part of the challenge is that we've got the wrong  Incentive structure to try to compel these companies to fix things. There are parallels in artificial intelligence. We know that there are all kinds of  Huge transformer models that are that are very great but that have been trained on data or bad data  Sorry, so like we we know that these problems exist, but there's no  Incentive to fix any of it. In fact, there's a it's it's it's going to be met with a penalty  There's a financial disincentive to fix these things  So what I would like to see is totally different legislation that doesn't focus on how are we going to define  This particular act being shown on video at this particular moment in time, right because that's all it's a moving target  It's always going to change is there a way that we can compel the platforms to promote to to to attack  What they know is bad stuff head-on  Through incentives that are tied to revenue. I think that's it's the only because nobody's going to come to the table and do this  Voluntarily, it's falling apart. The supreme court at facebook is falling apart  Supreme court at facebook is falling apart  We've got our own government agency where where a misinformation disinformation board didn't work for  You know reasons that are tied to disinformation itself, which is tied to to how the platforms make money, but but amy

Transcript:  Don't you think if  If there could be financial incentives attached to this  Don't you think we would have seen this by now because I mean I like conceptually what you're saying  But I don't understand even I can't even grok how the heck that would happen

Start time: 2463.70
End time: 2510.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so  again  We just haven't done it before so um, there's there's a carrot and stick model that can be accomplished through  All kinds of things that are going to be wildly unpopular  But we know work right tax incentives  Um  There are lots of ways to achieve this if companies can commit to  measure and enforce  Making sure that content is in the the sort of  It's being generated for the public good and I know that this immediately the easier thing to argue about and have a conversation about is censorship  The harder thing to do is to just to solution it right to get to a solution that involves a different type of incentive structure

Transcript:  Is it is it going to come from government? Is that where it's going to come from?  You know, it's not going to come from the companies because they're they're I don't think so  The companies are going to fight that and they're going to have right. You've really raised a larger issue though  Larry lesig the great larry lesig who was for a long time as a  Advocate a strong advocate for eliminating copy protection and and and changing copyright law  Finally gave up and realized I can't do this  Because of the perverse financial incentives  And the money in congress he said we can't do anything until we get money out of politics and became and that became his  Cause by the way, he's still working on that  But I don't think we still work on that. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna ever happen  So I understand if you could say well if there were no perverse financial incentives, we might be able to come up with a framework  But that's like saying, you know if the moon were made of cotton candy we could all live on mars

We're not even going now  And I feel like I know a lot of the people who listen to the show are the ones who have those great ideas  And sometimes you bring those ideas up at work and or you're afraid to because you don't want to be ostracized and like  Because it's different different equals, uh bad right different should equal  Curiosity, let's exercise our curiosity and see where we get and at the end we get to the bad place fine  We're going to be in no worse situation than we are today.

That's kind of more of what you were talking about. This is let's let's let's refine this  But don't you think it what is there any country in the world that is doing something that you think is a good?  Direction I understand nothing's perfect, but a good direction that we should be looking at  Is the chinese this new chinese rule is very interesting. Is it a good rule?

I mean for god's sake  That there are people who are worried at this point about using vpns to talk about the absolutist  Covid policies zero tolerance throughout the country, you know  Even people who live outside of china who use weibo and some of the other social networks  Who clearly have a different ip they're being targeted?  by  People they're not bots. They're actual people. Um, they're being targeted and and attacked with propaganda and  Being ousted as foreign spies or people trying to take down the ccp. So no, I don't think that model is good  um  you know, I see scandinavia and I know that I bring it up a lot and I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but  You know, we don't see a lot of the ex the serious extremes  um  there  there are problems but  Norway sweden finland, you know, it's just you don't see a lot of

And at the same time they want absolute free speech everybody else should be there is yeah  There is a tension. There's also no acknowledgement  That we are all constantly being surveilled all of the time  By the same exact platforms  that so  so  in a cloaked way, you know, there there's just huge piles of data and and all of these companies are  Using the data for the purpose of making more money right for advertising  That somehow isn't defined as speech  um  But people seem that there's a paradox between  Again, like what we what we get so upset about it  I wish there was a way to have a conversation that it did not immediately devolve to  Well, who's going to decide this is censorship?  Centrorship, you know china  um  It's important that we have these conversations and I really hope everybody listening  Will be willing to engage in a more nuanced version of that conversation because a lot of you are the people who are going to help  Build this other future.

Transcript:  Mm-hmm, right. I mean that's what it  But there's two different ways also to do about this and this goes into what you were talking about with regards to privacy  And uh, I want to give some credit to uh, davy ottenheimer of interrupt. That's uh,  Tim berners-leeve, that's t.b.t.l's thing. Yeah. Yes his company and davy works for me and I literally just before this  Show I I talked with him in and and this goes to another story that's that's on our list about the  About the fact that the these tools that we use  Are sharing our information, you know hundreds of times more so in the u.s than even in the uk  Yeah for that matter and  We don't get to decide that they're deciding for us  There's so many decisions that are being made for us about our own information, which is  Kind of tragic now, this is interrupts whole charge is to reverse set where you control  your own information as to who it goes to and  and so it  So, you know where it's being gone where it's going and it's being used and actually  And I thought quite the opposite but what davy said is advertisers really really love this kind of concept where  Well, we know people truly like this because they  Individually proved they wanted it and that shows that you know  Their their money that they're spending on advertising and I know i'm sort of directing this slightly differently is actually being used  appropriately, so  If we get to a point where people are  Self-directed can take ownership of their information and it's not used  unknowingly by them then  That is a good direction to go now per what you were saying amy as to  Somebody or having a conversation of how we're going to find the defining line of what can and can't be said  And how much it can be said and on what platforms?  We've already been having this conversation. I don't think this is the first time it's been brought up  Um, I feel like it's authoritarianism

Transcript:  Regardless of what it is. But anything that would anything that would say you can't say  I feel like if we just let everybody speak  Algorithms are a problem because we are boost. We are amplifying artificially some speech. So I agree. That's a problem  Uh, but if you could say everybody can say whatever they want and everybody else could judge everything that they say  If you get the algorithms out of it  That's true free speech. Nobody's amplified over anybody else  One of the things that the internet has given us is a much more democratic, uh, communications  Medium so everybody can have a voice if they want let everybody speak  Teach people how to think critically  Limits let me teach people to think critically about what they read do not algorithmically amplify  Stuff so that you know, you don't get radicalized  Isn't isn't that the only possible solution anything else is somebody whether it's you or president biden or john l trump saying  That's okay. That's not okay or or google saying that's okay. Okay. I don't want to see that. I think that's always fraught

So  what  You know the platform in a way is like this notebook that i'm holding up  This is also a platform and I can and I can write anything that I want on it, right?  And if I write horrible things, I guess, uh, or if something horrible happens  Nobody's going to sue the maker of this notebook, right? They're gonna i'm going to be the one that gets in trouble  and so I think that's the  The position that modern media has taken we're just the platform we are just distributing  There have been questions about whether or not algorithms are entitled to the same rights to speech as humans are and that has yet to be decided  But I have to ask a question if we continue to  You know, you can't say certain words on nbc at eight o'clock at night nor can you show nudity or certain types of violence?  Why do we hold?  I mean I know legally why we hold broadcast media to a different standard than a platform  But from a functional societal point of view  Um, if if we are free speech absolutists, then why hold broadcast media to some standards?

Transcript:  Because that may distribute content a time of scarcity  Just that scarcity you were talking about but as scarcity goes away and scarcity is going away. Thanks to the internet  I don't think you'd have to do those regulations anymore  And and so because there were three networks and there were very and it was it was a scarcity of the airwaves  And there was no other way to do it. You had some regulation, but let's get rid of the scarcity, which we have  I think the regulation goes away too and it did we don't have we don't have equal time  We don't have the seven dirty words none of that and I think that that's a good thing  And if you don't if you thought that twit would be full of expletives and you didn't want that for yourself or your family

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care if that's not happening. Here's here's the question that I would love for us to ask if we go into the future 20 years  What kind of life do we want to have?  Do we want to have more like because we have these multi multifaceted problems all of which at this point now intersect with speech  Whether that's catastrophic climate change or horrific gun violence  um, or  You know economic insanity we have all of these problems all of them intersect with both algorithms, you know tech and speech  so we have to  Ask the challenging question 20 years from now if we make no change, what's our baseline?  What's the baseline scenario and from my vantage point the baseline scenario is not a good one  We are in a worse situation  I don't have an immediate answer  I'm not suggesting that the government or some arbitrary body of people  Start policing what we say how to whom and where but I also don't think we should continue  to support total anonymity  um and and totally unfettered  All anything goes without any type of consequence in a real way because  The the problem here is that I don't see us mitigating  I don't see us mitigating these these other problems  And so we wind up more politically polarized we wind up with  More economic uncertainty again. This is just my opinion  And I think we wind up with more  more totally unnecessary violence

Start time: 3419.39
End time: 3450.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the I think the solution to that is is small communities communities of uh  Affinity there has to be communication between the communities  Uh, I think you know, I think that's one of the reasons I think the fedaverse works  Macedon works compared to twitter. Those are individual  Communities that are self that enforce their own by agreement rules  That you participate with or not depending on whether you agree with those rules that seems to work quite well

Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. They're federated models. I just want to say one other quick thing because I think it's worth noting  um, I know all of this sounds really speculative and uh  Like i'm thinking like worst possible cases here  For those of you who are not familiar with what I what people in my position do so  Technically the term is futurist but what we really do is strategic foresight  We use data sets and build different types of models  To look for long-term indications of change. So my economic my academic background is game theory and economics  This was before the the journalism stuff. So this is not just um, you know a crazy lady on a sunday afternoon spouting off  You know, uh, but I think that's important because again  There there is there is some there's data and evidence rooted in what i've been stating is uh, what i've been talking about  Um a federated model works really well, but that requires boundaries  So maybe some type of dao is a potential solution here  Dao is a government governance model versus an investment model could be actually kind of awesome  smart contracts, um making a lot of this totally transparent, um, maybe that's another  That's another you know, there there is emerging technology that we could use to solve our current technology problems, which would be kind of awesome  You know

I think is a really good exercise  Without worrying about how hard it's going to be to get there. What that's right. That's right

Transcript:  I will provide one thing one thing that I would like  One source of truth that we can all agree that is actually truth  As if something actually happened. This has become our major major problem  We've seen over the last number of years is that we don't agree that something is black is black and something is white is white  We we can't agree on legitimate so here's how you in my opinion scary how you handle that

Start time: 3644.10
End time: 3676.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's all in my opinion. It's all societal. It's all norms. That's why I like a federated model  I like a small community model because  The best way to decide that is not for any individual to say that's facts. That's not facts  but for community to  Censure liars  And when the community says you know what?  That's a lie that sky is not green  We all agree about that and and those of you who say the sky is green. No, you're wrong  But and and the community agreement that it's it's

Transcript:  No, I understand longer a fact and you know what there may be polarization and there may be groups that then say well  We believe the sky is green. We're going to go off and do our own thing  That's fine  That's fine. I don't think there's anything wrong with that  I think I think in every case you get in trouble when you become authoritarian and say no  No, we're going to enforce the fact that this is a fact because david as you well know  One man's fact is another man's fiction and it's impossible to say for many things not everything but for many things

Transcript:  That's always the problem and algorithms amplify media amplifies and uh, but I think we're going in a in a better direction  Aren't we by I think it's much more democratic. There are many more voices. Yes right now. It sounds chaotic  There's a lot of people talking at you. We're going to have to learn ways of dealing with that learn ways to judge  Whether something's true or not  That's part of the strife that's going on right now, but in the long run we're moving in the positive direction  But I think i've always said algorithms are a big problem  And I don't think you say I don't think you come up with a better algorithm  A fact fiction hot dog or not algorithm. I think you just stop algorithms

Start time: 3774.34

Transcript:  But there's also the training just journalism in general the training of journalism in general says get both sides of the story  Like day one in journalism school, it's taught to you. I know and that's wrong  Sometimes there's not a second side of the story oftentimes. There's five sides to the story  And you know, and this is the problem and you'll see so many stories in just your local tv news like  What's the opposite side of the story? What there is no opposite side in many cases  Sometimes it's just a fact report it be done. Yeah  amy go ahead

Start time: 3810.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was  Yeah, so I found journalism school to be  really challenging because  I there weren't so leo you were just talking about the sky is blue. The sky is green  Like my vision for the future is that we all walk outside  And somebody says the sky is blue and somebody else is like the sky is green  And this the sky is green person says like come at me bro  Let's let's talk but like but like um  Like let's why do you think the sky is blue? Let's talk about it. Yeah  Exactly. I think the the central problem that we face and the reason that we like algorithms  Is because people are very uncomfortable with uncertainty  um, and part of what algorithmic selection does is it reduces the tyranny of choice, so  We we have more  We're goaded into thinking we have more certainty and that the decisions that are being made for us are good ones  And then our behavior starts to change to match. I think that's what drove a lot of people to discord including me  I've spent tons less time on twitter  In the past year than I did five years ago. Um  in part because of like just you know, i'm getting like every day just  um  Crypto bots and crypto bros are just it's me with a whole bunch of hashtags and you know, it's like meaningless like horrible, right?

I don't actually care people have said some pretty horrible things  I just ignore it. Of course. Yeah, i'm a very confident person. So i'm quite fine  But it just makes the experience less and every time i've reported to twitter  Um, but the the harassment that meets their own criteria  It's not dealt with and even if it is dealt with there's it's like a hydra, right?

Transcript:  You've got like five new well and that's um, what's what's disturbing is that all of the things elon has said have shown ignorance of what?  the issues are  Twitter's I think done a lot believe it or not.

I mean, I really like mastodon for that reason  There needs to be some porosity to the bubble that you're in otherwise you all believe the sky is green  And uh, so it's important that there be  communication

Start time: 3997.78
End time: 4023.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  What is aggravating me is we should never have a conversation  About whether the sky is blue or green like some certain facts just are facts and with it  But what's happening is we're being we we are wasting time on these  Conversations and these issues that should have never ever come up in the first place and it's often to divert our attention from something that's  uh, that is

Start time: 4025.04
End time: 4041.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a lot of nasty manipulation going on  Yeah, and that's your fear. Of course if elon gets twitter is he would use it to manipulate the electorate  And so there is there are people willing to manipulate and the solution to them is to solve this amplification algorithmic amplification issue

Start time: 4044.14
End time: 4061.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And i'm not sure what the answer to that is but you're right  Uh, and and maybe the other issue is for us to become more aware of manipulation  To raise our consciousness to understand we're being manipulated and maybe there's a lot of people  Probably is probably the majority of people who don't care

Start time: 4062.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But just look at but remember david maybe you're not you're not you're kind of the three of us. I think are natural  Skeptics we're always even debating with ourselves about what we believe but there are  I would say the vast majority of people just want to be told what to believe and love that warm bath of no doubt  right of pure faith  And uh, and if if a charismatic leader comes along and tells them a fairy tale that that makes them feel good  They love the idea that they can believe they can yes  But then that they can turn off that very hard thing  which is  thinking  And I unfortunately think that that's a natural human tendency. So that may be here. Let me ask

Transcript:  This is not on our show notes for tonight, but I got a good example  Why is everybody so fascinated with the johnny dub and amber herd trial because it is showing up  That is the thing that shows up on twitter, right? It's it's it's being live streamed. It's it's like

Start time: 4137.00
End time: 4147.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that we talk about  Emotions these things emotions at a distance for feelings. That's why we have celebrity. We love that and I think it's just biological

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I mean, yes, we like  We're drawn into celebrity gossip  but why why that trial and not some other trial because arguably like johnny depp's a little past his prime

Transcript:  There but this is the part that I think is really important. Why does the royal family exist?  Well that I don't know but from a if we were to try to like who polices the algorithms I think is a question the  The conversation that we're having. Yeah, the problem is that  To get to the end of that we would want to have some  Kill switch so that we don't all get sucked into to something that is probably not great  But defining that would be really challenging and this is one of the core problems with with agi  And so you wind up with the reverse of that  which is a system like gpt3 which  Makes a lot of assumptions based on like problematic data sets and a handful of people who are making the decisions during coding  So again, if I like play this forward, this is an interesting another place for a dow again not tied to finances  but what should those decisions be  what should the  Like like what should the data set be? What should some of the params be like, you know?  And you know, nobody would care but maybe some people would care and maybe that's another way to think about this. I don't know

Would fall for adolf hitler and nazism  And follow in what was inevitably going to end in disaster. How did and this is of course the the work  Hannah erin's work the origins of totalitarianism  That tries to answer  uh that question  And you know, I think it essentially is I mean look I I probably should be the have you read it  Yeah, but i'm the wrong person to synopsize it it's kind of it's kind of  It's kind of trivializing in a way, but  She says it's loneliness

Start time: 4314.64

Start time: 4321.40
End time: 4355.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That if you're socially isolated, you're more likely to be attracted to totalitarian ideology  and  I'm not sure I ever i'm not sure I agreed with it when I read it it bugs me still  But you see evidence of it time and time again  and um  But there's something in our nature  That it draws us to a strong man  And draws us to somebody who will tell us it's certain. It's certainty. Yeah, we don't like it. We don't like uncertainty  We much prefer it if we're told what to think

It's about the lane about language  is what's  driving  us to believe in cults and the cults go from  You know the branch davidians all the way  Down to your peloton instruct crossfit as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He talks about soul cycle compares soul cycle to scientology. Excuse me. Yeah, soul cycle is definitely a cult. Everybody knows that but  but  You know, I think these are different facets of the same elephant that I mean language and joseph gebbels knew this hitler knew this  language is a tool a very powerful tool  And uh the language you choose  Is part of this. I don't think it's all of it. I don't think it's neuro linguistic programming  I don't think you know you if I say the magic words, you're going to fall into bed with me, but  It's certainly a tool in this in this manipulation  The whole reason it works though is we're so willing to go for it

Yeah, the common phrase people say is oh, I like what so and so said  I like what amy said I like what leo said but  And this is what we should be saying to ourselves  I'd like what amy said because it challenged my thinking there you go and people don't say that and they should never

That's just them  I'm so mad at discord  I mean I admit 4chan which by the way 4chan is exactly what elon musk wants to turn twitter into  4chan was very much part of this kid's radicalization  Uh, he but he found like minds there and he found the information he wanted and it reinforced his own beliefs

Start time: 4500.54
End time: 4554.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So right. So again, this is all structured data. This is the problem  So when you have radical ideas starting to take over they tend to share a common linguistic  Face, which is partially what this book is about that fascinating. Yeah, that makes sense  Right, but the problem is that that's like straight up structured data. And if everybody's using the same words and phrases  Then  You know you have two options there  it becomes much easier to identify and remove or mitigate on and you can train any system to recognize  Those words and they will evolve because people will come up with additional code words then to right  right, but uh  But but it gives you optionality if you're if you're looking at it as structured data  You can either deal with it and remove it  Um, or you're making a choice not to so, you know what i've got did I ever show you this?  um, I have

Transcript:  Actually, hold on go get it and we're gonna talk about it when I gotta take a break  So hold on just a second. Okay, but uh when we come back amy will show us something  I don't know if I should yes, you should hold on our show today brought to you by express vpn  watching netflix without using express vpn is like  Buying tickets to his taylor swift concert, but only being allowed to watch the opening act  Oh, man, how disappointing is that?  Well, let me explain  Express vpn  Unlocks the content you want it lets you like like any good vpn change your online location  But there's a real reason you'd want to use express vpn to do this first of all  Actually, there are a number of reasons there's security there's privacy there's eliminating geographic restrictions  I do all three ever want to watch doctor who on netflix?  You can go to netflix uk if you're already a netflix subscriber in the us and now you're in england  They invest in their infrastructure so you can watch high def video because it's fast  One of the ways vpns get blocked is because an address an ip address becomes associated with a vpn  And then the bbc or somebody else says well, we're not going to allow that and blocks that ip address express vpn  Rotates their address. They do a really good job of not only hiding you but hiding themselves  So with express vpn, this is one of many reasons to use it. You can just open their app select a country  Go to the country run netflix. You're already logged in  Suddenly, you'll be seeing netflix uk or netflix japan  Beautiful beautiful hd video without buffering that to mention the security factor of using a vpn  When you go, you know on a google search, even if you're in incognito mode, google knows your ip address. They say oh hi leo  Not with express vpn. It's not leo. It's some other ip address  Express vpn works with everything you use phones your laptops your your your consoles your smart tvs  You can even put express vpn on your router protect the whole house  And because they've got servers all over the world 94 different countries man. The world is your oyster  Yes, it works with  Netflix it works with bbc's iplayer works with youtube  It's really a remarkable vpn. Here's the final  final issue with the vpn  Sure, you're protecting your privacy against the other guys, but the vpn knows everything you're doing  You want a vpn service that protects your privacy the same way you protect it  I'll never forget the time that I uh, I fired up itunes and  What's on this list of everybody's music in the hotel? I could listen to their music. That's when it hit me  You know, I probably should be using express vpn. Uh, there was a great article on bleeping computer about express vpn and how  They do it. I was so impressed  They run a custom version of  debian  And it gets wiped completely  Every day, so there's nothing on the hard drive furthermore with their trusted server technology  They are launching a ram only server  That can't that sandbox can't write to the hard drive. So it can't write to the hard drive  It's wiped  regularly on reboot  it is  There's a verification system that prevents insider code tampering  It's patched every week with clean installs on every express vpn  server  So when I read this on bleeping computer, I thought you know what this is this confirms what I always thought  Express vpn it works better. They invest in infrastructure  They protect your privacy and all of this for less than seven bucks a month when you go to express vpn.com  Slash twit be smart  Stop paying full price for streaming services and only getting access to a fraction of their content get your money's worth  Express vpn.com slash twit and sign up for a year package  You'll get three months free big discount less than seven bucks a month to protect your privacy to put yourself anywhere in the world  Uh, it's amazing  Worth every penny. It's the only vpn. I use the only one I trust express  Vpn.com slash twit we thank them so much for their supportive twit. They've done a really good job  Uh of making this service  now  Amy webb is going to show us something  Ta-da

He was the first person to really generate his adversarial  Network network, which is a very deep form of machine learning  He yeah some of his papers early papers are fascinating to read now and he he was unhappy with the requirement to come back to work  He liked working from home who knew and said um for that and other reasons I think decided to leave apple  And uh, and then go back to google. There was a great quote  This is uh, this is from um tnw  Tristan green he said to put this into a sports analogy  What apple's done is like letting tom brady or michael jordan leave your team  Over a disagreement between them and the team owner on how towels should be folded

There's super glue that's been surpassed. There was the artari benchmark  Um, we can't even define it  Is the problem so this is the problem. Um, we talk about systems being  generally capable of performing  Multiple tasks at once at or above the level of humans  I would argue that we are already starting like like  Alpha fold, you know uses language uses decision making uses recognition making decisions  We already have systems that I think evidence  Uh sort of the outer edges we have edge cases now. Yeah, but they're very specific, uh domains

Start time: 5359.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, the problem with the current benchmarks is that you're right. They are specific. They are mostly tied to specific types of language  Um and with but you have to have the benchmarks because that's what galvanizes activity in the research community because people want to beat them  Yeah, I think we have to just define so in the last book that I wrote the big nine  I actually came up with a different my version of what a better benchmark would be  It's called the uh, I think I called it the meaningful contribution test  Which is where you would have an ai system like the a word for example, disembodied voice sitting in on a meeting with you  and it would  sort of  automatically, um  Intervene or be a part of conflict conversations. It would automatically I think that's super hard

Start time: 5402.00

Transcript:  And yeah much harder than we think I think that's yeah, I feel like the the first 80 is easy  It's the last one percent that's impossible and I think that's everything. Yeah, it's everything  And I think that that's really we've underestimated that last one percent all this time, you know the the right now the you the  Uh, eu is proposing  Uh that every social network should be responsible for the content  Of that network not only child sexual abuse material see sam  That's what apple was proposing with a c sam scanner for the iphone but of grooming behavior  So this raises a number of things first of all  That means no end-to-end encryption because if whatsapp is responsible for all the conversations on whatsapp  They can't encrypt them. They've got to be able to see them. But then there's even a more  Difficult, what is grooming behavior?  How do you know do you know can you identify it accurately enough to send somebody to jail

Um, of course they are and they're going to say the same pipes  It's going to be the same analogy  um about us  Personally, I would love to be the generation that's like hey  We figured out like picks and shovels and how to make fire and then we did some good stuff with those tools  Versus we were the barbarians  you know

We're trying to make it entertaining  We've got a great community people honestly this whole concept started  Because I don't know how much you've talked about on your shows security vendors and security practitioners are like butting heads constantly. Yes  and  You know  The problem is and it's this weird dichotomy of how the industry works is you've got somewhere and we don't know exactly how many  But there's somewhere between 3 000 to 5 000 security vendors out there and then they're all they all advertise with us  Thank you. You would hope  But they're all selling to csos  and so what's happening  Is just csos can't they got to run their environment. They got to secure their environment. They got to work with their team  They're managing and also working working with the business and then at the same time they have to look at new security solutions  So it's a challenging space. Absolutely very very challenging. Yeah, absolutely  we began the network with the original mission of  How can we ease this?

It is not a diet because you don't have to change your lifestyle  neum doesn't believe in restricting what you can or can't eat instead  Neum gives you knowledge. This is of course the secret isn't it and the wisdom you need  To make informed choices and then gives you the encouragement you need to stay on that path. It's a psychological approach  Based on things like cognitive behavioral therapy, which really really works with neum  You get a number of tools you get the app  You can track everything you're eating and drinking and all the exercise you're doing you get a coach personal coach  You get a group it helps you  Understand your relationship with food and build sustainable habits that last a lifetime when I first started neum  And when I told my coach I said I feel bad. I had a hot dog  She said no, there's no bad foods. You can have a hot dog. I said what?  What kind of diet is this? She said leo i've told you again and again. It's not a diet  There are no bad foods. It's about making informed choices what I was really doing that was bad  That I had to learn to change was fog eating eating unconsciously coming home and stuffing my mouth  And neum has really helped me build sustainable habits that are also fostering my health  Neum understands building long-term positive habits is hard  And yes, it has its ups and downs  They believe in progress not perfection your journey is going to look different from everybody else  But it is grounded in science and it's the heart of everything they do. They've published more than 30  peer-reviewed scientific articles for users  practitioners scientists and the public about what they're doing  And how it works and I encourage you if you want to know more to read up on that you can start at the website  noom  dot com slash  Twit when I first started neum they give you a fairly long questionnaire  They're really digging into what you're doing your habits how you feel about stuff. Do you stress eat?  Do you fog eat? Do you let the elephant take control?  all of that  And it's really you even in the onboarding process  a beginning of  Learning about yourself and knowing what's going on. You don't have to worry about ruining the whole program  With one off day it helps you get back on track you fit it in your life  So you decide how much time you want to spend on neum?  How fast you want to lose weight five ten fifteen minutes a day?  All of that is is in your control and that's really what neum is about is about being in control not forcing anything  I just i'm such a fan it works so well  And and if you ever if lisa ever  Sees you just ask her about neum and prepare because she will tell you  How great it is the whole story? It's really fantastic. It's really fantastic. In fact, you can read it online  Go to neum n o om dot com slash twit and start building better habits today. Of course, they have a trial  So at least do that for yourself n o om dot com slash twit see if it works for you  I think I think you'll see why it is  Now becoming such a great  Choice for so many people  And you know, I love the community that I had in neum and my and uh, and my coach and we communicate regularly  There's also a great neum subreddit with lots of additional ideas. I just think neum is fantastic neum  N o om dot com slash twit. I want you to sign up for your trial  If you've been looking for something this this may be the thing you're looking for it was for me  neum dot com slash twit. Thank you neum from the bottom of my heart seriously  All right, by the way one of the things that's kind of a through line in this whole conversation is

Yes, it makes sense  Is that why we are all staring at screens and the tech has evolved faster than our biology our eyes were built to see  Long distances so that we didn't get killed by animals coming at us not short distances  So what we know to be true is most people are going to need some type of corrective lens anyway  And that is especially true of people who are very young so kids especially and after being through covid that caused a second bump in acceleration  So we're already going to need to wear glasses now if your choice is you can have  Analog glasses you can have like plano glasses glasses like that don't do anything or  You can have enhanced glasses with these other capabilities  And if those capabilities are basically a heads-up display, what do you think people are going to choose it become is it's a  It is a absolute certainty.
