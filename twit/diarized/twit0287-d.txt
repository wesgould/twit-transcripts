Transcript:  panel by far. I don't know about that, but we do have really some really  interesting folks also joining us. Harry McCracken, editor of Technologizer.  He also writes for Time Magazine. Right? That's right. The magazine  and time.com. Excellent. Great to have you here as well, Harry. And joining us  because there is some some news that that Danny helped spread around. Danny  Sullivan, editor in chief of search engine land.com. Great to have you on  the show, especially with the news this week about Google and Bing. Sure.  Looking forward to the show. All right, let's get right into it. I want to start  off just looking at the week ahead because we've got a veritable avalanche  of announcements next week. There's or big events. Something happened in every  day. Monday. Did you guys see this? Did you get the invite from Sprint? They  promise an industry first. And they're also bringing David Blaine on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there you go. CEO Dan Hess of Sprint will be joining David Blaine. What  could they possibly have on Monday that would be an industry first? Any any  guesses?  Not a one.  It's not an iPhone.

Start time: 213.78
End time: 216.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that might be a 4G device of some sort.

Start time: 217.62
End time: 232.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say a 4G device with more than two hours battery life. Not that I'm  bitter about my overdrive modem. And it's overheating issues.  But yeah,  I think Android on a tablet, a secret Sprint tablet they didn't mention at CES.

Start time: 233.12
End time: 243.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Galaxy Tablet. I mean, that really wouldn't. I got to figure that this  industry first is going to be a technicality industry first. It's not it's  gonna we're not gonna get blown away, are we?

Start time: 244.92
End time: 277.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they're if you're going to get blown away, they wouldn't need David Blaine.  I mean, like the whole idea is like, we've got something mindbending, it's  going to change mobile communications forever. And we got this jackass who's  gonna, you know, what I didn't gadget say, you know, sit in ice water with with  flesh rending animals for 45 minutes. You know, it's not like Hess doesn't know  how to give a good press conference. I mean, he's not Steve Jobs, nobody is. So  if they actually need a giant scary magician on stage to spice things up, I'm  a little confused and possibly bored already.

Start time: 280.84
End time: 290.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, if we're blown away, we'll really be blown away because we're not sure what  it is. So my guess is that either something relatively mundane or something  completely out of the blue and probably the former.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Much more much more exciting, probably, will be Julian Assange's extradition  hearing, which is set to begin Monday and Tuesday. I'm sure C-SPAN will give you  live wall to wall coverage or somebody will but this is where they're they're  trying to extradite him to Sweden to face the charges on sexual harassment,  sexual assault charges over there really doesn't have anything to do with  Wikileaks. But it's there. It's the reason he's been under house arrest  because he's the Sweden wants him to be pulled over. And a lot of people think if  he gets if he gets extradited to Sweden, it'll be easy for the United States to  get Sweden extradite him to the United States to face charges on Wikileaks. So  this whole thing's about to start heating back up.

Start time: 336.70
End time: 360.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is really stupid, by the way, because if the US wants to extradite him,  they can get him out of the UK quite easily. There's there's any number of  people who are upset that it's very easy to extradite from the UK to the US. So I  you know, there's lots of conspiracies going on. But the idea that the US needs  to get him to Sweden to then get him out to the US, they could just do it straight  through the UK. They don't need to go through Scandinavia as part of this.

Transcript:  Probably the least exciting announcement coming is on Tuesday, Dell just picked a  bad week. They've got a Dell means business event in San Francisco. And it's,  it's my guess that it's, you know, some sort of business enterprise related stuff,  but it's not going to be exciting for the consumer.

Start time: 385.34
End time: 408.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they did have a tenants tablet they held up at Dell CES presentation,  literally for almost 30 seconds at the waist of the CEO all the way up on stage  and basically said they would be talking more about it later in the year. So could  be the tenants tablet they were showing off there. And then after that, it's like,  yeah, business usually means server and long term sort of not changing a lot  desktops. So

Transcript:  Wednesday is the one Oh, go ahead. Who?  Okay, Wednesday is HP planning a web OS event. I'm actually excited about this.  We're going to see tablets, we're going to see probably some new phones, right,  Harry?

Start time: 423.34
End time: 458.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I certainly hope so. I'm going to be there and I'm going to be live logging up.  And even though we know it's web OS, it seems like there's a lot we don't know,  like how many products. There were rumors before that nothing might show up until  September, which seemed unlikely. And then HP kind of said, don't believe everything  you saw out there. So I think given that we know the general topic, I think there's  still a lot of unknowns. And I'm kind of eager to see a tablet operating system  that's not from Apple and is not from Google. And there's should be room for at  least one more good product and HP has as good a shot as anybody.

Start time: 458.92
End time: 471.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can can a can HP make any headway against Apple? I mean, I guess it's a question of  anybody can but a lot of people think the Motorola zoom is the is the best one for  this. Can a can HP revive web OS as a tablet operating system?

Start time: 472.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It needs to be revived because I, you know, the Palm Pre was a really good  product, which did not do well. And then it's been I don't even know how long it's  been since it was a really significant upgrade to any device based on that  platform. We basically had the pre and the pre plus and the pre to whatever it's  called and the pixie. So they lost a lot of time and they kind of have to reboot  the whole product line. But I'd like to see it happen.

Transcript:  The rest of this week, we've got other things to talk about later bearing on  them. For instance, the Verizon iPhone goes on sale on Thursday. We got some news  to talk about regarding that Friday. Nokia has its capital markets meeting.  There's a lot of rumors about what's going to happen, what announcements new  CEO Stephen Elop might make. We'll talk about that a little while later as well.  And then next Sunday, Mobile World Congress kicks off in Barcelona. Samsung's  got their big announcements leading up to the beginning of Mobile World Congress  later in the week. Anybody going to MWC?  Harry, you're not going out?

Transcript:  They have they have excellent Hamon in Barcelona, let me tell you.  My my wife is going to Madrid on an unrelated thing, and I'm trying to figure  out how I can I can convince her to smuggle ham out of the country.  I mean, in today's immigration environment, it's probably not a wise idea,  though. I may have to just live without it.  All right, let's get to the the big news of the week.  And Danny, you know, I'll let you tell us the most about this.  But just to set the stage, it started with for me anyway, I saw your post  on search engine land about how Google was claiming Bing was copying search  results. And you had a great layout of exactly what was going on and what they  found.

Start time: 587.26
End time: 712.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. So I'll back up a bit more.  You know, we've had this whole thing heating up over the past month now where  Google in particular, its relevancy results have come under attack.  A number of people have written articles since the beginning of the year.  We had one that came up somewhere around the middle of January, I think of  January 12th. And I got a call from Google saying, hey, we really want you to  come in and talk more about relevancy issues or whatever.  So I said, OK, right.  Set up a time to come in at the end of January.  This was the I think the 28th is when I went in.  So this is like two Fridays ago.  Go and have a bunch of meetings.  Usually if I'm off at Google, meet with a bunch of different product people and  understand different things that are going on.  Last meeting of the day, they come in.  So we want to talk to you about this thing.  And they start showing me these results and this testing that they've been doing  that is convincing them that Bing is copying all their search results.  They had noticed somewhere around the middle of last year that that Bing's  results sometimes seem to be very similar to theirs, uncannily similar in some  cases. They do a spelling correction that they'd consider to be really difficult  to know that somebody had typed something in and it should have been another word  instead. They would correct it.  And then they would see Bing doing the same thing.  And it's got the engineers kind of scratching their head.  Then they saw more sort of anecdotal results of this.  And around October, they noticed a jump in two statistics that made them think  that Bing was becoming more Google like.  They noticed that Bing seemed to have a higher percentage of results in its first  page that matched Google's results.  And they also noticed that there was a higher percentage of the number one  results that were matching on Bing that were also matching on Google.  So Google, which is I think always had kind of a very low opinion of Microsoft,  kind of used them as this evil empire they've got to fight against, started  thinking, wow, are they actually somehow mining our search results?  And in particular, are they doing it using Internet Explorer, using things like the  Bing toolbar, using the suggested sites feature that will send information back?  So they set up a sting operation.

Start time: 714.72
End time: 722.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was like some kind of movie set sort of tale.  I can't wait for the made for YouTube video of this.

Start time: 723.04
End time: 815.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny because, you know, I've taken heat in some quarters or how could you tell  the story or, you know, how were you convinced by Google?  It's like, I'm sorry.  You know, one of the world's biggest technology operations like sets up a  Hollywood style sting operation.  I mean, it was just like a great story, regardless of whatever happens.  Right. So they they set up this sting operation where they get a hundred searches  that don't really exist in nature.  Very unusual words that nobody searches on that don't bring up any results or  really poor results.  And then they alter their search code so that for the first time, they say they  could now manually put a website at the top of these results.  They spiked their results, they spiked their results for these really 100 unusual  queries. And they do this in the middle of December.  They send these engineers home from Google with Internet Explorer and they say, go  through, do this search on Google, click on the top result and we'll see what  happens. They do this.  And two weeks later, nine of the queries on Bing start generating the same result  as Google has. So it's it's pretty clear Bing got that information by watching  someone who was searching on Google, the Google engineers in this case, and, you  know, had their results appearing that way.  To Google, this was a clear case that Bing was copying their information.  So I went back to Bing.  I talked to him on a Friday.  On Monday morning, I said to Bing, like Google saying this stuff, let's talk about  it. Bing had their big event on Tuesday.  This I can't remember what it's called, like Farsight 2011.  Yeah, Farsight 2011.

Start time: 816.16
End time: 820.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Matt Cutts from Google and Harry Shum were scheduled to be on stage together.

Start time: 820.94
End time: 952.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And so and so Bing knew this was coming up.  I mean, Google knew this was coming up and, you know, they were going to want to  talk about it at that thing anyway.  So I'm like, OK, you guys want to tell me the story.  All right. I'll write it up.  That's interesting. I'll see what Bing has to say with it.  And Bing's response was basically, yeah, we do get information in the way that  Google's suggesting. And we get information from a lot of sources and we want to  talk about more talk about it more after Tuesday's event is over.  So like, OK, write up, you know, what I could tell of it.  Try to explain what what Bing is saying.  Spend a lot of time, I thought, mentioning that, you know, from what you can see,  it's not that Bing's results are an identical copy of Google's, but that in  some of these very unusual cases, some of this work that Google's doing is going  to cause Bing to be doing the same thing.  And that's the crux of what Google feels is unfair.  They think that they work really hard in these particularly niche areas and that  Bing's results will improve.  So the the event happens and the story went out, the event happens and the  proverbial is hitting the fan everywhere.  And Bing's response came back and I did a follow up article that ran on this  Friday was really we gather information from all over the Web that our users are  going to. Google is part of that.  Sure, we get a signal of what people are searching on on Google, but that's not  the only thing that we see.  We see it from other places.  We're not specifically targeting Google.  And these are really outlier cases.  And in fact, you can you can take Google's own test and flip it around because they  ran 100 queries and only nine of them in a worst case scenario, the worst case  that you could pick where the only signal, if you will, was coming from Google  was flowing in and in and in most of the cases, Bing didn't use it.  So they're they're they're split apart.  Google feels like basically Bing is cherry picking their best stuff.  Bing's response is we hardly use this search signal from across the Web.  It's really, really minor.  There's nothing wrong with looking what our users are doing when they're using our  browser and improving search results.  And in fact, we think that you do the same thing as well, Google.  And that's where the standoff remains.

Start time: 952.88
End time: 984.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's been plenty of aftershocks from Microsoft all week in reaction.  I mean, they they are they are sniping at each other in the press, essentially, where  Microsoft is trying to reiterate we do not copy these results, which I find both sides  of this very odd from a public relations standpoint, don't you?  I mean, first of all, why does Google want to make such a big deal about this?  It almost gives Bing more publicity than than it hurts them.

Start time: 985.50
End time: 1079.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's there's a lot of people who I think are overreading some of the PR.  There's definitely PR.  Both companies are putting spins on this.  But to me, the fundamental thing is that on the Google side, you have engineers that  feel like something fundamentally unfair is happening, that they're really upset about  it. They feel like they've worked very, very hard on this stuff and that that Bing is  doing something that's just wrong and unethical or just unfair.  So basically, they feel like they worked at Overture.  I suppose you could say the same sort of thing.  Well, that's that's sort of some of the irony.  I mean, the reference is, well, Google just copied overtures, paid ads and Google copies  everything. And in fact, Google's entire business model is arguably based on copying  stuff from all over the place and making it easier for people to locate things.  But they I don't think the Google engineers are looking that far into it.  Right. I think the Google engineers that were upset were just saying, we think this is so  unfair and we have this evidence.  And, you know, I keep likening it as if they walked into the UN of the Web and they said,  we have found the Bing missile sites and we need your support.  And they didn't get it because, you know, some people actually look at what Bing's doing  and think, well, that's kind of reasonable.  And some people just have a lot of hostility towards Google.  And it's, you know, exactly that.  Well, you you're fine copying everybody who cares that they do it.  It doesn't seem like it's mattering that much.  And on Bing's side, you have the same degree of engineers that have actually worked very  hard to improve their search results, who are not happy at all over the idea that Google  wants to suggest that, well, they're just doing it because they copy Google.

Start time: 1080.90
End time: 1100.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this a an indication of the way a Larry Page run Larry Page led Google is apt to to  react, allowing the engineers to have their head and and and raise these sorts of things?  Is this something where I mean, I know Eric Schmidt has is still CEO for a couple of the  weeks, but is this something that he might have tried to put a damper on?

Start time: 1101.58
End time: 1148.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't I don't think that any of the top execs I don't if Larry was fully in charge  right now, I don't know that this would have made a difference.  I think that Google looked at this sort of thing in general and was reacting to the engineers.  I just I don't see it as well, this is because Page was there because he's not there.  The best example you could see is if you go back to around 2005 when Yahoo announced that  for the first time they had a Web page index that was bigger than than Google and Google  went nuts. They they like lost their minds and spent the next month trying to dispute  all the Yahoo stats and they're not bigger than us and we've got to talk to these people.  We need to explain more about that.  And in the end, it just kind of ended in this stalemate where Google said, well, we're bigger,  but we're not going to put numbers up anymore.

Start time: 1148.98
End time: 1154.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in a way, what you're saying is Google is less concerned with PR and more concerned  with with just being right.

Start time: 1155.80
End time: 1202.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the problem is that they I think believe so firmly that they're right, that  they forget that not everybody is going to agree with that.  Or care or care.  Yeah. You know, in this case, they don't really care that much.  It doesn't you know, wasn't this sort of big convincing case.  I mean, it's been interesting watching the reaction because there have been some people  who are, you know, clearly well-being you suck and I suspected this and now I think  you're spying on us, etc, etc.  But there's a whole lot of people who just don't have any sympathy for what Google is  saying and that they, you know, took a hit on this as well.  And it certainly did not go the way that I think Google thought it was going to go, which  was, OK, we've got the coalition of everybody.  We're going we're going up against it.  It's like they've got a coalition of, you know, kind of Google.

Start time: 1203.86
End time: 1207.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the coalition of the willing to be assimilated by Google.

Start time: 1207.76
End time: 1224.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Hey, Danny, to be super Machiavellian about this, do you think part of of Google's  willing to go on and on about being copying our search results?  Could that have been in part because of the battle they're in right now with the content  farms and trying to bring up the quality of search?

Start time: 1225.10
End time: 1248.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's been that's been one of the things that have gone around that, well,  they're doing this whole thing to distract from the fact that, hey, everybody says their  results suck now.  So possibly, you know, I mean, it certainly is distracting from that argument.  Those arguments will come back.  But to concoct all of this, they would have had to know, first of all, that that was all  going to explode in January.

Start time: 1249.34
End time: 1252.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And they started doing these test pages in December.

Start time: 1252.70
End time: 1320.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. You know, so, you know, maybe they had a hint that that was going to happen.  So they got all this stuff together.  Maybe they're lying about the timing, you know, and then they were also looking into  some of this stuff back in October when relatively few people were talking about it.  We've we've had a real frenzy over the past month.  Now, they could have sat on it even longer.  But, you know, I I just haven't seen the timing as this is what they're doing.  What I will say is that I think they are reacting to some of the people suggesting, as  our article did, that the results are not that different.  And I think this was them kind of throwing up their hands saying, all right, you think  the results aren't that different?  Maybe that's something to do with the fact that Bing's just copying us.  You know, that's I think their their reaction was if we want to start talking about  relevancy and who's better, who's worse than that, we need to fill you in on some  things that we haven't talked about before.  You know, I hope we do get back to the relevancy issues.  I think that both Bing and Google have challenges that they're going at.  And, you know, this has distracted from that, but I don't think it's going to make  that go away.

Start time: 1321.50
End time: 1361.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's it's interesting because they're trying to say they're they're playing a  little bit of a political game here saying they're copying search results.  And that's not even actually what Google is accusing them of.  They're accusing them of using Google search results to improve their own.  I don't necessarily think that that's such a bad thing.  I mean, if you can use your algorithm in a way to look at what other behaviors, other  websites are doing, is is that unethical?  I mean, because a lot of the early conversation about this was like it's unethical for  them to do that. But isn't isn't that what every search engine does is goes out and  it indexes the web?

Start time: 1362.50
End time: 1501.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that's that's part of the whole argument that's going on.  And Bing's argument is this is this is an important signal.  And why wouldn't we be using it?  And in fact, in my original article, I said it was very clever.  You know, why wouldn't you do that if you could use this information?  The I suppose the reasons why you might not want to do it that you might think perhaps  unethical is that, first of all, Google Bing has said that there is a search signal  that they gather from across the Web.  And Google is going to be the heaviest component of that search signal.  You know, they're kind of drowning it out.  You know, the other stuff that's going on, you know, potentially searches on Amazon are  mixed in there and eBay and so on.  I think that you got two other things that happen that in these very isolated cases  where Google has actually come up with a great spelling correction that's produced better  results. It's not really the user behavior that's causing Bing to see that and  improve on its end. It's not like the user corrected the spelling.  All the user effectively do does in some of these niche cases is act as a channel to  tell Bing what Google's doing.  You know, they didn't come up with a better way to do the spelling.  They they just saw that Google did it.  So that's one of those cases.  That's where I probably feel the most sympathy for Google, which is, OK, you know, you  say it's really hard to come up with these spelling corrections.  And now you should see that Bing is doing the same thing.  It's it's it would be the equivalent, I suppose, of coming up with an interesting blog  post idea and writing it.  And then somebody else comes along and and then writes it themselves and doesn't give  you any credit for it.  But, you know, Bing's argument of we're looking at all these signals from all over the  place and that's what people do on the Web.  And in fact, we think Google's doing it as well.  You know, that holds a lot of water.  Is Google better than Bing?  We don't nobody knows.  We don't know. We don't have any independent relevancy statistics to tell us this.  And in fact, some of the people who have been arguing over this past month that Google  has gotten worse and everything sucks, they don't know that.  That's all just people's guts feeling.  We I think people are better recognizing when they see the same kind of content farm  material showing up.  But I think they're also forgetting that before they did those searches and before all the  content farms were there, they probably just got pure spam.  You know, there probably wasn't good answers coming up either.  So we don't we don't really know.

Transcript:  I actually I I'm on one thing.  I think quantifying search results is enormously difficult.  But when I find myself over the course of, say, six months, you know, on stuff, I  constantly search about suddenly finding more and more, you know, e-how associated  content, basically garbage results, nothing personal, anybody who works on those sites.  But, you know, what I'm looking at an article and literally it looks like something a  weak form of A.I. cobbled together from search results to generate more search results  and more internal links.  You know, the search results before that and after that, if they're not sort of pushed  down below the fold, they still be really, really good.  But it's it's gotten to the point where it's like I keep thinking like, wow, you know,  we really need a button where we can vote up and vote down on the quality of these  answers. You know, I know Google doesn't want a human element in a search result.  It's algorithm other than the creation of the algorithm itself.  But, you know, it seems like there's there's always this kind of arms race between  people gaming the Google algorithm and the team.  I got not I assume Matt Cutts kind of still runs the team that's sort of fighting back  and forth to to find some parity between people gaming the system and the system  giving the best possible results.  But there's it just seems like there's been a lot more noise in the results than  there there was a year ago or six months ago.

Start time: 1593.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I generally use Google.  And when I go to Bing, I find it not to be as good.  But I kind of wonder whether that's because I've used Google for so long that my brain  has trained itself to think like Google does, if that makes sense.  I also know that Google does something which I know Danny has written about, which is  without telling you, it tweaks the order of the results a lot based on what it knows  about what you've searched for.  So I see sites I go to a lot, such as my own site way up high in Google, which gives  me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  And I see less of that with Bing, probably partially because I know it's big as much.  So, I mean, I think the world thinks like Google does, which gives Google an advantage  right now. And I read a lot about the stuff with content farms, to be honest.  If I do searches with an aim of finding bad content, farm stuff in there, it comes up  and I'm just using Google the way I usually do to do searches.  It hasn't been a huge issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, I primarily use Google like most people do.  It tends to be what my defaults on.  I keep reminding myself that I've got to change the default every other day, just so  I'm getting more of a variety.  But, you know, it still works well.  I encountered the same kind of problems that people do when they see the noise.  It's especially hard for me when I do searches on Google, because I always liken it back  to that scene in The Matrix when What's His Name was there and he's he's going he's got  those three screens, it's all computer code.  And he goes, I just see blonde, redhead and brunette or whatever.  When I look at search results, I'm I'm seeing all the SEO or I'm seeing all the errors even  strong more strongly than, you know, a typical person would would perhaps look at, because  I'll see what may be influencing or not influencing it.  And I would agree. I think anecdotally for me, the noise has gotten worse on Google.  I don't know that it's necessarily better than on being.  I've seen people talk about, well, how Blacko is, you know, great.  And it's got this great solution.  I love Blacko being there, but it's not hard for me to go to Blacko and come up with really bad  results as well.  So I think, you know, it's not.  And I think that they all have a lot of challenges on what they're dealing with this new  stream of content that's coming in, which is not spam, which is what they used to have to fight  with. It's just and it's not necessarily bad quality.  I mean, you get a lot of say these e-how things, because in the past, when you would search in the  form of a question or whatever, there really didn't seem to be much content.  So now people are becoming very sophisticated about getting something that's sometimes it's just  this sort of like fast food like out there rather than the meal you were perhaps looking for.  And I think that's what they're struggling with now.  How do we decide what's good quality versus noise and then try to get the good quality up there?

Transcript:  It is kind of amazing that we're having a conversation about what the best search engine is.  It reminds me, it puts me in the mind of the fact that Internet Explorer is now what the best  56 percent of market share where it used to be unthinkable that there would be another browser.  Even a year or two ago, the idea that you'd even talk about anything but Google in search engines  is sort of unthinkable. But not only are we talking about Google and Bing, we're talking about  things like Blacko and and there's another one, Duck something that I can't remember.  Duck Duck Go.  Duck Duck Go, which I saw a billboard for them today, which kind of amazed me.  Is Google threatened even in the tiniest bit?  Is that why they're so reactive to this?  Do they do they feel the heat for the first time in their in what actually makes them all their money,  which is ads on search?  Right.  I think they are.  Go ahead.  Sorry.

Start time: 1818.28
End time: 1900.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go ahead.  Yes, they're probably feeling more heat than they've ever felt before or for a very, very long time.  I remember they used to be a little bit more.  I think they're probably feeling more heat than they've ever felt before or for a very, very long time.  I remember they used to be an underdog.  So there was heat.  But from a consumer point of view, most consumers don't really seem to have a problem.  I mean, we talk about a lot of this stuff in the blogosphere or whatever, but, you know,  their market share continues to be very strong.  They occasionally have a one point drop here or there and then they come back up.  And for the most part, Bing really just seems to be cannibalizing Yahoo search traffic.  In terms of mind share, I think that it's a much different story.  They've got a stronger competitor now that they're facing and they've got people, you know,  who are in the technological space who are questioning whether or not they really are as superior as they were in the past.  And they don't like that.  It's funny because Google loves to say, we're not big, we're not a monopoly.  People could switch at any time and if they will, they'll do it or whatever.  And in fact, it works to their advantage sometime and they'll highlight that they're not the biggest search engine  that Bing's coming along because then they can even say to the people in D.C. and elsewhere,  see, we have all this competition. You don't need to regulate us.  But if you start crunching their technological chops, they don't like that.  That really just brings out the whole, all right, we're going to have to fight back and show you,  you know, that we really do think we're the best thing that's out there.

Transcript:  I was just going to say, I think perception is incredibly important.  I think about Dell.  But back in the 90s, Dell had an amazing halo as a PC company based on,  at least for quite a while, having really good tech support.  And then their tech support got bad and the halo not only disappeared,  Dell acquired sort of a negative halo with a lot of people where I think people assume that if you called  Dell for tech support, you would get somebody in another country who couldn't help you.  And Google, for the longest time, has had, you know, one of the greatest halos there ever was in technology  just in terms of almost everybody assuming that because it was Google, it was good.  And if I were at Google, I'd be really worried about the potential for that to crumble  because I think it can happen pretty quickly when it does.

Transcript:  All right, we're going to move on to a few other topics.  Google had their honeycomb announcement.  The Daily came out from Rupert Murdoch.  I want to thank one of our sponsors, audible.com.  They provide us with over 85,000 downloadable titles in audio form.  And I find I'm getting addicted to where I almost don't want to read a book if it's not available in audio  because it's so much more convenient.  I can do I can clean the house.  I can mow the lawn.  Actually, I don't mow the lawn, but I can walk the dogs.  I don't have I don't have enough of a lawn to mow.  But, you know, I can do all kinds of things and be reading books.  I've plowed through the first four volumes of Stephen King's Dark Tower,  just driving back and forth to work and doing chores and jogging and stuff like that.  So if you'd like to try out audible, we can give you two free audiobooks right here on twit.  Go to audible.com slash twit and the number two twit two.  And you get two free audiobooks under their platinum offer.  I'm going to recommend just because of our conversation here, John Battelle's The Search.  If you want to learn a little bit about how Google became Google,  John Battelle is is is one of the one of the top experts on this.  And The Search is a fantastic book.  Danny, do you have a do you have a source or a book that you ever recommend to people  if they want to get up on on search besides reading search engine land, of course?  Sure.

Start time: 2040.76
End time: 2082.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John's is an excellent book on the origins, not just of Google, but the whole search space period.  You know, one of the best things he did in that book is he didn't just completely focus on Google.  He talked about go to, which was overture, which was the ads type of thing as well.  I would really recommend beyond that, Ken Aletta's Googled, which came out last year.  And in some ways, it picks up where John's book left off, because when John's book ended,  you know, Google had turned into this big, huge thing.  And Ken's book looks at how Google has kind of evolved over that and and and coped with going  into these new areas and how they've been very disruptive and in being disruptive,  they've gained a number of people who kind of hate them out down the way.  So those are two excellent books.

Transcript:  Well, we're looking at Ken Aletta, a ULTTA is the author of Googled the end of the world as we know it.  So you can under the platinum plan here, you could try both of those out or you could get the first two books in the Dark Tower series.  Either one. Try it. Try it out.  Go to audible dot com slash twit to that's twit and the number two.  We thank Audible for their support.  Google actually had another announcement this week that had nothing to do with search had to do with Android.  Honeycomb was unveiled in a in a in a big press event, which frankly, I felt like it was a little overdoing it.  But but we it was very developer focused.  And I think that was the point was to say, hey, folks, if you want to start developing your apps for a tablet,  start doing it on Android, because this is what Honeycomb is going to be capable of.  Harry, did did you go did you attend the the event?

Start time: 2138.66
End time: 2169.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was there. And, you know, there was not a lot in the way of new news.  A lot of it was recapping stuff we knew already knew about.  And I almost think that's good, because whenever I write about Android, I say Google, you should stop adding new features to Android  until you really focus on the user interface and get at least a little bit closer to what Apple does.  And from what I can tell with Honeycomb, I mean, the primary focus has been building a good user interface for a tablet.  And, well, I want to get more hands on time with one.  What I've seen so far looks quite good.

Transcript:  Well, that was one of the funny things that CES was was talking to people from Toshiba and Dell and other places.  And everybody was like, yeah, Android 3.0, Honeycomb.  The only people who have access to it is Motorola.  So we'll see how the new operating system I'm building my hardware for runs when I get to see Android 3.0, which I thought was actually kind of bizarre.  I mean, Motorola had completely locked down access to this coming in through CES and listening to people talking on the show floor about the fact that we don't have access to Android or assuming we don't have access to Honeycomb.  And we're looking forward to seeing Honeycomb.  And boy, wouldn't it be nice to start working on apps for Honeycomb?  It was it just seemed very strange that they were restricting access to this to a single developer for so long or a single hardware manufacturer for so long.

Start time: 2234.68

The Galaxy one is interesting when the Galaxy came out with whatever the Galaxy tabs.  It didn't feel as compelled, but Honeycomb seems like a.  Oh, we have of writing it as a business expense.  I think that'll be one of the things key to is that, you know, do I get a Wi-Fi only version?  Will that be much less than closer to the iPad price if you're going Wi-Fi or not?  But from what I've seen of Honeycomb, it sure looks nice.  You know, I'm really intrigued to try it with a head to head against the iPad.

Let's let's move along to another tablet item, but this one on the iPad, Rupert Murdoch's attempt to bring publishing direct to the tablet with the daily.  The daily has its own staff dedicated to writing the daily.  So it's not a print publication that's being adapted.  In fact, they have a website, but they're not even publishing to the website.  It's very limited what you get when you go to the website.  The idea is that you will buy the daily and and you will use it as your as your newspaper.  But it's only updated once a day, maybe with breaking news updated a couple of other times a day.  What do you does anybody has anybody read it?  First of all, I mean, I'm sure most of you have had a chance to at least take a peek at it.

End time: 2462.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And right, because you can send a link to someone from within the app, which allows them to read the story, even if it's not linked directly from their website.  So somebody just sent emails to themselves of all of the articles and boom, there was a website with all the articles.  Although not everything is there, but 90 percent of it.

But, you know, I got to try it out on the iPad and actually see if it goes.  But, you know, if I've got my iPad, I usually kind of want to know what's the latest story.

My favorite thing of all time, I think in some ways was working on magazines.  I'm fascinated by this as somebody who reads a lot of magazines, still gets a daily newspaper.  But it's it's bizarre.  I mean, they're doing a three million dollar something in the middle of the halftime show at the Super Bowl, whether it's an advertisement or Super Bowl is carried on Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch this year.

They're talking about 100 pages, 365 days a year.  And, you know, I can almost hear Harry at the other side of Skype going, oh, dear God, you know, how many people is it going to take to do that?  Even if 2530 pages of it is weather and sports scores and Sudoku or Sudoku and crossword puzzles where it's essentially, you know, auto generated content that requires very little manipulation.  They're still talking about filling a huge amount of content.  It's cheap. 40 bucks for a year.  So they've got that side of it on.  But I just, you know, I, you know, Murdoch didn't do really great with my space.  You know, I'm I'm waiting for this to sort of grab me and get me all excited.  And it just hasn't happened yet.

And it's I mean, they went out and they hired a bunch of talented journalists, which is not cheap.  The thing that confuses me most is most of the other large media companies that have hired a lot of talented people are trying to get that content out on as many platforms as possible.  You know, they're doing tablet apps.  They're doing they're on the web.  They're doing mobile stuff.  Some of them are doing print.  And the daily is sort of entirely putting all of its chips on one platform.  And well, the content I read is quite good.  There's a lot of quite good newspaper style content out there and most of it's available in more places.  And at least right now, most of it's available for free.

Transcript:  Well, I think the I think the bet here is that, wow, they sold 10 million iPads.  You know, they haven't even gotten to the second version of the iPad yet.  So they're, you know, do I think they can do it?  You know, I think anything can happen.  I mean, look at the, you know, an eighth grader and his mom managed to at least for a short period of time, you know, rise above angry birds in the free games ranking.  So anything is possible.  I just I'm just really curious if it's sustainable because filling 100 pages every day that they're essentially creating the sort of newsroom that every newspaper in the country, if not the world, has been hacking down at for the last five, 10 years.  And they're trying to do that for an online publication.  You know, it's it's literally it's, you know, it's the closest thing I can think of it is is the launch of of.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness. The McPaper, the national paper, the USA Today, right, which is like, you know, the New York Times is fundamentally a very narrow.  It's sort of it has a very narrow and defined audience, you know, for being having as much weight as it does.  So looking at the daily, it's going to have to be very generic, very broad to get those kind of numbers.  I mean, Murdoch certainly knows how to do that.  I just I just I'm a little mind blown that he's starting something this big and and this expensive.  Pretty ballsy, huh? Yeah, absolutely.  He obviously believes in the iPad as a platform.  But it's it's just kind of a really surprising thing for somebody to be doing it in this day and age, especially because, as Henry points out, good journalists are not inexpensive.  Good journalism is not inexpensive to maintain.  There are so many sources of good writing on the Web for absolutely free.  And what Murdoch is betting is he can create this experience around the iPad and tailoring an application for the iPad that will make it better than reading text on a page.  And, you know, that's that's an interesting guess.

And it does some things that really well, it shows you, you know, like what what is your weather, you know, in your local area automatically.  And it shows you your local sports teams based on your you know, and it brings in Twitter stream.  So you get a little bit of up to date stuff.  But it's a daily magazine.  And I think that's what really has confused me at the beginning, which is this isn't a daily newspaper.  And because that was my first criticism is, well, why isn't it got the top stories of the day?  Why when I open up the first one, was it telling me last night's news about Egypt when lots of stuff has happened since then?  And and a lot of people pointed out, well, wait a minute, you know, this has got some really high quality, long form pieces in it.  And and there's a market for that and there's a need for that.  So it's not valueless.  And I definitely agree with that.  But it wasn't what I wanted.  It's not what I expected.  And I think that's my question is, is there a marketplace for people who have tablets?  Because it will get off the iPad eventually.  It'll be available for Android.  Is there a market for people who have tablets who want to read sort of a lean back daily New Yorker Atlantic, the nation sort of experience where it's like, this isn't keeping me up to date.

And the challenge right now really seems to be creating a way for them to keep up on the stuff from a variety of sources, which would be the opposite of what Murdoch really wants.  Murdoch wants the daily to be the place you're always going to get your stuff and you're always coming there.  And really things like I think insta paper or a few other apps that are pulling in and allowing you to save and allowing you to read things, especially if they allow you to find stuff on your phone or on your desktop and they keep it all in sync.  That's ideal that that you know that way you can sit down and say, right, I want to look at this sort of thing.  Maybe I want to see some of the breaking headlines along with it.  But that's all aggregation and into Murdoch aggregation is a sin that's going to cost him money.  That's just giving away stuff for people for free.  The reality is aggregation doesn't mean that you have to give away stuff for free.  Maybe you come up with a way to work with the aggregator.  So you're paying for some of the content or they're getting subscriptions because they know that some of the stuff they want is from the daily.  But right now, the daily is a walled garden that has no presence.  You know, I was having fun doing some searches on Google trying to see what I could find or any of these these stories.  There was one nice story about, you know, the impact on Jamaica of tourism and how it reshapes the island and in bad ways, good content that you're not going to locate very easily.  Some of the articles are just completely images.  So they're not going to be, you know, findable and they may be, you know, so far they're not blocked from Google.  But I just I don't know that the solution is the complete walled garden.  I don't know that the solution is you just give it all away either.  But, you know, we'll see here's how his grand experiment goes, I suppose.

And that is shown in the sort of that cover flow aspect and the three hundred sixty degree photos and everything.  I don't see anything revolutionary.  They're taking bits and pieces of things that have been done before, but they are putting them together in a very attractive way.

Transcript:  All right. It's going to be all Verizon iPhone news next week.  I have a feeling the Verizon iPhone will be coming out on Thursday.  You'll be able to preorder on Wednesday if you're not a Verizon subscriber.  We'll talk a little more about that and the iPhone wars that are heating up in a minute.  But we actually have a message from Leo Laporte, who is probably on a ship eating caviar and drinking champagne.  But he was he was nice enough to leave us this message to thank another one of our sponsors.

Transcript:  Hi, Tom. Hi, guys. Sorry to bother you.  Interrupt you. We'll be getting right back to the conversation just a bit.  But I thought I'd stop by.  Interrupt and tell you all about one of my favorite remote access products.  Now, you know, I'm away. I'm in South America right now.  I actually recorded this ahead of time.  But I'll tell you what I did bring with me as I went to South America.  Go to my PC. See, we've got many of the computers here.  And certainly my computers at home are all set up with go to my PC so I can get to them from anywhere.  Even shipboard, even Tierra del Fuego.  As long as I can get online, I can get to my computer.  It's so amazing. And boy, talk about telecommuting.  You can skip the rush hour, save time, money and frustration, work from home, go to my PC.  I used to actually commute every day for two or three hours a day.  And it drove me crazy. Now I look at the traffic report on the news and I go, I don't do that.  A lot of people I know get stuck in it in and around San Francisco or L.A., Chicago, D.C., Atlanta, just about every major city these days.  It's so funny you go to a city and they say, yeah, we have the worst traffic.  It's almost as if they're bragging, no, the traffic's worse here.  I've heard that in New York. I've heard it in Atlanta. I've heard it in D.C.  Certainly I believe it in L.A.  All that time in traffic costs you time.  Of course, I think the average commute is going up and up and up.  But I think it's now almost 45 minutes a day.  I was three hours. I was twice that, four times that.  Of course, of course, the money and the miles on your car and the gas and all that and the stress, the energy.  The loss of peace of mind, if you will.  For everyone who gets stuck in traffic, two words to consider.  Stay home. Telecommuting, it's the hot thing.  And you can do that with Go to My PC.  Go to My PC lets you access your office computer from anywhere you can get online.  Do anything you would do at work. Use any program, access any file, even network files.  You could check email, run programs. It's just like you're there. It's fast. It's secure.  128-bit SSL and there has never been a remote access exploit with Go to My PC.  Can't say that for the other guys.  It's an award-winning remote access service from Citrix.  You don't even need any extra hardware. You just need Go to My PC.  Get it free right now by visiting gotomypc.com slash twit.  G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C dot com slash twit.  You can do it while you're listening to the show.  Really, seriously. It takes very little time and bandwidth and then you're ready.  Just do it now for 30 days. That way you'll be ready for the next time you don't want to go to work.  You don't want to sit in traffic. You are on a vacation or a trip.  Go to mypc.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support.  Now, my friends, back to the twits. Tom?

Transcript:  Thank you, Leo. He just wanted to show off that he can do that from a boat.  Not just that, but the Go to My PC as well.  He can be in our computers right now.  All right. Have you seen the latest iPhone commercials, y'all?  The Verizon rolled out their personal computer.  There's been one from Apple that showed the phone side by side and how it's peace and love for everyone.  But we've got one now from Verizon, which definitely is a very exciting,  we've made the iPhone part of our family thing, but it does take a little plug at AT&T.  I think we're going to see an internecine iPhone conflict here.  We're loading it up right now. We'll play it for you. But nobody's seen it yet?  No.  All right. Well, here's your chance.  Well, maybe it'll be your chance.  Essentially, it's just a lot of dramatic shots of the iPhone with dramatic music playing.  And then at the end, it's the Verizon guy.  I can hear you now.  Because that is their tagline and also a little dig at AT&T.  AT&T has come back at them, though, with a commercial of their own,  touting the fact that on an AT&T iPhone, you can surf the web and talk at the same time.  That's their big comeback against Verizon for anything.  Motorola wants in too, as we mentioned. They're going to be taking a dig at Apple and the Super Bowl ad.  It's sort of a send up of the 1984 thing.  Verizon is going to also prepare their network for the onslaught.  Because the joke is the thing about the iPhone on Verizon is it now makes calls.  Because AT&T is so poor in some parts of the country.  But Verizon says they are going to throttle the data speeds of the 5% of their heaviest users  for the rest of a billing cycle and the next billing cycle.  Is that fair?  Verizon supposedly can handle all this, but it seems to be in advance of the iPhone coming  that they want to make sure that they can handle all of these bandwidth hogs that are going to come along.  Patrick, go ahead, Danny.

Transcript:  It's funny. I was on Verizon for the longest time.  Then I went to the iPhone. Now the only thing I have with Verizon is my broadband card.  But I keep hearing all these things that they seem that they're going to do special for the iPhone people  that are going to be coming in where we get apparently unlimited plans.  But if you're not on an iPhone, you won't get an unlimited plan.  Just pick a policy and go with it.  If you want to throttle the heavy usage from certain users, then do that.  But do it consistently.  All this stuff that they're doing just ahead of the iPhone, it just, I don't know.  It doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth, I suppose, in the end.

Transcript:  I think, I don't know, it seems like they're trying to do a lot to be considered as extremely proactive  and ready for the iPhone because they know a lot of people that will leave AT&T for Verizon.  And rumors are floating around whether or not Verizon will offer, you know,  on corporate accounts they've mentioned that they're going to be offering compensation for kill fees  for leaving AT&T to go to Verizon.  Whether or not they're going to do that on a consumer level, nobody really knows.  But they're talking about basically dealing with the top 5%.  You know, what is it to, if you use an extraordinary amount of data and fall within the top 5% of Verizon wireless data users,  we may reduce your data throughput speeds periodically for the remainder of your then current and immediately following billing.  Well, current and immediately following billing cycle to ensure high quality network performance.  Basically, you know, our proactive management is designed to ensure that the remaining 95% of data customers  aren't negatively affected by the inordinate data consumption of just a few users and 5% a big old chunky users.  You know, they're also basically talking about automatically de-resing video.  Excuse me, I'm sorry, not reducing resolution, implementing optimization and transcoding technologies in our network  to transmit data files in a more efficient manner.  And it's like, OK, so they're package shaping and they're going to detect video and they're going to optimize it.  I'm going to put optimize in brackets, you know, for your device.  I think it's going to be really interesting. I think Verizon's panicking.  Panicking is probably not the right word. I think Verizon's nervous that if they blow the transition and they're saying like a relatively small number of units,  100,000 or so handsets are going to come out for the initial rollout on Verizon.  And I think they want to make sure things are as stable as possible, especially because they also have a lot of Android devices coming out, you know,  and sort of dogpiling on more data. I think it's going to be really, you know, really interesting, you know,  especially when you're saying things like while we invest much effort to avoid changing text, image and video files in the compression process.  And while any change to the file is likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the file.  So I think they're, you know, I think they're afraid that they're going to have the same problem AT&T did,  which is to just have their network absolutely slammed in the wake of people, you know, buying iPhones in large volumes.

Transcript:  Now, the the preorders for existing Verizon customers happened this past week. And by eight o'clock that night, they stopped taking them.  They said we're we're sold out. And it's they won't say how many they actually sold.  Mike Abramsky of RBC estimates it was less than 100,000.  But Verizon's trying to imply it's the biggest selling smartphone that they've ever had.  And they, you know, over the first weekend of the droid, they sold 100,000.  But this was just preorders for existing Verizon customers. Starting on this coming Thursday.  If you're a non Verizon customer, you can reserve or preorder your iPhone and either go pick it up in a store on I guess you'll start the preorder on Wednesday and pick it up in the store on Thursday.  And I think I think it's going to be a zoo. We're actually going to be out there covered.  We're going to we're going to find out. We're sending Sarah Lane poor thing at six forty five a.m. Pacific time on Thursday morning to stand in front of the San Francisco flagship store.  Do you think she'll be alone? Anybody in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know a lot of people with iPhones and the only ones I've heard that are immediately like I'm dumping my iPhone on AT&T to go to Verizon are all San Francisco residents.  Obviously, because we're New Yorkers.  Well, I haven't heard from any New Yorkers yet, but I wouldn't be surprised.  You know, and it's going to be really funny to see whether or not the sort of density of you know, whether it's AT&T network or whether it's the incredible density of iPhone users in that area that creates the problem.

Start time: 3676.64
End time: 3688.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's going to be huge. I think the fact that preorder sold so quickly means we're going to see a lot of people not on Verizon yet, switching over to Verizon.  But Harry, do you think it can it can hold up under under the strain?

Start time: 3688.92
End time: 3730.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll see. And I think they're they may be more worried about the first few days than they are about the long term, just because it's like Disneyland opening up the gates and people flooding in.  And once they're a little more fully dispersed, they're OK.  I do wish they were more straightforward about the stuff.  And it's just hard to know.  And I do feel a little bit for five percent because like Patrick says, five percent of Verizon's entire user base is not an insignificant number of people.  And it also when you sold me the service and you said you didn't give me a limit on how I could use it, it seems a little shabby to then be saying that I'm using an inordinately large amount or misbehaving.

Start time: 3732.12
End time: 3736.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I paid for that data. Why? Why suddenly? Because I happen to be making good use of it.

Start time: 3737.24
End time: 3806.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And can I not use it? Yeah, I think they're extremely uptight about tethering and how much that might be abused by end users.  You know, I because it's like you can blow through a data, you know, you download three or four videos off of iTunes like HD resolution videos or purchase three or four videos on iTunes and you can blow through the data cap and almost any wireless service right now.  At least three wireless services like Sprint on the four G.  They're not they're not counting your bandwidth at this point if you can actually get four G.  So I think they're super panicked about like like Harry said, the initial rollout.  I think they're kind of nervous. They want to sort of tone people down and how vicious they get with using the tethering with their notebooks.  I think it's going to be really interesting to see what happens and how the initial Verizon customers react and and whether or not we come back to the classic.  Like, you know, if if if you ask, like, you know, you get a thousand, you know, textile viewers or a thousand, you know, twit viewers in a room and it's like, OK, who thinks sprint sucks and like a third of the hands go up and who who thinks Verizon sucks and a third of the hand goes up and who thinks T-Mobile sucks and maybe like eight hands go up.

Start time: 3806.96
End time: 3813.52

Transcript:  But, you know, T-Mobile was just rated by JD Power as having the best customer satisfaction.

Start time: 3814.34
End time: 3866.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I know a lot of people are super happy with T-Mobile.  I also know a lot of people, they can't get the devices they want on T-Mobile, not as much now as in the past.  But, you know, you're also talking about a smaller group of customers by comparison.  So, you know, I think it's going to be no matter how well Verizon is prepared for this, I think it's going to be an ugly week.  I think it'll be interesting to see when people start running into the data caps if they do, because the thing that always comes out from Sprint or AT&T and anybody else, it's like the biggest data consumption is always like three percent of the customers.  It's just, you know, and three percent of the customers are trying to download like every video on the planet simultaneously and they blow through the caps.  But, you know, when they say ruining it for everybody, it makes me wonder if their switches are really prepared, their towers are really prepared for the level of data traffic they expect off the new iPhone population.

Start time: 3868.88
End time: 3957.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's probably why they put in place this policy.  And if you read it carefully, they say we may throttle you if you're in the top five percent at times.  So they're not going to just throttle you down and then you're stuck on the slow lane for the rest of the month and the next month.  What they're saying is, you know, once you're in that top five percent, if we start having these problems, we may ratchet you down.  It's in their best interest to only do it when they absolutely have to, because the first person it happens to is going to go blog about it and put it on Twitter immediately.  Let's move on to Nokia Microsoft rumors.  This started last Monday when Adnan Ahmad of Berenberg Bank in Hamburg.  He's an analyst, said Nokia should partner up with Microsoft.  It almost feels like a shill at this point because all week long, the stock rose.  Everyone talked about what a great idea it was.  Steven Elop is now the CEO of Nokia.  He's from Microsoft.  He came over from Microsoft.  But there are some folks saying, no, this is not going to happen.  There's not going to be a partnership between Nokia and Microsoft.  Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet doesn't think so.  Chris Ziegler over at Engadget says he's got sources that say, yeah, it is going to happen.  But we don't know what form it would take.  Most of the speculation is Nokia would put out phones with Windows Phone 7 on them.  Are we going to see that, Harry?  Are we going to see Nokia expanding the number of operating systems on its phones?

Start time: 3960.01
End time: 3998.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they basically have to use some operating system they're not currently using  because I don't think it's going to cut it unless they use one of the big OSs.  And the other obvious choice would be Android.  But I have no idea whether Windows Phone 7 will show up on Nokia handsets,  but I don't see why they shouldn't try it.  I mean, it would obviously be great news for Microsoft, not so much in the US  because Nokia is not a big player here, but in the rest of the world,  it would clearly be a good thing for Windows Phone 7.  And it might give Nokia something that was a little more exciting than the Symbian-based handsets.

Start time: 3999.70
End time: 4016.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Nokia is known for the integration of their operating system with their device.  If they go to starting doing third parties like Android or Windows Phone 7,  then suddenly they're just another HTC or something like that.  And that's, I think for them, a harder marketplace to compete in.

Start time: 4017.16
End time: 4034.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true, but unless they pull something amazing out of their hat,  like in the next 90 days, they've got to do something other than the strategy  that got them to be a big player in the first place.  And they don't have to bet the entire company on Windows Phone 7 for it to be worth trying either.  They could just do a handset or two and try to make it good.

Start time: 4037.26
End time: 4091.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be the marriage of two declining platforms in any case.  I mean, a lot of people have looked at this and said,  it doesn't matter if Nokia puts Windows Phone 7 on their phones or not.  Nobody's uptaking Windows Phone 7 right now.  There was a whole spat last week over this weird data leak  that people with Windows Phone 7 have been having  because of the way Yahoo Mail checks its mail.  It downloads a lot more data than it needs just to see if there is a piece of mail there.  Microsoft's been very slow to admit there was a problem,  admit who the problem was until researcher Rafael Rivera finally admitted it.  I talked to Paul Thurado on Windows Weekly about it this week,  and he has a whole explanation of what happened.  But the upshot is, Microsoft still hasn't updated Windows Phone 7.  It just seems like they're moving very slowly,  and this phone's operating system, which is a very nice operating system,  is not getting any uptake.

Start time: 4094.82
End time: 4108.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have to be Windows 7 specific though.  They could go Windows 7, they could run Android as well,  they could be in HTC basically.  They could continue to put out phones with their own operating system too  and basically play all the cards I suppose.

Start time: 4109.88
End time: 4135.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's a question that if they did partner with Microsoft on Windows Phone 7,  Microsoft might actually contribute a little bit to MeeGo or Symbian  to help spruce that operating system up.  You're right, they wouldn't have to choose sides.  Is that a good thing though? Would that work for them?  I guess they're grasping at straws right now because they just lost the lead in smartphones.  They're still the number one overall phone maker.

Start time: 4135.86
End time: 4174.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if you take the HTC example,  I don't know where their finances are or anything,  but they seem to be doing just fine,  and they seem to be doing fine being friends with everybody.  They just make the handset.  So you want an Android phone, you get it on HTC,  and you can get it on any carrier.  If you want a Windows 7 phone, they're doing that as well.  Nokia's got a great brand.  I don't know that people, I think they still do have a great brand.  I don't know that people necessarily think that that brand has to translate  into the actual Nokia operating system for mobile being on a Nokia handset.  They just might think, oh, it's a Nokia,  and just be happy to have whatever operating system is on it.

Start time: 4175.86

Start time: 4181.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They still make some really nice hardware.  They've made a number of phones over the last few years  where the software is woefully obsolete,  but the device itself has a really nice camera and respectable industrial design.  And the one thing that's lacking is that you don't really want to use the interface.

Transcript:  All right, we got a few more stories to get to.  Canada is fighting a bandwidth cap rule from their version of the FCC, the CRTC.  Viacom is back on Hulu.  We've run out of IPv4 addresses.  We'll get to that and more as we wrap up.  But I want to thank our final sponsor for today's show, Squarespace, at squarespace.com.  The fast and easy way to publish a high-quality website or blog.  You can say it along with this.  You've heard us talk about it before.  But Squarespace makes beautiful websites.  If you have a blog, if you have a podcast,  and you want an easy way to make it look good,  because maybe you're design-dumb like I am,  and you just, you know what?  I want a template that I can make a few easy modifications to,  to make it look my own,  but I don't want to have to draw anything or come up with a design or figure out the layout.  That's what Squarespace is perfect for.  You go in, you sign up.  It's optimized for beginners.  If you are a CSS expert and you do want position control of everything on the page,  you can do that too.  You can go in and tweak the CSS code and get the best of both worlds.  Use the template to get you going and then modify it to your heart's content.  Hundreds of design templates.  You can build out all the modules you want.  You want to include your Flickr stream in there.  You can do it and make it look good.  And if you've already got a blog and you're like,  well, I don't want to lose all my old posts,  they have an import module for WordPress, Blogger, Movable Type, and Typad.  So you can bring your stuff in and you're not locked in.  If you decide you want to leave Squarespace, they support data portability.  So your data is still yours if you use Squarespace.  And the best part is if you get really popular, which I mean, that's what you want, right?  You want to get really popular, your website won't go down  just because a lot of people decided to visit it at once.  They will provision you bandwidth with the popularity of your site.  You still pay the same amount for hosting.  So why don't you try it for free?  Go start a website.  See how good looking website you can make on Squarespace.  A 14-day free trial for Twit users at squarespace.com slash twit to give it a shot.  Try building out a website.  You could even import your old website into, your old blog into Squarespace during the trial  and see how it works for you.  Sign up for a free account.  You don't need a credit card to try it out.  There's no reason not to.  Go to squarespace.com slash twit and give it a shot.  If you want to see some examples, go to swordandlaser.com.  That's the podcast I do with Veronica Belmont, co-host of Tekzilla with Patrick Norton.  And we use Squarespace for that.  That's one example of the many.  We thank Squarespace for their support.  How many did you guys hear about the CRTC bandwidth cap situation this week?  It sort of cropped up and then simmered back down all within a week.  The CRTC is the FCC of Canada.  And Mr. Conrad von Finkenstein is the head of the CRTC.  What they did is they put a decision in place that said there are caps on Bel's offerings to people.  So if you sign up for Bel, you get 25 gigabytes a month, very small, on your monthly account.  And then if you want to buy insurance against going over that cap, you can buy it in a couple dollars.  You just throw down an extra toony a month in Canada and you get five more gigabytes, 10 more gigabytes.  They also have something called a vault where you can buy gigabytes against going over a cap  without having to pay the monthly insurance.  So if you go over your 25 gigabytes in a month, it takes it out of the vault.  You don't get charged the overage fee. You don't get throttled down.  What the CRTC said is, Bel, we require you to open your pipes and sell your service to third party competitors.  And we're going to allow you to force the third party competitors to abide by your bandwidth caps,  which meant that all the third party sellers, all the competition now had to offer pretty much exactly the same service that you get from Bel  and in most cases charge a little more for it.  It limited their competitiveness. Now, this didn't affect every single Canadian.  You could get your service from cable, Rogers & Shaw, but they had their own bandwidth caps, usually higher.  There was a huge outcry, huge petition.  Stephen Harper, the prime minister, actually said, CRTC, you need to overturn this or we will overturn it for you in parliament.  And von Finkenstein has said they will take the next 60 days to review this and decide what to do when they're going to take public comment.  But they're not going to implement it right away.  So you don't have to have that bandwidth cap. If you're on a third party, you can go unlimited.  But in 60 days, they'll decide whether they're actually going to allow it to be implemented or not.  Now, obviously, none of us are in Canada, so this doesn't affect us here.  But which of you could get by on 25 gigabytes a month?

Transcript:  I honestly don't have a clue. I couldn't tell you how much I use.  I mean, this all reminds me a little bit of using CompuServe in about 1991 when I was keenly aware of how much CompuServe I use because I was paying by the hour.  I do know I have a Verizon MyFi card for wireless broadband, and that I keep tabs on because I have a five gigabyte limit.  And I basically use that all I want for wireless stuff.  And I really never even approach going over the limit.  But on the other hand, I'm not doing all the stuff I do at home where I'm streaming all the video I want and downloading all the files I want.  So I would love to try me doing myself for a while just as a reality check to see where I am in relation to 25 gigabytes.

It's like because it's like one of those semi slimy kind of like, hey, we're going to make sure we don't charge you over by charging you monthly, whether or not you ever go over or not.  So if you're paranoid and you're conservative, like many Canadians are, I shouldn't say paranoid.  But most Canadian, you think Canada, you think people are like trying to do the right thing.  You know, you think stereotypes, you think foolish, foolish thoughts.  But the you know, it's it's just it's I can also already, you know, probably in the chat room right now, everybody from Australia is going, oh, it sucks.  It really sucks. We've always had these kind of caps.  They suck. Fight Canada fight. It's just atrocious.  It's a bizarre. It's a bizarre regulation to hand down.  You know, we're going to make everybody's service suck as bad as the people who built the network service.  It's like, why? You know, that that that reeks of the kind of thing a lobbyist would put in, for example, like Verizon and AT&T spending 11 million dollars lobbying in Washington, D.C.  And miraculously, mobile Internet doesn't get regulated in our pseudo net neutrality regulations passed by the FCC.

Transcript:  80 gigabytes a month under the under this new plan would cost you forty one dollars and forty five cents.  I'm sorry, this is one hundred five gigabytes would cost you forty one dollars and forty five cents.  Previously, the 200 gigabyte cap was what they had, as well as unlimited.  Twenty gigabyte cap was thirty two dollars a month.  So you get half the gigabytes you were getting under the old plan, but you get to pay ten dollars more.

Transcript:  It's a lot like AT&T when when people started downloading video and volume and AT&T had their technical economists or economist engineers had this really bizarre title for them.  Basically write these really long white papers about, yes, we we you think we sold you this amount of bandwidth, but we only sold you that bandwidth speed for a few seconds at a time as you downloaded some web pages.  We never ever meant for you to actually use all of the bandwidth you think you're already paying for us on a monthly basis.  You know, so I think it's interesting.  There's there's obviously, you know, huge interest in the United States over net neutrality, whether you're pro or con.  I hear a lot of noise that a lot of the major ISPs are all trying to figure out how they can implement tiered or per bit pricing.  You know, whether or not they need to or whether or not they want to because of a look good on Wall Street is is kind of the real question because the the the the white papers by the technical economists were an absolute joke.

Transcript:  You know, so it's this this kind of false idea that there's only so many bits that we can deliver.  That's not really the way the Internet works.  It's not like the water company says, look, we've only got so much water.  We have to conserve because it's not raining.  You know, I mean, it's it's the the bandwidth argument is so obfuscated by this oversimplification of like, ah, but if we, you know, if we if we don't limit it to 25 gigabytes, we'll run out of bits.  It's not that it's not the way it works.

Transcript:  If we don't limit it to 25 gigabytes, we'll have to upgrade our infrastructure and actually deliver on what customers think they have already purchased.

Start time: 4780.10
End time: 4844.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and that's where the the debate is.  Right. Which is how much is that infrastructure and what is the incremental cost and what do you get?  It's not like the the company, the telco can only deliver, you know, say 500,000 gigabytes a month.  And if they spend another one million dollars, it'll be 600,000 gigabytes a month.  I mean, it's it's all about provisioning at the at the head end in ways that allow bandwidth to get routed correctly.  Everybody can get unlimited bandwidth.  That doesn't mean that you'll have quality of service all the time.  It comes and goes.  But they want you want to over as I understand it, I'm getting out of my depth here, but you want to over provision in order to avoid lag.  And I think there these telcos are exploiting that in order to make a bunch of money off something that actually doesn't fix that problem.  They just want to charge you more.  We need we need a network engineer now.

Transcript:  For instance, they do not have Hulu in Canada.  Not because not because of the bandwidth problem, but it could it could discourage innovation in these areas.  It could discourage companies like Twitter and revision three from actually getting started and and trying things if if the telcos were able to put such a vice like grip on the data.  Absolutely.  I mean, yes, I have I have a vested interest in this, believe me, but I can always go back to slinging books if I have to.  Viacom is back on Hulu.  The Daily Show is there.  Colbert report is there.  And some of their other shows will show up 20 days, 21 days after their first airing.  Apparently Viacom is paying 40 million dollars.  But the bigger part of this story was CEO Jason Killar going off on his blog when he announced this about how behind the television industry is.  And a lot of people feel like he was shooting himself in the foot.  He might be trying to get fired.  A lot of people say, no, he's not.  That's just the way he is.  He believes in this medium and that the Internet is going to win.  And, you know, he's right.  Did you guys did you guys see much about this, Harry?  Did you follow the story?

Start time: 4932.29
End time: 4959.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw that.  I mean, there's also talk about Hulu, maybe essentially having to go to an entirely different business model where it's a little bit more like Netflix and a little more controlled by the TV industry.  It's I mean, Hulu is a fabulous product.  It's wildly popular.  And it's not clear whether the people who own the content are going to let go and allow it to continue in the way it has.  And I think that that Killar, the CEO, is kind of in between a rock and a hard place.

Transcript:  Now they don't know what to do with it.  The crazy thing is, you know, like for me, who has become my DVR.  And it's if I were an advertiser, awesome, because unlike with my actual DVR, I can't skip through the ads.  You have to watch them.  So I sit there and I watch them simply because I've got no choice.  And yet the ad pricing, I think on Hulu, they either can't sell or they're still selling it under price and what they're doing on the broadcast, which is continuing to die.  And you just watch these industries and it's almost laughable where they just can't transition over and you just know because of all the vested interests that they can't they can't say, all right, we need to start selling the online stuff or more.  We need to dive in more or the online.  Let's just hold off as long as we can and try to milk the broadcast for as much money as we think we can get out of it.

Start time: 5021.92
End time: 5032.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're exactly right, Danny.  In fact, some of the off the record responses to Killar were like, oh, yeah, 80 percent of us know he's right.  But you can't say that.  It's just, you know, we will get fired.

Start time: 5032.90
End time: 5152.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and we should also point out anyway.  And some people there was at least one blogger or columnist was saying that the whole point of this blog entry was his attempt to get fired so he can move into sort of a startup or something.  But I mean, if you know, it's not like it's not like NBC and CBS and ABC aren't making money.  And it's you know, they're also are still the best in the world.  If you want 15 million people to show up simultaneously, they still do a better job of that than anybody else.  So for the you know, the the five or six advertisers that spend 25 to 40 percent of the money on advertising in a given year, the biggest companies, the biggest advertising spenders like literally like 30 or 40 percent of the money.  And that's about a quarter percent of all advertising is purchased probably by less than 10 companies every year.  You know, and they're not really looking for one to two, you know, purchases.  They're looking for huge numbers of eyeballs.  You know, the NBC, ABC, CBS, they still make a huge amount of money off of those advertisers and a lot of other advertisers.  So, you know, there's there's it's just a mess because the it's the thing we're going back to Rupert Murak.  I don't want to trade analog dollars for digital sense.  And Hulu is obviously caught between a rock and a hard place.  And I think it's going to be really interesting watching Hulu and Netflix over the next year or two, because all of the studios are kind of like, you know, we've got to rein in Netflix.  And, you know, it's ridiculous that stars did the deal with Netflix because, you know, Netflix pays so much of their content comes from their stars deal.  They are restricted from doing HD, but they do standard definition content.  They get a huge number of titles literally for like three or six cents a head versus your local cable company who would pay like two or three dollars a head for that for that exact same content.  So I think the deals between the studios and the networks and the online vendors like Netflix and Hulu, I think that's going to get really messy and really nasty over the next year or two.

Start time: 5152.76
End time: 5178.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what one of the things Kalar said is we've got to start paying per view per month for this stuff, which is essentially what the Viacom deal is.  Viacom gets paid more the more people watch their stuff rather than these flat fees, which in Netflix's case started out as seemingly a good valuation.  But Netflix grew much faster than everyone thought they would.  And now it now it ends up being incredibly cheap.

Start time: 5179.45
End time: 5229.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you also get the flip side.  It's like I'm not charged, you know, per view of what I'm watching on NBC when they broadcast to the world for free.  They want me to watch it.  They want my eyeballs.  And when you start getting onto the Internet, it just starts becoming this completely weird thing as if suddenly I don't count as a viewer as much or my attention is not worthwhile or just showing the ads isn't worthwhile enough.  I need to start paying for it.  I mean, I pay over a hundred dollars a month for my satellite subscription.  So I suppose down the line, maybe I will have, if you will, an online TV subscription that they could figure out a way that I'm paying it all across to.  But then if I'm going to do that, then don't keep charging me what I'm paying for for the broadcast stuff, which I'm basically paying for mainly because I get better.

Start time: 5229.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're you're you're paying a small subset of what the broadcast carries for cable for DirecTV.  I mean, the I gave up on DirecTV.  We moved the last time, you know, and it's been interesting.  There's certain programs we missed.  My wife's kind of really ticked off like she's not seeing the first season of or the first few episodes of Big Love.  And it's it's funny.  HBO is like, you know, we want like 20 bucks a month or we want Netflix to be charging at least 20 bucks a month for their service.  And then there's a real, real nasty rift in between what the broadcast, especially something like ESPN, is used to paying or being paid for their content on cable or satellite versus what people are willing to pay online.  And it's going to be really interesting.  You know, I think ESPN may be the one that sort of leads the way because they do a huge amount of their content on multiple platforms.  But, you know, having sort of the entire HD stream available and a perfect HD set, I mean, it'll be fun to watch this battle out over the next year or two.  But, yeah, I think at some point Hulu, you know, the content partners or the owners really need to think of Hulu as being a legitimate thing and rather this backdoor business, they can kind of, you know, hold at arm's length.

Start time: 5304.96
End time: 5397.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you, as Netflix gets bigger and if Hulu gets bigger, this conversation will change materially because suddenly it'll be too big of a money pot to turn away.  Right now they can afford to make it sound like it's, you know, it's trading digital analog dollars for digital cents.  But this reminds me of when I was in charge of the website at techtv.com, we were not allowed to put more than 10 minutes of video per half hour of our content on the web or it would violate our carriage contracts with the cable companies because they were afraid that if I could watch a postage stamp size video of tech TV shows, then no one would pay for cable anymore.  Which was like that is the least possible. They should have been going exactly the opposite, which is like nobody's going to watch video.  Let them put it on there so that they see the postage stamp and go, I really like this. I want to subscribe. I want to get this, you know, and they actually do pay for cable because they want to see it.  But they did. They go the opposite way. Now, when actually you can watch full size HD video streaming, they're giving you whole shows and saying, well, but we don't want to give you whole shows all the time because that might undermine the content.  That less than one million viewers on Hulu might undermine our, you know, 80 to 100 million potential viewers on broadcast and cable.  It doesn't make any sense. They're afraid of something that actually isn't threatening until it actually becomes threatening.  Then they all jump on it and want to monetize it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's weird because there's no question where we're going and it's going to happen pretty quickly.  So they're essentially trying to march in the direction where where the industry is not going to get done.  If they just look at what happened with music, I don't see why they can't figure that out and get ahead of the game rather than them straggling behind.

Transcript:  P Pratik 96 in the chat room just passed this along. Just posted up on Engadget by Vlad Savov.  Android is ready to play February 13th at 1800 GMT.  This is probably going to be a Mobile World Congress announcement.  But yes, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play.  They finally stopped allowing it to just be leaked all over the place and admitted. Yeah, this is what it's called.  This is what it looks like. We will announce it on February 13th.  Have you seen have you seen much about the play? It's the it's the PlayStation phone is what everyone was calling.  So it's got it's got the buttons like you'd have on a PlayStation, but it's a slide out Android phone and it'll it'll exist somewhat.  It'll be interesting to see the full details now that it's going to be official.  It'll exist somewhat in that in that Sony universe.  All right, we're getting close to the end of the show. We're also getting close to the end of IPv4.  They passed out the last of the numbers. IPv4.  If you don't know, those are the numbers behind things like domain names.  So if you type in twit.tv, there's a number there. I don't remember what it is, but there's an IP address.  And IPv4 has a smaller address space than IPv6.  We're trying to transfer everyone over to IPv6, but that's going to cause a lot of problems because not all the routers can work that way.  Almost no sites are actually delivering themselves as IPv6 sites.  And we've used up all the IPv4 numbers. What are we going to do, Harry?

Transcript:  Yeah, they had a big ceremony where they handed out the last blocks to everybody and said, all right, good luck.  There is a plan on June 8th.  There's going to be a IPv6 day and big sites like Google and Facebook are all going to serve their sites as IPv6 as a way to test out what the issues might be.  There's lots of IPv4 addresses that aren't being used.  They're just assigned to someone right now.  And so there's a lot of talk about recycling IPv4 addresses and saving some to translate so that if I'm on a machine that can only read IPv4,  IPv6 could be translated into IPv4 and this and that.  But it is one of those obtuse situations that, like you say, maybe we should be more worried about than we are.  But the people I've talked to who actually know this stuff say they'll get it worked out.  It won't be pretty. And actually, there may be some bumps along the road where people won't be able to get to certain websites because the websites in IPv6 and they don't have a machine capable of translating those addresses.

It's not a problem with the Sandy Bridge processor. It's with a particular chipset.  And now Best Buy says they're going to be delayed and rolling out Sandy Bridge machines on their floor.  So it's it's too bad because a lot of people are really excited about Sandy Bridge.  The announcement was made right before CES started and it you know, it's it's hit a big bump here.

Transcript:  Brian Shroud and I spent a lot of time talking about this on Twitter hardware this week.  It's a it's kind of a on one hand, it's a huge deal for Intel because they have to spend a lot of money replacing a lot of chipsets or a lot of motherboards effectively and notebooks.  You know, if you actually already have a Sandy Bridge device, don't panic.  It's essentially a potential problem showing up on the three gigabit SATA ports on the motherboard.  You know, if you're really paranoid, switch your stuff to the six gigabit SATA ports, you'll be fine.  A lot of it's still being worked out and a lot of what we're hoping is vendors decide to do, you know, they take your credit card number,  they fire out a fresh functional system or motherboard to you.  And then they, you know, they they release the hold in your credit card or however they want to do it when you send the RMA back on your old motherboard.  It's it's really messy because it came out of nowhere.  Intel verified it over the like found out, verified it over the weekend, released it immediately on Monday.  And it really came out of left field.  Nothing anyone expected.  One of their motherboard power partner found it during extensive sort of heat and stress testing.  But Intel verified it and immediately said, you know, we'll cover the costs.  What that turns out to be, if it is going to include shipping or other things we don't really know yet.  So each of the vendors are kind of working this out.  And I'm sure they're all working this out with Intel and how they're going to cover the expense of this.  But it's a pretty big slowdown in the rollout of Sandy Bridge.

Start time: 5756.86
End time: 5769.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it only affects ports two through five.  So if you're only using two SATA ports, ports zero and one, you're OK.  But even if you're only using two, shouldn't you get the working one just in case you need those other ports down the road somewhere?

Start time: 5769.68
End time: 5822.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you will get the working one, you know, unless you sort of, you know, bought your Sandy Bridge secondhand and didn't turn in any kind of warranty card.  Yes, you should black market Sandy Bridge.  Well, I mean, you know, if you contact your vendor, whether it's a big PC vendor or if you built it yourself, your motherboard vendor.  Yes, you do want to replace it.  It's just that the likelihood of any data corruption happening over the three gig with SATA port is relatively minor.  You know, yes, you absolutely do want to eventually replace the motherboard.  You know, that's going to happen over the next few weeks.  But it's I think it's a big, you know, it's it.  Intel's got the money. They said they'll cover it.  Do it, you know, you know, call your vendor, find out how to do it.  But, yeah, you will want to replace your motherboard.  It's just it's very unlikely that very many people are going to be impacted by this.  We think we think. Yeah.
