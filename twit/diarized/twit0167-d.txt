Starting with Paul Therotte, he's the host of Windows Weekly on the TWiT network and  runs the SuperSight for Windows, winsupersight.com, news editor for Windows IT Pro and the author  of Windows Vista Secrets, which is now completely obsolete.  Hi Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Throw it out.  I'm so proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so proud.  Paul has brought with him some of his expert Windows friends, including Ed Bott, ZDNet  blogger and longtime Windows expert, former editor of PC World magazine.  Sorry, PC World, right Ed?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it right.  PC World, PC Computing, you know, all the magazines that are now much smaller or don't  exist at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  PC Computing was the first to die, wasn't it?  Yes.  That's sad.  I loved PC Computing.  I always thought that was a great magazine.  So did I.  Yeah, I bet you did.  Were you the found, you were the founding editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was there the second year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Second year, okay.  Yep.  And always a good friend.  I've known Ed since we started doing radio, John C. Dvorak and I started doing radio back  in the turn of the century.  Back when we were young.  Back when we were young.  And also with us a new friend that I'm looking forward to getting to know better, Rafael Rivera,  Jr.  He is also a columnist, a blogger and the future co-author of Windows 7 Secrets.  And his blog withinwindows.com is very, very popular.  Rafael, nice to meet you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice to meet you, Leo.  Although I'm a bit weird.  I'm the newbie here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nah, nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't feel weird.  Is there some like first day prank we can pull on him or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is it.  Are you kidding?  This is the prank.  Yeah, this is, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is pretty much where careers go to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't get prankier than this, I'll tell you right now.  You've been punked, Rafael.  You're on Twitter.  Haha.  So you all were in Los Angeles for the Professional Developers Conference.  Yes.  How many, how many PDCs is this, Ed Bott?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, I remember, I think my first one was in 1992.  Wow.  So.  That's before there even was a Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ed, you're really old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Going to this most recent one reminded me of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.  Now they don't have them every year though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't have them every year.  I went to, you know, so that was one for, that was one for Windows NT for the first release  of Windows NT.  And then there was one in 94, 93 or 94.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the big QBasic PDC, right?  Oh, that was exciting.  For Chicago.  Oh, Chicago.  For Chicago.  AKA Windows 95.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  So there was one for .NET, I believe in Denver.  Remember the, the .NET PDC?  You know, I skipped that one.  Everyone did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's only so much boredom any one person can take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trapped in a hail storm, I think.  Oh yeah, sure.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  That's his excuse.  Everything, everything came up blue though.  It's okay.  Geek, geek humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in general, Microsoft does PDC when?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when there's a new platform, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, with a, generally with, you know, roughly a year or so before they expect to launch  a new platform.  Every once in a while, 2003, that doesn't work quite as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be the last PDC, which was a Vista PDC.  No, it was a Longhorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Longhorn.  Yeah.  That was Longhorn.  That was followed the next year by the Great Longhorn Reset.  Yes.  Which they did instead of shipping the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they say everything we told you last year was wrong?  Actually, they kind of did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please forget it.  Over several months, they, you know, they couldn't say it in a single sentence or a  single press release.  It took about six to nine months for them to fess up to all the details of the Great  Longhorn Reset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at all the great technologies we're still using from that PDC.  Like, hmm.  Oh, shoot.  Well, moving along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Rafael, how many PDCs have you been to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say two.  Okay.  You're the youngster here.  Yeah, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The newbie.  Were you impressed?  Was this an interesting event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was very interesting.  Now we all kind of knew the cloud platform would be unveiled and that we'd be thoroughly  confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought it would be Strata, but instead it's Azure.  Right, right.  Or Azure or Azure, Azure audio, whatever the hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the unveiling of the taskbar was awesome.  The what?  The unveiling of the taskbar was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  From Windows 7, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that like a big, that's like the big deal is the taskbar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it sounds silly, but it is kind of a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's new about the taskbar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's glassy and shiny and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a step back before we talk about individual features.  Microsoft announced basically two big things, Windows 7, which by the way is not a code  name.  This is going to be the name.  That's the real deal.  This ain't no Longhorn Chicago thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, Windows version 6.1 will be called Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the world of Microsoft, that actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and I talked a little bit about this on Windows Weekly.  And I've been ever since, like, I'll go to sleep.  It's by the way, a great way, better than counting sheep, go to sleep trying to count  the versions of Windows, trying to get to seven with the next one.  And you can't.  Can't do it.  Somebody sent me an email saying, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, please.  I've got a thousand emails.  This is how you do it.  I figured here's the key.  No, no.  It's not the seventh version of anything.  It's so stop trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you start with NT.  The NT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could start with QBasic.  It doesn't matter.  It's not the seventh version of anything.  It's OK.  All they had to say was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think actually if you start with each family and then you name it and then you take a shot.  Yes, yes.  Somewhere in between six and seven, it makes perfect sense.  Exactly.  That's exactly right.  We actually tried that at PDC.  I believe we did that live.  Four nights in a row, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which is part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's why everybody's a little bit tired today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all tired and but we're also very accepting of the name now.  You might notice that.  That's true.  You know, after a while, just all starts to make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's like when you name a baby, you name your baby Fratz.  At first it seems odd, but after a few years, Fratz is just completely normal.  And that's just what you call him.  Fratz, come here, Fratz.  Nice boy, Fratz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Pentium name.  Remember until they announced that name and everyone was like, Pentium, what the?  Sound like a dentifrice.  It didn't.  Yeah, it's a made up word.  But now Pentium is just the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They might have asked the Palin family for name suggestions.  Windows truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, like I said, they could they could call it yogurt for all I care.  I mean, it's it's it's a fine operating system, regardless.  So Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So those are the two things we'll talk about today is Azure and Windows 7.  Characterize for me, if you will.  Maybe I'll let Paul do this.  What is how does Windows 7 different than or the same as Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where does it fit into the family in one hundred and fifty words or less?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say from a technical perspective, Windows 7 is the next version of Windows  Vista. You know, it's an evolution.  Well, OK, technologically, right?  From a from a user experience standpoint, if I could use Microsoft Lingo for a while.  Also an evolution, I guess.  But I think they're they're describing it as a big release because there's a bunch of fun  new stuff in the UI that makes it hopefully more useful, but certainly more fun to use.  So it's more colorful. It's got more of the effects going on.  It's just it's a it's a cooler looking thing.  And in many ways, sort of like an Apple product.  You know, it's it's it's big on the shiny button stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So would you wait?  You know, the way I would add on to that, when people have been asking me about it  and I've described it as this is Microsoft started at the very lowest levels with Vista  and went all the way to the user interface and really appear to have looked at everything  along the way and said, how can we refine this, make it better, make it simpler,  you know, remove the annoyances, most of the annoyances, obviously not all of them.  It'll still be Windows.  But they've they've really simplified things.  And but not just at the UI level and not just at the driver and API level, but sort of,  you know, in a continuum from one to the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that 100 percent.  Actually, it doesn't seem like there's any little piece of Windows that hasn't been given  the once over. I think all of it got a spit shine, you know, and some of the stuff they did,  as we alluded to earlier, is just fun.  I mean, it's some pretty cool stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rafael, you like that I see that 50 percent of your blog readers prefer Windows 7  and then 50 percent prefer Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a blog post that made when the name was confirmed to be final.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, what's the the the error, you know, the margin of error there is a plus or minus seven percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the red versus the blue.  And I like that.  So, Rafael, do you consider this, as some do, just kind of a polishing of Windows Vista,  kind of Windows Vista the way it should have been?  Or is it really a new version, all new version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like Paul would say, this is Vista done right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys all got a copy of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes. At PC, we attended a workshop and we got some laptops preloaded with Windows 7.  And then on top of that, received the bits along with all the other attendees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have a disk, a laptop and a hard drive.  And a hard drive.  What was on the hard drive, Ed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's the installation media plus a bunch of other, you know, a bunch of other stuff,  some SDKs, white papers, some tools.  So it's like the press, the full press kit.  Yeah, it's the stuff, you know, in the in the Longhorn timeframe, as they say,  this would have been done in, you know, it would have been a stack of three or four or five DVDs.  But I think they got to the point where they added it all up and said,  this would have been 15 or 16 DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Just put it on a...  Although, by the way, it wasn't full, which kind of confused me.  They were talking about 160 gigs of stuff, you know, but the thing is only like half full.  I mean, it's maybe 75 or 80 gigs of stuff.  I forget how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you've all been using Windows 7 now for a few days.  Are you using, are you all using it, Rafael, using it as kind of your production machine  or is it one in the corner?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  No, it's usable.  It's stable.  Especially the 64-bit version.  Now, OK, let's ask, so there's a 32-bit and a 64-bit version still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in my experience, the 32-bit version, the Explorer freezes a lot for some reason.  And it's true on a variety of machines.  So I found that the 64-bit version, for whatever reason, appears to be even a little more stable.  But it's, you know, I think for people like us, it's pretty much there for day to day use.  Obviously, it's not ship ready or anything.  I wouldn't have my parents run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are there significant features missing?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Like?  Well, like that awesome task bar that Rafael was...  Oh, it's not there?  Although he has a surprise about that this evening.  You do, Rafael? What's your surprise?  Maybe this is a good time for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Surprise.  Oh, you scared me.  So at PDC, everyone was running around.  They're like, hey, Rafael, I heard from A, B and C that if you hold up your laptop to the moon, stand on one foot,  connect to the Microsoft domain, the taskbar will appear.  Oh.  Of course, that didn't sound very true.  So I ignored it.  But this morning, I woke up, started digging through stuff, trying to find some arrow shake references.  Totally independent of this.  But I stumbled upon code that checks to see if your machine is a part of a select few domains at Microsoft  and checks to see if you are a user that does not have the letters A hyphen or V hyphen.  And then after you meet all this criteria, the taskbar appears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How? What?  And it's true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is the blue badge test.  Yeah, that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the blue badge test?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, at Microsoft, full-time employees at Microsoft have a blue badge.  Vendors and consultants have, as Rafael alluded to there, they have an A hyphen or a V hyphen in front of their name,  and they get a different color badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you all using this new beautiful taskbar now that you know how to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because Rafael hasn't shared this with us yet.  He will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was literally scrambling to get this all typed up into LiveWriter and ready to post.  Press the button. Press the button. Press the button.  I will push the button right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, exciting, exciting. Go to WithinWindows.com.  Everybody do that right now. We'll bring the site to its knees.  Yeah, there you go.  And so you're going to post a... Do you have some screenshots of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a screenshot. I have a flow chart explaining how this process works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How to actually do it. Okay.  Yes.  Now, can civilians get copies of this beta of Windows 7 or how do you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not designed... You know, they didn't release it that way, but of course, it's not protected in any fashion.  So I would imagine it's already out there, you know. So yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially... Okay, so the version that you guys got on a disc, on a CD or DVD could just be distributed.  It's probably on the... Somebody must have put it up now on the spit torrents, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's got to be all over the place by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How shall we recognize it? How shall we know it's the real thing?  What's the build number? Is there some...  Oh, I see. 6801.  Okay. So this is build 6801.  And I'm sure there are now, right now, spyware and pirates putting copies of something up on the torrents with that build number.  So be careful, of course.  So tell us... You know, we got an hour. Or not even that long. 45 minutes.  Tell me some stuff that's going to get me drooling over Windows 7. Tell me why I should care.  Actually, the real question, and this is, you know, after reading everybody's reviews of this over the last few days,  my real question is, why would anybody buy, especially a business that hasn't upgraded to Vista, why would anybody buy Vista at this point?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think there's an answer to that. I mean, because it's been around for a couple of years.  If a business has been qualifying its internal apps against Vista...  Yeah, you've done all this work so far. Might as well benefit.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know many consumers who would want to use Windows 2000 in preference to Windows XP at this point.  And yet there are lots of businesses that say, no, we're sticking with Windows 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there are lots of consumers, anecdotally, that are sticking with Windows XP.  Yeah.  I guess if you buy a new computer, you're going to get Vista on it. Did they say when Windows 7 would come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The general... What I've been seeing is, you know, August 2009. Is that unreasonable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that's very reasonable. In fact, I think that is their plan.  I think they want to ship this earlier than people believe they're capable of doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they would be foolish to say when because, of course, that really would kind of kill sales on Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, well, plus then what happens if it doesn't work out?  Right.  You know, then it looks like Longhorn again.  Not that they've ever missed a ship schedule or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not Microsoft.  So you've said before, Paul, that because it's so componentized, you think they can ship it anytime, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. And they pretty much verified that.  They talked about how anything that's in the build is ready to go and in a near final state of such quality that they could include it in there.  It wasn't like in the Longhorn days where they would just throw stuff in there.  And depending on which component you were talking about, it was either nearly done or not even close.  Most of the stuff that's in there is pretty baked.  So, yeah, they could artificially at some point in June or July or August or whatever, just draw the line and say, hey, we're done.  And whatever's ready is ready. And that's what we're shipping.  And I'm sure they'd love to do something like that.  I mean, I think obviously they're going to have to have a schedule and at some point they'll have to announce what that schedule is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I noticed that the evaluation copy you guys got expires July 1st, 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Well, I don't think that means anything.  That's me.  No, they'll have a beta release. They'll have a release candidate.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've already said that the beta would be available early next year.  I believe that's the official phrase that they used was early next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this feel like an alpha or a pre-release?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This feels like a beta 2.  It really does. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is that, Ralph Vail? Why is it so solid? Is this something, some new magic process Microsoft's using?  It's magic.  I mean, really, seriously, if it was that easy, why didn't they do it before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's different people, I think, are responsible for this. And this is their credo.  Steven Sinovsky said in our reviewers' workshop, and I think he might have said during the keynote, I'm not sure.  But they don't want to over-promise and under-deliver, obviously.  But they also don't want to under-promise and over-deliver.  I mean, that's the sign of a very similar problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? Why not under-promise and over-deliver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they want to, what they said, which I think is actually, I don't want to say it's profound, but I actually appreciated the way he said it.  We want to promise, and then we want to deliver what we promised.  Wow.  And that's what we want to do.  Wow. What a concept.  No, but this thing being solid is an indication of what we were just talking about, that they're not going to put stuff into that build until it's ready.  I mean, the beta 1 version of Longhorn was a joke. It was terrible.  The PDC 2003 release that we got after that awesome demo was horribly painful because it was nothing like that thing that they showed, that director demo they showed up on the screen, which was so beautiful and so wonderful.  Right.  It looked nothing like that. It was terrible.  And that's the type of thing they knew they needed to work on.  And clearly, the results of that have occurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Sir, Karius is saying in our chat room that maybe it's just a stripped down Vista.  I mean, is that it? I mean, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  What?  Yeah.  Why not?  Well, I can tell you that, but all you have to do is sit down and use it for an hour, and you'll see for yourself what I'm talking about.  I mean, each there's the sort of level of attention of detail that has gone into the changes.  I mean, if it were a stripped down version of Vista, you'd go through and you'd go unchanged, unchanged, unchanged. Whoa, they really worked on this part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Or, look, here's the bunch of stuff they removed that, you know, by removing this thing, it actually made the system faster or smaller.  You know, there isn't that kind of stuff. There are, in fact, additions.  You know, things like the library system, which is basically that thing they wanted to do in Longhorn, you know, done right, not done with WinFS, but done and actually working.  And it does work. You know, but there are, like Ed was saying earlier, there are so many small changes and improvements that it's not that stuff has been taken away.  It's just been finely honed. You know, they've really done a nice job with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like a little bit of an indictment, frankly, of the Vista team, like these guys screwed up.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's one way that definitely is one way to look at it.  But I think you can also and there's a lot of that in there.  There was a poorly run project all down the line.  But what they did with Vista was a whole bunch of architectural work.  I mean, it was it was 90 percent architectural and and 10 percent UI.  And it was like nobody was really thinking the through from an engineering point of view, the UI part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's interesting. So they're benefiting from the underlying infrastructure that the Vista team put in.  They're using that and they're now just doing a new interface on top of it that benefits from the work done and throws out that kind of lame work that was done kind of hastily at the last moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, finishes. I don't think I know I don't think it would be fair to say it was done hastily at the last moment, but they didn't put the resources into it from day one that they did.  So that was so Vista was a platform release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I agree with that. I mean, I guess I would just to expand on it.  I just remind everybody that the Longhorn project that they showed off in 2003 was not Vista that came out later.  Vista, like I said, was the subject of a reboot or reset of what they were doing with Windows at the time.  And Vista itself, if you want to just look at that project, really came to market in about two years.  And it was a major architectural change that enabled both what they're doing today, but also the sort of thing where you have a desktop and you have a start button and a taskbar.  It works just like Windows has always worked. It sort of hides or masks the degree of the changes that occurred under the covers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's like we still have a Chevy body. Maybe we got fins, but the engine, the drivetrain, the transmission, all of that's been re-architected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And that's a hard thing to communicate to people because they use it and they say, well, you know, it kind of works like Windows XP.  I don't quite see what the big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if they did the job right, it would. You wouldn't say, oh, this is all different.  Yeah. Well, Windows 7 is all different.  Is it still NTFS? We're not going to win FS anytime soon.  No.  So it's still NTFS.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a capitulation? I mean, that was one of the big things of the Longhorn project was this Windows file system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not at all. Not at all.  Why not?  Actually, WinFS stood for I think Windows Future Storage.  Oh, sorry.  And it wasn't a file system. It was a series of technologies, schemas and database organizational plumbing that worked in conjunction with the file system.  So it was always designed to be sort of pluggable on top of NTFS.  And a lot of that stuff has now appeared in different formats and things.  I think there's a bunch of stuff in SQL Server 2005 R2 or something like that that's direct descendant of WinFS.  But you look at NTFS with Windows Search on top of it and some of the other goodies that they've got and pretty slick and pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Microsoft has said a few years ago, we can do what we want to do in the file system without WinFS.  And that was true of Vista. It's even more true of Windows 7. You can see it happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the registry still there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God, I hope so.  Yeah, it's got to be there.  I will look.  But of course it is. It's so backwards compatible. How could it not be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we made one. We used to use Win.ini. I mean, you can presumably move to the next generation at some point.  How do you all feel? Do you feel like the registry is something that you want to see there or?  Rafael, are you a fan of the registry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think we all love to hate the registry. But if you try to re-engineer a solution, you end up with the registry all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, for compatibility's sake, if you tried to remove the registry, first of all, you'd be doing it for an artificial reason.  And second thing, you would break compatibility with everything. You would ultimately have to build something ten times as complicated as the registry to make the new stuff compatible with the registry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the registry did not exist, we would have had to invent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and so, you know, so I mean, just to just to spin into the future, what you would the way you're finally going to get rid of it is to is to have a new operating system with a virtualization layer inside of it that runs old, you know, current Windows style applications within it with a with a registry virtualized inside of that thing, which is what, you know, Apple did when they went from OS 9 to OS 10.  They had that compatibility box that served them for a while, but they had, you know, one, one thousandth of the number of Windows programs running and one, one millionth of the number of mission critical enterprise level programs running.  So it was, you know, it was and it was painful for them. And yet, you know, it was painful for them to do, but they were able to pull it off in a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying there's no reason to dump the registry. There's nothing wrong with it.  And there's a strong reason not to keep it for compatibility purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a strong reason to keep it for compatibility purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no reason to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no real reason to get rid of it. You know, you can harden it. You can you can make it easier to recover from damage to it, to to back it up and restore it.  And that's what some of the robustness features that are in Windows 7 are there, you know, to, you know, precisely to just make the make the work around some of the brittleness of the registry, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I notice it is lighter weight in the sense that you could run it on a smaller computer.  Paul was telling me Steve Sienofsky is running on a netbook with a gig of RAM.  Yeah, and I have 12, 512. Is that right? 512. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he had one gig of RAM in a time. Let's not go crazy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But still, a gig is impressive. How do you make how do you I mean, if it's Vista under the hood, how do you make it run on a gig with an atom processor?  And I mean, how do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know people who have Vista running on those systems with with more than acceptable performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, I have I do have an ultra mobile PC that I want to say has a gig of RAM and maybe 512, but in a very slow process or whatever it is.  And Vista was completely unacceptable on that system.  And you're reminding me now I should install 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so is the kernel changed at all?  Are we still seeing the same essentially the same kernel or is that rewritten as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How would you know? I don't know. Yeah, I mean, you guys are experts. I don't know.  This is a this is a touchy subject for the Windows guys. Why is it touchy?  Because people like to equate new versions of things with the new kernel. I want a new kernel. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The kernel is that's how Linux does it. Yeah, that's how Linux does it. New version of Linux means a new kernel basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's version six point one. It's yeah, it's kernel kernel six point one.  The seventh point six eight. It's the seventh version of the kernel. I know that.  So, you know, we've got that going for us. And by the way, that it expires on seven one.  Not coincidental, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can actually if you slice the kernel sideways and count the number of rings in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are seven. All right, I'll drop my question in the pulpy center of the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forget I mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, the kernel there have been one of the things that that, you know,  when it's synopsis talked about in his in his various remarks and when he and I talked about it in the in the brief time that we had to talk one on one.  He says they they did go in and they looked at a lot of the low level code in the kernel saying,  is there you know, is is there an instruction or a semaphore or a you know,  or someplace where it touches the the bios here where we can identify, you know,  a clock cycle or two or ten that we can remove to make it faster.  And each time you do one of those things, it's it's unnoticeable.  But if you can do that a hundred or a thousand times, then it's the sort of thing that you just feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. So maybe that's where some of the performance improvement came.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there's no doubt about it. And I think that's what I was alluding to when I said they've started at the lowest level  and worked all the way up to the parts that you see on the desktop. And since that level of attention to detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of makes sense. I mean, we're at a mature it's a mature operating system.  Vista was, you know, kind of a rewrite. The next step is to clean it up, tidy it up, speed it up.  That's what you would do. That's where you would go.  And you do that probably before you start tagging on some really big new features.  So when you're saying that the platform release was Vista, this is the tune up release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's probably a fair way to put it. A pretty major tune up.  I mean, there's a lot of retooling. You know, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of engineering to tighter tolerances and finish.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now we're also seeing a new UI. But is that just kind of de-rigor?  If you're going to release a new version of Windows, people won't think of it as a new version unless the start button is translucent or something new.  I mean, it's painting the pig. It's painting the pig.  Whatever. That's a nice phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, that came from Steven Sinovsky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? But I mean, obviously you have to do that. Otherwise, customers just don't know the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yes. But not just doing it for doing it's sake. Right.  They're not just painting the pig. This is not just right. In other words, they're not just doing it to do it.  Look, hey, it's flashy and new. I mean, like Ed was saying, they look at every little piece of the OS, not just the stuff you see, but also under the covers and said, how can we make this better?  How can we make this more efficient? How can we make it work more simply?  And that comes through anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking at Rafael's beautiful new task bar and I'm thinking, well, okay, so it's transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you're looking at a screenshot. You were looking at a static screenshot.  And so what that doesn't show you is that on on that screen.  So if you let's let's imagine that you have a browser with five tabs open and you have a copy of Outlook with five message windows open and you have a you know, and you have a word with five documents open.  Right. Yep. So right now, to switch between those, you would use you would use the task bar to find the window that you want.  And then you would click on the task bar icon, which might be grouped.  And then you would switch to that. And if you wanted to open a new program, you would go to the desktop or the start menu or the quick launch bar or or some third party launcher program that you had.  And all of those things would be, you know, a multiple clicks in multiple different places to get them there.  So what they've done with what what they're calling the super bar here is to combine all of the all of the launching and switching features into a single, highly visual, highly efficient process.  You like it.  I well, I like what I saw of it.  I haven't I haven't been able to download Rafael's files so that I can make it work here yet.  But you know, I like I like what I saw of it.  There's a there's a lot that's rational to it.  And there's a lot of analogs to it in other things that I've seen where things that used to take five clicks take two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, kind of a OS 10 like doc interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More than OK, because I've been using the OS 10 doc lately just to to sort of prepare myself for that.  And always 10 uses the doc both as a launcher and as a way to give you a little status indicator, the glowing thing that tells you that thing is running.  And it also gives you a a menu of things where you can switch to to things that are running from there.  The the Windows seven version adds a whole visual dimension to it and also a sort of non procedural dimension to it.  So you put the mouse over that Internet Explorer icon and previews of live previews, not just static snapshots,  but live previews of the five tabs that you have open show up there and you move the mouse over one of those.  And it appears in a window on the screen, move the mouse away and the window goes away.  So the preview becomes the window. And then if you click on it, then then you switch to it.  If you move away from it, you don't switch to it. So it's all very fluid.  And and, you know, with the with the doc or with or with the taskbar and windows, you want to switch to something you have to you sort of you sort of see it there.  And then you click on it and you go to it. And if it wasn't the one that you wanted, well, there you are.  You've got to go back to the dock or the taskbar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This gives you kind of an intermediate way to check that you're looking at the right thing.  Yeah. Rafael, it looks like this this little hack you did is is Microsoft gonna get mad at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm not sure what they can do.  I've made sure I've included no copyrighted code in my little tool. I guess we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could change it. I mean, they could change it to, you know, tomorrow, make it dash Z or something that you need to have in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, oh, no. Well, yes and no.  But I want to, you know, I am totally in awe of what Rafael has done here.  And, you know, and I'm going to be, you know, I'm going to be trying this myself.  Having said that, it is important to point out that the build sixty eight oh one build that we have here was finalized on September 13th.  Oh, wow. And it and it represents a version of the interface that was probably the you know,  the UI portion of it was probably locked down several weeks before that.  So the builds that they were showing at P.D.C., you know, the things that are in the keynote demos and in the individual demos that we saw would have been  at least a month more current than that. And they've been doing a lot of work on that.  So even even unlocking things, you know, as Rafael has done is not necessarily going to give you the experience that you saw in the keynotes.  Right. Right. Not. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what I've noticed here on my seven laptop is that, for example, the quick launch toolbar still it's still there.  They made it quite clear. That's right.  Right. Right. With that arrow peak where you drag your mouse to the corner and all the windows become translucent.  You can see to your desktop that doesn't seem to work at all.  There are various little things there here and there that are missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, the code for that is sort of there. If you right click on that little square, it gives you the two options.  So preview desktop, which would be the arrow peak feature, and then show desktop, which is the old behavior and the one that works in the current build,  you know, in the in the regular UI. So you can see how they were sort of on the way to doing it.  Yep. But that you yeah, you don't get the effect, unfortunately, because the arrow peak effect is actually pretty cool as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Arrow is still there, but now enhanced with some new features. Is that it?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Anything else? We're going to wrap it up because I want to I want to get to the cloud portion too, which I think is important, if not more important.  Anything else you guys want to say about Windows 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should speak about the most important thing that's in Windows, which is, of course, the gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the sidebar isn't on the side anymore. It's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everywhere, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everywhere you want to be. That's kind of Mac-ish too, but OK.  OK, well, which is kind of I never like the sidebar because I don't like having them all there, but you could drag stuff out of the sidebar before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could actually say that this makes the desktop active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm making the sign of the cross right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is the active desktop.  I mean, this is this is this has come to well, this is really come to fruition and done right.  I mean, that was, you know, it this the Windows 7 version of gadgets is to active desktop.  What, you know, Aero is to the Windows 2.1 program manager, you know, right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks cool. And there are now, you know, we've talked before about this, Paul, that there aren't as many gadgets as one would hope.  Maybe they can do something to encourage more gadgetry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I appreciate it. It can only be better than it is now.  I mean, the problem is the number of gadgets. It's the quality of the gadgets.  And I'm actually interested that they're continuing with us in Windows 7 because frankly,  very few of the gadgets that appeared in the Windows Vista timeframe so far have been compelling in any way.  You know, I mean, the the only one I downloaded from a third party was a like a resource monitor type of thing.  You know, it's just really kind of lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'll have to write this up this week because I've got a half a dozen awesome gadgets here, all third parties.  You should, you should, because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, and it's not hard to write gadgets. It's a fairly easy thing to do.  I would like I would imagine that there'd be something you could cultivate and get people to write more of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the collection that's in Windows 7, the collection that's in Windows 7 is unchanged from Windows Vista,  which makes me think that that's one of the things they're going to unveil a whole bunch of real, you know,  I would expect them to do some awesome ones in there and save them till the very, very last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And where are all the Windows Live ones? Right.  Why isn't there some crazy collection of Windows Live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, well, let's get live in just a little bit. I want to talk about the cloud.  I guess a couple more things real quickly about 7 gaming still DirectX.  It's not going to change gaming. It'll be if it's lighter weight, maybe even be better for gaming.  No comment. Yes. Good. Sounds good to me.  OK, that's my thesis. I'm sticking with it. Largely unchanged, unchanged.  Are we going to see what else have people been looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me throw out there that Ultimate Extras completely gone.  UAC's behavior modified, modified greatly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're an administrator, you might not even know that it's that it's there.  And if you're a standard user, it will it.  I've been running a standard and and administrator accounts here.  And even as a standard user, it's you know, I see it far less often.  That's a really good point.  I mean, there's a reason they put UAC in. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is this going to be less secure or are they going to have some magic dust that keeps it from?  I think they might have overstepped their bounds a little on the first one.  They went too far. OK. For a good reason.  You know, they did the right thing, but I think they did it for the right reason.  I mean, I think they're going to have to do it for the right reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think they're going to have to do it for the right reason.  I think they are taking a little bit of a step back because of the sheer volume of the complaints they got.  So any reason that they address security at all?  Is there any reason to think this will be more secure than Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I aside from the UAC stuff, I don't recall much there.  I mean, there are security features, you know, like BitLocker to go or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't think course security is going to be more secure than Vista.  No, it's all evolutionary.  And, you know, they've been continuing to refine address space layout randomization and other geeky features like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But basically the security architecture of Vista has proved itself to be pretty robust.  It is pretty secure. Yeah.  I think people seem very excited about Windows 7.  I mean, my general feeling from reading all the coverage of PTC was that it's a very secure system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think people seem very excited about Windows 7.  I mean, my general feeling from reading all the coverage of PTC was, hey, this is great.  This is the way Windows, the next Windows should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd say N minus one reviewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Who is the guy?  There's one guy.  Paul won't tell me his name.  One guy who's mad at Microsoft because they didn't let him into the reviewers workshop.  Who is this guy?  I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody will say.  The court jester of the Windows world.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We won't bring up any names.  I want to come back, talk a little bit about the cloud.  Also a little later on the show, we're going to talk to PC.  John Hodgman will join us with a rebuttal, I guess.  I don't know.  Maybe he's going to throw money at Vista.  I don't know.  But I do want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting is, of course, the preeminent online meeting company.  If you've used other online meeting software, even that stuff from people you might have  heard of than Redmond, Washington, you're going to want to try GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting makes it simple, makes it easy, makes it fast.  And we've got a 30-day unlimited trial for you.  That's unlimited meetings for the next 30 days at GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Maybe you've tried the other guys.  I just want you to take you two minutes.  You'll be installed.  And then you could throw a meeting anytime, anywhere, much more compelling than a conference  call because it's visual.  The way it works, you send out an invitation ahead of time.  You could just click, create an Outlook email and send it out.  Or while you're on the phone with somebody, you could be talking and say, look, go to  GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  I want to show you this PowerPoint.  I want to show you these documents.  I want to show you the new task bar.  I want to show you, I can, really, you can see it.  It's just like you're there.  You're seeing, they're seeing your computer desktop on their screen.  Very effective way to sell.  By the way, now available for PCs and Macs.  That's a new change.  Very good.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Give it a try.  30 days free.  And by the way, one flat monthly rate that's very affordable makes GoToMeeting the right  choice for your online meetings.  Forget those other guys.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  And we thank them so much for their support.  This week in tech.  So then Microsoft also mentioned Microsoft Stratera, right?  No, no, that's wrong.  Microsoft, Microsoft.  Microsoft Stigmata.  SkyNet.  SkyNet.  Azure.  Was Stratage just a false rumor that they never used that name or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that was the codename if I understood it.  Oh, but they abandoned that.  Azure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Azure.  A-Z-U-R-E.  It means sky blue, right?  So this is computing in the cloud.  How important is this to Microsoft?  Is this strategically the next big business for them or is it just MSN?  I mean, is it just one more side business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if this goes according to plan, this will be a lot of their business.  This replaces Windows and Office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now it's mostly something they can sell alongside on-premise servers,  you know, in the sense that a lot of Azure will be hosted services, right?  That they'll offer all of their servers as hosted services as well.  I think for a lot of companies it makes sense to just let Microsoft handle that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is, they brought in Ray Ozzie to do this presumably, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was his job.  This was, you know, he's the, so in some ways it is a big focus for Microsoft.  Oh, I think it's a huge focus, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was the point of PDC.  Ed, do you agree?  Yeah, I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the, you know, right now there's a, the real challenge for businesses  isn't deploying desktops and it isn't running file servers.  It's making applications that are enabled that allow, you know,  their workers to talk to each other when they're out on the road  or in branch offices and also, and even more importantly,  to customers and partners who are geographically and even globally scattered.  And so if you want to do that now, you've got to, you know,  you've got to either contract out with, you know, somebody for hosting,  you know, for major hosting resources or you've got to build your own data center,  all of which are expensive and fragile and required.  And so the idea behind this is you build one of those applications,  you log on to your account at Microsoft where you're paying who knows what,  and then you upload the thing and boom, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, if John C. Dvorak were here, he would be saying, cloud computing.  What's the difference between that and timeshare?  It's a bad idea.  What happens when the cloud goes away?  I'm just trying to channel him.  Well, what happens when your local server goes away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, at that point you would actually be responsible for it yourself.  I mean, at least in this case, a company that you hopefully trust is storing your applications  or possibly your data up in the cloud for you.  You might as well, you know, in a way, leave it to the experts.  Even as I say that, it sounds vaguely odd,  but I would rather have Microsoft host email than host email here locally.  That doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess we're getting comfortable with this idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google is, Microsoft clearly sees Google as the next big threat.  So if they're going to go after Google, that's how they go after them, right?  Sure.  I mean, they're not going to do search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the interesting thing is, they might do online apps.  No, no, no, they're not going to do search well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there's a soft underbelly to Google, it might be these online apps, this cloud computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Google doesn't have a big corporate sales force.  They don't have any experience delivering service level agreements  that cost millions of dollars with a selling cycle that takes months or years to corporate customers.  And Microsoft does.  So they come in to pick your favorite Fortune 50 or Fortune 100 corporation.  And they go, hey, we can make it so that you don't have to replace all those servers over there.  As they age, you can just take them offline and replace them with these resources  in our globally distributed, redundant, protected, federated data center called Skynet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in this realm, Google may not be the chief competition.  It might be Amazon with their S3 service.  Iraq space is moving into that same space as well.  There may be others doing this.  I guess there's nobody with the cache of Microsoft in the corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google is actually the only company that could compete with this.  I realize Amazon is doing what they're doing, but let's be honest here.  If confronted by the thought of running Microsoft Exchange, let's say, on Google EC2  or running it on Microsoft's cloud platform, which one are you going to pick?  I mean, I think people are going to pick Microsoft.  To have a competitor to Microsoft, you need to have a partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need to have somebody that has a massive data center infrastructure  and somebody that has applications and sales experience.  I think you'd need to have a Salesforce or Oracle combined with a Google or Amazon.  You put those two together.  If you can make the cultures work and if you can actually get that Frankenstein to live and grow,  then you've got something that competes with Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's what happens down the road as things consolidate, as they will naturally over time.  I think that this is...it was confusing.  I can't speak for everyone, but I sat through that keynote with somewhat of a glazed look at my eyes  and then later had a 45-minute briefing specifically about this topic.  I have to say, I still walked out of there a little confused.  It was a second coat of varnish on your glaze.  I have never asked so many questions in a briefing in my life.  In fact, I was that guy and I could feel it.  I just felt annoying.  Then they said, did you get what you wanted out of this?  I said, what, are you kidding me?  What did I want to get out of this?  If it was understanding what you're doing, I guess the answer would have to be no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does Microsoft even understand what they're doing?  That's not clear to me. It really isn't.  I think if they had a coherent strategy, they'd be able to explain it to you,  but I think they haven't agreed on what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think this is a multi-layered hydra of sorts.  There's a lot of stuff going on there.  They've got their live services and live mesh.  On the consumer side, a bunch of these are stuff, but not all of it,  but a lot of it seems to be specifically targeted at the enterprise.  Maybe it helps to think of it as another version of Windows Server,  but one that we don't host ourselves, but one that's hosted and managed and configured for us.  Up in the cloud, we can run applications on it,  but how these things all fit together conceptually, I have to say, I'm still a little confused.  It's something I intend to spend some time on over the next week.  I hope I can come back in a week or two and say, oh yeah, I get it,  but right now, I can't say that, and I am confused by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We all have test accounts here, so we can go up and try this.  I'll be building a couple of applications in Visual Studio tomorrow morning between 7 a.m. and 7.05,  and then deploying them up to the cloud and seeing if I can get Ford Motor Company to start using them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you say after PDC, I mean, look, everybody seems very positive, very upbeat.  PDC seemed to make people feel pretty good about Windows 7, about Microsoft strategy going forward.  Would you say that the end result of PDC is that people are feeling pretty good about where Microsoft's headed,  that they understand where they're headed, they understand what they need to do,  that they're putting the trouble of Vista behind them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, PDC is a developer show.  I would have to say for a large part of Microsoft's so-called ecosystem, partners especially,  this has to be a little unsettling, right?  If this Strata Windows Azure thing takes off, a lot of the way that they make money now...  Their business changes, yeah.  Changes, it goes away.  That's something that was a little bit of an issue, maybe a big issue, depending on who you talk to,  with Microsoft Online Services, which was just three or four very specific products.  Now they're talking about putting everything up in the cloud.  This changes the dynamics between Microsoft and its partners to a very great degree, and it's unclear.  I can assure you they're not feeling fantastic about it.  But I think customers, developers probably to a lesser degree,  people like us who have criticisms or at least opinions about Microsoft,  I think PDC was a positive experience overall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You agree, Ed?  Yes, I do. I think what this showed is a Microsoft that had been...  It wasn't just so much that Vista had problems,  because it was that the process that delivered it practically guaranteed a problematic product.  And I think what they demonstrated at this year's PDC was that they have dramatically changed those processes.  And the product that they delivered coming out of that re-engineering is really good  and should give anybody who's a Microsoft partner some hope that they can really start firing on all cylinders again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent. Some good news. Rafael, you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I absolutely agree.  I can't provide the background that Ed and Paul have, but I'm excited  and I'm confident that Microsoft is going to ship the greatest windows yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? All three of you would say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The greatest windows yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, arguably every version should be the greatest windows yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can think of a couple of exceptions, but we won't belabor that.  If all goes well, it should be better, right? Of course. It's the next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's not just the product itself.  I would argue that, and have argued, that Vista is a fine OS, especially in its current SB1 guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A fine OS is not a recommendation to get people jumping up and down. It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I'm sorry. Well, I'm actually very enthusiastic about Vista.  It's extremely fine.  I was until I saw this. But this is the type of thing where I think people have,  we saw them respond to it in a very positive fashion, and will, I think, out in the general public,  when people see this, I think they're going to respond to it in exactly the right way.  And I think that's what Microsoft really needs.  It's not just to do something that's technically excellent,  but to really excite people in a way that they just haven't in a long, long time.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me put it in these terms. What was the version of Mac OS that was 10.1 or 10.2?  I forget what animals those were.  Panther.  Panther or Jaguar or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jaguar was a big one. Panther was probably the one where everybody said, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. So start with one of those and compare it to Leopard.  And would you say, boy, that one, that Panther really sucked, didn't it?  Because this Leopard is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right. Okay, you're right. That's a fair thing to say.  Put it in terms that I can understand. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  After three, four, or five years of development, which is what we've, you know,  we've had three years since Vista was pretty much locked down to the time when this is going to come out.  In three years of development, you should be able to do some pretty awesome stuff.  Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm excited. I mean, you know, I think in a way, I think people, Vista, I'm not sure why Vista disappointed.  It could have been the long wait.  It could have been the fact that people had compatibility issues, although that happens every time.  But for some reason, the perception was of disappointment with Vista.  And it's been tough for Microsoft to shake that off its heels.  And this may be Windows 7 is what they need to do to go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is exactly what they need to overcome that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whether rightly or wrongly, you feel that Vista was a problem.  There's clearly a perception problem. And this sounds like the way to go.  Yeah, absolutely.  Guys, I really appreciate it. Paul Therotte, of course, the Windows weekly host.  And you can hear from him every Thursday on this network and watch us record the show every Wednesday at live.twit.tv.  We do it at 11 a.m. Pacific. That's 2 p.m. Eastern time.  Thursday. Thursday. Airs Thursday, records Wednesday.  No, no. Airs Friday, records Thursday.  You know I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We record on Thursday and it airs on Friday.  You're right.  You have way too many buttons to push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. I'm going like this. You're absolutely right.  It airs on Friday, but we record at 2 p.m. Eastern and come by on Thursday and say hi to Paul.  And Ed, I hope you'll come by and visit once in a while, too. It's always great to talk to you.  I've known Ed since you and I started doing Dvorak on computers many moons ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be delighted to do it, but don't expect me to remember what day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't remember, so I don't know how you would.  You'll find Ed Bott on ZDNet. He is a blogger there at blogs.zdnet.com slash B-O-T-T.  And of course, look for his great books. And we look forward to talking again very soon.  And I know, Rafael, you're going to be getting to work pretty soon on the next edition of Inside Windows or Windows Secrets or whatever it is we're going to call it this time.  Will be Windows Secret 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows 7 Secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Better even than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows 6.1 Secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or 7 Secrets about Windows 6.1.  Actually, that'll be the first secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It ain't 6.1. It's a secret.  WithinWindows.com is Rafael's blog. Great to have you on. You did a great job, Rafael. I appreciate it.  Thanks, Leo.  Good to talk to you. Thank you all for being here. I'm going to hang up on you guys and introduce you to another character.  This is as we get ready for the second segment of This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good evening, boing-boingers, and happy Halloween to you.  Tonight is the haunted night, night when we dress up our children in dark clothing and send them out to wander the streets alone and thus remind them of their mortality.  It is the perfect night for me to give you, at last, my tasting notes on crystal-head vodka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're glad to. That is John Hodgman. You know him, of course, as PC from the great Mac switcher ads.  You might have seen him with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show.  And of course, he's on stage from time to time with his friend Jonathan Colton. Let me see if I can get through the magic of Skype.  Hi, John.  Are you there?  I am here. Thank you very much.  Oh, thank you very much.  How are you today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't tell you how nervous I am to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't be nervous in the least. In fact, before we talk, I want to do my audible commercial because I wish the new book were on audible. Are you recording it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shall happen. Jonathan Colton and I will record it after we complete this book tour. That way we will know what to say on the audiobook.  So is Jonathan part of the new book?  Well, you know, he went on tour with me for the last book and we he would play guitar. Right. And he dressed up.  The furry old lobster. Yeah, exactly. Yes. And he and he played the part of my feral mountain man companion.  I claimed to have found him wandering raised by woodland creatures in the woods of southern Connecticut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, with that beard, you're not far off, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know. Well, that was the entire idea. I mean, he was just asking to be branded as a feral mountain man.  Maybe he wanted that secret.  Grow a big grizzly Adam's beard. That's what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is in the in the recording of the areas of my expertise playing furry lobster and playing along with you.  And I have to say, I'm listening along to the book and and all of a sudden there's Colton and it really it just was fun.  I mean, it's some sort of weird geek universe colliding.  This is our recommendation. We Audible has been a sponsor of the show for almost two years now.  We love Audible books. Oh, kidding. Oh, yeah.  And I'm thrilled that you recorded this yourself read by the author adapted for audio on six or more CDs, actually.  These three CDs. I think once you got to the hobo names, it kind of ballooned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hobo name contained the hobo names are all in one single CD.  They take up an entire CD. Seven hundred or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So well, it's seven hundred. Yes. Yeah. Not even we owe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We owe you a hundred because in the paperback we I added another hundred hobo names by popular demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was the session like when you actually recorded seven hundred hobo names?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Torturous. I can only imagine. Yeah.  Well, here's the thing. In my book, for those people who haven't read it, my first book, the areas of my expertise  and indeed my second book, More Information Than You Require, which was just published, are both almanacs of trivia,  much like the old Guinness Book of Records or Ripley's, believe it or not, or Book of Lists,  with the exception that all of the amazing true facts in my book are made up by me.  And I included quite a bit of information about the hobos of the Great Depression and their ways and their culture  and their brief takeover of the United States government.  I also talked about the seven hundred.  And it seemed like a very funny joke at the time because my friend Sam Potts, who designed both books long ago,  had given me a book called Seven Hundred Sandwiches, which was hilarious to me.  I mean, that's exactly what the book was. And you would just flip through the book and I'm like, yep, more sandwiches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peanut butter and jelly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was published sometime in the 30s, I guess, during the sandwich craze of the 30s.  People couldn't get enough of them or could at least they at least required seven hundred.  And so that always stuck with me. So how about seven hundred hobo names?  And this will be a funny joke because it was it was the closest I could get, I think, to a literary site gag,  because the idea was you would start reading the seven hundred hobo nicknames and they were like Frypan Jack and Tennessee Slim  and Giant Leathery Wings Roland and what have you. It got pretty esoteric and weird.  I listed all the skexies from the dark crystal in there because I got going through some dark phases where I was just like, now hobo name three hundred ninety six.  And I don't think I put a Leo Laporte in there, though. I probably should.  And and, you know, when you get into hobo name four hundred, you think you're going mad.  Yeah. Because you have another three hundred to go. My math is it's just it's madness.  Painful. And when I finally got it done, but they all had to be distinct because the whole point of the gag  wasn't that someone would sit down and read them all, but that you would have them all listed.  And then when you saw them, you would like he didn't actually do this. He's going to start repeating them eventually.  And then, you know, I had to prove that they never repeat, even as they go on into the margins of the rest of the book, because there's really no room for them.  Oh, my God. So when we got all of that done, I was like, I'm glad that was a funny idea, but it really did push me to levels.  I really felt like I was on my own in the universe. Like, yeah, no one's going to like it's a long march.  It's a long march. Yeah. Anytime. Well, you know, ask anyone who's written down seven hundred Hobo nicknames and they'll tell you the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a universal experience. But then when we get to the website, it's a website. Yeah, it's a print thing. It makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. It certainly it makes sense as a print thing. That's a good point, Leo. You're right.  It made sense from the beginning as a print thing. It never makes sense until it's done. Do you know what I'm saying?  And then and then, you know, we're just I was trying to figure out what to put on the website areas, my expertise dot com.  Now your catch all website for all things pertaining to either book. Yes.  And and I said to Jonathan, let's you know, we should do we should probably include a reading of some kind.  Let's drive people crazy and do the the seven hundred Hobo names. And he was game.  But I didn't realize that we weren't going to drive people crazy. We were going to drive us crazy. Right.  Because the idea was we would sit in his what was then his office, now his children's room, and we would record it on his computer while he played.  It was a very low tech operation. We had a single microphone and he had his guitar out and he played Big Rock Candy Mountain, the great Hobo anthem of our time.  Yeah. Behind me over and over and over and over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many names per iteration of Big Rock Candy Mountain can you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to leave that to your listeners. I would like to know the answer to it.  And I'm not really interested in finding out myself.  So I'm going to crowdsource this one. People should go to Audible and buy the audiobook because they can hear and that at all seven hundred Hobo names on that on that cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that is that is that track on the Audible? Is that the one you recorded in Jonathan's study?  Did you think we would do it again? No, no, you're right. Of course. What was I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it was, you know, nothing was looped and it was all a single take.  So you hear me often going, excuse me while I have to take a drink of water or like attempt to kill myself.  Needles in the eyes, actually. It was it was, you know, and the idea was to make it sound like the numbers stations.  Do you know what I mean when I say the numbers stations? Yes.  Weird by stations that on the on the shortwave band and on the sort of ends of the AM dial, particularly in Europe, where you just hear a voice speaking numbers and no one knows what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They think it's it's like a spy code of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And there's a great there's a beautiful compilation of it available on the Internet.  You can buy of just recordings that have been amassed of all these different strange broadcasts.  No one knows the origin. I'll have to look it up at some point when we take a break because that would be my audible request.  We need a book of that. And I think it's amazing.  You know what we should do? We should take we should take those recordings of those weird numbers stations and we should do a transcription and publish it as a book.  There you go. That would that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard to think of anything with more drama than 700 Hobo names, but maybe you found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about 700 Mole Man names? Is that is that book?  And their occupations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, I would stop.  This could this could go on too long, but do get that areas of my expertise read by John Hodgman.  Hodgman abridged. I don't understand why abridged if you're leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were certain in my books, there are lots of tables and charts.  Yeah, there are one or two tables and charts that did not just did not work in the audio format.  You think we have a lovely Robin Goldwasser reading all of the the the table headings and stuff.  Right. I just I mean, I would say there are only one or two things that didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you leave in 600 Hobo names, you think that you might.  I don't know. Anyway, the Hobo names are in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are in the audio version of the areas of my expertise.  Yes, I do.  And and the 700 Mole Man names will be in the audio version of my new book.  More information than you require. But right now they exist only on paper, where, as you say, they make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I was maybe I was maybe going a little too far with that.  Do your commercial for Audible. I will. Why not? Audible.com. It's simple.  It wasn't one long commercial for. Get the book.  The Areas of My Expertise by John Hodgman. You can get it for free right now.  Going to audible.com slash twit to. In fact, you get two credits.  So you get another book as well.  I wish the new book were were available on Audible, but it will soon.  So join Audible now for the time when you can get it on Audible, a great resource for audio books of all kinds.  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit to invite you to visit audible dot com.  John, I'm so pleased to talk to you. You know, it's an enormous pleasure for me, I have to say.  I'm flattered that you would say that. But but but you're the guy.  I mean, The Daily Show, you're you're right. You're a writer first, though, aren't you?  Isn't that isn't that what you consider yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's back when I was a freelance magazine writer.  I had been I had been briefly a professional literary agent.  And then I became a freelance magazine writer.  And it was one of those lazy afternoons when I was lying on the couch doing nothing and watching Thunderbirds on tech TV,  which I had never watched before. I mean, I'd seen Thunderbirds before, but I hadn't seen on tech TV.  You know, this is an ancient history. Yeah.  And then I saw the screensavers and I saw you and Patrick there.  And I was like, what is this fantastic show? I had no idea what you were talking about.  For the most part, I'm not as I'm not as up to the minute and technology as Jonathan Colton is.  The irony is that I turned to the Feral Mountain Man when I need briefing on any technology, frankly.  And I called him up immediately. I'm like, you have to watch this program because I felt it was obviously it was a live program  and it was just so genial and fun. And there was such a spirit of camaraderie to it that I just became hooked.  Oh, you're so kind. That's true. And then, you know, everything else happened.  And then I then I picked you up on the podcast and I've been listening ever since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just thrilled you and you and Colton are neighbors, are you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We now live in the same utopian commune that is ruled by children called Park Slope, Brooklyn.  Park Slope. But we we we went to college together. Oh, I didn't know that. At Yale University.  Oh, we're all blues. Exactly.  So you see the world government conspiracy in action again. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Skull and bones. I have to leave now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was never I was never a bones, never tapped.  Oh, when were you when were you at Yale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, between 1989 and 1994.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so you're much younger than I. So we missed each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Considerably younger than you are. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was there in the 70s. That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right after they added women. Did they have all those buildings at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of them were still there. Yeah. OK, good.  Yeah, I thought maybe they built them just for me. Just for you.  Isn't that the experience of every college student? Look what they made for me.  I'm going to try to destroy it as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just my generation. The funny thing at Yale, I'm sure you admired it,  is these little gargoyles made during the Depression by crazy Italian craftsmen.  Yes. They're all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Students being men being arrested by the police and that sort of crazy stuff in the library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you got just stained stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, it was wandering through the stacks of Sterling Memorial Library  that really sort of inspired my books to a large degree.  You know, this supposed repository of complete world knowledge  and the completely esoteric weird things that you would find in that library.  Going up and down that little almost manual elevator.  Did you ever go in this high speed elevator? Yeah.  Going down onto the mezzanine floors that the regular elevator didn't serve.  It's like wandering through a bizarre fantasy.  It was. We used to see.  You find a weird literary journal that would talk about somebody that you knew once.  And like, wow, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We tried to stay in there after hours several times.  Because there's something kind of spooky and mysterious about the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever go to the roof where they have the miniature Sterling Memorial Library on top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I heard about that. I've never seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear that it's true.  It's a lot.  It has another little version of itself on top of another little version of itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how long does it? How far does that go? I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's an infinite recursion, isn't it?  I guess it is.  I hope so. Otherwise, what are they?  With an endowment like that, they better make it a damn frackle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the point if not?  So how did you get involved with the Apple Switch commercials?  Because I think that's really, I mean, people are your...  You have huge fan club, but those put you on top with the world.  I mean, everybody sees those.  That must have changed your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had been a freelance magazine writer.  And then I had this idea.  Someone said, you know, you should write a book of trivia because you love that stuff.  And I said, you're absolutely right. I do love that stuff.  But there have been lots of books of trivia.  So why don't I try to put my own stamp on things by writing books of fake trivia?  Right.  So, you know, I mean, the proof of concept idea that I had that made me want to sell it was,  you know, instead of like the book of lists, sort of nine presidents who, you know, had asthma or whatever,  I would have the nine presidents who had hooks for hands.  And just talk about it in a very straight face.  This became your medjay.  And so I called up this editor and I said, let's go.  Nine presidents that have hooks for hands. You've got to see the possibilities.  I like my idea better.  But eventually I ended up writing that first book of fake trivia called The Areas of My Expertise.  Which I love.  And I may remind your listeners that I have just completed a second one not to get ahead of ourselves called  More Information Than You Require, which we can talk about later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same idea there as the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my proposal for the second book was almost exactly this long.  More of the same, but twice as long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they snapped it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my concern was because at that point, you know, I had gone on The Daily Show with John Stewart to promote  the Areas of My Expertise, which changed the fortunes of that book and my life dramatically to go on television.  Because you know what? Apparently people watch television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And there's something about you. You're kind of cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's very kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you are. There's a certain something about your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's been drinking the Crystal Head vodka now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that Crystal Head looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very good vodka, I have to say.  You know, I don't want to digress, but my dream in life is to sit down with Dan Aykroyd and a bottle of Crystal Head vodka at the House of Blues in Mandalay Bay and just say, Dan, what the hell?  What are you doing here?  You know the whole story behind the Crystal Head vodka?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I watched his video on the site. I mean, it kind of goes on and on. I don't think I've completed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, you have to watch the whole thing. It's really the 700 hobo names of vodka commercials.  You go into a long period where...  Because, you know, it is either the most wonderful deadpan joke in the world or it is the most earnest endorsement of a paranormal vodka in the world or both. And it's brilliant all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it when suddenly he's in the bar and there's Crystal Head vodka. I mean, stacked to the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what it's like in Canada now, I think.  And I only say this, you know, I only would plug a product if I loved it, whether it be Apple or Crystal Head vodka or my own books or Jonathan Polton or Twit or Munchcast or whatever.  But I say I hope that it is understood because I don't doubt that on some somewhere Dan Aykroyd will hear this, that I say this with all affection for Dan Aykroyd.  He's a genius and a hero of mine. And I would just love to get into the House of Blues with him in Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas with some Crystal Head vodka and just suss it out and just get to the bottom of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can... Let's arrange that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I digressed from the story, didn't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine. I forgot even what the question was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pick up anywhere at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The night before I went on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, I would have been very happy to be a fake book of fake trivia writer for the rest of my life.  Indeed, as I will be, as I suspect.  And then I went on the show and they very nicely asked me if I would come back and do some more comedy on the show.  And I thought that they were joking.  But now after two years and change of being the resident expert on the show and sort of the fake authority and fake trivia master on the show, I think they were not joking.  And soon after, in 2006, after I'd been on the show just for a few months, I got a call asking if I would want to audition for the series of ads.  And so I said, of course, for two reasons.  One, because I've been a Mac user since 84.  Really?  I had a brief period in the wilderness in the 90s when I was working in publishing and I was doing some sideline writing and I had a Windows machine.  Let us not speak of it.  But I've been a big fan of Mac for years and years and I've been a big fan of the advertising too for years and years.  So I thought, can't go wrong there.  But mainly I was just curious as to why they would be interested in seeing me.  I figured it had something to do with The Daily Show, but it was really very much out of the blue.  And I thought, well, you know what, I'll go in for the audition because it's something new in my life.  And, you know, I won't get the job, but at least I'll have an interesting story to tell Leo Laporte someday on his most popular podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to plug me.  It really is.  It's okay.  So what was the first one you did?  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Sneezing Fit.  The one virus.  It was called Virus.  That was the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me play this one because we remember this with Faunus.  I do, in fact.  Let me stop it so we get the audio.  And had you met Justin Long before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had met him the day before.  The day before?  Yeah, but we hit it off terrifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, I'm a Mac.  And I'm a PC.  Action! Action! Action!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zuntite, you okay?  No, I'm not okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have that virus that's going around.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, you better stay back. This one's a doozy.  That's okay. I'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. Do not be a hero.  I'll ask you.  There are 114,000 known viruses for PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  PCs, not Macs.  So, just kidding.  If you feel like that, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, there are a couple things that I'd like to say about that.  Okay.  I think that it probably was the sneeze that got me the job on the second.  I think so because I could sneeze pretty good.  It was very effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as I say, I was not a trained actor when I got that job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Had you been practicing sneezing for other purposes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say it again, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Had you been practicing sneezing for other purposes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do it sometimes naturally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I just wonder how your sneeze was so realistic if you were not an actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually had to redub some of those sneezes.  Now, think about it.  I had to go into ADR and do some re-sneezing.  But I really, I mean, you know, it was really at that moment in the audition.  I had gone to the audition and I realized they didn't want to see me.  They wanted to see everyone on the planet.  Because I went to the audition and everyone I had ever met in performing circles was there.  And I kind of went to the audition to find out why they had called me in the first place.  And the person who was running the audition looked at me after I did my little read and said,  Who are you again and why are you here?  I'm like, I was hoping you could tell me.  I had no idea.  But when the second audition happened, I met some of the folks from the agency.  And in particular, I met Phil Morrison, who's the director of the ads.  And he also directed an amazing movie called June Bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wonderful movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's such a lovely guy.  And he sort of set me at ease by saying, you know, we saw you on The Daily Show.  And that's how you got your name in the hat.  And then I had to read the sneezing one.  And I at that moment realized, like, you know, I kind of have a chance to stop treating this like a weird vicarious adventure and start treating this like a real thing.  And it's going to happen with the sneeze.  Like, either I'm going to sell the sneeze and put myself at risk of getting the job and my life changing.  Right.  Or I'll hold back on the sneeze and, you know, sort of just remain sort of at arm's length from the whole thing and not get the job and then have a story to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting insight that you knew that that sneeze was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just had to, you know, sometimes you just have to sneeze real hard like you like you're really sneezing.  And then after the sneezing, I had to do some human beatboxing, which I don't mind telling you I'm very good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I have mild 1989 era proficiency.  Can I hear a little?  And it just goes on like that.  That's about all I can do.  I'm not really that good at it.  I'm not Blake from American Idol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like you had a little fit there or something going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I didn't get to work up very much, did I?  Want to hear me fake sneeze?  Achoo! Achoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, so at some point you realize this is a fork in the road in my life.  And it sounds like there was a little bit of trepidation about maybe becoming the television celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, I had and still do have a very happy life as a writer for at the time for magazines.  And then I was doing The Daily Show.  I had radio full and happy life and in particular, The Daily Show had just started in my life.  And frankly, that was about all of the sort of life changing upside down world is take.  You know what I mean?  But I was just like, I'm ready to just sort of get used to this new life and not take it another step further.  But, you know, this was a chance.  And I realized that, you know, I probably still wouldn't get the job even if I sneezed really good.  But you don't stand there.  You don't stand there in life and not sneeze real good.  You know, just because you're afraid.  So I sneezed real good.  I beatboxed better than I did now.  That was fine.  Maybe I got the job in spite of the human people.  And then I would say, you know, a couple of weeks passed and then, you know, we had some more conversations and they offered me the job.  And after they offered me the job, I was on a plane within 36 hours.  Wow.  And in a fitting right off the plane.  And that's where I met Justin for the first time.  And we really hit it off.  You sent me the next day.  The next day we were shooting that ad that you played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You sent me an email, which I never responded to.  I deeply apologize.  I just missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sent a lot.  You sent me an email and I didn't respond.  Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're both too famous to answer our emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But you said, thank you for saying those nice words the other week regarding me, John Hodgman, as a fan of you, Leo Laporte, dating back to the early screensavers days, et cetera, et cetera.  I am moved to say something on behalf of my friend and fellow consumer electronic device named Justin Long.  Rumors of whose departure from the big white room were, as you know, and this was when we were talking about this on Mac Break Weekly.  A couple years ago, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, since 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bogusly swirling around at the exact moment he and I were shooting another round of them.  I am someone who had never acted professionally before those ads were not for Justin's humor, timing, and generosity I would have been lost.  You give him a lot of credit.  He says, you said he's doing more work than I am on these ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he has to exercise a lot of restraint.  I mean, I'm the buffoon.  So the sort of broader I go, that's an acting term, by the way.  I just learned it.  Very good.  You know, like I'm a ham.  So the weirder I get, you know, that's OK.  But, you know, Justin is naturally a very, very funny guy.  And he's he's doing a job that's very subtle in those ads.  And I think the sneezing one is a really good example because from the beginning we were working together really well and we liked each other an awful lot.  And as I'm falling with the sneezing, he takes the handkerchief away from me.  Oh, my goodness.  And keeps it.  And keeps it. And it's this beautiful little ballet of haha there.  And that was him.  And he just knew exactly it was like we knew exactly what to do with that handkerchief from the beginning.  And you're not going to see that necessarily unless I get on.  Let me play it. Let me play it again.  I'm not going to see it on the radio either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they get there watching some of them.  Oh, I see. I apologize.  So I'll play it for him.  And those who are watching the video can see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  14000 known viruses for PCs, PCs, not Macs.  He takes it, blows your nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I got a crash.  If you feel like that don't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's left holding that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it is absolutely magic.  And every one of those ads works brilliantly.  Many have pointed out that you're the sympathetic character that in fact these ads for Apple products make people like PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that, you know, the character is I, you know, I always imagined him as a guy who, you know, was just not very aware of himself.  Right.  And as the computer, because he's a computer, he's not a person, as the computer who has this massive amount of market share, maybe managed to sort of stop seeing his own flaws to some degree.  And is actually in that room, you know, because he thinks he's helping the Mac out.  He's going to give him some pointers on how to be a computer and and constantly sort of trips all over himself and is flustered with his inability to, you know, and so that means I think that's I think that there are lots of people in the world who feel that way.  You know, and and I think he's a sympathetic.  Oh, he's very.  Yeah.  And, you know, all the villains are always the more interesting.  Yeah.  Characters to play, you know, so that was all.  But I'll tell you, you know, it helps somebody who if you've never acted before, right, and you need to act.  Here's a little tip.  Yes.  And you need to act sick.  Yes.  Like you have a terrible virus, for example.  I following backwards 20 or 30 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you're landing on in something soft, I presume.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I was landing on a I was landing on a, you know, a mat, a pretty heavy, heavy mat.  It did not hurt me.  Right.  You are sending like all the blood in your body to your head in each fall.  And then to give you an idea of just how like how surreal the whole experience was.  I mean, this was, again, first day of shooting.  And, you know, this is a stripped down production is just two guys in a white room.  But there are a lot of people who are helping.  And because time was of the essence and everything else, like they assigned two guys to pick me up every time.  So I would fall down.  Two guys would immediately grab me by the shoulder.  Put me back up again, like I was some kind of proper machine.  And it was amazing.  I was like, OK, let's go again.  Here we go.  And then by the by the eighth or ninth take or whatever, you know, I felt pretty stuffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many how many how many ads do you do in one day?  Do you do a whole bunch of them?  Yeah, quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quite a few.  I would say.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do all of them make it to air or there are some that just don't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there there aren't.  I think that we shoot quite a few more than than actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So someday we may have the basement tapes of the switch ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suspect that that might happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to see some of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there we do.  We do sort of versions, variations on a theme.  Oh, so all interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not a hardwritten script.  There's some improv going on.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we'll do a number of scripts, but the scripts themselves sort of revolve around a theme.  But we're talking about, you know what I mean?  And they'll pick the ones that work the best.  Your favorite.  And then very rarely, Justin and I will ad lib line or whatever.  But that will make it in.  But that doesn't happen.  I can't even think of one where that happened.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your favorite.  Do you have a favorite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I kind of liked Out of the Box, which is an early one where we're both in boxes  and Justin leaps right out and is ready to go.  And I confess sort of sadly that the rest of me is in some other boxes somewhere.  This is spoken as a true Mac fan.  I'm a PC.  Ready to get started?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, not quite.  Got a lot to do.  What's your big plan?  I might make a whole movie or maybe create a website, try out my built-in camera.  I can do it all right out of the box.  So what about you?  Well, first I got to download those new drivers and I got to erase the trial software that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  came on my hard drive.  Sweet.  And I've got a lot of manuals to read.  You know, it sounds like you have a lot of stuff to do before you do any stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm just going to get started because I'm kind of excited.  Let me know when you're ready.  Actually, I'm going to go get ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the rest of me is in some other boxes.  So I'll meet up with you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good you didn't have to do that leap out of the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you know, I was doing a lot of phony calisthenics in there and they did not use  the take where I used my asthma inhaler, which I was hoping for.  But it would kind of break the, you know, because a computer would never use an asthma  inhaler.  But it's very funny.  Yeah.  Believe me, I've gotten a lot of laughs out of strategic deployment of the asthma inhaler  in my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you just keep one in your pocket for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for breathing, first of all.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you actually use it.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, it could prop to have though, too, even if you didn't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  How do you think I became a geek?  It's not because I could run a jump real good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There always does seem to be asthma at some point in there.  Do you have kids yourself, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do indeed.  How old are your kids?  I have a six year old and a three year old.  That's wonderful.  For reasons of privacy, I don't say their names out loud.  That's fine.  I've heard of them only as Haj Mina and the younger one is Haj Manila.  You can read about Haj Mina in my first book because I talk about how I'm going to write  a book about being a parent next.  But then in my new book, More Information Than You Require, I reveal that I forgot to  write that book.  And also because I'm now a famous minor television personality, I don't really have time to write  all those books.  I'm hoping my three year old son will pick up the quill and follow my footsteps, presuming  that they give them enough time to do so in boarding school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've shipped them off already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a lot to take care of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All that crystal head vodka for one.  Do they see the ads?  Do they have a thought about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Of course they do.  I think they tend to be amused by them.  Like everyone in the world, they like the pizza box one quite a bit.  But I think, I don't know, I can't imagine what it's like to see your parent on television.  I mean, I think it gets very normal very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.  My kids, basically at that age, they said, just put the cartoons back on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Makes sense.  Why?  Because you're turning on the TV going, look at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at daddy.  Yeah.  They said, can you put the cartoons back on, please?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's in here?  It's a strange life.  And I talk a lot about it.  And because when I sat down to write my second book of fake trivia, there's a lot of fake  trivia in my new book of fake trivia.  There's a lot of like how to rid your house of common household pests like mice and ants  and Scottish terriers.  There's a lot about how to tell the future by looking at the spleen of a pig and that  sort of thing.  There's a lot about what to look for when you're buying a computer from a street vendor.  Well, that's an old Jonathan Colton story that I sort of discussed.  Jonathan Colton actually in New York one day was walking around the Upper West Side where  we both lived for some time.  And he was telling me how he saw a woman go up to a guy who was selling a bunch of garbage  on the streets, which you would see sometimes in New York City.  You'd have a blanket out and there'd be some old video cassettes and some old CDs and some  old books.  And then there was some old laptop of some kind.  And the laptop was clearly in bad shape and the screen had a crack right down the middle.  And the woman was saying, well, I'm not sure if I should buy this computer.  And the guy was saying to her, according to Colton, of course, no, no, no, no, it's fine.  It's fine.  All it needs is a program.  And I love that story so much.  So in my book, I talk about how Jonathan told me that story.  Of course, I understood exactly what the problem was there.  A lot of casual consumers don't understand computer lingo like a program.  So that's going to scare her off.  You need to tell her in ordinary language.  What it really needs.  What a program really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is a bunch of b**bs and boops.  So I can't wait to read this new book.  It's available at Amazon and of course bookstores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And all your local chain and independent bookstores, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And have you been doing a book tour on this?  I see that you're going to Washington State in a couple of days and then Portland, San  Francisco on the 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Colton has been in Europe.  Right.  Well, in England and Ireland and Scotland.  And he's just getting back right now.  So I've been touring by myself in Chicago and lots of other fun places.  But now, starting later this week, we will be touring the West Coast together.  And it shall be fantastic, I dare say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to be in San Francisco on the 10th and the 11th.  Where can I see you?  Because I'm coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see you.  So first we'll be in Seattle on the 6th at Town Hall.  Then we'll be in Portland as part of the Wordstock Literary Festival in Portland, Oregon.  Then San Francisco, the 10th.  City Arts and Lectures with Dave Eggers.  Oh, fantastic.  That may be sold out.  But take a look.  But certainly we'll be at Book Passage in Corte Madera on the 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's my good friend Elaine Petracelli.  I know that well.  We'll go down there.  Wonderful bookstore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then LA on the 13th at the Echoplex BookSoup.  All the details are available.  BookSoup is the bookstore down there.  But it's going to be off-site at a place called Echoplex somewhere in Silverlake or Echo Park  or something in LA.  Okay.  And those will be the four big shows.  And all the details can be found on areas of my expertise.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the web design.  Who did the design for you?  This is just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a designer named Don Cittarella.  Era 404 Designs.  I was introducing him to my very smart and wonderful editor, Sean McDonald.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it because you have an areas of my expertise theme and you have more information  than you require theme.  So you can reset the theme depending on which book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by theme we're talking about colors.  That's all.  The areas of my expertise was in beautiful blue and orange.  And the new book of course is in what Don Cittarella termed chocolate and pews.  Is that pews?  I've always wondered.  Let's talk to Don Cittarella about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks more like kind of a mustard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think there are lots of other very descriptive terms you could use.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a father of small children I actually have some thoughts about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Catch you on Twitter as Hodgman.  H-O-D-G-M-A-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So DGMAN is my handle on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And is this ad for Hodgman's Macintoshes actually real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is real.  Hodgman, it turns out when I first got online back in 1997 I did what everyone else did  is I Googled Bruce Campbell.  And that led me to Bruce Campbell and the whole other story.  But the other thing I did of course was Google my own name.  And apparently what I did not know is in Framingham, Massachusetts there is a very old maker of  fishing gear and waders called Hodgman.  And apparently at some point they made Macintoshes with a CK meaning the outerwear, the raincoats.  And someone found for me this whole this old ad for Hodgman's Macintoshes, presumably  the Hodgman outerwear company and Macintoshes meaning the raincoats because they're certainly  not talking about computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you've been associated with Find Mac since 1880.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's when the ad dated back to.  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really wonderful.  John, it's such a pleasure to talk to you.  I can't wait to read the new book.  More information than you require.  I also can't wait to listen to it.  So get cracking.  Have you started recording?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, when we're done the book tour and we've sort of figured out how to perform it and  what the best parts are and that sort of thing.  We'll go into this is what we did with the areas of my expertise as well and really try  to get that book tour experience down onto the scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought when Jonathan shows up, it just really it was a wonderful part of the book.  But the whole book is just fun to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thank you very much.  You know, we'll have lots of fun with the audio version and then the paperback version  and then the, I don't know, deluxe coffee table version, the fold out version.  You should note, I want to note that we never did a page a day version of the areas of my  expertise. And that really burned me.  That's exactly what it's meant to be.  That's where the money is, of course.  Sure. And so in my new book, More Information Than You Require,  it is a page a day calendar as well.  I've included the date on every page as well as a fascinating fact that did not happen on that  date because I made it up.  So that way you can enjoy my book as a book or as a page a day calendar, just tear out the  pages as you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, as somebody who actually wrote an almanac with day and date information for every  page, I wish I'd thought of that make it up thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  I don't think it makes it any easier.  You still have to type the words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still it's still an exercise and scraping around your own brain.  It's a nightmare.  It is. It's a nightmare.  Yeah, it's a nightmare sitting around and doing exactly what you love for your living.  How are we so cursed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How did that? How did that awful thing happen?  How did you get out of the pizza box?  Just I'm just curious. I don't understand how that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the physics of the pizza box.  Yeah.  Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you reveal that or is that a is that a top secret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, we shot it at the same time, but with the cameras shooting at different levels  and I was standing up and there was a pizza box built around my head, which happens all  the time anyway.  But you're not, you're not, you're not in the floor.  And that right.  And we had different eye lines.  And then when they composited it, they, they shifted me down and, and, and Justin up so  that we matched.  I see a lot of Hollywood magic going on.  It is magic.  It's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  And I hope we haven't spoiled it for anybody telling them the secrets behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that they probably figured out that I was not smashed up into a pizza box.  They figured there had to be a hole involved somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you were in the floor.  I don't know.  I just thought that was what it was going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't the floor, but the floor was higher.  It was a higher floor.  A higher floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they, do they shoot those on white or is that, is that a green screen?  How, what are you shooting on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they shoot them on white.  They shoot them on big white.  They shoot it on a white cyclorama, which is to say it is a, it is basically half of  a sound stage with floor and ceiling all the way up, you know, 80 feet is painted white  and the floor slopes up to the ceiling so that you have that illusion.  No edges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, that's how they do green screen and blue screen as well.  Yes.  But in this case it's white and it's really quite vertiginous.  We use about, you know, I would say we stand on about 5% of the white that's out there.  Wow.  And it's really amazing.  You just walk and walk, walk back and you feel like you go out forever.  That's very cool.  Someday I will disappear there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just walk off distance instead of walking off in the sunset, walk off into the white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then, you know, you can read all about my remarkable transition into a famous minor  television personality in my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really?  You talk about it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Well, I mean, it was, you know, as I sat down to write the fake trivia book, I realized,  you know, my life has changed a lot and I'm telling jokes from a different point of view.  And even if they're all sort of phony jokes, you know, in my first book, I had a list of  movies and television shows in which I had made cameo appearances because that was  ridiculous.  Like, why would a tweety former professional literary agent ever be in like the Muppet  show or the Muppet movie, I should say, or, you know, all the other fantastic claims  that I made.  And then by the time I was writing the second book, I was sort of writing the same style  of jokes and I realized it didn't.  It could be true.  Because I was, you know, I really realized it when I was sitting at a desk.  I do a lot of roles where I wear glasses and sit behind a desk and I was sitting behind  a desk wearing glasses in front of Tina Fey making Baby Mama, that movie where I played  the doctor.  Right.  And I was like, this is exactly what I was describing in my first book.  This is actually happening.  You know, life is getting more bizarre than I am able to admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you have a very good career doing these kinds of roles.  I think we'll see you in a lot of films.  We shall see.  Are you getting a lot of calls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, sometimes people need someone who wears glasses and sits behind a desk.  It's a small group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a niche.  Ben Stein is now getting a little on, you know, somebody's got to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope that I can be the new George Plimpton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  Without the football stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're at minus football stuff because I don't even know the rules to football, but  everything else.
