Start time: 308.78
End time: 331.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  especially since Spotify broadcasts all of our Twitter programming which is nice that's a new  feature I think Spotify wisely realized that depending on music labels for your business  is probably a long-term not a great plan yeah so they've added content from podcasts and I think  that's nice and other other internet programming including video but I think I think that I mean

Start time: 331.72
End time: 335.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right now I still find Apple music a little confusing you know just there's a lot a lot

Start time: 336.06
End time: 343.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people don't even know they think it's like what is it is it iTunes is it what is it yeah

Start time: 343.28
End time: 431.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  unfortunately that's I mean that's the biggest problem is that it's at least at the desktop  it's built into the iTunes app I feel like what they should do at some point is do what they did  with the photos app and and do what they've done with some of the other things and separate it out  so if you want to have iTunes as your kind of you know media management place to you know get files  on your iPhone and do updates and that stuff that's fine but separate all of the Apple music  stuff into its own app if the interface there's a lot there you know they've got a lot going on but  I find the for you section to be fantastic I love Spotify I've been a Spotify user since I think two  years before it officially came to the United States is there anything Apple music does that  Spotify doesn't do yes the recommendations are significantly significantly better on Apple music  I find the for you section is really good I think that a lot of the curated playlists they make are  a lot better than the curated playlists Spotify makes that said I do miss being able to search  for playlists that other people have created so if I want to see that someone you know made a  playlist of all the songs and Mad Men I could do that on Spotify I can't do that on Apple music  but I do find the recommendations I get from Apple music of what to listen to what new artists are  coming out things that I might like deep cuts from artists that maybe I haven't listened to in a  while I find that to be a lot better I find I like beats one I don't mind the radio station I don't  love all the day-to-day programming not that I have to but I like a lot of the shows that they have

Start time: 431.56
End time: 451.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they have an Elton John show and so every time I listen to beats one Alex you're a former DJ as am I  I feel like this is radio from the 70s they have like beats one echo echo echo echo and the DJs  will talk over music like crazy it just seems very it seems retro to me and I and I wonder I

Start time: 451.98
End time: 463.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  kind of dig that I don't know I mean I think that's kind of cool I think for a certain generation  of people they're either gonna love it or hate it but there are certain people who are listening  to it now who've never listened to traditional radio the way that you know it used to be around

Start time: 463.90
End time: 490.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because that's what this is isn't it it's Mike Elgin made a point that it that that's for the  first time ever there is a global radio station that conceivably people from all over there's a  hundred countries all over the world could be listening and you break a song on beats one  you're breaking it not just in the US but everywhere and so it could be very powerful and yet I don't  feel like one station is gonna serve a very broad heterogeneous so I audience I'm supposed to start

Start time: 490.88
End time: 501.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  listening to radio again yeah yeah Apple brought it back all right for you yeah I mean I think  I'm not based on that I'm not convinced it's a lot of one station has been serving at least the

Start time: 501.78
End time: 534.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  US because I mean when you look at clear channel or many of these that's one station is programming  one station programming has been very very and there's other handful of consultants that run  most of the stations in the United States there's probably four or five real stations that cover  most of them most of the major markets and then there's lots of little independence and so so we  you know that homogeny is I think happened for a while I think that it is interesting though that  and I think that becomes very complex when you look at Apple possibly paying for you know creating  content and do they break content that they've helped make with the artists down the road you

Start time: 534.28
End time: 554.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know that would be one thing I would worry about is that the payola thing that it's one thing if  Zane Lowe and the other Julie Antonuga and the other DJs are playing music they really love that  they picked it's another thing if Apple corporate says hey we really want to push the latest you to  album would you mind playing a little more of that that would bug me right and I don't there's

Start time: 554.26
End time: 621.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no reason to think they're doing that no I mean I asked I asked Trent Reznor about that in the in  the lead-up to Apple music and and you know he made it very clear that the whole reason they were  doing it it was his idea he wanted to basically go back to a time when you know radio when DJs  really kind of had authority to pick what they wanted and and Zane show on the BBC on radio one  was very similar to what his show is yeah on Apple music and I like that show no it's not for  everybody but I like that show and so I think that he's basically a trick told me he's like kind of  the heart and soul he's like the entire kind of the DNA of beats one is is Zane so I would be  concerned if we I guess what I'm saying is I'm not expecting to see that sort of interference I  would be concerned with that possibility if I would be concerned of Zane left but let's put it  that way if Zane left then that would be a concerning thing but as long as he's there I  have a feeling like he's there to do his thing and Apple is kind of treating this like a loss  leader in some cases I don't think they're looking to make money off of beats one they're looking as  this is kind of a value add to the rest of the service the other reason I bring it up I feel

Start time: 621.12
End time: 643.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like it might it might be a little bit of an insight into Jimmy Iovine Trent Reznor and Apple's  attitude towards music I thought that the whole that I thought Apple killed radio I thought Apple  killed music radio the iPod came out and now we can listen to what we want to listen to and I  thought that that and I know it was bad for music radio and it's strange that they would be bringing

Start time: 643.60
End time: 732.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it back it seems like one of the things one of the things I think is missing though is I think  that they could kill radio and and what I mean by that is that I think we do like listening to a  little bit of context around the music that we're that we're watching so or listening to so I think  that there is an opportunity for that I think that the real hard thing that Apple is going to is  trying to do is all these curations but I feel like that top-down approach to all that all that  curation and that real press to not allow the you know allow the kind of cross pollination among the  users in the same way that you have Spotify you know to make sure that there's no you know noise  I guess I feel like is gonna make it a little sterile I think that there's a lot of opportunity  to I think there is opportunity for people to bubble up and I think this is the place that  Spotify could actually you know take advantage of this is really providing a platform right now  no one can do a radio station online because of the expense of all the royalties that are connected  to it but if you combine the ability to talk a little bit as well as run songs not actually play  them and stream them but use you know utilize playlists that are kind of you know part of that  process it would allow people to start building basically their own their own you know radio  stations and that I think would would definitely be the end of a radio not not because some kid in  Iowa would do it but guys like Mike on that Mike Hall ran and could do his own guys you really know  they're doing yeah yeah at a 91 X you know and do it out of his do it out of his house and probably  make a lot more money than he's making at the radio station well the jury's still out we'll see you

Start time: 1136.06
End time: 1139.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all right I mean they know their business obviously they've done some research and they figured that

Start time: 1140.74
End time: 1193.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean the only thing I can figure is that they already have you know the guts to go inside an  iPhone 6 maybe pair things down a little bit you've already got all these shells cheap to make you  know you've already got the shells and the screens go ahead and pop the upgrade in this will at least  get iOS 9 there was I was actually a little concerned that maybe the old iPod touch would  get iOS 9 so this will at least get it to iOS 9 when I'm also thinking and I don't know how likely  this is but I'd love to hear you guys's thoughts I don't know if there's potential here for in  developing markets developing countries where people still have poor cell signal and are  primarily using their phones again like like most of us do on Wi-Fi if having a $200 you know no  contract type of device running an a chip and having no better graphics performance running the  latest stuff that could be a competitor of sorts to you know some of the super cheap Android phones

Start time: 1194.08
End time: 1212.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that sounds that sounds like a bit of a stretch I mean it makes sense financially in some ways  but with super cheap Android or even you know Firefox Mozilla phones you could believe you  could get all the same stuff with cellular if you want it that's true yeah could you I mean it does

Start time: 1212.88
End time: 1226.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I mean I think there's an interesting theory here because Apple does not want to make and will  never make probably a cheap iPhone that's just not something they're interested in maybe that's  what this is I mean you could put Skype on it if you had internet access well you have FaceTime

Start time: 1226.86
End time: 1232.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right now and the thing is is that you can put FaceTime Skype go to meeting hangouts you know

End time: 1236.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all of those things are all available on it you don't need cell service if you get Wi-Fi and as

Start time: 1236.70
End time: 1258.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wi-Fi spreads I don't know maybe that's a nutty I think that I personally think that part of this  is a little bit of a hobby on Apple's part every update seems to make it easier to make voice calls  without your cell service right you know I mean it's one of those things that they just keep on  kind of creeping along they're not making any announcements and I won't know they don't want  to get anybody's dander up you know plus the equipment is a perfect safe place to do this

Start time: 1258.82
End time: 1276.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the end the hardware that goes into this is fully amortized I mean they've got the screens the chips  are probably binned versions of the age that didn't pass the test to get into the eye perfect  under clocked yeah yeah so it probably cost them it's very little to put this product together and  they've got to keep it updated just if they haven't updated so long just to keep it current

Transcript:  Curtis B. in our chat room points out it does have the M8 chip so it could do the fitness tracking  yeah so it's a fitness device perhaps and let's it has to have something to do with the release of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple music right because it's an Apple music device oh yeah no I mean that was even when I  had my you know on background phone call with them about about the device I mean that was that was  definitely a highlight of it yeah working with Apple music and what's interesting is that the  shuffle and the nano will not work with any of the offline files you download from Apple music if  you're not an iTunes match person so if you've bought you know if you can download tracks to  listen to offline with Apple music those offline tracks have DRM that do not work on the iPod touch  or excuse me the iPod Nano or the iPod shuffle they work on the touch just fine oh that's

Start time: 1323.30
End time: 1331.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1331.68
End time: 1341.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's just I guess because they haven't updated the other two iPods in so many years it can't  handle new version of DRM they've put on but yeah it's weird I know I know I use one of them in my

Start time: 1654.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  his point and it's a reasonable point is that a normal person in a normal environment listening  to the normal crap that they use isn't gonna be able to tell the difference but that's true nobody  denies that so who's gonna buy so who would well somebody who cares about music is gonna buy the  best quality music and look and then there's a legitimate argument is a CD as good as it needs  to be and I think that that's a legitimate argument I'm not gonna get in the high-res versus CD but I  don't think there's anybody who's listening carefully with good equipment that can not tell  the difference in AAC or mp3 and flat there is a clear and obvious difference I think it depends

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mean you could say the same thing about use net or or any other kind of you know big big network  forum things that are that are of that regard I wouldn't go that far I mean if someone wanted to  boycott the whole thing because of some of the objectionable stuff obviously that's their right  I but I don't think that it means that just because you you like certain subreddits that  have nothing to do with the other stuff and you have your own community ecosystem that you should  somehow feel guilty because other parts of this kind of weird you know octopus of of networks  has nasty stuff in it I think the bigger problem is that because they didn't step in four years ago  a lot of the stuff that's happening now is happening and um I don't know if I almost feel  like it's too late it's like I don't know what Steve can do I don't think he's doing enough but  so I don't know what more he can do other than starting with baby steps because I do fear  for their their sake you know we've seen how quick communities can just disappear  and even humongous sites can just die in in nanoseconds and I think that's probably going  to happen to reddit because what it once was is not going to be what it is again and that doesn't  mean that what it could be couldn't be great but they're kind of in this period of you know change  and lots of things happening that um the one advantage they have the only reason I think that  people haven't jumped ship already the way that people did from dig is that dig had reddit to  support the the overflow of people um what is there to replace reddit there isn't anything so  until there's a replacement for reddit they're okay but little by little you know the people who  you know for for right or for good or for ill kind of keep the community running and and keep  things happening and and the the wheels turning are going to disappear and that's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  want those nude pictures oh you go to reddit go to reddit and the thing is is that because the front  page of reddit is driven not just by things you follow but also by other things from the community  oftentimes the front page you'll end up seeing stuff that maybe you didn't want to see so for  instance I mean and that's where the corrosive aspects of the community do tend to fall into  other subreddits so if you're a new reddit user and you sign up you know you're automatically  subscribed to a few big subreddits and if you know our images has really gross content or if some of  these other popular r news or things are happening big controversy you can be made aware of some of  the bigger stuff that's happening in the community whether you want to or not I also think that the  you know well although many parts of reddit are very nice part of the tenor of the conversation  because it has kind of been known as this place where anything can happen is corrosive I was  talking with a friend of mine a guy I work with and he wanted to look back and see his very first  reddit comment and so he logged in to see something from like 2010 and the first response to him was  calling him a guy and and and saying something terrible to him and so he kind of realized oh  from the very beginning something that I said that it was completely innocuous it was really this  terrible so there's certainly I think that there's an element where you're allowed to act a certain  way on reddit and it's acceptable in a lot of the communities whereas it wouldn't be acceptable

Transcript:  of things I mean I think that one it's one of the reasons that you know Facebook adheres to or tries  to push things like your real name I know when when we had a fledgling social network that we  were building we required a photo that looked like you I kind of want to do that I kind of want to

Transcript:  registered ours was a paid social networks you know and and use a credit card yeah yeah well you  we knew who you were and you needed to use your name and you know and we actually have instructions  on how to build your your profile picture and so so but it was really it was amazing how just that  one simple you know action cleaned up all the conversation because you know you you really  everyone knew who you were and that takes a lot of that a lot of the stuff out that that bothers us  and then of course everyone reported everyone else and you also just created a culture we created a  culture that was very much like that's not going to be appropriate but isn't there a point there's

Start time: 3277.42
End time: 3321.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  two points there's a point to be made that really free speech is good because it challenges your  preconceived notions and it open and and if it's a terrible idea if it's racism if it's fat hate  then you should know it exists and you should fight it with all your might and if it weren't  for free speech you might not you know i think there's an argument that i think open and free  is a good thing but there's also the argument that anonymity is a good thing now i agree with  you in fact we talked about this on the when i did the nerdist chris hardwick said you know if people  had to identify themselves it'd be no problem because people most of the time will not say  horrendous things if you know who they are and that's your that's your position i guess alex  but there's also a case where you need to be anonymous there's reasons there is and chris

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and there's chris poolwood has argued that from fortune for a long time yeah and for two and they're  a good effect but you know where you draw the line is the hard part because we like i said  uh everybody can agree on certain cases but um one of the things that's coming up right now in  academia is this whole issue of things that offend or trigger people the whole trigger warning issue  yeah and at some point at a lot of points people just fundamentally disagree on what is acceptable  and what is not acceptable and both people could be completely reasonable well-meaning people who  completely disagree on something being well that's fine people should be exposed to it it's the world  or that is completely utterly unacceptable and must not be allowed to be seen by anybody and

Start time: 3368.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and that's kind of not right that's not what we want right well it's not what we want  i understand in the university but i but i feel and i think that there's definitely i think that

Start time: 3378.56
End time: 3415.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i think that when you when you have a business and a community that you're trying to build it  with a certain flavor to it i think that you know having a lot of control makes a lot of sense  i think that in a lot of rules of engagements of how we do i mean we're the example of that we  heavily control it right and i think that but i think i don't believe the government should  make it illegal and i don't know and i do think there are allowed there are plenty of places but  i think reddit's making a business needs to make a business decision and that's you know it's not  they're not making a political decision about whether free speech should ever exist but i think  they need to make a business decision about whether they want that kind of free speech on their site  where they're trying to sell ads next to it i mean we have is there a future for reddit are they done

End time: 3533.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but but that's what that's the the first amendment in fact says you know as long as you don't incite  to violence or you know then anything goes that's the first amendment that's really yes it's really  vague yeah and and there of course been many supreme court cases and others refining it a  little bit but i don't think that that's a bad bad standard and i the reason i say that is you  there's there's horrible things people can say so we need a supreme court but they need to be able  to say that and and i think it's valuable that it's said and it's exposed otherwise it goes

Start time: 3533.30
End time: 3553.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  underground well and also it builds up pressure when people don't feel like they're heard when  they don't feel like they can say anything you know that those are the people who oftentimes  become violent and so there's a good reason to have you know outlets for people to say it rather  than do it so i think that it is important i you know so i definitely there should be places on the  internet that allow that it's just the question is is where the reddit is that place yeah and

Start time: 3553.98
End time: 3658.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that should be clear the first amendment is not as ambiguous it says the government shall not abridge  free speech but subsequent court cases have narrowed it to say you know there are some  limits on that you can't shout fire in a crowded theater you can't incite to violence things like  that i think it's a good conversation i wanted to have this i know it's a little bit old news  although steve huffman's rules just came out so maybe maybe there's some timeliness to it but i  i was sitting here watching this as i'm floating down the river there's nothing else to do and i'm  thinking boy i want to talk about this good week to be on a river  yeah except for the 95 degree heat wave in europe yes let's take a break come back google is  challenging apple for beacons it's kind of interesting they've also hired some folks from  homejoy we'll talk about what homejoy is all about but i'll let your imagination think about  it for a little bit until we do 60 billion dollars to the stock in one day on friday  60 billion 65 billion dollars in stock and stock worth and what's the percentage raise on that  eight percent yeah yeah it gives you some idea that's amazing i would like to talk to talk about  windows microsoft you know we're just 11 days off 10 days off from windows 10 satya nadella giving  mary joe foley an excellent interview to talk about that taking a seven billion plus dollar  write-off on windows phone as well lots more to talk about but meanwhile let's take a break and  see i actually want to see this what happened when i was gone this week on twit go for it

Transcript:  aware it's it's pretty important stuff maybe one of the reasons ibeacon was doa two years ago is  because it collided with a sudden awareness of privacy issues right uh the people suddenly i  don't want my phone telling a retailer i'm here that's not exactly not what i want to have happen

Start time: 4173.78
End time: 4213.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right i mean and that's sort of the challenge i mean i think that definitely this stuff is important  i think that the challenge it'll face the same one that ibeacon has is how do you get you know  lots and lots of people to buy these devices and implement them and implement the apps that will  support them you know certain retailers have gone really i've been really bullish on beacons and  certainly you've seen implementations in ballparks and other places but even if this technology is  better and even if it's really interesting i mean you've still got to convince people especially  you know places that might have already invested in beacons to buy these things and actually  implement them and then build software for them and i think that that's those are you know hurdles  that are not easy to get over no matter how good your technology my suspicion is eddie stone is as

Start time: 4213.78
End time: 4223.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  doa as ibeacon was not because of the technology not being as good or whatever just because nobody  wants that there are retailers might want it but i don't think customers want it well when you go

Start time: 4289.50
End time: 4371.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nobody's doing any of that right and i think that that that is actually the the navigation is one of  the places that it could go really really well where there's a lot of places that you get very  limited once you get there you know so gps can get you to the convention hall but it can't tell you  what room to go into or how to get to that room and i think that that ibeacon has or or all of  these low to low low energy bluetooth have the opportunity to provide that and not only can it  tell us what booth where to find our booths or build a path that we can follow to find these booths  and tell us whether we're on the right track but it can also help us find other people that were  that we're trying to find you know so i find you know there's a lot of like where are you in the  las vegas convention center for instance you know the north hall or the central hall is a big word  you know that's that's still an hour of wandering around trying to figure out which which booth is  four four six five you know and so um so being able to tell everyone meet me here and being able to on  an app do that i think you'd find a lot of people using it families in malls or in in disneyland  or and all these other things being able to precisely identify where they are and they  could end up using it a lot beyond all the commercial things now and i think that what  what retailers have to do and what people trying to commercialize is they have to look at that first  how do i get something that people want to use all the time and then we'll figure out how to make  money with it but we have to get them actually excited about opening the app and knowing where  they are and getting something that has a real value before we try to sell them something

Start time: 4373.18
End time: 4398.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one of the one of the things to watch out for in both and all these things is that  beacon technology no matter whose is a way to get information from a device onto a phone  automatically which means it has risk there is a risk factor involved and it's one of the things  that we're we're looking at right now because our hacker the make hackers are used are this is really  they're using beacons well we're looking at it's really cool you can do cool things with it i think

Start time: 4398.72
End time: 4418.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that google's also well positioned because they have google now so google now could respond to a  beacon and already it's kind of set up and i'm using now and it just kind of makes sense to me  that i'm going to get a card about this that might be of use or a coupon i just feel like people don't  are so sensitive now to this to the risks yeah i mean i don't think i don't think the average person

Transcript:  what it does show though very clearly is the difference between apple and google google  doesn't make money on these kinds of technologies so they can make it open source it's on github they  can let anybody do it i'm sure your makers would be much more likely to implement eddie stone than  than i beacon just because it's open but but apple needs to make money on its products i mean that's

Transcript:  should just leave the discussion for the pros probably can i just say though that when i was  covering products back at cnet the most uncomfortable conversations i ever had were  the ones with the anti-virus guys when they come into pitch it's like selling the viruses out the  other side the other door i'm probably you didn't accuse them of that did you no of course not i'd  be you know i wouldn't i think a lot of people think that naturally i'm naturally cynical yeah

Start time: 4531.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they don't need to sell some more or do they well i mean you know try to convince you know especially  in the era when you've got stuff built in by you know microsoft and apple all these other companies  started to have kind of built-in antivirus anti-malware things you know how are why should  an enterprise or why should a consumer still buy your product good point all the and all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  by the way they're pretty much out of business right i mean microsoft is now building a virus  anti-virus into windows windows 10 will have it as well waiting for the first great mac virus  yeah you know there's a but apple has done i think very good things  and less obvious things they don't build an antivirus but they have some really smart technology  that allows them to spot malware and to remove it without your knowledge so i feel like apple is  probably being fairly proactive on this right and they control the stores and they control it right

Start time: 4596.02
End time: 4633.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and that's the big thing is that by default you know you the gatekeeper thing is turned on so you  can't install software that isn't signed and most of the time is the unsigned stuff is where the mac  viruses the mac trojans come from so if you've downloaded you know you've pirated something  and it's unsigned you know you've got to actually actively right click and click open or you've got  to actively change your settings um to to run that file um if it's been signed by a developer  in theory of course there are possibly people can still kind of there's always a way around  things but you know if something's been signed by a developer then it's it's the likelihood of it  having any sort of malware on it is is very very limited flash that was one of the bugs that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but isn't and that's and those and those technologies aren't there you know the technologies especially  to replace streaming video streaming video on the web is not and i've had some recent experiences  with trying to use things other than flash and and it's it's a little frightening you know and  so so you do want that to go and that and that technology is moving down that path but it's you  know not there yet in some areas and i think but i do think that people do need as you know has been  suggested by some technologists a dead a dead date you know that we're going to facebook in fact is

Start time: 4697.72
End time: 4731.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  saying uh let's uh let's dump flash facebook's security chief says it's time to uh say you know  we're gonna on this date get rid of flash and that'll be it alex stamos tweeted it's time for  adobe to announce the end of that life date for flashing to ask browsers to set kill bits on the  same day firefox maybe jumped the gun because the latest version of firefox blocks flash  right well that's because of the zero day hole because of the the hacking team hole  yes but and we'll presumably unblock it at some point we'll unblock it as soon as you know adobe

Start time: 4732.08
End time: 4769.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  gets the thing um fixed but yeah i mean firefox has a you know a reputation they they have a kind  of a a duty to their customers to not let something through that could potentially harm them and if we  know that there's this big zero day exploit that has been hacked by the hackers and is now all over  the place and that a million people could start you know to build um tools to take advantage of  that exploit yeah i mean i think that maybe they maybe they're more proactive than maybe they had  to be i don't know but i don't blame them for taking the the method and saying yeah we're not  going to support this until you patch your stuff because and and the question is is do do we have

Start time: 4769.96
End time: 4778.62

Start time: 4783.80
End time: 4831.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no no they i think they kind of would because they would i think in a perfect world adobe's  ready to get rid of flash you know they're they're trying to migrate people away from it they're  trying to migrate people into other types of tools they've shifted their business away from flash you  know they went from being so anti even bring up a couple you know five years ago if i would bring  up with adobe you know why can't you guys just embrace html5 i would talk to one guy at adobe  who was like i'm with you i agree this sucks but i'm like the only person here who's saying this  and you know five years later you know they don't support it on mobile i think they would like to  move people into their html5 solutions they would they have you know a suite of streaming video  solutions and servers that can run on different platforms that they would like to sell they have  different tools for software creators and web developers and technologies they would like to  use and sell they don't want to continue supporting you know you know flash and director stuff forever

Start time: 4833.90
End time: 4874.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well we'll see what happens uh you know it would be a problem for us because we don't  stream our own content we use ustream uh ustream has had non-flash streaming but they also have  flash streaming we also use big gravity which is flash only as i think we do pay for an hls an  http streamer because of our i people who use ios can't obviously use flash the fact that you  could use an iphone and ipad and never use flash and you could successfully navigate the modern  world kind of indicates it's it's almost it's not necessary not for video anyway yeah but it would  require our providers to adjust and i presume they would it wouldn't it's not up to us it would

Transcript:  dash is a is one of the things that people are you know looking at as you know is dash a codec

Start time: 4889.84
End time: 4910.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what is dash dash is just another codec yeah flash is a wrapper usually it's around h.264 mpeg 4  right um you uh but if so there's a video in html5 there's a video tag bracket video bracket  and to my knowledge that we still has not been defined what's supposed to happen in a browser

Start time: 4910.78
End time: 4958.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  when it sees that tag well there's been conflict i mean mozilla primarily hasn't wanted to support  h.264 because of the patent encumbrance with it so they would prefer to support you know aug and  and vp8 and and so in webm webm obviously hasn't taken off i mean google doesn't even use it  um so um but but you know mozilla has started to at least um start to move a little bit on h.264  especially on systems where it comes already part of the operating system and and even on their  mobile stuff so yeah i mean the the codec the specification of the video tag is basically  it'll play whatever video is there and then it's up to your browser or your hardware whether or not  it can play back the codec or not so it just has you know video tag going to the file and then it's  up to your system whether or not it can play the file but it can simply play it in any format

Start time: 4958.32
End time: 4965.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the the spec itself or video doesn't care so alex is dash unencumbered or is there are there patent

Start time: 4965.26
End time: 5085.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  issues with dash as well dash is just the wrapper so what you end up with is a situation where  kind of what was just being discussed is is that you have there's a couple different things that  happen so i get i get a video and then i stream that video out to a um to a cdn and that can be  whatever format it is i mean that can be h.264 it can be a lot of other things but it you know  but that can that's sent to them and then it has to be split up and so when you're watching  something online that's all being cut up into a whole bunch of little um adaptive bit rates so  we're going to give you four to nine uh bit rates and we're going to decide oh you're on a phone  this is what you're going to get now that um how that is being stacked up and managed in this kind  of a simplified version of this but how that's all being stacked up depends on these different  protocols and how flash is doing it or dash or um you know or hls and so um how these things get done  it's it's not necessarily changing how it's being compressed but it is changing how it's being  managed and then you have a player on the other side that's then making decisions about how it's  getting that data but it does make a big difference on how it's being requested so for instance  you know the you know there there is a way that all these cdns you know basically what they're  doing is they're peering so i get you know i have a what's called an origin server and i'm i'm  getting that i send that to that server and it sends it out to peers and then they send it out  to peers and they send it out to peers so that out on the edge you're not getting slammed with  uh you know you're not getting slammed it's just those locations that are getting that it's  theoretically local to them it's not putting a lot of pressure on a single server but how chatty  those those those protocols are um you know is very can be can vary so um you know one of things  we found so far is that the protocol that you know dash is different than flash and and it's  the way it's making requests based on things that are going on um can put a lot more pressure on the  on the server what is youtube does youtube use dash what does youtube do no youtube is still using  um uh actually i i don't don't know there's a lot of different things they're still using vp you  know vp8 i believe is in part of it you know they're using you know there's a variety of

Start time: 5086.20
End time: 5091.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know html5 because they don't support flash right no they do but they still they've switched

Start time: 5091.60
End time: 5120.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the the d yeah it still has a flash fallback but they did finally switch to html5 as the default  and i think that they primarily use h.264 they do have vp8 and and you know webm but i think they  primarily use h.264 um but uh just because you know so many mobile devices use that instead  but they did i can't remember when it's been within the last year they they made html5 the  actual default and then there was a flash fallback so if you're on a really old system that doesn't  support it there will be you know flash support part of this reason this is confusing is because

Start time: 5120.82
End time: 5164.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there's rappers which are things like flash or mkv or quicktime movies there's codex which are  inside the wrappers and they those two don't necessarily indicate which you're going to which  you're going to be and so it's all very uh it's all very confusing youtube currently uses i'm  just looking here on their engineering blog vp9 for the high def and 4k video that they stream  um this is this is the codec i think that they want to become the default codec on the internet  they kind of admitted that vp8 is is still encumbered it is not uh it's not a completely  open technology i think they hope that vp9 will be um and vp9 is very impressive you know i mean

Start time: 5164.92
End time: 5170.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for the future it's bandwidth adaptive so if you have low bandwidth you could still get a stream  and get something that's okay um but if you have enough bandwidth you can get 4k as well  so uh chrome uses vp9 android devices support it some game consoles support it and uh i would guess  this is kind of the future but boy you just you just don't know this is an interesting um uh right  image they have on the engineering blog where you compare and i don't know those of you who  are watching on h.264 may not notice this but if you look at vp9 same stream same bit rate that's  a 600 kilobit connection uh there's a huge difference in the clarity uh between h.264 which  is really kind of blocky and artifacted and vp9 and then there's also h.265 which you know is

Start time: 5224.54
End time: 5240.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  similar to h uh to to vp9 is that hv so confusing yeah i mean no i mean the biggest problem i think  honestly with a lot of the codec stuff is getting the hardware support so like even though chrome  and android might support vp9 doesn't have hardware encoded decoding support for transcoding support

Transcript:  it's just a wrapper i mean it's just a really nice wrapper i think that you could conceivably come up  with a different type of wrapper that would not have as many security holes and you could even call  it flash it would just be you know not not be lying on on all the stuff that you know macromedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  started 20 years ago well right now though if you if you're running a computer you don't have chrome  you don't have a vp9 codec so that's kind of the issue is you've got to get the codec somehow

Start time: 5272.54
End time: 5297.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right and flash got to a point where it was everywhere right to some and then and then the  iphone came and then it's not everywhere but it's still on the desktop it's everywhere and so most  of the time for instance when we're streaming you know the the end product is going to be a  flash and an nhls you know those are the two that you know that's you know still the standard  of how that of how that gets done and of course everyone wants to move on they all know that but

Transcript:  computer so that's the problem is that is that who needs a new computer you know if you bought a  computer when windows 8.1 or windows 8 came out right so that's you know three years that computer  probably still decent you're probably still okay with it that's why so many people are using xp  exactly because the because the technology hasn't increased to the point where we're needing to do  it we've kind of hit these plateaus replacing your phone every year that's one thing because that's  now your primary computer thing it's like what brink was saying earlier you know like you know  mobile is now kind of the central center of our universe um our laptops and desktops not so much  so i think that you know if you bought something in the last three years say you bought something  a year and a half ago you know you bought a computer that came with windows 8 on it or maybe  by that time it was windows 8.1 um you're probably not going to need to buy another computer for  another year and a half two three years um so it's going to be really hard for microsoft i think  unless they give it away for free for the year to convince people to upgrade and then if you don't  upgrade then you can't get them into the more virtuous cycle of maybe paying for offices of  service and getting latest updates and all the other stuff so i mean they've got to do something
