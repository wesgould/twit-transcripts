I hope you enjoyed last week's holiday special with John Hodgman, Jonathan Colton, Paul and  Storm and that strange Roderick fellow who showed up.  This one's going to be a little different.  This is our yearly best.  We'd like to end the year with a look back at some of the great stories of 2012.  We've got a bunch of them for you.  We're going to kick off with one of the stories that happened early in the year that was a  bit of a shocker and gave rise to a new monetary unit on the internet.  One Instagram.  Watch as we talk about Facebook purchasing Instagram for one billion dollars.

Transcript:  Let's start because the big story and I apologize for people who listen to all our shows because  this story broke Monday, the day after last week's Twit.  So we've gone, if you listen to all our shows, we've gone through every show now to talk  about this story, but we haven't done it yet on Twit and we need to and I've got a great  panel to talk about it.  Instagram selling to Facebook.  This company is 15 months old, 12 employees.  They are an iOS app recently released, an Android app.  Boy, we couldn't have a better panel here to talk about it.  We've got one of the great photographers here.  One billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you're not going to preoccupy yourself with the price, with the money that's floating  around because you did that on the show, on the radio.  Hard not to.  But then you just was, you were like-  If it were 999 million, it wouldn't be the same story.  You said that exact same thing.

Transcript:  But don't you think it's a materialistic analysis and we should be looking at the possible reasons  that they did this rather than-

Start time: 229.56
End time: 243.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything with one billion dollars in it is materialistic.  I don't care what.  All right.  According to The Verge, Dante Orasio writing, it took Mark Zuckerberg two days to make this  deal.  You think it was a rush to judgment?

Start time: 244.83
End time: 249.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, I don't think he wanted anyone else to start a bidding war.  I think they just-  Is that what it was defensive?

Start time: 249.12
End time: 255.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I can't believe there would be a bidding war.  New York Times said-  I believe it was defensive, but I don't believe there would be a bidding war.  Not at that price.

Start time: 260.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Also ridiculous.  It's a picture sharing mobile app.  It's an app.  That's all it is.  It's not even a website.  It's not anything.  Yes, it has a lot of users, but-

Start time: 269.72
End time: 276.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But every one of those users, Jolie, doesn't every one of those users probably a Facebook  member already?  I mean doesn't Facebook know more about that?  Yes.  Which gives it away.

Start time: 277.48
End time: 279.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  In the IPO filing documents, everybody was saying, oh, you know, mobile is Facebook's  biggest weakness when you're talking about investors and publicly traded Facebook stock.  So this is Facebook saying, hey, no, we can do mobile.  Look, we bought a big mobile company for a billion dollars.  Isn't that competent of us?  And maybe it is.  Sure, I'm not privy to those discussions, but it's so bubbly.  I talked to people who lived-

Start time: 303.32
End time: 305.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bubbly in the sense of like a stock bubble.

Start time: 305.14
End time: 333.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I lived-  Overvalued.  I talked to people who went through the 90s dot com bust and they said-  You were 12 at the time, so you probably remember it.  No.  Darling, I was working on my first computer job.  Were you already?  I was.  I had my first startup job in 1999.  So you lived through this, actually?  I am older than I look.  Yes.  So no, but everyone who is from that era is saying, okay, this is the kind of deal that  makes people terrified that our whole internet economy is going to collapse again.  Overheated.  Oh, God, it's ridiculous.  A billion dollars for a mobile app.  No, wait a minute.

Start time: 333.92
End time: 337.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think with the brains at this table, we could figure out why this happened.

Start time: 337.36
End time: 382.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a good call in MarketWatch about this.  Why did this happen?  Because the number of users, like I think you said on your other show-  30 million.  Are all Facebook users already.  Right.  And they were ripe for the plucking.  Google could have grabbed them all and picked up 33 million people right off the top.  And Facebook is starting to exhibit the Microsoft paranoia qualities.  And I think this is one evidence of it.  They are getting just- and Google is showing this too.  They're paranoid about things going on around them.  Because they make so much money, they can't even consider the possibility that a competition  might be good for them.  So they did a defensive move, grabbed this thing out of sheer paranoia, and for as I'm  concerned pulled a Yahoo.  This is the broadcast.com-  This is broadcast.com, exactly.  It's a broadcast.com-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a matter of months.  They have to buy them from Paul Allen who won't sell them.  But they could buy the Seattle team which has moved to- or they could create a new Seattle  team because the other team has moved to Oklahoma City.

Start time: 396.60
End time: 422.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  Taking the devil's advocate side, it's really easy to look at this and say, obviously they  overpaid.  I'm a billion dollars for a couple of filters and a few users that Facebook probably already  has.  Seems like a lot of money.  But this is a particularly vulnerable time for Facebook.  They are in IPO land now.  And they don't want any competition when the IPO finally hits.  They don't want any questions about whether or not they are the number one mobile space.

Start time: 423.06
End time: 428.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, is it really competition when all of the Instagram photos get pushed to Facebook  and Facebook is the one that monetizes those?

Start time: 428.56
End time: 433.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be if Twitter or Google Plus bought them and flipped that little switch there.

Start time: 434.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  But didn't Twitter just buy a photo sharing?

Start time: 436.80
End time: 438.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well certainly Twitter couldn't afford a billion dollars.

Start time: 438.68
End time: 445.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They didn't buy TwitPic.  Which one did they buy?  I don't know.  Anyhow, Twitter bought one.  Facebook bought one.  I'm going to go buy one.  It doesn't even matter.

Transcript:  According to the Times, Mr. Zuckerberg- that's how you know it's the Times.  Mr. Zuckerberg.  He raised a call on Friday, last Friday a week ago, to Kevin Systrom, the CEO and founder  of Instagram.  And a very nice guy.  We interviewed him when Instagram came out and he was still one of us.  According to people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity  because the discussions were private, Mr. Zuckerberg was blunt, they said.  If Facebook wanted to buy Instagram over the next 48 hours, Facebook and Instagram hammered  out the details for a one billion dollar cash and stock deal.  I can imagine that call.  Hi Kevin.  It's Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg.  Mark Zuckerberg, yeah.  Hey, I want to buy you.  And Kevin thinks, hmm, I don't want to sell.  Sure, Mark.  It'll be a billion dollars.  Okay, where do I send the check?

Start time: 502.24

Start time: 507.58
End time: 514.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's what happened.  I think Kevin said, yeah, yeah, sure, a billion dollars.  And Mark said he didn't blink.  Yeah, sure.  Well, here's a vector.

Transcript:  Here's something that no one's really talking about.  And I think something's happening right in front of us, right underneath us, and no one  really understands it.  But I think the way humans are starting to communicate with each other is evolving.  It's going to visual, isn't it?  It's becoming a picture sharing society.  For years, ever since Gutenberg, right, at the printing press, we've been converting  concepts into words and paragraphs.  And that's how we've communicated.  In fact, that's how we've communicated on the web forever.  But if things continue at their current rate and we're sharing more and more photos, you  can communicate concepts and stories and ideas with photos almost as effectively as words.  It's not better or worse than words.  It's just different.  It's faster.  It's easier.

Start time: 560.80
End time: 563.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  And it's more mobile friendly.  And I think that's very much so.  And I think that's hugely important.  Yeah.

Start time: 565.00
End time: 573.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, as you say that, Trey, I think about my use.  I use Path and Instagram.  And I most often will send a picture and maybe a few words.

Start time: 573.62
End time: 604.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And look, most everybody now, if you have a streaming type life, right, you just flip  through the words until you see a picture that's interesting.  And then you might read some words around it.  And Instagram is a pure photo sharing thing.  And if you think about like humans as we develop, basically from age three till 10, you're learning  this alphanumeric system and how to convert concepts into cogent sentences.  That is a huge amount of human development time.  But what if people just start sharing photos to share stories of their life, to share concepts?

Start time: 604.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually Pinterest exploits this thought.

Start time: 607.46
End time: 613.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It feels like going backwards a little bit to cuneiform if you ask me.  You've got to think Pinterest is probably next on the block.

Start time: 613.06
End time: 622.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  How much is Pinterest worth?  If this is worth a billion dollars.  This is the popular page right now on Instagram.  These are the pictures that most people like.

Start time: 622.74
End time: 629.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  This depresses me.  They're not.  They're not deep.  It's pictures of food and shoes and weirdos.  Who is that?

Start time: 639.18
End time: 665.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no question that language continually evolves.  We're always changing the way that we're trying to convey meaning.  But you know, getting back to the main story, I don't see you.  Thank you, Potter.  I don't even granted that communication is shifting.  I don't see the value in a purchase like this.  Defensive.  Is it is it an act higher?  Were they looking at a core technology?  Is there a patent portfolio?  The answer to all those questions is no.

Start time: 665.76
End time: 676.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Jolie hit the nail on the head.  The stock, the IPO is coming up.  Mark might have said if we lose this, it could cost us a billion dollars in the IPO.  It might be worth it.

Start time: 676.92
End time: 693.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's almost like they just spun a roulette wheel and said, OK, Instagram, they're big.  I mean, give it up for Kevin, the luckiest guy in America.  Four hundred million dollars.  There we go again.  He gets four hundred million out of that.  Although I found the timing really weird because I think they collected a significant round  of funding, like something like a day or two before.

Start time: 694.10
End time: 699.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody bought in a week before this happened.  How do you not know that?  Happy people.  That's a lottery ticket.  Happy people.

Start time: 699.80
End time: 710.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They won the lottery.  But with your due diligence, how do you not know?  I don't think so.  This happened in two days.  I agree with John.  How do you not know that the company you're investing in is getting acquired by Facebook?  I don't buy it.  I think somebody knew something.

Start time: 711.76
End time: 736.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think we can take the opposite angle on what she just said, which is not that it  was to make Facebook look good to the potential investors and save a billion dollars.  But now I think potential investors look at it and say, well, these guys are kind of crazy.  This is a dumb idea.  This is a stupid thing to do, which maybe we should hurt them.  And I'll tell you, I think this is going on with these guys are going to do a bunch of  non-voting stock IPOs.  Google's pulling the stunt, which is completely ridiculous.

Start time: 736.58
End time: 743.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's getting people very upset.  In fact, they say that's even the most evil thing given all the evil things Google's done  this year.  That's the most evil.

Start time: 743.06
End time: 745.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to talk about that.  I thought these retirement funds are going to pull out of Google.

Start time: 745.70
End time: 751.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You watch.  CalPERS and things like that.  And these are big investors, these institutional investors that can make a huge difference  in the valuation of the stock.

Transcript:  Did Berkshire Hathaway just get into Google or was that IBM or something else?  I think it was Google.  I'm so into Google.  Let me Google that.

Start time: 759.02
End time: 777.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, there is another angle in the story and that is back when the IPO story was fresh,  there was a TNT episode called 57% Zuck.  The whole idea was he owns most of it.  It's Zuck.  If you're investing in Facebook, you're actually investing in Zuckerberg.  No decision can be made without him.  So I mean, does Zuckerberg just have a liking for Instagram?

Start time: 778.86
End time: 781.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of what the Times article said.  Is this just shows?

Start time: 785.60
End time: 792.86

Transcript:  I got the checkbook.  Don't you think if they can put those stupid filters on Facebook as a Facebook feature,  wouldn't it make Facebook photo sharing even more popular?

Start time: 793.83
End time: 795.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, they don't need Instagram to do that.

Start time: 795.88
End time: 798.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It makes it easier.  You mentioned the other day, there's dozens of Instagram phones.

Start time: 798.74
End time: 809.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Camera Plus did it beforehand.  You've got how many filters in your 100 cameras in one?  There's 100, Leo.  It's an amazing thing.  So it's not like Instagram has a monopoly.

Start time: 809.42
End time: 810.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a coincidence that you named it that.

Start time: 811.30
End time: 813.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I know.  We racked our brains trying to count with the numbers.

Start time: 813.68
End time: 818.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who missed out on this and probably came very close?  Hipstamatic, which predates Instagram.

Start time: 818.52
End time: 828.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I have a little theory about why that happened.  I think the fact that Instagram was willing to go into Android territory made a huge,  huge difference in that price especially.

Start time: 828.98
End time: 830.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happened two weeks before the sale.

Start time: 830.70
End time: 851.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, two weeks, three weeks ago I was at Facebook HQ and I was talking to them and  they're like, yeah, iPhone's a big deal.  Android is as big a deal and the mobile web is twice as big.  Facebook said this.  Facebook said this to me.  They showed us the numbers and they also said, you know, we see the entire spectrum of mobile  access technologies as one in the same.  They're all kind of equal.

Start time: 852.50
End time: 859.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That kind of lends credence to the idea that maybe Instagram knew about this ahead of time  and maybe Instagram said, quick, get an Android app.

Start time: 860.16
End time: 864.19

Transcript:  Far be it from me to come here and posit conspiracy theories.  That's John's job.

Start time: 864.52
End time: 871.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's John's job.  Because they put this off.  I mean, I asked Instagram every time I saw them, Android app, Android.  They say, we're working on it, we're working on it, we're working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  You know, it's kind of speaking of the valuations.  Which would be more interesting.  And they have all half of it.  They have filters.  They're made out of glass, but damn.  I thought it was kind of interesting that Instagram is actually worth more than the  New York Times.  Oh, geez.

Transcript:  I hope you're enjoying this best of our annual look back at some of the big stories of 2012.  Well, we don't do that annually, but some of the big stories of the year.  Next year we'll do 2013.  I guess it would save time in editing if we just did a look back at 2012 from now on.  We could really simplify things a little bit.  We're going to come back in a second with a look at an announcement that happened twice  in 2012.  The new iPad.  But first, I'd like to talk a little bit about one of our favorite sponsors, a company  that's been with us since almost the beginning at Twitter.  And we really love having them with us.  Audible.com.  I don't have to tell you about how great audiobooks are.  Audible.com is the place to get audiobooks on the internet.  One hundred thousand strong in every category.  Fiction, non-fiction.  There's history, there's science fiction, there's thrillers, there's mysteries.  Of course you learn a lot at audible.com too.  There's business books, technology books.  I'm just a huge fan.  Storm of Swords is coming out.  The third book in the Game of Thrones, Sixology I guess you'd call it.  There's six books I think of the Game of Thrones.  But HBO in March will be coming out early next year with the third in the series.  I am of the opinion, and I've been doing this, you've got to read the book before the show  comes out.  I think it enhances your enjoyment of the show, but also you don't want any spoilers  before you read the book.  So I've read book one and two of Game of Thrones, but now it's time for Storm of Swords.  How about getting that for free?  That's a lot of hours of Audible content for free.  This is part of the good news that Audible has made nearly every book at audible.com  a single credit.  This used to be a two credit book, and it's now a one credit book, which means you can  get it for free and get another book when you go to audible.com slash twittoo.  You'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's two credits a month.  But your first month is free.  Your first books are free.  You cancel at any time, pay nothing, and they're still yours to keep forever and ever.  I want you to try Audible.  I really do want you to try Audible.  So do me a favor and take advantage of this special offer.  Two books or two credits, depending on the book, but I think Storm of Swords would be  one credit.  In fact, you could read the next two.  If you go to audible.com slash twittoo, use that special URL so that you get the special  deal.  Audible.com slash twittoo.  I think the Sanderson book is still available too.  So I can make this three books.  If you go to audible.com slash Sanderson, you can get a copy of Brian Sanderson's great  novella Legion.  This was such a good book.  Absolutely free.  No trial, no credit card, even if you're already a member.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E slash dot com slash S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.  Audible.com slash Sanderson.

Start time: 1122.36
End time: 1158.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here, you can look at that.  Yeah, thank you.  Isn't that beautiful?  Go ahead and just type on that.  What do you think about it, Denise?  It's really good looking, isn't it?  No, I'll tell you, at first I thought this screen was going to like, your eyes would  go like Jessica Rabbit would.  But they don't actually do that.  It's not immediately apparent how much better it is, but as you spend time with it, it gets  better and better.  Where do you notice it most?  Well, launch a book application would be one thing to do because text is of course incredibly  crisp.  So I'll launch the Kindle app and you'll see kind of immediately that it's.

Start time: 1159.00
End time: 1161.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in video and HD video, it really, really looks good.

Start time: 1162.04
End time: 1182.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's one question because, OK, the screen is quad resolution, 3.1 megapixels,  and it is now 2048 by 1536 means it could do 1080p video.  But on a screen that size, I don't know.  Is there much of a difference between a 720p video and a 1080p video?  Do you notice a difference?

Start time: 1183.66
End time: 1200.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was testing some clips I have here and definitely the 1080p video I downloaded from iTunes.  It looks better.  Way better on the new iPad versus the iPad 2.  You definitely see the difference.  I just see the difference in even standard definition video on that screen.

Start time: 1200.96
End time: 1215.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just I just feel like it's not it's the same IPS style LCD screen.  It's not a super AMOLED or something, but I do.  But the resolution is so high it is.  It is, I think, 260 pixels per inch that it just feels a lot crisper.  Feels a lot.

Start time: 1216.24
End time: 1218.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So colors look better.

Start time: 1219.16
End time: 1223.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know what I'm most excited about and I don't hear a lot about.  I think the camera blows me away.

Start time: 1224.52
End time: 1227.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How are you using it?  So I have a question for you.  Do you take pictures a lot with your iPad?

Start time: 1227.94
End time: 1230.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to see what it looks like when I take pictures on my iPad?

Transcript:  For those of you listening, Leo has the cover of the iPad on his forehead like a visor.

Start time: 1238.68
End time: 1293.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have one of those iPad covers that see the camera is right down here.  So normally the cover folds over the camera.  So I have to do that.  Or you could take a picture like this, which is equally kind of dorky to have the cover  hang down from the bottom.  But you know what?  I think we're all going to get used to the idea.  Even when I pull it out, it still looks kind of silly.  But I think we're all going to get used to the idea because it is, you know, it's essentially  the same sensor, I guess, in the iPhone 4 with a lens system from the iPhone 4S.  But it is so good.  It really is so good.  And what's different, what's exciting about it is you're seeing the image.  It's like a view camera.  That's cool.  In the old days, you know, on the Three Stooges or the Wild West movies, they'd have a guy  and he'd have the thing on the tripod and he'd put a black hood over his head and say,  watch the birdie.  And this is, you could almost do that, put a hood over your head.  And because now you're seeing a full frame rendition of the picture.

Start time: 1293.70
End time: 1301.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, not the point was made is when have you ever been able to take the video with  the same view as it will be consumed?  Exactly.

Start time: 1302.12
End time: 1318.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so as a result, I think it is a remarkable experience for a videographer or photographer.  And then you add to that that this has got LTE, which is really fast, and you've got  great software on it.  I think in some ways the camera might be, to me, the most exciting part of this.  I really like.

Start time: 1318.94
End time: 1350.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's interesting.  Everything.  Go ahead.  No, no, no, go ahead.  I say that's interesting because I just finished writing my review.  I've written a number of pieces on the iPad this past week and I wanted to take some time  and write the review.  So the review will be up tomorrow.  But I come to the conclusion and I don't want to.  It's the conclusion everyone else has come to, which is really that the screen is the  biggest part.  But that other biggest improvement is the camera.  But I'm not sure a lot of people buy a new iPad for a camera.  But it's funny.  I've been hearing that a few people just don't really see the improvement in the screen.

Transcript:  I don't know.  The camera function is cool.  Am I going to use this?  I'm a video creator.  Am I going to run around and make videos on this and send them off via LTE?  No, because I can't depend on it.  Is this cool?  If I didn't have one?  Yeah.  If I was upgrading from one, maybe.  Is this going to make me upgrade from two?

Start time: 1384.82
End time: 1386.72

Start time: 1391.79
End time: 1399.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very.  This is walking around.  The other thing is it's a little more stable because of its size than a little mini camera  or your smartphone.  Right.  Yeah.

Start time: 1400.84
End time: 1409.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's nice that they're incrementally improving the product, but I'm with Becky.  I'm not going to upgrade from an iPad 2 to get this device.

Start time: 1410.04
End time: 1416.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah.  Iterative, not innovative.  And the teardown was interesting.  That big battery.  Huge battery in there.

Start time: 1417.40
End time: 1428.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think 45 watt hours from 25.  And you need to, obviously, for LTE.  I think that's more for LTE than it is for the screen, although we don't know.  It's got a much faster processor and a much, of course, more dense screen.

Start time: 1428.50
End time: 1431.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I was wondering in the Wi-Fi only versions, do you get a boost then?

Start time: 1432.57
End time: 1465.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I'm actually in the corner of my apartment right now running a battery test.  I'm running the same HD video on both the iPad 2 and the iPad 3.  And I expect that the iPad 2 will last probably a little bit longer or around the same amount  of time as the iPad.  And I have LTE off the new iPad.  I have LTE off just running on Wi-Fi because I expect that the screen, they've boosted  the battery just to give you just as much as you would get on Wi-Fi on the iPad 2 because  of the screen.

Start time: 1465.52
End time: 1473.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think we're saying.  So it's not the LTE that it is the screen that's sucking all that juice.  I don't know if that makes sense.  Right.

Start time: 1474.32
End time: 1480.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they say you'll get an hour less with LTE on.  So you boosted the battery just to compensate enough for that screen.

Start time: 1480.16
End time: 1493.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So I was completely wrong.  It is the screen that's sucking all that juice.  LTE is notorious for being a battery hog, but that's 10% more.  If it's only one hour, that's going from 10 hours to nine hours.  That's not a huge...

Start time: 1493.30
End time: 1501.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Not bad.  One point on the teardown, 499 retail price, estimated cost to build at $316.  Does that sound about right?  Yeah.

Start time: 1501.92
End time: 1503.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more than the old one, but that's a decent profit margin.

Start time: 1504.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 1505.12
End time: 1509.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 1511.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Start time: 1512.04
End time: 1522.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also in the teardown, we're finding that it has...  Let's see.  The A5, I guess we knew everything else.  So it's really the battery size that's new information.

Start time: 1522.34
End time: 1525.40

Start time: 1527.46
End time: 1531.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The funny thing was...  I think they also found that there was one gig of RAM, which Apple hadn't confirmed.

Start time: 1532.36
End time: 1541.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing with the Apple TV.  It's now 512 instead of 256.  They doubled the RAM there too.  And Apple never talks about RAM, which is part of this post PC strategy.  We shouldn't have to talk about that stuff.

Start time: 1541.72
End time: 1557.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Specs aren't the issue.  It's just about performance.  Can it work?  Does it do it?  Qualitative, not quantitative.  The funny thing about this release is before I went on vacation, I went out and recorded  from my Yahoo show all the raps for the new announcement.  So it was the new iPads here.  The iPad 3 is here.

Start time: 1558.56
End time: 1561.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before they said...  You didn't know.  iPad HD.

Start time: 1561.64

Transcript:  You had to go through all the names.  Two weeks.  The iPad HD is here.

Start time: 1564.56
End time: 1566.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then I did...  Were you smart enough to say just iPad?

Start time: 1566.85
End time: 1580.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yes.  I did the new iPad.  I was so stoked.  And then the best one was the A5X is that that had come out.  Every single thing that was out was almost uniformly correct.  There were no surprises.  It was absolutely as predicted.

Start time: 1581.59
End time: 1595.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  You should have let me know because that would have really helped with search placement if  we had all known the name.  Well next time I will bring my...  It's so funny because I kept calling it the iPad 3 or the iPad HD and that was just totally  wrong.

Start time: 1596.08
End time: 1603.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I still need to call it the iPad 3 because if you just say the iPad, it's ambiguous,  especially since Apple still sells the iPad 2.

Start time: 1603.88
End time: 1608.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  But going back to your spec point, they wanted to be qualitative, not quantitative.  So new is good enough.

Start time: 1608.52
End time: 1609.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all just the iPad.

Start time: 1609.52
End time: 1614.71

Start time: 1633.68

End time: 1655.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Don't you just keep saying it can't keep going up?  I feel foolish for having such negativity about the possibility.  And then at some point, everyone's going to go, okay, can go sky's the limit, whatever,  trillion bucks, no problem.

Start time: 1656.12
End time: 1680.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they're talking about.  What is it?  $700 billion they're worth now?  They're saying, you know, we could be worth a trillion.  I remember when Apple was stoked, this is how old I am, because they were a $2 billion  company.  Wow.  I remember when we were talking about stock price on Mac Break Weekly, we said, well,  it might hit 200, but it sure won't go much higher than that.  Scott Bormers saying it'll go higher.  It could go to 250.  And I thought you're crazy.  So now-

Start time: 1681.60

End time: 1755.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, this is breaking news.  And I was just about to say it.  The question is, what would the announcement be?  The dividend?  They have $100 billion.  They were expected or it was hoped by some, I think, that the stockholders mean that they  would offer a dividend.  Of course, they didn't.  They've never offered a dividend.

Transcript:  Okay.  I'm just saying.  Appoli.  To rival Italy.  I'm going to back into the This American Life story with this little point.  Yes, back it up.  So here's the deal.  There's a story that we'll talk much about, which is This American Life retracting the  episode they did about Apple and the Apple factories.  But the last act of the episode talking about this thing said that Apple could build their  devices in the US, the iPhone, for $60 more.

Start time: 1809.78
End time: 1829.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the study that came out about a year ago.  People might say, oh, it's going to be twice as much or it's going to be, you know, no,  it's not a significant difference because they only pay about five bucks to the workers  in China to make that device.  So they pay 65 bucks to US workers.

Start time: 1829.73
End time: 1840.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_16

Now, remember Steve Jobs when he went to that famous dinner it's talked about in the Walter  Isaacson biography with Mark Zuckerberg and many other Silicon Valley luminaries.  The one thing that Jobs brought up with Obama is, you know, there's too many regulations  for me to build a factory here.  But remember in the early days of Apple, they did make Macintoshes here.  They did make Apple IIs here.  This is a more recent development to offshore the manufacturer.  Steve was very proud of the next factory where they built the cube.  Right.  Built here in America.

I hope you had a great Christmas, great Hanukkah.  Your Festivus was the best of us and you're enjoying your winter solstice activities.  New Year's is coming.  And as we always do, we're doing a best of twit this year.  Looking back at the year 2012 and some of our best episodes.  More to come in just a moment.  Before we do though, I'd like to thank one of our sponsors who's also been with us all  year long.  In fact, one of my favorite companies, good friends with the guy who started at David  Friend.  He's an interesting character.  I don't know.  Remember Arp Synthesizers?  He started Arp.  Made a lot of money there.  Right out of college.  I think he was at MIT.  Right out of college.  David went on to do many other startups but he was kind of retired.  Taking it easy when his daughter who was a college student called him up and said, daddy  I just accidentally erased my thesis.  You're a geek.  Can you help me?  And he said, I can't.  I have no solution for this.  And that's why he founded Carbonite.  He said there's got to be a better way to back up and Carbonite is the better way to  back up.  Here's the beauty of it.  It's automatic.  So you could put it, I put it on my daughter's laptop when she went to college.  She just kind of went full circle on that.  So she didn't have to even know that there was a backup solution on there.  Just automatically backing up.  Continuously too.  So she puts the finishing touches on a term paper within minutes.  That's backed up.  Whenever you're online, Carbonite is always backing up without slowing you down or your  computer down.  And the nice thing is this Carbonite data is available at any time.  So you've got your term paper backed up.  You go to the library.  You don't bring your laptop with you.  You can still open the term paper on the library computer.  Log into your Carbonite account and there's all your stuff.  You can even do it on a smartphone or a tablet.  Carbonite has a free apps there.  It's a really great deal.  And all of this is just $59 a year per computer.  That's less than five bucks a month.  I would really encourage you to try Carbonite today.  Go to carbonite.com.  Click the try it free button.  And use the offer code TWIT.  And you'll get two weeks without a credit card, just the offer code TWIT.  And when you buy, you'll get two months free.  So a two week trial, two bonus months when you go to carbonite.com and use the offer  code TWIT.  You got to back it up to get it back.  So do it right with Carbonite.  Let's make 2013 the year that nobody lost any data.  Wouldn't that be something?  So normally I wouldn't recommend taking stock advice from former MTV VJs.  But in this case, Adam Curry got it right.  We talked about Facebook's IPO and this is before it even happened.  Quick, reload the fireplace while we watch Adam Curry.  I do want to talk about the Facebook IPO.  That's the reason we've gathered you all together today because and the Zuck got married.  I guess Priscilla Chan, who's been dating since before Facebook, since a freshman in  Harvard, Priscilla finally said, Oh, you're worth 19 billion.  I'll marry you.  No problem, Mark.  Well they wait.  They waited to the day after the IPO.

And here it is the lovely vision of Mark, the 19 billion dollar man and his new bride,  Priscilla Chan.  They got married yesterday and a surprise.  They invited people to the wedding and said it was a what was it?  It was like her grad graduation party.  And instead she shows up in white.  She's graduating from spinster hood.

Transcript:  Doesn't fit.  One of these things is not like the other.  So really interesting to hear you say a Facebook failed IPO, Adam.  And I'm not sure I disagree with you.  The underwriters decided to set the price before the IPO yesterday morning at thirty  eight dollars.  That was the that was the price that if you were an insider, like you were a big trader  with your brokerage, you could say, hey, cut me some of that Facebook stock.  And you know, it's the biggest tech IPO in history.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to think it's going to what they call pop, which is come  out at thirty eight bucks, but end up at one hundred bucks or fifty bucks or whatever.  Even if you just wanted to sell at the end of the day, you'd make pretty good money.

Transcript:  So I took my company public in ninety six.  You've done this.  Yeah, I have.  And that was a huge IPO, a big raise, fifteen million dollars.  It was amazingly large.  Was this metaverse?  No, this was think new ideas.  OK.  And which we later sold successfully to another public listed company like two months before  the bubble burst.

Transcript:  Well, ninety six was a little bit before it.  And we had we were making money, which is good.  We had clients.  But it was you know, it was back in the day when we'll build a Reeboks website for one  hundred thousand dollars and then ten thousand dollars a month maintenance.  Yeah.  So this is you know, we saw the writing on the wall eventually.  But I went through the process of taking a company public.  And what it really comes down to is pricing the night before.  And so it's the size of the float, the number of shares and what the what the actual price  per share is going to be.  And I think they got greedy.  And when investors and of course, there's a lot of more interesting to me was the coverage  of the IPO, because you saw the day before.  Oh, it was the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And people were GM tanked him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I think it had to do with it.  Right now, they're trading 74, almost 75 times earnings.  That's very, very high.  I mean, I'm pegging the stock to go down to 17.  That's where I think it belongs.  I think that's reasonable for what they can do, what they've shown historically in revenues  and profits.

Start time: 2348.44
End time: 2376.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's the problem.  You know, I was watching it was really treated like the Super Bowl.  I got up at 530 a.m. to watch CNBC because it was like a big event.  They had reporters down at Hacker Square at the Facebook thing.  And of course, Facebook was smart.  They had the hackathon the night before.  So there were thousands of employees there.  Zuck spoke.  They hooked up the Nasdaq bell there in Silicon Valley so he could press the there's no bell  for Nasdaq.  It doesn't have a trading floor, but he pressed the button to start the trading day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the problem with these IPOs.  And I saw and yes, I went I saw this in the bubble.  So you have people who came into the company recently.  They're getting options.  Their strike price is going to be maybe a little bit under 38.  Any new hires that come in, you can't just reshuffle the option pool.  That's a big deal.  They have a strike price.  And let's say just for argument's sake, it's going to be around that 38 number.  So now people are going to be very worried like, oh, you know, either I have stock or  I'm in lockup for six months.  I can't sell anything.  So on paper, I may look like I have a million dollars.  But every day, it's going to be like, how's the stock doing?  How's the stock doing?  That's not good.  Huge distraction.  That's really what you don't want.  Particularly when it's going down, it really, really hurts the company.  And I think that's what we'll see with Facebook.

Start time: 2426.14
End time: 2446.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's BS.  You know, at Rackspace, when we went IPO, the stock went down and it didn't distract  us and the stock since then has gone up 10, I think about 10 times.  You know, just to go out to IPO, you're trying to raise money for the company.  Let me understand this.  So do those face perfectly?  There's 38 bucks.

Start time: 2446.82
End time: 2459.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that which is what they decided to sell it for.  Does all of that money go to Facebook?  Is that like what?  So Facebook said we're going to have how many shares?  Almost a million shares right at 38 bucks.  I forgot what it was.  The total number of shares.

Start time: 2459.58
End time: 2469.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  If I could take a contrarian position here.  I know why people are saying this is a bust because they're they're expecting for the  price to double to go back to the good old days of the bubble when you would have an  incredible rise in the stock price.  And the IPO was when people get paid.  This is not a regular IPO.  You're talking about a company that is 57 percent owned by a single man.  All he wanted was operating capital for his company.

Start time: 2524.60
End time: 2547.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think he even needed to do this.  I think the SEC rules made him do this.  Well, at least they made him disclose to a certain point.  And I think they figured, well, as long as we have to do all the disclosure a public  company has to do, we might as well raise money on the stock market.  But I don't think that this was I think they put it off as long as they could.  Right. They could have done this a year ago.  They could have done this two years ago.  Partly that's hype because you don't think so.  I think Martin wanted to know Mark better than anybody.

He collected one hundred and four billion dollars on Friday for his  investors and his company. Now, I mean, on Friday night, what did he do?  He went and bought a mobile company called Karma. Right.  He's going to have the resources.  He's going to have the resources to take over a lot of things.  And this is very good for Facebook.  Also, on the other side, the transparency is going to force Facebook to be an adult  company for once. I think that's what Mark didn't want, though.  No, I think he did. He did. I think he does.  You know, he knows he's moving his company into being a brand that everybody respects  and trusts. That is those two words are not used with Facebook today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And more interesting is, though, is how do they actually make money?  If you have a so-called 900 million people, which I don't believe is correct,  I think it's probably a fraction of that.  But really, that's neither. Yeah, I think that everyone has multiple accounts.  The SEO guys have 50 accounts.  It's just a matter of how you count things.  But in the case of Rackspace, Robert, that's a business where you're providing a service  and people pay for it. I have five Rackspace servers.  I love the servers. I have them.  Amazon S3 servers, EC2.  But we have yet to show that you can really place a good value on,  essentially, display banner advertising.  That's all they've got so far.  And quite honestly, for the company that knows so much about the social graph,  how could they not figure out that this IPO was mispriced?  You know, they should have had all the information at their fingertips.

Start time: 2661.14
End time: 2676.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it mispriced, though?  They announced it at $38 and it came out at $38.  If they came out at 17 and went to 38, they would have not left money on the table.  The purpose of doing an IPO is to raise money for your investors and your company.  You can't disagree, Adam.

Transcript:  It's 120...  The price to earnings ratio is 122.  This is not a normal IPO.  This is not a...  That means that the stock price is 122 times what they earn.  That's crazy.  And one of the reasons...  And, you know, I'm watching CNBC and Jim Cramer, who was actually great on this.  I was surprised because he's kind of...  Seems like he's kind of crazy.  But he was great on it.  He said, well, what you can't account for is what's going to happen with the retail sales.  You know, the institutional investors pushed back about this price.  There was some concern that everybody who loves...  All the kids who love Facebook would just say,  well, I don't know anything about the stock market or price to earnings,  but I want to buy Facebook.  It's a good...  And would buy it.  And that's what the thought was.  That this would pop.  That it would go up to 50 bucks.  Because...  And you know what?  The kids or whoever did not fall for this.  They looked...  Somebody looked at the price to earnings and said, it's too high.  Well, it came back...

All the ads work that way.  I think the only brand advertiser is Ford possibly, and they're making a connection  with a tech savvy audience.  It's not exactly the same.  And again, Coca-Cola sells an actual product.  People take money out of their pocket and hand it to the company.  This is the difference.  I mean, we've been through this.  We've seen this.  The banner advertising, it's marginal.  And how do you grow if you really have 900 million people?  How do you scale?  How much bigger can you go?  All of a sudden, you're going to make five times as much from each person?

I mean, one of the things that we keep forgetting is...  This is not a regular IPO.  If this had been another LinkedIn or if this had been another Groupon,  absolutely, this was a bust.  But this was a man who, by all means, has done very well for his company.  Getting money for him to be able to invest in his money  so he can leverage those 900 million users.

Long-term, he is going to turn on mobile revenue,  and for the next five quarters, he is going to beat his numbers,  and that is going to cause the stock to have lift.  Target price.  This is what happens.  And by the way, this is Zuckerberg's brilliance.  Zuckerberg knew we were all going to buy this stock coming out of the gate.  So he sandbagged us.

Slap him.  Slap him around and announce a whole bunch of new things,  and announce a new open graph style.  Do you know something we don't know?  Or is this speculation?

I do not believe in the advertising banner click model.  I think, yeah, if you turn it on on mobile, sure, people will misclick.  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to do that.  Well, I clicked on it anyway.  I just don't see the model as something that really works anymore.  I think it's the only way you can make money with banner advertising,  which is essentially what they do.  I looked at all the presentations.  I follow it.  I'm very interested.  It's high volume, high, high volume of lots of people,  some of them will be drunk, some of them will make a mistake.  Some of them will be interested, no doubt about it.  But early on, brands were all sold on this, how many likes a brand had.  And advertisers are very, very smart.  Agencies, not so.  Agencies will sell a bunch of crap to the advertisers.  But the advertisers at the end of the day go, hey, man.  Did it make us money or not?  It's a return on investment.

Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Well, this is the pendulum that always swings back and forth.  I think the internet, if the internet was meant, it was not meant to be centralized.  It wasn't built that way.  I think we will see mom and pops, I hope we'll see mom and pops popping up again,  who will provide email to 100 people, email services.  There'll be little smaller cloud things.  I mean, my goodness, my fiance just moved to iCloud and the mail's not working.  It craps out.  This is hard, hard stuff.  And the more scale you have, the harder it gets.  And if you do it in a smaller, I run my own mail server here at home.  I got like three accounts on it.  It's enough.  It works.  So we're going to have to go back to that.  And because of Facebook's inherent closed nature, it's not a part of the network.

I'm talking about it's gone beyond a critical mass where you have an ecosystem,  where you have people who are willing to buy the brand, not just the advertising in the site,  but the actual brand for Facebook.  And I think you've given a man who, again, I think is very intelligent,  a huge war chest that he can now go out and get what he needs to get more money out of  his 900 million users without it just being banner advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Adam makes a very good point.  Stamps.com calculates return on their investment very carefully.  It's a little harder for Ford because it's a brand builder.  But you're right.  And Ford even wants to do a lot of research.  They're researching constantly to see if they're getting brand recognition.  So no company that's spending ad dollars  and is intelligent is spending ad dollars into a vacuum.  They're checking, does this work?  Does this produce results?  One way or the other, they're not...  I think you're right, Adam.  I don't know if it's the agencies that are that smart.  But the advertisers whose actual money it is  are very careful about where they're putting it.  And in fact, I think that's one of the reasons you're seeing  of a real softening in banner ads right now, aren't we?  Display ads are down.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's why advertisers start to demand  cost per acquisition instead of cost per click or cost per impression.  They really want to make sure that they're getting their money's worth.  Yeah.  So I don't...  But this was all brought up before the IPO.  Everybody said, well, here's the negatives.  It could be another MySpace.  Everybody could vacate Facebook because somebody else comes along.  They don't haven't shown that they know how to produce revenue.  And they certainly aren't producing enough revenue to justify that price right now.  It's clear people who bought Facebook, and by the way,  I would buy it if I could, believe in Zuck.  And believe in him and his team and his ability to somehow turn 900 million users.  We could say if it's Adam's case, 900 million eyeballs.  And they're believing in their own usage model.

Leo, you're doing extremely well with the Twit network,  but I don't think you actually believe you can scale it to a billion-dollar company.  Nor would you want to necessarily.  And that, I think, is, you know, there's a couple things going on here  that are very exciting to me.  If you look at Kickstarter, there's a very interesting model  where you have a company that's facilitating the connection of people  and is taking a piece of the action and people are getting what they want.  And this is really the future.  And I think the network itself is going to facilitate that tremendously,  where I want a product, I want...  Oh, there you go.  So, there you go.

One was Diaspora, 100 bucks down the tube.  One was some dice that I never got, 150 bucks down the tube.  Don't you think that there's going to be Kickstarter fatigue that has...  Inevitably, many of these projects are not going to produce a product that's worth anything.  Who knows if that Pebble watch that I spent 125 bucks on is going to work,  is going to be any good.  I think we're in a bubble, a Kickstarter bubble.  I cannot imagine this is going to continue.  I'm just waiting for the first really bad case.  There's going to be a horrible, horrible example.

But I also believe that if at that point it got down to say $17 and I actually had money to invest,  I would invest in Facebook, not for Facebook, but for Zuck.  Zuck has delivered.

Transcript:  Yeah, you would.  Welcome back to our best of for the year 2012 for Twitter.  And I want to thank the folks at Water Wings Productions, waterwingsproductions.com  for our fabulous super 8-bit fireplace for today's episode.  Keeping my butt warm throughout the show.  Coming up in just a little bit.  The chimney.  Coming up in just a little bit, we're going to take a look at the launch of the surface,  or at least the announcement of the surface.  Both RT and the surface pro.  Before we do though, I'd like to talk a little bit about my friends at Ford.  You know what?  Christmas is going to bring me.  Well, it didn't bring me yet.  By next Christmas, I really want the Ford Fusion energy.  This is the plug-in hybrid which should be coming out in the next month or so.  You know, I'm a big Ford fan and one of the reasons I'm interested in the 2013 Fusion,  2013 Taurus too, is because I can get the blind spot information system bliss with it.  Including cross traffic alert.  This is a really cool technology.  Sensors in the rear panels of the vehicle monitor the blind spot.  You know, whenever you drive, no matter how good you are with the mirrors,  and there's always a part of the car behind you, or on the left and the right, you can't see.  But what's great, and by the way, is one of the number one reasons for auto access,  is lanes changing into oncoming traffic.  So bliss stops that.  Because what it does is it monitors vehicles on either side, and it detects traffic.  If another vehicle is in your blind spot, you'll get an audio and visual alert warning you.  A little bleep in your mirror.  So you totally know.  The cross traffic alert uses the same technologies to warn you as you're pulling out of a...  Ever have this happen at a parking spot at the mall?  You know, there's two big SUVs on either side of your pickup trucks.  This happens all the time at Petaluma.  Everybody drives a pickup truck except me.  They're on either side of you, and you can't see around them.  So you're kind of slowly edging out of the parking space.  The blind spot assist is fantastic because it can see around corners.  It sees if there's any oncoming traffic.  So as you're slowly pulling out, you can observe,  and you'll know if somebody's coming your way.  That's a super neat technology.  They also have active park assist, and I've used that, and I can't wait.  Are you good at parallel parking?  Maybe you are.  Active park assist is better.  I don't care how good you are.  You push a button as you're driving by parking spaces,  and it's measuring the size of the parking space.  When it sees one you'll fit into, it says, whoa, parking space.  Pull forward.  You pull forward.  And then when you get to a certain point, you take your foot off the gas.  Keep your foot on the brake.  That was my mistake.  Keep your foot on the brake because once you park, you're going to have to stop the car.  And then it's so weird.  The wheel goes...  And you do all the perfect geometry pulling into the parking space.  If you've never used the active park assist on a Ford vehicle, you've got to try it.  It's amazing.  Amazing.  In 24 seconds, you're parked perfectly.  All you do is operate the accelerator, the gear selector, and the brake pedal.  I wish they'd told me that before I tried it.  That's all I want to say.  It is fantastic.  Ford is putting great technology in their automobiles.  Technology you can take advantage of if you get one of the new 2013 Ford Fusions or 2013 Ford Taurus.  These are available technologies in both, or you can go to ford.com.  Technology to learn more.  Thank you, Ford.  Ford has been such a blessing to us this year.  One of our biggest advertisers and a huge support to what we're doing here at Twitch.  So if it comes around that there's a time you need to buy a car, I hope you'll consider Ford  as a way of saying thank you to them for supporting us.  Now, ready to move on?  All right.  This next segment is...  Is Dvorak on this one?  Who's on this?  Well, we'll find out in a second.  Microsoft announced for the first time ever.  This was huge.  That they're going to make their own PCs watch.  So is it hyperbole of me to say the biggest week in the history of Microsoft from Microsoft's point of view?

Does it beat Windows 95 or Windows 3.0?  It's pretty close to Windows 95.  I would say.  It's pretty big.  It's a big deal for them because they're betting the company on Metro.  They're betting the company on their own hardware.  Rumor is that they may have their own phone.  That's a huge departure for Microsoft.  So maybe it is the biggest week.

End time: 4278.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do remember when the main Xbox, the first Xbox launch, that was a pretty big deal.  That was a big one, but the 360 I think was much bigger.  But I have to say this to me is huge because Microsoft's changing its business model.  John Gruber wrote a piece about it on Daring Fireball referring back to  a guy named Diddy Yu and I don't from Asimco blog.  Of course.  I don't know, but he wrote, I thought, a very intelligent piece in which he essentially said,  do the numbers.  And what Microsoft realized was the writing on the wall.  They'd made all their money selling expensive software on commodity hardware.  And really, I mean, we always, Dvorak would always joke, well, whose wallet would you  rather have, Bill Gates or Steve Jobs?  It's better to be in the low overhead software business because it's all profit.  But all of a sudden, that seems to have changed.  And Apple has proved that in fact, there's more profit in doing  inexpensive software on very expensive hardware.  And Diddy Yu's premise is Microsoft saw the curves intersecting and said,  we've got to do something about this.

Start time: 4278.14
End time: 4341.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Does that make sense to you?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I don't think that they're looking at it as they're going to make money on the  software.  I think that they're looking at it as one, you know, owning the whole banana.  As we say, and a lot of this actually kind of goes back before the iPhone.  As we really started to adopt mobile devices, something changed.  And that was we had integrated experiences.  And, you know, that would that means, at least my opinion, you know, a software stack and  a hardware stack that are very closely tied together and that are not necessarily  commoditized.  And if they don't work well together, the whole thing falls apart.  And so we started getting used to this and then Apple raised the game with the iPhone.  And then all of a sudden, it stopped being about operating system and hardware and,  you know, pick your hardware, pick your operating system.  It became single great experiences that people came to expect.  Right.  And I think that that's what Microsoft really realizes.  You have to at some point sooner or later to match the great experiences other  companies are creating.  You have to own the whole banana.

Remember, they don't make the PC.  They just make the software.  He says Apple, if we do a little math, makes one hundred ninety five dollars per iPad sold.  And as iPads start to outsell PCs.  We're talking about Surface.

Start time: 4369.78
End time: 4381.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why they had to do Surface because they were only doing the software.  And then, of course, Lenovo and Dell and HP are doing the hardware.  There's not much margin in hardware in the PC.

Start time: 4381.44
End time: 4401.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, this is a major competitive disadvantage that they had for their hardware partners in  the tablet space because I think what I'd read and I don't I don't have this confirmed yet because  I'm not sure if the final OEM pricing is out.  But I think I'd read that they were going to charge seventy five dollars to eighty five  dollars for Windows RT, which is their version of iOS.

Start time: 4401.68
End time: 4404.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that would be the licensing cost to a tablet manufacturer.

Start time: 4404.48
End time: 4421.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So if I'm Asus and I want to create a Windows based tablet, I'm going to have to pay seventy  five dollars just for the OS, which if you look at the breakdown of what goes into one of these  things, seventy five dollars is enormous.  That's more that's at par or maybe even slightly more than, you know, the incredible display on  the on the iPad 3.

Start time: 4422.26

Start time: 4426.40
End time: 4438.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's a huge competitive disadvantage to those guys because they can't compete on price with  anyone else if they have to do seventy five dollars cost for the OS.  So for Microsoft, that actually makes a lot of sense.

Start time: 4438.84
End time: 4469.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Plus the fact I don't know how good the hardware is going to finally be when we see the actual  final version of it.  But I would guess that Microsoft's going to do a really good job on the Surface tablet  relative to other companies that are going to create tablets using the same software.  In fact, I think Google did a superb job on its phones relative to HTC and some of the  other players in terms of the branding.  And so I think that essentially they're going to kill the entire ecosystem, which I don't  get it in that sense.  I mean, wait a minute.

Start time: 4470.14
End time: 4488.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, I think they're going to kill.  I agree that they are going to kill the ecosystem on the tablet on Windows RT.  But I think that there's still I mean, look at Dell, Lenovo, HP.  They've still got to sell Windows machines.  They're going to sell Windows 8, aren't they?  Or are they just going to be all Windows 7?  What about Robert?  You deal with business.  Business isn't moving to Windows 8.

Transcript:  No, it's not.  But this is why you've had in this last week, the CEO of Acer came out and essentially he  laughed.  He said they're not going to make this.  He said Microsoft was going to fail.  And the reason he gave for them failing is they're creating two products.  They're creating their own product and they're creating the third party market for the service  tablet.  But you know what?

Start time: 4516.16
End time: 4544.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said that would be another reason for Microsoft to do tablets.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Even at Computex, we didn't see a lot of Windows RT tablets.  Right.  I mean, it looked like I'm going to make a prediction.  I got two predictions.  And I agree with you, by the way.  It's not just financial.  It's also because integrating hardware and software makes sense.  That's Apple's big advantage.  Right.  They give a better user experience.  I think by doing what they've done, there's two things that are going to happen.  One, I don't think anybody's going to make a Windows RT tablet.  I think it's all going to be Windows 8.

Start time: 4544.94
End time: 4549.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I think you'll still see people making it.  The problem is they're going to be, well, go ahead and make a prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there aren't going to be many apps, even though there is.  In theory, you could push a button when you make a Windows 8 Metro app and it's a Windows RT app.  I just don't think...  We've seen so many tablets like the Playbook, like the Zoom, the Android tablets just die  because there weren't enough apps for those tablets.  There's no ecosystem.  So, 75 bucks.  It's an unproven system.  You can make it...  It's just going to be difficult.  You can make an Android tablet if you really want to make a tablet.  At least have a shot at it.  And Microsoft's kind of in the market.  So how are you going to compete against Microsoft?  So I think this kills Windows RT, except for a Microsoft product.  And I think they'll kill it quickly enough because it's not going to be selling very well  with just them making it.  I think it also means Windows 7 gets an end of life in 2025.  Because I don't think business wants to go to Windows 8.  I think Microsoft is going to essentially cede the Windows 7 market to the Lenovo's, the Dell's.  They're going to make Windows 8 Pro tablets.  And it's going to be a very different PC world.

End time: 4636.39

Start time: 4644.28
End time: 4666.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I guess it's kind of a...  That's going to do fine.  That's the Windows 8 Pro tablet.  Yeah, it's kind of pedantic.  It's an upside-down laptop.  It's not really a tablet.  This is a tablet.  It's basically a slate PC.  I mean, it's a full Windows PC.  So I wouldn't really kind of put it on the same...  It's going to cost twice as much.  It's going to do different things.  It's not an iPad competitor.  It's something different.

Start time: 4666.66
End time: 4681.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, I see this as driving something else.  One of the biggest trends that we're seeing in the enterprise right now is BYOD.  So you've got all these different vendors trying to figure out how to let the users  of a network bring the device that they want to bring.  Really what that means is smartphones and tablets.

Start time: 4681.86
End time: 4686.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4686.77
End time: 4695.06

End time: 4698.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they worried about the iPad becoming a dominant enterprise platform?

Start time: 4698.80
End time: 4730.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they are.  And that's why you've got the Surface RT.  What they want to do is they want to offer an option for enterprise people to say,  if you want a tablet, we can give you one without having to bring your own device.  We can give you a tablet experience that stays within this network that we've already created,  that uses all the same resources that we've already bought.  So I mean, I see that as the real impetus.  And why Microsoft released what was clearly an underbaked product.  No one was there.  That's the other question.

Start time: 4730.14
End time: 4733.45

Transcript:  I think I mean, look, if you if you zoom way out, you know, we're at year three of tablets,  basically, and it feels like it feels like Microsoft's tablet efforts since 2001,  which I don't because again, those were PCs and they were built as PCs.  So I you know, it's a different paradigm.  They didn't really know what to do yet.  Nobody really knew what to do yet.  They were they were they were dabbling.  We're in year three of tablets.  I think, you know, let's like zoom ahead 10 years, 15 years when tablets are,  you know, what most of us are doing most of our basic computing on  and have been for quite some time.  That could look totally different.  I think it's hard to say like way, way down.

It's not for me.  If I could only pick one device, it would be my laptop.  And I feel very weird about, you know, going on vacation with only an iPad.  It just it doesn't feel right.  There's a lot of stuff I know you can't do.

Start time: 4833.78
End time: 4851.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I mean, the MacBook Air, ironically, is not that much heavier than the iPad  and comes with a full keyboard and all the software you could possibly want.  And there's some ultra books out there that are going to fit that bill.  So I think that for those of us that are doing real work,  the laptop is still the machine of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the question, Robert.  Does business.  Microsoft argument is, well, you're using Windows in business.  You're using Exchange.  You want compatibility.  We're going to give you a Microsoft solution that's going to fit better into your enterprise  and the iPad.  But isn't that what Blackberry said?  You've got Blackberry Enterprise Server.  Isn't that what the Windows Phone 6 and 6.5 was all about?  Well, it integrates better.  It works with Office.  And that wasn't compelling when we got to the BYOD era.  People brought iPhones.  So Microsoft, I think, is is counting on the idea that,  well, we'll somehow integrate better into the enterprise.  Right.

Start time: 4893.08
End time: 4912.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's absolutely key.  And it's something that they have proven they haven't been able to do.  Nobody has.  They had an incredible opportunity with the release of Windows Mobile.  Tightly integrate it with Exchange to make it a no-brainer to be able to use in the enterprise.  And it's not there.  It's actually easier to set up an Android phone on Exchange Server  than it is to set up Windows Mobile.  And that's just ridiculous.

Start time: 4913.38
End time: 4972.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Your outlook and context don't sync with Windows Phone.  Are you talking about Windows Mobile or Windows Phone?  We're talking about Windows Phone.  Windows Phone.  Because Windows Mobile, that was the key feature of Windows Mobile back in the day,  up to 6.5, was that it had amazing whatever.  Exchange integration.  And that wasn't enough to save it.  Right.  So I think Microsoft probably looked at that and said,  OK, well, clearly, having a great office enabled product  and enterprise enabled product is not what's going to save us.  So we have to work towards the consumer first and then back our way into that.  And I actually, I mean, I think that's actually what they're doing.  So RG is a consumer product, not a business product.  They didn't really talk about the business story at this launch.  I mean, they really didn't.  It was very, very much a consumer focused launch.  And I think that's really important.  We're talking a lot about business.  But I don't think that this is intended to be a business product.  I think if we're talking about BYOD, they want this to be a device  that consumers feel comfortable with.  And then that's how BYOD.  That's how the Apple.  Right.  Which is, frankly, that's the strategy they should be taking.  Yeah.

Start time: 4973.20
End time: 5012.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I like your analysis of looking at this as year three of tablets,  because we could actually take it back.  Look, five years.  Five years ago, everything was netbook.  We were moving to the netbook.  And then people realized, well, the netbook doesn't really have everything I want.  Tablets became really popular.  People are now using iPads alone.  And they realize it doesn't have everything I want.  And so you've got on the other side, they're bringing out ultrabooks.  And the Surface seems to be just an ultrabook with a touch screen.  So it looks as if Microsoft is betting the farm on a strategy that says,  people want devices that are going to be like a tablet,  but will increasingly allow you to do more of the things you can expect out of a notebook.  I think it might fill a very nice niche that way.

Start time: 5013.32
End time: 5055.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I think at least in the higher and heavier version of the Surface,  Microsoft is also betting that people want to run their Windows software.  I mean, because there are certainly people who are out there who love their iPad,  but are frustrated because there's one or two PC or Mac programs that they simply can't run.  And I do think that there is a market for that.  But as pointed out, Microsoft has more than 10 years experience coming out with tablets  that are basically just little PCs.  So the question is, by having the hybrid with a metro interface and the desktop,  by making it lighter, taking advantage of newer technology,  can they finally crack that business market for people who want the tablet that also is a PC?  They claim it's a great tablet and a great PC, but that really remains to be seen.

Start time: 5056.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This rarely works.  Every time you try to balance multiple disparate needs within the electronics world,  it almost never works out.  Microsoft has made it work once.  I would say the Xbox 360 is a great example that they created a game console that was also an  amazing living room entertainment device.  But that was something that took them years to slowly develop,  and they're kind of really just now flushing out that side.  Like they got the games down and then they moved to the entertainment stuff  over the course of two, three years of software development.

Start time: 5087.36
End time: 5103.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  The one example where it's worked, the multifunction device, the printer-scanner.  In fact, and frankly, when those first came out, there was a lot of question about,  pardon my camera, there's a lot of questions about those too,  because they weren't all that good.  But that's about the only thing I can think of that really does multiple things well.

Start time: 5118.14
End time: 5133.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And they might still.  Or maybe not.  Maybe that's not, maybe they're thinking.  I mean, and that's kind of my point.  Whether or not they do or they don't, I think it comes down to,  if you hedge too much, everything suffers.  And at the end of the day, this is really about creating a great user experience.

It's a weird laptop.  Why would anybody buy that weird laptop for about $1,000 when you could go buy a MacBook Air?  Right.  I mean, somebody explain that to me.  It just makes no sense.  RT, I can see.  It's going to be really hard for them,  but I can actually see some people buying that and adopting it.  The Pro just makes no sense.  We've already seen.  Slate PCs do not sell.  They're highly verticalized.  You see them in the medical industry and that's basically it.  They don't move.  Nobody cares about them.  It's the worst of all worlds.

We're talking about Surface and a very big week for Microsoft.  We haven't even gotten to Windows Phone 8, which they also announced this week.  And we've got the right guy for that with Ryan Block from Gadget, gdgt.com.  From on the enterprise side, we've got Father Robert Balliser.  It's great.  It's perfect time.  And you see where Microsoft is in this weird hybrid world.  Right.  And then Larry Magid and I also who have to explain to consumers  that there are two kinds of Windows.  Windows RT and Windows 8 Pro.  And how do you explain the difference?  Right.  It's fun for me, actually.  I don't usually watch this week in tech because I'm, you know, I was there.  So I don't watch the show again.  And it's fun for me to see these because it reminds me what a fun show this is.  What a great show we do.  Thanks not so much to me, but to our producer, Chad Johnson, who puts this together.  When did you start this year?  When did Eileen?  Eileen Rivera did like the first half of the year and Chad took over.  And both of them did just such a great job putting these panels together  and are great panelists.  People like John C. Dvorak and Jolie O'Dell and Alexia Tsotsis and Harry McCracken and  Mike Elgin.  I could just go on and on.  We've probably had two or three dozen regular panelists throughout the year.  And every one of them bringing something fabulous to the table.  Ryan Block, Veronica Belmont, Joshua Topolski, Nili Patel from The Verge.  Just wonderful people.  Who else?  Cory Doctorow joined us this year.  It was so nice to have Cory.  He's so rarely available for us.  So it's fun for me to go back through time and look at these old episodes.  We're going to get an interesting one in just a second.  The Matt Honan hack in a bit.  But first let me tell you about something that is not a hack.  That is absolutely fantastic from Lantronics, the Xprint server.  I got a call today from a guy.  It was so great.  He said, I don't have a complaint.  I don't have a problem.  I just want to thank you for something.  He says, I listen to shows.  I love the shows.  This is on the radio show.  And I try to buy the products your sponsors advertise whenever I can.  He says, I have a USB printer.  I wanted to put it on the network.  And you were talking about this Lantronics Xprint server.  And I bought one.  And he said, I just got one complaint.  He said, I thought there'd be some installations, some configurations,  some driver downloads.  There was nothing.  I just plugged it in and it worked.  He said, this was too easy.  Xprint server lets you print wirelessly from your iPad, your iPhone, your iPod Touch.  It turns a USB printer into a network printer.  If you've got network printers, it makes them work better too.  No need to print through apps to install software, to email yourself documents for printing.  You print natively right from the iOS menu.  4,000 printers are supported, all the big brands.  And it's so easy because it automatically discovers and sets up all your printers,  USB and network.  You just open it, plug it in, and you're printing.  Just like our caller said, nothing to install.  Now, the Home Edition is normally $99 and supports up to eight USB  and two network printers.  For most people, that's enough.  We had a school administrator send us a note saying, I put this in my school network  and I found every printer in the whole school network.  She probably used the Office Edition.  That's $199 and that supports up to eight USB and unlimited network printers.  So it's a really great IT solution.  You can find out more at xprintserver.com slash twit.  And when you use the offer code twit, you're going to save 20% off your order.  So it's really affordable.  xprintserver.com slash twit.  And when you buy it, check out, use the offer code twit to save.  That's a nice, that's nice.  They upped that one to save 20%.  We thank Lantronics so much.  One of our new advertisers on this week in tech.  The name Matt Hohen, I've known Matt for years.  He is a, he writes for the Wired Gadget blog.  I've been a fan of his.  I think he's kind of been a fan of ours for a long time.  We've certainly chatted and I was so devastated, so sad  when he told the world he'd been hacked.  I mean, badly hacked.  They'd gotten to his Gmail.  They'd stolen his Twitter account and worse.  They got into his iCloud account and used a feature of iCloud to delete everything  on his iPhone, his iPad and his MacBook Air.  Matt was devastated, but I give him a lot of credit because he told the story.  He explained what happened.  He ended up talking to the hacker who did it.  We all learned, I think, a really valuable lesson thanks to Matt Hohen and his willingness  to share his mistakes, I guess, on the air.  When that happened, it was the few days after it happened, we called Matt and we got a  chance to talk to him on Twitter.  Here's what it sounded like.  But before we get into the meat of the matter, I wanted to introduce Matt Hohen.  I've known Matt for quite some time.  You might remember him from Gizmodo.  Are you working for Wired now or are you just a freelancer, Matt?

Transcript:  You had an iCloud account and you turned on a feature of iCloud, which I think is actually  a useful feature.  It's the remote wipe feature.  They've had for a while with the find my iPhone, you could remote wipe a lost iPhone.  I think this is new in Mountain Lion.  I don't remember it before.  The ability to remote wipe a laptop.

Start time: 5599.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It was certainly a Lion feature because I haven't upgraded to Mountain Lion on my MacBook yet.  What happened, if you're ready for me to get into it, was Friday, I left work a little early  and was home just before 5 o'clock.  I started playing with my daughter and my phone died, or it looked like it died.  I went to go plug it in.  When I plugged it in, it started up to the initial start screen that you get when you  first get a new iPhone.  It says plug into iTunes.  I thought that's weird, but things happen.  I went downstairs to connect it to my Mac, because I backed up really recently to my desktop,  and restored from that backup.  I'm sorry, I should say when I tried to log into iCloud, it said my password was wrong.  And again, I didn't think that much of it.  I went downstairs, flipped up my MacBook, and it almost instantly went to a gray screen and  asked for a PIN to log in, a four-digit PIN.  At that point, I knew I had real problems.  What turned out to happen was that someone hacked into my iCloud account using basically  social engineering techniques.  They were able to remote wipe my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.  Because I'm a terrible computer user, I hadn't backed up my MacBook in a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Actually, just Gmail.  That really exasperated things.  So what happened next was that the apology offense was basically,  and I've been in touch with the person who hacked into my account,  they were ultimately trying just to get my Twitter.  They just wanted my...  You had the Gizmodo Twitter account.  They weren't even trying to get to the Gizmodo Twitter account.  They just wanted Matt.  They just wanted Matt.  The Gizmodo Twitter account was just a bonus.  They didn't even realize it was connected until they got into mine.  You can link Twitter accounts.  And so at some point when I worked at Gizmodo, I had linked my Twitter account with Gizmodo's  Twitter account so I could not have to log in and log out every time from the web.  And that hadn't been undone since I left.  Even though you had left Twitter.  I mean, Gizmodo, yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  So I was still linked.  They didn't actually have password level access to the Gizmodo Twitter account.  They just had password level access to my Twitter account.  So what they did was they used a social engineering technique to get to my iCloud account.  They used my .mac email as the backup email for Gmail, got into my Gmail,  and used Gmail as the account verification for Twitter, and got into my Twitter account.  Wow.

Transcript:  Now you did a few things wrong and there's going to be pedantic people I know in our chat room  who said, well, if you had only done this, this, and this, and of course.  But this is the kind of thing we're all doing.  And this is kind of the reason I think it's a morality tale.  You at first thought your password maybe had been hacked or brute forced.  Right.

Start time: 5783.26
End time: 5868.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, that was my initial suspicion.  I mean, I just thought that I had a seven digit alphanumeric password.  That's pretty weak.  I've had it for years.  Yeah, and that's pretty weak.  I just haven't changed it near its out of laziness.  I don't use it anywhere else, but that's not a good answer.  I mean, most of my passwords, I use one password, and most of my passwords now,  the new password generator, 15 characters, 16 characters.  So I thought, okay, well, someone used some sort of technique to crack my password.  A lot of other people were speculating that someone had set up some sort of intercept  to a keystroke logger or something.  But as it turned out, the hacker told me, and Apple subsequently verified,  Apple tech support verified with me, someone called Apple tech support at 430 on Friday,  or about 430 on Friday, claimed to be me, knew some details, knew enough details,  and was able to have a temporary password issued.  When the temporary password is issued, they are able to log into  iCloud and completely change the password.  That was kind of step one.  Step two was wiping all my stuff so that I couldn't go in and stop them.  Step three was going into my Gmail, going into my Twitter.  Step four was they deleted my Google account,  and then they just went crazy on my Twitter account for several hours Friday.

Matt, do you feel in some sense, I know this might be a slightly insensitive question to ask,  but do you feel lucky in a way that these guys weren't evil and malicious  and skillful enough to hide their tracks for days or weeks while they mined your information  and maybe tried to social engineer some of your contacts?

Start time: 6000.70
End time: 6032.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Certainly, absolutely, 100%.  The first thing I did was call, before I even realized that my Gmail had gotten hacked,  first thing I did was call Apple.  And I was on the phone with their tech support for a very long time.  And I kept telling them, I've got to get off the phone and call my bank.  Because I was really worried that they were immediately going to go into my  online bank.  Once you get into somebody's email, you can get everything.  And I was worried they were going to go into my online banking,  go into any number of other accounts and just clean me out.  That was my big concern at the time.

But go ahead, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Go ahead.

Start time: 6055.90
End time: 6095.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay.  So you must have a pretty impressive address book with contacts that if somebody  wanted to social engineer people you know, people at Apple, people at Google,  people who are your sources, they could do a fair amount of damage and they could actually  use exploits and install keyloggers on those people's machines.  So in a sense, I mean, as a wake up call goes, this is a very painful and ugly one,  but the damage is hopefully contained in a way that it wouldn't have been  if somebody had been truly malicious and evil.

Start time: 6096.58
End time: 6122.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, it was certainly a wake up call to me.  I hadn't, to be honest with you, I hadn't considered, you know,  using social exploits to get to other people from my account.  But it was, it could, I mean, I hate to say it, but I just keep thinking I'm kind of lucky  because it really could have been a lot worse.  I'm really distraught about my data possibly being lost, but in the grand scheme of things,  it was not, I mean, it could have been so, so, so much worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Leo, something that happens when you do that is that it initiates a four-digit pin. Okay.  And only the person who presses that button gets to see that four-digit pin.  So if I'm on the other end, if you're on the other end and someone does that,  you don't really have any way to stop it. And this is one of the things that I think really ought  to be fixed about that situation is that, you know, if there's going to be a pin code ought  to be something that you set up or there ought to be a second password, there ought to be something  that lets the person basically stop this in their tracks or that at least, you know, has some sort of,  you know, secondary level of authentication before you can pull a trigger and remotely wipe  a hard drive. I mean, it's wiping a Mac. You know, I kind of gradually got into this. First,  I had to find my iPhone set up and then I was like, oh, well, I can do the same for my Mac.  And that's actually quite different than wiping an iPhone. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I feel like that  ought to be that ought to have better security. That'd be harder to do. Matt, I'm sorry this

I mean,  I actually probably would turn that off. You know where your Mac is.  I know, you know where it is. Yeah. I mean, it's like, what's, somebody asked me like,  what's the greater risk? Is it, is it actually having your, you know, your Mac physically taken  from your possession or having someone be able to get into it electronically? And I think it's  probably the greater risk, the more likely risk for a lot of people with a Mac. It's not a phone  is, you know, is, is having it broken into electronically.

I also think that we learned a lesson about where to send password recovery emails and to have kind  of a rotating set of emails and I have them all sent to one place. The hacker obviously thought,  knew that if he did these erasures, you would be very, it would be very hard for you to get

And then they, when they  realized that my Gmail was linked to, to dot Mac as the backup there is the verification there,  it was sort of like a jackpot moment for them. And, you know, having that all linked together was,  was a, was also a bad idea. And it's also something I've changed. I've set up two-factor

No, no, no, no,  no. And that's, no, that's not for you, Matt. Think about that. Apple's got more money than just  about any corporation in North America. And they allowed somebody to social engineer their way into  locking at you out of your digital life. That is, that's bad. Whether, whether that was a failure  between the keyboard and the chair by whoever was answering the phone or whether that was  a massive flaw in the way they institute the system, which I think we'll probably find  more out in your Wired article tomorrow.

I know there are a lot of  smart people working on other options. We don't have them yet. And, you know, I mean,  the ultimate failure point here was this temporary password that was issued.

I know that the  president has actually set up a special office where they're working on next-generation password  things. But one of the big problems is that Microsoft is working on one thing and Google  is working on another and Apple is working on another and Facebook is working on another and  everybody sort of has a vested interest in being identity providers. And that means that  you know, you don't get some sort of top-down standard. It gets really important too as we

Transcript:  it is. But it's just... My general take was Apple should not have... I think you're right, Brian. I  think that they were somewhat aware of the low end, but look what happened. Google came out and  said, okay, we'll take 50 bucks off the Nexus 7. The problem is you cannot compete at the low end  because neither Google nor Amazon has the same business model as Apple. Correct. Google makes  money when you use it. That's exact on the hardware. Amazon makes money when you use it. Services.

Transcript:  Apple makes money when you buy it. So when I covered the release of the Kindle HD and I spoke  to Bezos... That's what he said. And he said, I don't care if you have the first Kindle in your  drawer or this Kindle. He's like, we just care if you buy books and if you buy media from us.  Whereas for Apple, they care if you have the newest device. It's the hardware. It's the margin on the  hardware. They probably make some money on the ecosystem after the fact, but mostly it's on...  Here's the question for the crew. What's more important in the long run? Because I'm kind of  fed up buying new Apple devices. I'm not running out to... I think what's starting to happen is

Start time: 6865.38

Transcript:  So in the long run, does Amazon have a better business model because they're based on the

Start time: 6873.14
End time: 6919.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  media, not the device? In my opinion, the Amazon Kindle Fire HD, which I've used extensively,  is not very good. I agree. It's a bad UI. It's a bad UI. The Nexus 7 on the other hand is extremely  competitive. It's 200 bucks for 16 gigabytes. It's got a higher res screen. The only thing lacking,  it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I think most people don't care about that. And so my  recommendation was not to buy the mini. If price is an issue, get the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 is a  wonderful, wonderful device. And I think Apple should have, and I think you and I both before  the show agreed to this, not have said we're going to make a competitive low-priced product. We're  going to make a small iPad and we're going to charge whatever we need to charge to make it a  retina. Maybe like an iPad mini. Yeah, like an iPad mini, mega mini. Now do you think that they

Start time: 6919.54
End time: 6962.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  would have been better off if they had offered... because the press event was obviously, it was a  heavy focus on the iPad mini and then a minor focus on the latest revision of the iPad. I almost  feel like the fact that they tried to pull this, as they're very good at in general, this breathless  new innovation, something you've always wanted for essentially what's a mushy middle product.  It's something that pretty much just bridges the gap between your cell phone and an iPad. I think  they would have been better off if they played it down as an afterthought. You know, they focus more  on the new iPad revisions and then say, oh, BT-dubs, people seem to like smaller devices. So we made  one of those for you too, if you're interested. Then they could have charged a hundred dollars  more and nobody would have complained. That's not Apple's way though. Somebody has said on the

Start time: 6962.52
End time: 6971.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  thread, they feel bad for Apple. It's a $650 billion. That's never a good idea. I mean, they have  $121 billion in cash in the bank. The sympathies are misplaced. They could buy Greece. What's to

Start time: 6971.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 6980.36
End time: 6996.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember for years... But he said in the long run as well. In the long run. Because I remember  for years we said, who's wallet would you rather have? Steve Jobs or Bill Gates? Bill Gates had a  model where Microsoft paid very little for software. It's free. They don't have to... And  they judged a lot of money. But as time went by, Apple's business model actually turned out to be

Start time: 6997.02
End time: 7012.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the better business model. And I think part of the choice is, are they limited? Is there a declining  marginal return on the awesomeness of the hardware? Beyond which you're just not impressed anymore.  Well, that's what's happening. And then who has? What is the thing, the thread between all these

Start time: 7013.22

To iTunes, to my account, to the wallet they  have, to the investment I've already made in my TV subscriptions there? Or am I tied into Amazon  because of my book relationship with them and my shipping relationship, my Amazon Prime? Or is it  to Google with their burgeoning? Okay, so that's really interesting because I am tied into Amazon

Yes, but that's because it's a  one-time thing, right? It's an eye-watch at once. You don't save your TV shows and watch it later.  But books are kindled... So things that you want for an extended period of time, you want... You're  going to go with the brand that allows you to do that. Things that you want immediately, you'll go

Transcript:  not going to be a success. What we're saying is... What I believe is I bought this cable here,  right? That's driving me crazy. This is a Fire... Lightning. Lightning cable to USB. 29 effing dollars.  Okay, seriously? Screw you guys. Because this thing costs 50 cents to make because you know what?  Every single one of these cables that comes out, there's a third party that makes them,

Start time: 7099.38
End time: 7102.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they cost 50 cents. Actually, these have authentication chips and so they are more expensive.

Start time: 7103.62
End time: 7114.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  56 cents. Yeah. Right? I mean, that's a huge difference. I got more than 10% difference.  But as a customer... Sorry, go ahead. As a customer, it's annoying. It's like completely

Start time: 7114.32
End time: 7125.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  frustrating and disrespectful. And because Apple did have to move everybody from that 30-pin connector,  they should have really charged cost for these. At least to make up for the fact that you're going  to have some pain, you're going to have to buy a bunch of these. Exactly. I've spent $200 on lightning

Start time: 7126.04

In the short term,  of course, they're making money hand over fist, but they're eroding their long-term brand value.  This is the cash in. This is what you see. This is... Yeah, but I gotta say, they've been doing

Start time: 7152.82
End time: 7162.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this historically. Remember how much Apple charged for RAM? They stopped doing that, but they used to  charge five times what RAM cost when you bought a Mac with more RAM. Yeah. And it didn't hurt them,

Start time: 7163.62
End time: 7189.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  did it, Brian? Well, I mean, again, it's tough to say right now. I mean, in a post-jobs era,  it's very difficult to know whether or not any of these things are chipping away to what extent. But  in many ways, brands tend to get to the top of their game and then they begin to cannibalize  themselves because they can't resist taking advantage of all the power they have, not realizing  that for all the money they get, they are chipping away at their value. Absolutely.

Start time: 7189.62
End time: 7205.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and you saw that, you see with the cables, you saw with Maps, which was a forced downgrade  to many of its users, which had been led to expect a certain service level and then they violated that  trust and that expectation. Yeah. In fact, I talked to somebody on an iPhone 4 on the radio show today

Start time: 7206.26
End time: 7215.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and she, as you would normally do, installed iOS 6 because Apple said you should install the new  update. Why would you not? And all of a sudden it took away features. Yeah, your upgrades don't

So apparently  Johnny is a big fan of, I mean, he thinks that the Windows Phone 8 design is actually quite nice,

Start time: 7231.10

End time: 7260.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  non-digital. And Scott apparently thought it was crap. And so there was that and then there was  a lot of the stuff that happened with Apple Maps and apparently there was a big meeting with the  execs and they wanted to put out an apology and Tim Cook asked Scott to sign it and Scott refused,  which is what we reported. And Scott also just didn't play well with others. Now, old Malik said,

Start time: 7269.90
End time: 7290.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  though. You're the CEO. You want this apology. You're going to do this apology. And when you're  forced to sign it yourself because the guy responsible for iOS said, no, I'm not signing it.  I am not. Here's an example. This is this photo booth in Snow Leopard, which is fairly clean and  simple. Here's a photo booth in Lion. It's got red velvet curtains. It's got a wooden frame. And

Start time: 7314.14
End time: 7336.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  been hugely successful. Yeah, exactly. And I think that when what happened when Steve was  running the company, you can ask Walter Isaacson, Adam Lashinsky, all these guys that have written  books on this. When Steve was running the company, he enjoyed and he liked and he promoted the tension  within the company. He wanted that. He wanted that because it created creative force. And I  think it worked when you have people that are like, Shagomorphics is amazing and people are like,

End time: 7379.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  and I've heard this from several sources, very senior people too, and other people reported it,  he believed that he should have been CEO, not Tim.  There's a problem right there.  I think there's a problem right there. And the thing with Scott was,

Transcript:  When I interviewed Walter Isaacson, I did a Q&A with him after the book came out. And one of the  things that he said that really stuck out with me was, Steve Jobs was, there was half of him that  was this creative genius and there was half of him that was this technical genius, if you will.  And there was also problems. He's not the greatest guy ever, but that was the gist of it.  And when you take Tim Cook and Johnny Ive and you put those two together, they are that. So Johnny  is the creative genius, Tim is the business genius, and they together make what essentially  Apple was with Steve Jobs.

Start time: 7421.66
End time: 7431.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the last. I'll tell you why Siri's a failure. First of all, they bought a program Siri that did  more than Siri does even today. It never got out of beta. The network has been highly unreliable.  So I don't know about you, Brian, but don't you find that at least some large percent of the time  you try to communicate with Siri, she comes back saying, I'm sorry, I can't help you.

End time: 7552.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Siri should be  better than it is by now. It's just now. You should be able to download personality. You should be

And there was these great  things where you could say, you know, what are the five biggest lakes in California? Like, you know,  what's the temperature in South Dakota compared to the temperature in North Carolina?  Very hampered. And they've hampered all these things out. And I think that, you know,  if they're going to do it in beta, do it in beta. Like throw throw everything in there and let us  like have fun and play with it or strip it out and say it's not in beta or whatever it is that you

Start time: 7599.32
End time: 7630.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  what she's not going to do well. Right. Right. And I guess part of that, you know, it's very  compartmentalized. You could do the parlor trick of asking, you know, what's the mass of Jupiter?  And it calls up, you know, the stuff from Wolfram Alpha. And but but for sending texts, I very  rarely have her dictate texts to me. But when I'm out on my bike, I mean, there's there's nothing I,  you know, I got hands on the on the handles. I'm not able to do anything. And it's a big pain in  the butt to pull out the phone. So I use it a lot for that. And it's there are times I send out  texts. I'm like, it's close enough. Sure. Whatever. I do that all the time. And sometimes some

If it doesn't  work 98 plus percent of the time, it works zero percent of the time. And so what I will dictate a  query or transcription, and it pings the server and gives me a little beautiful purple dots,  and it comes back with zero.

And you vote yes or no.  Now, what do you think a yes vote does?  That you're for the death penalty.  No.  No, you're not or yes, you're not?  You're saying you're voting yes to repeal the death penalty.  But on the ballot, it says, Proposition 34, death penalty initiative, yes or no.  What do you vote?  So if you wait until you go to the ballot booth to decide what you're going to do,  it's too late. You screwed up.

Transcript:  There's a whole movement called Why Tuesday, which challenges why we even  forced this to happen on a Tuesday.  Give us some months.  If any truly freedom loving entity party person, whatever,  wants maximum participation, it makes the system more legitimate.  So if you're fighting to reduce participation, you're on the wrong side of history.
