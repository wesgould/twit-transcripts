End time: 256.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In meetings.  Well, it's great to have two former Fortuners and I'm not going to draw any conclusion from that.

Start time: 258.60
End time: 261.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They hired up.  Could be that.

Start time: 262.02
End time: 278.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then they whittled down.  Could be that.  Could be we don't know.  We do.  We do know.  I've been listening to Dan Lyon's book Disrupted on his abrupt departure from Newsweek and his attempt to make a life for himself in marketing.  And it's really funny.  Oh my.

Start time: 279.00
End time: 284.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The excerpts were funny.  I wondered if it would hold.  It holds.  Yeah.

Start time: 284.92
End time: 288.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's really a funny writer, actually.  I really like his stuff.

Start time: 288.70
End time: 295.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He once said he was never as funny as he was writing fake Steve Jobs.  He just never could do it again.

Start time: 295.32
End time: 308.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that would be a tough thing to top.  I'm not sure I agree with him because, you know, remember he also worked for two seasons of Silicon Valley, which was one of the funniest shows on TV.  What we don't know is which jokes he wrote.  So it could be he wrote the bad ones.

Start time: 308.56
End time: 314.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he was bad at Newsweek.  That was not good.  Yeah, no, he wasn't good.

Start time: 314.38
End time: 318.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  What was bad about him?

Start time: 318.96
End time: 323.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, because I've watched Apple.  He was just wrong about Apple.

Start time: 323.86
End time: 371.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's not hard to do, frankly.  I've been wrong about Apple many, many, many, many, many more times than I care to even think.  I was the guy who said Apple is going down because they're changing to the Intel chip.  Could I have been more wrong?  Can't blame me for that.  That seemed like a bad idea.  I remember also saying almost exactly what was it?  Ten years ago, 15 years ago, Apple going into retail.  Are you nuts?  Don't you see what gateway what happened to Gateway?  You fell into that.  Guess I was wrong there, too.  Now I'm saying Apple.  I remember saying very well when they said when the rumor was they were going to get the phone business.  It's the last business you want to get into.  That's like that cell phone business, a terrible business.

Start time: 379.98
End time: 391.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, John's being kind probably.  The latest is, of course, why would Apple get in the car business?  That's just the worst.  You're trying to compete against companies have been in this business for a hundred years.  Insane.

Start time: 392.31
End time: 396.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Have you any idea how complicated a car is?  Exactly.  That's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know how complicated it is?

Start time: 400.08
End time: 412.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think they're really going to do a full on?  I just I can't believe that they would do a full on car.  I feel like you got to understand how the car works before you can take it apart.  That may be what's happening.  And then they just come up with a new platform.

Start time: 412.30
End time: 422.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You think they're like a 12 year old kid taking apart cars like just to see what's inside.  You think that's what's going on in those secret bunkers in Sunnyvale?

Start time: 423.74
End time: 441.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I yeah, I just I'm going to I'm going to put it out there.  I'm like, I just can't believe they would actually do a car like a true Tesla style or car style car.  Maybe something about transportation when we get to self-driving cars.  But just I don't know, but I'm willing to be wrong.

Start time: 442.98
End time: 445.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they are.  I think they're building a car.

Start time: 445.80
End time: 447.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like they've put a lot of money into it.

Start time: 448.04
End time: 448.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have.

Start time: 448.58
End time: 455.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they've pivoted the company and they used to make smartphones and in the future,  they'll be making cars.

Start time: 455.48
End time: 485.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you agree with that blog post that says based on R&D numbers from above Avalon.  This came out May 11th.  Neil Seibert said based on the R&D numbers and the huge growth in the R&D budget over the last few years.  He said it was a pivot.  I mean a pivot implies that your current strategy has failed and you have to quickly turn to another one.  But in this sense, I think what he means is just as you said, Apple's looking at a new category.

Start time: 486.18
End time: 512.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually Katie Huberti at Morgan Stanley lifted that chart, did a better job with it.  Morgan Stanley came out and said, yeah, they're doing it.  They basically did for the buy side investors what above Avalon did for ordinary mortals.  You should put my new blog address.  We'll put that in.

Start time: 512.64
End time: 515.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry we didn't check your lower third before.  What is the new blog?

Start time: 517.02
End time: 520.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's called Apple 3.0 and the address is ped30.com.

Start time: 522.48
End time: 535.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Philip, I should point out, has a much better track record of Apple prognostication than I do.  I also, as long as we're being complete, said the Apple watch would be a flop and I love the Newton.

Start time: 537.10
End time: 549.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm just more cautious than you are.  I don't, I try not to say what's going to happen.  I wait till it happens.  It's a dumb thing to predict tech.  And it's dangerous to bet against Apple.

Start time: 550.70
End time: 552.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That doesn't feel like it's dangerous these days.

Start time: 553.62
End time: 574.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it depends whether you're talking about short-term bets in the options markets or whether you're talking about, you know, I mean, you know, everybody says the iPhone.  You just said that the iPhone, you know, business is dying.  So they have to pivot to cars.  Well, ask all of Apple's competitors whether they think the iPhone business is dying.

Start time: 576.15
End time: 589.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the stock market seems to be believers.  Apple tanked a little bit when Apple's, when the quarterly results came out and they showed that they weren't in fact growing the iPhone market.  But now what?  They're up about 10% over the last few days.  Yeah, that's, I think all...

Start time: 589.85
End time: 603.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that?  Is that profit?  Is that people?  No, it's Warren Buffett.  Oh, Warren Buffett.  Must be nice.  Must be nice.  Oh yeah, that's Warren.  It's not just him.  He actually bought it last quarter.  It wasn't even him.  It was Berkshire Hathaway.

Start time: 603.82
End time: 622.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's quick to point out it wasn't him at all.  He says, I only weigh in on buys more than a billion dollars.  It was one of his managers.  No, it was one of his managers who spent $950 million.  And I have to think the guy sitting there saying, well, stop, stop, stop.  He spent a little bit more.  We're going to have to call Warren.  Let's stop at $950.

Start time: 625.52
End time: 651.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this, you know, the last couple of weeks, the stock is, you know, it hit bottom and bounced finally.  And it's not Warren Buffett or even Berkshire Hathaway.  That's old news.  What it is is the value investors seeing they do what Berkshire Hathaway does.  So the money's been moving.  And also Apple, which wasn't buying back shares for a while, is now buying back shares again.  And that may be more important to those investors.

Start time: 652.02
End time: 654.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The fact that they probably can profit.

Start time: 654.80
End time: 664.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Berkshire Hathaway put in a billion dollars.  Apple just increased the amount it's going to spend on buybacks by $35 billion to give you a sense of the scale of things.

Start time: 664.20
End time: 696.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and also to give you a sense.  You know, this is not a stock market show.  And I'd be the last person to listen to any stock tips from me.  Or me.  Or you.  We wouldn't be journalists if we knew anything about the stock market.  We'd be out there driving our Fogattis.  But I look at Apple's, and I think that's what people are looking for if their value investors is a stock price that is below what it should be.  And I look at Apple's price to earning.  They're 11 bucks.  $11.17 P to E.

Start time: 699.66
End time: 705.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's before you take the cash out.  Ah, well that's the cash.  It's more like $8.

Start time: 707.71
End time: 711.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Amazon, what is Amazon's P to E?  It's like 8 billion or something.

Start time: 712.64
End time: 721.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's usually, you know, you can't chart it because it's so finicky.  But it's come down and now it's like 200 and something now.  Unbelievable.

Start time: 721.98
End time: 728.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So at the same time, I'd feel better buying Amazon stock maybe now than Apple.  I don't know. What do you think?

Start time: 729.26
End time: 742.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's all based on what people think it's going to grow.  Right.  And Amazon and Google are growing like gangbusters.  And Apple just had its first down quarter in 13 years.  So that explains the process.

Start time: 743.36
End time: 759.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But for our purposes, and we're not talking about what you should buy or anything like that.  You know, stock-wise.  We're talking about how companies are doing, what their future is,  and whether they're going to change their business because they have to.  Amazon's P to E right now is $293 compared to Apple's $11.

Start time: 763.33
End time: 781.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you look at Apple, Joe, is just selling physical goods,  which is kind of how people tend to see them.  You know, and you look at Amazon, which is in distribution.  It is in e-commerce.  It is now banking on kind of AI with the Echo.  That's a lot.  I mean, and the cloud.

Start time: 781.32
End time: 783.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they are the 10 billion dollar cloud business.

Start time: 784.50
End time: 787.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a big business for them, even though they suck at it.

Start time: 789.26
End time: 791.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think they suck at it.  Really, Christina?

Start time: 791.82
End time: 794.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think they've done a good job with their services?

Start time: 794.62
End time: 796.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do. I think AWS has been a huge success.

Start time: 796.22
End time: 820.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you're talking about Amazon.  I was talking about Apple.  I'm sorry.  Stay with the thread.  I'm sorry.  Hey, can you boost Christina's volume up?  She's not as loud as the rest of us.  You must have had some sense, though, Phillip,  what we're going to talk about, because I look at the blog post you wrote,  I presume earlier, tonight on Twitter, Apple is doomed.

Start time: 821.52
End time: 823.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I just knew that it was going to come up.

Start time: 823.66

Start time: 833.22
End time: 842.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People don't understand irony on the Internet.  I would be the last person to say any company with $200 billion in cash in the bank is doomed.

Start time: 844.35
End time: 853.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you have to subtract the 80 billion that they borrowed  to give back to shareholders.  It's about 240, and then you minus 80, so it's like a hundred and something.  160 billion, I'm sorry.

Start time: 856.26
End time: 857.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only 160 billion.

Start time: 858.32

Transcript:  I loved, I mean, as long as we're talking Apple, I loved this Boltz blog.  I've actually bookmarked this because I thought it was so great.  This is on Medium.  Ben Einstein, product designer, lover of hardware, founder and polter at Bolt VC.  It's a venture capitalist.  No, you can't manufacture that like Apple does.  Too many startups, he says, look at Apple's manufacturing and say,  oh, I want to do it like that.  I want laser drilled holes.  I don't want to see any mold marks on my plastics.  I want to make a white plastic device.  And he says, you can't.  Just give up on it.  Here are a few things Apple does that can cause problems for a startup.  White plastic, it's the hardest color to do.  Even Apple had a hard time with, I think it was, what was it?  It was a white MacBook or something.  They had to put it off because they couldn't get the parts to match.

Start time: 917.20
End time: 918.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you know what they do to fix that?

Start time: 919.22
End time: 920.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The white iPhone, that's what it was.

Start time: 921.72
End time: 939.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can, you'll see this if you look at your products that are white.  They do a shiny finish on one spot and where the joins are, they do a matte finish.  And then they're like, oh, we chose this because it's like water, it's smooth.  And then we went with this more granular gritty finish.  I'm like, yeah, huh?

Start time: 941.33
End time: 954.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't do CNC.  Expect to do it at Apple scale.  What happened when Apple wanted to see the CNC machines?  A million MacBook bodies, those aluminum bodies, they bought 10,000 CNC machines to do it.

Start time: 956.08
End time: 960.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Computerized numerical controller or something like that?  Yes, those automated whatever machines.

Start time: 962.60
End time: 965.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's automated milling.  It goes through.

Start time: 965.20
End time: 977.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you.  That's the word.  Yeah.  How about when they wanted to laser drill holes in MacBook Pros for the sleep light,  but only one company made a machine that could drill those 20 micrometer holes in aluminum,  so they bought the company.

Start time: 979.20
End time: 981.82

End time: 1008.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the one that got me though, because I look at Apple boxes and it kind of,  you know, I'm the guy that does the recycling in the house.  And every Monday I have to break down all the boxes.  And there are a ton of boxes that I have to break.  I spend an hour every Monday night breaking down boxes for the recycling.  And it's always the Apple boxes that you almost feel like I'm destroying a work of art here.

Start time: 1008.40
End time: 1035.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Do you remember the original iPod box that was origami?  No, I don't.  I loved that box.  So the original iPod box would kind of fold out in different ways.  And it had kind of overlapping things.  It was a square and you had to fold it in a certain way.  It was like an origami piece.  It was so great.  And, you know, I remember I kept that box for years,  even after I got rid of that original iPod, just because the box was so fantastic.

Start time: 1036.61
End time: 1038.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ben writes,  A basement full of boxes.

Start time: 1038.66
End time: 1072.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to throw them out.  Look at this. This is the Apple watch box.  The squares, it's like you use the CNC machine on the cardboard.  This is perfect. Perfect squares.  And of course, it's a vacuum, right?  So you can't just pull the lid off.  It's tight, so tight that it's a vacuum.  And then the foam inserts, he says, Ben writes,  Four colored doubled walled matte boxes and HD foam inserts.  I know you're going to do this anyway,  but be aware of these kinds of boxes will literally be the most expensive line item on your build of materials.  It's not unusual for them to cost upwards of $12 a unit at scale.

Start time: 1076.57
End time: 1082.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  They spend something like $3 for those rows of Chinese workers to assemble them.

Start time: 1082.62
End time: 1100.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But the box, you're assembling a box that costs more than you do per hour.  This, I mean, look at this.  And then I break them down because what I'm not going to keep this, but I feel terrible doing it.  I feel like I should feed this to a starving child in Ethiopia.  That's bad. I should not say that.

All right. I was it was there's a lot of Mac stuff, but somebody in the chat room is pointing out quite rightly.  So that Apple is the Donald Trump of the tech journalist.  It's the one week.

Never mind.  I'll take it home.  It's fine.  I don't want to talk about that.  And yet we live in this era where people are so concerned about privacy.

Transcript:  You know, I had to get a hybrid, not a Prius, but made by Toyota.  I forget the name.  Started because someone had left the light on for a week in an airport parking garage.  And two things are weird.  One, this this car has a huge battery in it, but it can't be used to start the car.  Exactly.  That's what she's saying.  Well, no, but it to start its own car.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.

Start time: 1459.30
End time: 1465.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 1500.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when that one goes dead, they don't they could, but they haven't connected the two batteries.  The second thing is when the guy came to open it up, neither of us had a manual and it was really quite tricky finding where the the plus and minus were.  They're not big red buttons with junk all over them.  They're under little little things you have to flip up.  And then they don't look like the normal things.  They look like USB ports sort of.  So it was a whole new world.  You wrote an article on pivoting from smartphones to smart cars in which apparently a car is jumping another car.

End time: 1545.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, will it be?  I think that's a much different question, because I don't know if they can get the scale that's necessary.  Getting pushed back.  And there's the Bolt Chevy Bolt, which is a thirty thousand dollar all electric car.

Start time: 1547.64
End time: 1556.14

Start time: 1565.36
End time: 1579.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't live.  No, no, that's the new one.  See, that's the thing.  So the Volt has a little gas engine, little generator.  I shouldn't call it an engine, a generator in it to charge the battery.  The Bolt is all electric and they claim they say they're going to have a couple hundred miles range, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I mean, that's what I mean.  I desperately want my mom to get a Tesla.  And that's always her fear.  They live in the suburbs of Atlanta and there are some some stations in Atlanta proper, but they're like 40 miles away from their house.  And so, you know, they're driving a lot.  I'm like, yeah, you know what?  This would probably not work for the distances you drive.  You would probably frequently be freaking out about am I going to make it to get charged?  It's not for everybody.  Which which I mean, which I think that's the biggest thing that even beyond the mass production that has to be solved, right, is is making it so that there are charging stations that are accessible everywhere so that people can, you know, pop in and charge up.

Start time: 1668.66
End time: 1675.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course, that's what Elon Musk tried to solve with the superchargers.  They're free Phillips for Teslas, but they have to be near you.  Yeah.

Start time: 1676.52
End time: 1708.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're they have to be near you.  And there's only like the one between our like Austin and Houston that we stop at.  I think it's got six ports or six not ports, whatever you want to call it.  Little parking spots.  Yeah.  Plugs. That's it.  And it's it's fine.  Most of the time, but during like a busy travel weekend, it might get kind of full.  And then the other thing is once the Houston floods happened, it was flooded.  I'm still not sure if it's ready.  But before we take the Tesla down to Houston, we've got to check.

Start time: 1708.82
End time: 1711.58

Start time: 1733.58

Start time: 1740.80
End time: 1752.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in this case, we're talking about putting up charging stations roughly where you have gas stations now.  So if the gas station, it's more than that because how long does it take?

Start time: 1752.46

Let's talk about actually let's take a break and talk about Google Oracle.  We can also there's lots to talk about.  I have many many a topic on our list here, but I also want to defer to you guys because it's always fun.  We get people on the show and it's Stacy's first or second time on the show.  It's Phillips. He's been several times.  And Christina is a regular, but it's always fun to let you guys choose what you want to talk about.  So I'll open it up to you in a second.  Meanwhile, as long as we're talking about car tech, I want to talk about something you can do with your car.  Any car made since 1996.  And that's this. This is the automatic. This is so cool.  So every car in the United States and I think all over the world made since 1996 has a port underneath the steering wheel.  You probably never noticed called the onboard diagnostic Porter OBD to.  And you know, if you do notice it, you think, oh, yeah, that's that's when I take it into the shop.  They're going to plug in their computer. Well, did you know you can plug in your own device?  This is the automatic plugs right into it. Easy to do.  There's no tools or anything. It just snaps right in there.  And then you pair it to your phone with Bluetooth, iPhone or Android.  And suddenly, you know what's going on inside your car.  Everything from what is that light that just warning light that just come on mean and where's the nearest gas station?  A repair shop. Do I take it to to how hot your engine is, how fast it's revving, how much gas you've used,  how much that last trip cost you?  Because the automatic also knows what gasoline costs at the gas station you use last.  So they know exactly how much it costs. You can ask your if you have an Amazon Echo, you can say to the Echo,  hey, ask my automatic how much gas is in the tank. Oh, you have half a tank left. Oh, thank you.  It'll work with not just your Echo, your Nest software like your mechanic.  It'll work with fresh books if you want to track mileage for business.  If this than that. I use it all the time with if this and that.  I have an if this and that script that when I pull up to the studio tweets, hey, Leo just pulled up.  Let's get something going.  Be just as good for your teenagers if you wanted to keep an eye on them.  There's even a 24 7 crash response feature, which helps you know that automatics keeping your loved ones safe on the road at all times.  They have software for teenagers to that ties in with the automatic works with the Apple Watch and Pebble 2.  And best of all, you might look at this and say, wow, how much a month? Nothing.  There's no subscription fee. No, no, nothing. It's ninety nine dollars.  And that's it. And we're going to make it even more affordable because and by the way, they never sell your data.  Your data is yours. If you go to automatic dot com slash tweet, you're going to get 20 percent off when you use the offer code.  Tweet at checkout. I love my automatic. I just love knowing, you know, it's I kind of play a game with it.  See how if I can get a good score, you know, oh, you got 80 percent driving to work today.  Try to get 90 percent next time. And that just means you get better mileage and you're a safer driver.  I love it. Automatic dot com slash tweet.  Twenty percent off when you use the offer code. Tweet at checkout.

You know, when I started doing this stuff for Fortune, it was me and a couple of other people and they really weren't paying attention.  But after the spin off, after Time Warner let timing go with the start, they sat up and started paying attention.  Well, they realized they had to make money on it.  And so they got into the same business that every legacy media is in now.  And it's like it feels like a death spiral where they have to get more and more ads.  They're basically trading, you know, print ad dollars for Internet pennies.  And they discovering that they have to pump a lot of ads past a lot of eyeballs to make what they used to make, you know, on dead trees.  And it's a tough business. And what they did at Fortune is they they staffed up.  They got some really good people, Stacey and a bunch of others from from Giga Ohm.  But they also hired a bunch of kids and put them in a kind of a bullpen in something they called the SEO Speedwagon for search engine optimization.  And it's kind of like the Huffington postization of Fortune magazine where they, you know, they're going for the stuff that gets clicks.

Start time: 2104.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we can get there in a second. But just to be my my particular thing was that there were these kids were chasing Apple stories, which I would do if I were them.  So I get up in the morning and think, OK, what I'm going to write about today and all one after another, the subjects that I was going to do.  One of the guys had already claimed.  And so I was navigating this every time I had to pick a topic, I had to navigate this thing.  Anyway, so it's so great. It's not so bad to have competition among your writers, is it?

Start time: 2150.38
End time: 2153.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good to have competition, but I'm competing already with 100 other people who write about Apple every day.  And I didn't need to compete with with my own team.  So they base, you know, I think we talked about this.  They said, OK, you can't just write about Apple anymore. You got to broaden your scope.  And for me, you know, it took a long time to build a reputation as someone who covers Apple.  And it was just it was like walking away from my niche. It didn't make sense.  So so I did what I had been talking about doing for a long time, which is going off on my own, which Stacey has also done.  And a lot of other people, the Ben Thompson's of the world, the John Gruber is the is the classic example.

Start time: 2195.40

She's doing this Stacey on IOT. Yeah.  And I did it. I mean, I still keep my foot in the mainstream waters with a radio show, but really twit for 10 years now.  The main reason I did it was because I didn't want to. It wasn't so much I saw the writing on the wall.  It was more I just didn't want some idiot to tell me what to do.  And I also didn't want to have to work hard as we did at Tech TV for six years so that some guy could just say, I'm tired of this and sell it.  You don't own your own destiny when you work for somebody. And so but at the same time, come on, admit it.  It's kind of scary doing what we're doing. Oh, it's hard. Yeah. Yeah.

I am so like, were you a barista? Did you work at it?  I could be. Yeah, I have a lot of faith. I always keep that in mind when I see a help wanted.  I think, well, OK, just in case.

Transcript:  So good. You know, to some degree that there's been some disappointment in I think what the Internet has become.  I think a lot of us at the beginning thought, oh, this is going to be this amazing force for democratization.  Everybody's going to get a voice. The the oligarchs, the plutocrats who controlled media will be disenfranchised.  It's going to be ultimately democratic. Information will flow freely.  And all of that did happen. But what we maybe didn't anticipate is what a problem it would cause, what a disruption it would be for the old media in such a way that so many so many traditional and useful things disappeared.  And so we I guess we lost as much as in some ways we lost as much as we gained.  I don't know. You're I mean, Christina Warren, you're a child of the Internet. Yeah.  And and your Internet native, you know, Mashable is, you know, the kind of the king of Internet native.  Do you look back and feel that we've lost anything? Yeah, I mean, sort of.

Transcript:  I mean, it's weird because I remember when I started writing professionally, I specifically chose to do web rather than print.  I started off kind of doing both.  And I made the decision to do web versus print because I felt like that was the future.  And I was fortunate enough that when I started writing, you could still kind of make a name for yourself online because even though it was the mid 2000s, the legacy media still was down on blogs and didn't really understand that this was where everything was going.  And but it became very clear once once everything started moving from from from print to digital that the establishment was not going to be willing to give up what was there.  And I do feel like we've lost certain things.  I mean, you look at all the great newspapers that have closed, you know, and great journalism that goes away.  And that's really disappointing.  But then you even look at, you know, websites and that come and gone over the years.  And and so, I mean, I think media is just hard.  I think that's that's this kind of kind of the long the short of it.  It used to there used to be a business model that works differently.  And there used to be kind of a, you know, people who would fund media for different purposes that doesn't quite exist anymore.

Transcript:  And I kind of thought we'd gain more than we lost, though.  I thought and this I'm starting to get a little discouraged by the state.  For instance, the idea that there could be a thousand blogs covering Apple.  Yeah, all the different angles and facts would come out and we'd as users, as consumers, we'd have more information and be more informed.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that it comes down to at least with certain certain industries, especially with kind of business and tech journalism.  There aren't as many interesting stories to tell if we're being totally honest.  I mean, there might be you can always are you.  Oh, well, there's things that are being unreported, uncovered.  OK, fine. Then cover that. But there are things that people are interested in and you are chasing eyeballs.  You're wanting to get what people want.  And the truth of the matter is that there's kind of this, you know, middle 80 percent, you know, in kind of your bell curve stuff of stuff that people want to read about.  And so everybody's going to write that stuff. Everybody's going to write that.  And the thing is, at that point, yeah, you have a thousand different sources, but you're all competing for one another.  And the biggest ones are going to be the ones that succeed.

And you guys would have to like let me know, because I mean, I would know this maybe a little bit as a newsreader, but I don't know this as from any professional experience or any personal experience.  But how different is it from, you know, the era when there might be, you know, extra, you know, three or four local newspapers as Ken from Chicago saying in chat?  You know, I mean, I remember when in Atlanta there was both the Journal and the Constitution and then they merged.  And you have to wonder, you know, aren't they weren't they just chasing one another to re report the exact same things and fight for the same stories?  And so I wonder how much of it is feeling nostalgic for a time long past that wasn't that different than where we are now.  You know, if you had a bunch of local newspapers that were basically writing the same stories, is it just nostalgia for a past that ever existed?

You have to create a brand.  I mean, you know, there's a lot of work to that, but there's the opportunity to do it.

Transcript:  Well, it is the worst of times in that there's a generation of journalists who are out of a job and they feel bad about that.  Yeah. And there's newspapers across the countries that have folded.  It's mostly the work of Craigslist because they we know the dirty secret was these newspapers are being funded by legal ads and and want help wanted ads classifieds.  It has created huge opportunities. What I'm disappointed, you know, that anybody can now own a press and have enjoy freedom of the press.  But I'm disappointed in how it's turned out. I think the echo chamber is a real and and worthless thing that nine to five Mac will will get some scoop and it will be, you know, be embarrassing.  There'll be, you know, forty five stories about it the next morning, adding very little value because they've learned that that pays.  They can they can just repurpose a nine to five Mac scoop in three paragraphs and they'll sell enough ads that it justifies it.  But it's it's not taking journalism anywhere good.  And the question really that remains is who is going to pay for the reporting?  You know, in the old days, I worked for a magazine that used to have bureaus in Bangkok and Hong Kong and Baghdad and Paris and every major city in the world had a time magazine correspondent in there or stringers who could be counted on to deliver reporting and whenever needed.  Those bureaus have almost all been closed, along with the bureaus that were for the L.A. Times and the Boston Globe and the smaller major newspapers.  And now we have the New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal are the only really serious national newspapers in the U.S.  And we have USA Today for the hotel rooms.  And it's not it isn't like it used to be.  Now, some of those were killed off by television and some of them were killed off by radio.  But nothing like the damage that happened when the Internet disrupted and pulled the rug out from under their business model.  So it remains to be seen.  I think that I think there is great stuff being done on the Internet.  And I won't hurt anybody's feelings by naming names, but I think the people who know that they're doing good work know it.  And the people who are doing schlock page click stuff know it as well.  And we can only hope that the market rewards the people who are doing good work.  Now, you know, now maybe is where we talk about Gawker because it is probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say I was changing my mind to say that I think the business model, the opportunity is still there.  I think what people are confused about is how to match that to the right business model.  And if you can like what I'm doing is probably never going to be a massive media empire.  Right. So as long as I can keep it up, I can make a living wage for myself.

Start time: 2880.38

Transcript:  Haven't we seen this, though? Now, OK, I'll use the example, the music industry, where it was ruled by a handful of multi platinum artists who took all the money out of the out of the the ecosystem.  And and then and but now we have such a different world where you're not going to get maybe a multi platinum as many multi platinum artists, but many more musicians can make a living.  And isn't that a better situation?

Start time: 2906.32
End time: 2936.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Except that only that's happened for the music industry.  I think the music industry, again, it's you have you have again, you have like three artists, you have like Adele, you know, what's your fiance.  And you make the money. Yeah, it's fewer.  It's fewer. Well, what they've had to do is they've had to shift and go.  There was a period of time about about 20, 30 years where you could actually make a lot of money selling music.  That has changed. That is no longer the case since Napster and since the music industry.  I mean, you know, having ACDC selling 100 million albums.  No, but you but you still have them touring and that's where they make money and that's shifted to.

Start time: 2936.26
End time: 2949.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's become a long term opportunity, though, of Spotify and the new music ecosystem is that more bands can make a little money.  The artists I talk to know they're not making any money.

Start time: 2961.24
End time: 2983.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the music industry, I mean, but I think it actually makes a lot of sense with newspapers and with with with traditional media in general.  And that I think in both cases, they were disrupted.  And it wasn't so much that there wasn't an opportunity for them to fight the disruption.  It's that they refused. You know, you look at a legacy media and so and I look at it and go, well, obviously, Craig's list was part of the problem is, though, that we're in the middle of a transition.

Start time: 2984.46
End time: 3059.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's hard to say where we're headed.  Certainly what we can see is disruption.  But I think in the, you know, maybe 10 years out, if you're an artist, you're what you're going to say is I'm not going to sign with a label.  I'm going to do my own thing. I'm going to have a website. I'm going to sell music directly to the fans.  I'm going to build a community that supports me, not because they have to buy my music because they don't.  They can steal it. But because they want to support me by buying my music, they'll come to my shows and that that kind of artist.  And I think that that there are artists now already starting to do that more and more.  That's going to exist. Will in the long run with their album.  Yeah, I mean, I think of Jonathan Colton and I'm freezing McGee.  I think a lot of unsigned groups who are going around now are making a decent living.  They're not going to sell 100 million albums, but they're making a decent living.  And so I only only bring this up as a kind of a metaphor for what democratization could ultimately be, which is fewer people get really rich.  But there's a broader base for journalists like Stacey and and and you, Philip and me to make a living doing what we want to do, serving an audience directly.  And that's the key, by the way, is that direct relation, I think the direct relationship with the audience.  So the audience wants to support you by patronizing you.

Start time: 3063.54
End time: 3081.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe you do have to give up a lot of yourself in a way that's not I mean, I never wanted to be an entrepreneur.  And I think that is something that's not everybody can do that.  Yeah, right. And I mean, a it costs money.  B, it requires a certain mentality.  And you know what? There are a lot of artists who are space cadets who aren't going to do this.

Start time: 3083.30
End time: 3115.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so those people relied on the music label to do all the work so they could just kind of space out those.  Those, you know, it's going to be the musicians, the journalists, the plumbers who can create a business and understand the need to build an audience in a community that will succeed.  So it's not just that one skill anymore.  Being able to play a guitar.  OK, I don't see that as the worst thing in the world.  I do worry about those people who have that single skill.  But maybe kids going up today will understand.  I was going to say, what does that say for art?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's your point. But Van Gogh wasn't.  You know, he had people who were mean and he kind of died poor.  But I mean, he had people supporting him. But, you know, you look at it for his brother, he would have died earlier and he still died young and poor.

Start time: 3137.62

Transcript:  I'm going to say something very controversial, and I may not even fully believe it.  But I think of Andrew Sullivan's article about the America has never been more ripe for authoritarian government.  And his contention is that it was the elites protecting us.  And I'll extend this to journalism, that what we lost with the democratization was this sense that and think about network news.  Edward R. Murrow created a brilliant news organization at CBS, even though that was going to be a money loser because it was prestigious.  And the elites were interested in creating a prestigious, important thing and making money, putting commerce in a different realm.  But the problem is when it's a bunch of us little guys and we all have to make a living, it's democratized.  We can't do that. We can't say we're going to do this because it's important, because it's right, not because it makes money.

Because it's right. It's right to cover. You know, CNN has closed all its international bureaus, right?  Even Vice now just closed its London bureau. You know, these things are expensive.  You do them not to make money. You do them because it's the right thing to do.  And you can only do that, frankly. Maybe you can only do that when you have a plutocrat who says, well, I'm I'm willing to spend money on the Washington Post.  I'm willing to spend some my Amazon billions on the Washington Post because it's the right thing to do rather than the profitable thing to do.  Should profit drive journalism?

They're often the best ones are often family owned.  I mean, the New York Times family keeps it alive. Washington Post for years.  Right. The interesting example is the Herald Tribune, which was a better newspaper in many ways.  But the family at some point stopped caring about it and they just kept taking money out of it.  And just before World War Two, when the New York Times was pouring money back into the operation and setting up these bureaus in Europe,  the Tribune was taking was closing down bureaus.  And when World War Two hit, the Times had people on the ground ready to report the biggest story of the decade of the century.  And the Tribune didn't. And it died.  They blamed their death on the unions, but it was really that they stopped paying for the reporting.  Now it's a different group of guys now, the plutocrats that you're referring to, I guess, the Internet billionaires.  And what we learn is that they can they can buy they can save newspapers like the Washington Post by buying it with Amazon.  Funny money. Or they can close down an operation by tying it up in lawsuits.

Frankly, because I remember speaking with him when he bought it and you very much got the sense that he was a Facebook founder and had lots of money.  And I very much got the sense that this would be yet another thing to add to his toys.  Exactly. And then and then it realized, oh, wait, this is actually a really complicated situation.  This is a brand that has been through a lot that's already been kind of damaged and has been suffering.  Then there's the price of bringing some new leadership and ends up having a mass staff exodus because that didn't work and never does.  And then just got rid of it, sold it.  It does seem like the person it was sold to is at least trying to take it back to what it was before.

Transcript:  And he's admitted this. And I'm glad I'm surrounded by journalists because this is one that's very difficult for me.  On a personal level, I loathe Gawker and I understand why Peter Thiel hated Gawker.  They outed him against his wishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He told all his friends. So I'm going to tell the rest of the world is his attitude.  Right. Yes. And I'm sorry. I don't buy it. Gawker, by the way, is the king of rationalizations.  Every single crap article they've published has a similar rationalization.

Start time: 3601.20
End time: 3611.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, no. I would say, though, that in this case, I mean, Owen Thomas has been very clear from the beginning.  He doesn't feel that it was outing. Owen is an ass. I'm not saying Nick Denton is an ass.

Transcript:  Those are the worst kind of people ever.  They're horrible. And talk about going for the money as opposed to going for the self-interest.  And then they justify it with, well, you know, Silicon Valley's never been covered and they deserve to.  And that's BS. And yet I as much as I hate to admit it, it's completely wrong for Peter Thiel to fund lawsuits against them, either either openly or covertly.  I'm very torn on this. And I believe in the First Amendment.  The last thing you want is billionaires deciding, oh, we're going to risk even if there's no merit in this, we're going to sue these guys out of existence because we don't like what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're everybody who knows Nick and Owen and all the other. Sam says they're nice guys.  I'm sure Hitler was a nice guy in the bunker.  Hitler wasn't not a nice guy.  I'm just saying there's a difference in personal what you personally apprehend about somebody and what their output is.

Start time: 3684.86
End time: 3697.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Gawker's rationale is if we're going to dig up anything that we find interesting that we think people will click on.  And it's not that different from most websites, except most websites have better taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would say it. So there's a legitimate. OK, I'm not saying it's completely legitimate, but having someone report on the people who are in power in Silicon Valley makes sense.  Absolutely. People are dictating all kinds of things. His sexuality is not.

Start time: 3717.16
End time: 3722.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 3796.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, in that case, I in the in the concept of that article, I agree with you.  But I just just to make I mean, I'm not in any way advocating the outing of anyone at all, having said that at all.  But I don't think that you can say that sexuality and some of those issues are not germane to certain things, especially when there were bills like Prop 8 happening at the time and people who are are quiet or not quiet.  I mean, Brendan Icke was fired for good reason, I think, from Mozilla because he backed Prop 8.  And when that came into into account, he was fired from Mozilla.  Are we going to say that that was something that shouldn't have been public, that there should have been reporting about the fact that he'd given money to anti gay causes and then wanted to be the CEO of a company?  I think that it's more nuanced than that.  Sometimes people's personal lives and what they support and what they say can have an impact on the bigger picture and what their investments are and what the things they stand for are.  I would never have published what Owen published.  And I never would have written that in.  And I don't know if I'd ever want to work at a place that would have done that.  But I don't think that it's as easy and cut and dry to say that the things that the Gawker has published didn't have news value because I think that many of them, even as distasteful as they might be, totally do.

Start time: 3796.26
End time: 3803.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might disagree with you on that.  And by the way, I think I don't think it was Gawker that added Ike on that.  I don't think it was either.

Transcript:  I think we're in the middle of a big historical shift on quote unquote important issues.  So like if you think back into like even even Kennedy covering President Kennedy and all of his affairs, everyone in the press corps knew it, but no one wrote about it.  And that's shameful.  I agree.  I agree.  And we can look back on this perhaps as, you know, as people who are gay or normal.

Start time: 3841.28
End time: 3882.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that he was an entrepreneur, not a president of the United States.  I mean, the case you would make for Kennedy being sexuality being reported on is because he's the president of the United States.  And perhaps he'd be vulnerable because of this.  Maybe.  You know, I don't know.  I mean, and by the way, it's all moot because we have the First Amendment.  And I really would hate to see money being thrown at people just kind of trying to put them out of business because of their reported reporting.  So my point is I hate Gawker.  I'm not a fan of any of those people.  But at the same time, they have the right to do it.  God damn it.  Right.

Start time: 3882.98
End time: 3886.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, precisely.  And you saw this.  I love the Joy of Tech comic where you know, these guys are really good.  And we you know, we disclosure.  They do all our album art and we love them.  What's so wrong that Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire, has been secretly bankrolling lawsuits against Gawker?  It's scary. It's a threat of freedom to the press.  Look, Gawker's evil and publishes horrible things.  As far as I'm concerned, it's karma.  So now he's litigating it off the face of the earth.  The guy's no hero.  He's a bully.  But Gawker's ruined many people's lives and reputations.  Wouldn't you agree?  That doesn't matter.  Thiel's actions are a corruption of our legal system.  It sends a chilling message to other members of the media to be very careful about who they are, where they're writing about and what they say about them.  Why are you kicking me?  Why do you keep looking over there?  Oh, OMG.  It's Peter Thiel.  Hi.  Nice day, isn't it?  You're you're looking sharp, sir.  Can I just say I love PayPal and Facebook?  Please don't sue me.  I think that kind of sums it up.  And who was it?  Was it the New Yorker?  I think it was in the New Yorker.  One of their writers wrote a love letter to Peter Thiel because now it's like it was wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wired.  And it's a satire, obviously, because nobody's really doing that.  But it does sound a chilling effect that, you know, I better not write about this guy because and absolutely the new these are the new very powerful, very rich people who would very much like to operate in secrecy and privacy.  And so we do need good journalists to write about them.  Not sure their sexuality is fair game.  And that's the problem I think people have with Gawker is they didn't draw a line at what was fair game and what wasn't fair game.  They in fact, the more clicks, the better.  Right.  Not not the more TMZ of right.  So and I found it very disingenuous of Nick to say, well, we're just speaking truth to power.  No, you're not.  You're buying clicks.  That's all.  That's not truth to power.

Start time: 4004.48
End time: 4009.18

End time: 4035.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Gawker has said for a while they don't I don't think this is their model now.  But for during that time period, especially they had a model of you work on something investigative and fun, but you kind of finance that time with clicky articles.  Right.  So in that case, you know, every page view for them is a chance to spend time on something real and reported and they do actual real reporting.

Start time: 4035.48
End time: 4065.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I should point out and we know this because we we've had Roberto Baldwin on the show and he used to work.  He worked for TMZ and Harvey Levine in the early days that there is frankly a well known and encouraged symbiosis between stars and starlets and their coverage by TMZ.  They want the coverage.  They you know, Britney Spears doesn't wear underpants because she wants to get a picture taken of her.  It's good for business.  And so there's a symbiosis that's very different from what Gawker is doing.

Start time: 4065.24
End time: 4098.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So although although I will say having spoken with Owen in the past about this in the early days, at least a Valley Wag for some of their stuff, there was a symbiosis between what was happening in with certain members of the Valley and Valley Wag, too.  They were after the same things.  I mean, do you think that they wrote all those stories about Julia Allison because she was that interesting?  No, it's because she was a fame whore who was emailing them tips about herself all the time.  Like, I mean, there's I think and I think this is the case with all the press.  I mean, there's a certain symbiosis where, you know, you get pitched things and people try to kind of put things in your ear and say, oh, this is really interesting.  You know, that's how stories break.

Start time: 4099.22

Start time: 4109.22
End time: 4166.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would be crazy stupid to take Peter Teal doesn't need to do this.  I mean, to me, the thing that bothered me the most, I'm actually not that bothered if Peter Teal wants to back a lawsuit of Hulk Hogan, even if it has nothing to do with him, because that's a fact of our legal system is that you can be supported by third parties.  And I don't have a huge problem with that, even though I think it's distasteful to try to put something out of business simply because you don't like some of the things they've written about you and your friends.  But what bothered me about it was frankly the fact that it was done secretly.  The fact that, you know, this has been something that's been under wraps for years and that we just now found out about it this week.  That to me is very troubling because I do feel like if you are, you know, facing the sort of loss that they were facing against Hulk Hogan, you should be able to face your accuser, which in this case, Hulk Hogan is a proxy.  And the real person is Peter Teal.  And that makes it very different, I think.  And as you know, the public, we should be, as anybody, you should be aware of who's actually accusing you.

Start time: 4167.81
End time: 4184.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and it changed the legal strategy on the case.  I mean, like not settling and it kind of distorts the way you would view the arguments even.  So, I mean, if you're going to read that closely into the case, I don't know.  Should we talk about Oracle?  Because that's big and exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I'm going to take a break, but I will quote the phony Voltaire quote,  I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.  And as journalists, I think we have to question Peter Teal's motivations and support the First Amendment.  But I'm really mad at you, Nick Denton, for putting me in that position.  I'm sure Owen's very nice. Is Peter Teal nice?  Isn't he? He was the model for the weird VC at the beginning of Silicon Valley, right?  The kind of on the spectrum strange person.

They're all Headspace. Happy Headspace users.  All right. So, boy, this is a this Google Oracle thing has been going on for years.  Six years. It's an absurdly complicated case that boiled down to the least important part of the whole case.  And which is ridiculous. Do I need to give the summary?  Or have you seen it enough on all of our shows that I don't have to tell you how this started?  You know, Java was written by Sun, blah, blah, blah.  Android used Java. They maybe they copied the code. They say they didn't.  They just copied the API. Talk to James Gosling, the inventor of Java.  He says, yeah, we felt like they slimed us, but we weren't going to sue him over it.  But then the Oracle lawyers arrived during the acquisition talks and Gosling says, yeah, we feel like they copied the code.  But we're not going to sue him, are we guys? And he said the lawyers eyes lit up and they said, hmm, there's some there's some gold in that there, son.  Of course, Oracle did sue Google saying you copied Java. But they did it in a weird way.  Apparently the lawyers. Well, at first, I think that they had nine lines of code.  They said, look, they're exactly the same. It was an array bounds checker.  The judge, Al Sop, learned Java and wrote his own array bounds checker just to say, you know, not that unique.  He kind of he felt that this was not really theft and ruled in favor of Google Oracle appealed and using a loophole.  I guess I am going through the whole story using a loophole.  This managed to get the appeal not to go to the Ninth Circuit Court out here in the West Coast that knows a little bit about this stuff and probably would have ruled in Google's favor.  But instead got it set up to the federal court, which is in charge of patents.  And because of some patent law here, they got the case and they said, well, no, Oracle can copyright the code and furthermore, the API.  And Google violated the Oracle.  Maybe they didn't copy the code, but by violating the copyright on the API, they we rule in favor of Oracle.  Google appealed. Supreme Court said, no, we're not going to take this case.  Send it back down to Judge Al Sop saying you got to first figure out.  No, this we're not debating whether Google stole the code.  Stole the code.  We're not debating whether you can copyright an API.  That's been decided.  You can copyright an API, which seems like a stupid idea.  But anyway, what we're trying to figure out is, is it OK that Google copied the copyrighted API because it's fair use?  And that's what the case was all about.  A jury of 10 people, none of them tech experts because Oracle made sure there were no tech tech experts on the jury.  And they deliberated for three days and decided that no, in fact, it was fair use.  Google was even though the API is copyrighted, it was fair use.  And Google's off the hook.  Now, Oracle says, well, we're going to appeal.  It's going to go right back to the federal court.  Did I accurately describe that scenario?  I always feel like I'm getting something wrong.  No, that was really impressive.

And then it got sent to the Federal Circuit and then sent back.  So, yeah, I have a feeling that he might have known.

Start time: 4722.28
End time: 4732.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Yeah, he's usually pretty good on this stuff.  But sometimes he's in the pay of one of the parties.  And I think in this case, he might was an expert witness expert witness.

Start time: 4759.32
End time: 4771.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we've been paying him on this the whole time.  So I guess analysis to be totally fair, even though I agree with you a lot of times he's good on this stuff.  I can't take seriously just because he's I mean, he's he's an expert for Oracle.

Start time: 4800.22
End time: 4813.13

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't reject it entirely.  They said we're not going to rule at this point.  We want the lower court to rule on this fair use first.  Gotcha. OK.  So the idea of a copyrightable API, I'm going to use I'm not going to use a hamburger and a breakfast menu.  Let me use the automobile.  Thank God everybody has agreed that the gas pedal is on the right and the brake is on the left.  No matter what car you drive, you get in the car.  The steering wheel may be on the other side, but the gas pedal is always in the same place.  That's like an API where we've all agreed this is how you do it.  It doesn't mean you can't build a gas pedal that works differently.  Doesn't mean you could brakes have to be drum brakes or disc brakes.  It just means that for the purposes of the people using your car, that there is a standard for how you interact with it.  Failing that, you've got no Internet, you've got no computers, you've got nothing because I can say, well, I have an API, but you can't use it because it's copyrighted.  Now, that seems to me problematic.

Start time: 4925.99
End time: 4970.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fine. We have, for instance, we do that.  We wrote our website has an API public and private.  In fact, this is very common. You have a public API and a private API.  You keep some. We're not going to give out the API for doing stuff that we don't think an app would want to do because that's ours.  And we are the ones who should be able to name a show.  For instance, that's that maybe there may be an API to do that, but we're not going to make that public or give people.  And by the way, it's not merely the knowledge of it that's needed.  You also need a token and you need to have a system where there are the API call can actually do that unless you're us.  You can't. So not only do we not reveal it, it's not publicly usable.  That's fine. We're not saying that.  But open source requires publicly usable APIs, right?

Start time: 4971.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and then there are cases where people will reverse engineer and do clear clean room implementations.  You know, you look at something like Samba for file sharing where they took SMB, you know, which was the Windows file sharing protocol and did a reverse engineer of that and created the Samba protocol.  It's I mean, at this point, I don't think it would be at Microsoft's best interest to ever sue that project.  It's been around for a long enough time and it's become a core part of Linux and other POSIX operating systems.  But, you know, you do worry that with the API copywritability thing, even though it was a clean room implementation, even though they did not use any of Microsoft's code, that because they, you know, re-implemented the API and kind of built it on their own, that could become, you know, there could be legal challenges against things like that.  And that's that's a concern.

Transcript:  Florian says that the judge misinstructed the jury, making the hurdle for fair use too low.  He said it's actually it's an exception.  The hurdle should be fairly high.  And he also points out, and this is important, that a trial is not a jury decision is not a precedent.  Right.  So it doesn't set any precedent of any kind.  So it doesn't resolve the question of copyright APIs and and whether APIs can be copied.

Start time: 5052.78
End time: 5091.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, that has been because the Federal Circuit did.  They did.  Yeah.  So what it says, though, is that just because it was deemed fair use in this case does not mean that that would have a bearing in a future case, meaning that if you did want to sue over someone, you know, using your API and you wanted to claim it was fair use, the fact that this jury ruled in Google's favor would not have bearing on that in most cases.  That's the argument.  And that's fair.  And and so that that kind of I think even though it's a good thing that Google has won so far, this is not over.  And this probably won't be over until we get some sort of definitive ruling, you know, one way or another from from a higher court.

Transcript:  Florian said that mismanagement at Sun really was the problem that they allowed Google to incorporate Java's API into Android.  That was against the law then and they should have pursued it.  And and so they Google doesn't have any fair use exemption or license because of ineptitude on the part of Jonathan Schwartz, who he calls one of the industry's worst CEOs ever.

Start time: 5117.20
End time: 5180.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I mean, there's probably something to be said there in the fact that when Google was developing Android and they were using Java's APIs, they didn't want to pay for Java's some of their whatever the mobile Java stuff was at the time.  And frankly, when it came out, when Dalvik came out and it was so clear that they were kind of reverse engineering the stuff that was already available from Sun, some probably should have stepped in at that point and said, hey, actually, this isn't OK.  You need to pay us a license for this.  That probably would have been the best thing to do and probably been frankly a much better business decision for Sun to do at that time, since their their server business was all but dead and no one cared about Solaris.  And they could have.  And I think at that time in 2007, 2008, you know, Google might have might have been more amenable to paying the licensing fee.  You never know.  But they didn't push for it.  And it took Oracle buying them.  And as you were saying, actually kind of looking and realizing, oh, wait a minute, there are actually some potential legal things here that we could sue over that that made this court case that it is.  And by that point, Android was huge.

Transcript:  And I mean, and I think you do look at I think there this gets conspiratorial thinking.  But I think it is a valid question to ask, you know, when they bought Sun, you know, because they immediately got rid of the spark stuff because that wasn't making any money.  That was an albatross.  And they got, you know, my sequel, which, you know, was was already starting to come up against, you know, Oracle's database stuff.  And they got Java.  If you wonder if doing their own due diligence as a company, if Oracle realized that one of the main reasons that they would spend what they spent on Sun was for the potential legal benefits and taking on Google, I don't know.  But I think it probably.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have a feeling that any lawyer who would be looking or any business person be looking at the assets of Sun to buy it.  You would have to think about are there potential, you know, patents or in a royalty agreements we can we can squeeze out of other companies that aren't already being executed that well that way.  And can we make money that way?

Flora Mueller's post on several posts on Foss patents rejecting this whole thing and saying this is a dumb move by the jury that fair use is not a defense and that Google in fact did act inappropriately and intentionally in their commercial interest and to Sun's and later Oracle's detriment.  Because he does make some good points.  You know, it's not as cutting dry as maybe some of us think.

Start time: 5302.89
End time: 5319.20

Transcript:  I mean, I think it makes some good points.  But I mean, I think ultimately he is someone who's being paid by by Oracle to to kind of, you know, play this out and to write the post that he writes.  So I don't I don't reject his opinion.  I just think that we should all be aware that he's obviously being paid by Oracle to say that.  So, of course, he's well, I'm not sure if that's the case.

Transcript:  Well, no, you know, so we started doing what you wanted to do, Philip, which is I thought, well, we will just go directly to our listeners.  And and we were able to raise a decent amount of money, but not enough to grow.  So we would have done one podcast.  I mean, you know, that's the difference is how much you can make that way.  And we would have been able to do one podcast and that would be it.  And so we ended up I initially I remember talking to an ad agency saying we will never take ads.  And after only a few years, I said, you know what?  We're going to take ads because in the long run, that's the only way we can grow.  And we're just going to try to do it in a responsible, respectful to our audience manner.  But I think both make sense nowadays.  I mean, it had Patreon been around and other other crowdfunding options.  Maybe I would have done it differently.

And if you try to block it, right, then they say, well, we're not going to show you any content.  You turn off your ad blocker and all the other in the movies that start themselves.

Transcript:  It gets down to what I was saying earlier, which is that the what the way to in the long one, the rate of monetize.  And this works for both models, by the way, is by building a relationship with your audience and have and getting an audience that wants to support you in doing what you're doing.  And they can, you know, ads or donations.  It's very similar. I think a lot of our audience says, well, I want to support you.  So I patronize your sponsors.

In the days of mass media, it was not a direct connection.  And that's why you're liking this, Philip, is because you're hearing from your audience, you're talking to them directly.  It's not intermediated by a publisher and a press and a large organization.  And I think for musicians, it's going to be the same. I think for everybody, it's going to be the same.  It's about it's about finding an audience. And to do that, you find your voice.  You have to find your passion. You have to be knowledgeable.  I think you have to operate with integrity, although I guess it's different if you're a comedian or something.  It doesn't matter. You have to be funny then.

Mike Godwin actually wrote it, wrote about Godwin's law a few days ago in the IBT.  Cool. Yeah. He says, based on my early experience of online arguments, I've come up with this mock law,  which is meant to have the sound and seeming inevitability of a law in physics or mathematics.  Quote, as an online discussion continues, the probability of a comparison to Hitler or to Nazis approaches one, in other words, 100 percent.  He says, I admit to being a prankster.  He was actually intentionally trying to create something that would take on a life of its own and and and become a law.  And, you know, in the sense of, you know, memorable.

In other words, he was trying to prevent that from happening.  And by making his law a meme, he didn't expect it to become true. Unfortunately, has he thought he thought the law would discourage people from invoking Hitler.

Transcript:  Take a break. Come back.  We will talk about Twitter and their misogyny problem.  I think that's probably what you were thinking of in the back of your mind.  A study by a UK think tank, which found in just three week period, 10,000 explicitly aggressive, explicitly aggressive and misogynistic tweets in the UK alone.  Shocking.  There's gambling going on on Twitter.  Shocking.  Our show today.  Let me reach over is brought to you by this.  Let me. It's my key chain.  Well, that's not brought to you by my key chain.  But the fact that I have my key chain is thanks to this.  This is the tracker.  It's a coin sized tracking device.  Kind of kind of pretty.  This new the new tracker Bravo is anodized aluminum aluminum tough and light very thin.  And what happens is it's Bluetooth, L.E. Bluetooth low energy pairs to your phone.  The battery lasts a year because it is L.E.  They can you can even get a water resistant case.  You can put it on your pet.  You can put it on your keys.  You can put on anything that you lose a lot.  And then you'll know when you get separated from it.  In fact, there's two way separation because it will let you the tracker will let you know when you get separated from your phone and the phone will let you know is when you get separated from your keys.  Press the button on the tracker.  Your phone will ring even if it's on silent.  There's all sorts of you can choose your own ringtone.  I know our former producer Jason used to have like a klaxon horn there.  And then they do something really interesting because as you know, Bluetooth only goes 30 meters, 100 feet.  But tracker has the largest crowd GPS network in the world.  Show that if you scroll down a little bit, Carson, on the website, you can see the map, the current map of trackers, the million and a half trackers.  In the real world.  And when you come anywhere near it's not on our there it is.  There it is.  When you come anywhere near a tracker.  So let's say I leave my keys at a truck stop in Modesto.  Now I've driven away.  My phone will know where the last place it saw the keys.  But but maybe that's not it.  Maybe somebody picked him up and moved him whenever another phone that's got the tracker software and it gets near my keys.  It will register its location and I'll get a GPS update on the map.  So I'll know if my keys move where they went.  They also have this is another thing.  It's great.  I mean, you know, your keys are in your house, but we're in your house.  They have tracker Atlas, which works with your tracker Bravo or a third party Bluetooth tracker to pinpoint your items on a customizable floor plan of your home in the cushions.  No problem.  Tracker will tell you.  You just ask tracker Atlas, where are my keys?  And you'll get an answer.  You don't even have to look for him.  This is so cool.  I want you to go to the tracker.  T H E T R A C K R dot com.  No E in the tracker and never lose your possessions again.  And if you use the promo code to it, 30 percent off your whole order.  Thirty percent.  The tracker dot com promo code twit.  Thirty percent off.  I love this little thing.  What I do, by the way, you notice my keys are on a chain is that I attach it to my backpack or my bag, whatever I'm carrying around.  So now I've doubled doing double duty.  If I leave my bag behind, it'll let me know as well as my keys.

A surprising number of women may have contributed to the abuse.  So it turns out this is that what you were talking about.  Being anonymous, people will do horrible things on Twitter because no one knows who you are.  And in fact, it turns out that of 1.5 million tweets set in the UK  during a three week period from April, mid April to May,  the research team lifted out conversational or self identifying tweets to focus only on those with clearly aggressive language aimed at another user.  Ten thousand explicitly aggressive and misogynistic tweets.  You know, you slut you, that kind of thing, directed at 6500 users.  There were more than 20,000 tweets using the same terms directed at 80,000 users internationally.  So if you just UK, it's a smaller set.  But here's the weird thing. Half of them sent by women.

But people can be terrible regardless of of their gender or or whatever norm or wherever you want to fall on that spectrum.  So, you know, people are people on the Internet are terrible is, I think, kind of my big takeaway.

But it's just it's just sad. I mean, I feel it's so it's so saddening to me as a as a father of a daughter, as a husband, as a mother and a sister. I just it's sad.  Say something.

Oh, when I worked at Giga, oh, there was somebody who came on in the comments, I want to say, and said something about me that was just completely.  It wasn't even it wasn't like a rape threat or anything. It was just being a jerk to me online.  And he got in here like you offered no value here. F off. And I was like, holy cow, I can't believe he did that.  But then in another instance, you know, someone I don't know, it was a picture of me that ran with something.  It was like nice legs or something like that. He was like. Unacceptable.  He just deleted it. He put it on social cast. This is completely, you know, but you should say those things.

But those people, you're never going to have any chance of reaching the worst trolls are going to trouble.  Regardless, OK, those people you're never going to reach.  But I think that there's a broader amount of people who say terrible things online who do it for two reasons.  One, they don't actually see what they're saying as the person they're targeting as being an actual person.  And I've run through this myself with people who've said some terrible things to me when I've had kind of an actual conversation with them back.  And they kind of realize, oh, you're not just this person, you know, this this this username and the other and this this photo on the Internet.  You're a real person. They'll often apologize.  But I think that the other thing is that, you know, people feel like certain behavior is allowed because it's the Internet.  And there is something to be said about about standing up and saying this is not OK.  Again, you're right. The people that are going to hate on and just want to do it because they like the world to burn, they're never going to stop.

Start time: 6449.68
End time: 6472.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's probably a very small number, truthfully, very small number of people.  A lot of people, in my experience, some of these really people are surprisingly horrible are kids.  They're they're like 15 year olds and they just really aren't properly socialized yet.  And if a little bit of appropriate censure might actually turn them into nice people, then maybe that's we owe them that.

Transcript:  Well, it's and of course, it's the it's the dog whistles in the and the very subtle things that sometimes we don't even notice that can really be damaging in the long run, too.  Let's let's talk about Windows 10. Speaking of horrible things.  So Microsoft says, no, no, we meant to do that.  We're talking about I got to find the picture because I want to ask you guys what you think would happen here.  So let me let me Carson, let me find this picture.  I'm going to do a search for Windows 10 upgrade dialog box.  This changed the behavior changed this week.  And there are people, including our friend Paul Thurot, who hosts our Windows Weekly show, who said Microsoft is being disgusting and and damaging not only the reputation of Windows 10, but their own reputation.  So here's what happened. As you all know, Microsoft decided that they wanted everybody to run Windows 10.  And so they offered a free upgrade a year ago, July 29th, 2015.  And anybody who was running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 could get a free upgrade.  Nice. Then they started nagging people.  They started putting up dialog boxes that you're you're eligible one upgrade one upgrade.  But it all really went to hell a couple of months ago when they moved the Windows 10 upgrade into recommended updates for most Windows users, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users, their recommended updates are automatic.  They happen.  And that means there are a great many people and I've talked to half of them now who got upgraded to Windows 10 without their knowledge, without their consent, without their permission.  Karsten, you did. It just happens. You did too, Chris.  So you're sitting there running Windows 7 happy as a clam. All your software is working. Everything's just great.  You love it. And the next morning you get up and there's a pop up that says, congratulations, you've been upgraded to Windows 10.  Say, do you agree? And if you don't agree to the license agreement, you say, no, I don't agree.  Then it has to uninstall Windows 10, which can take a long time and often fails.  Now, the last piece of the puzzle, this dialog box.  Windows 10 is a recommended update for this PC based on your Windows update settings, as I referred to earlier.  This PC is scheduled. Listen to the words carefully. And that's the problem.  People don't schedule to upgrade on Sunday. In this case, it says May 22nd at 11 p.m.  Click here to change upgrade schedule or cancel scheduled upgrade.  Now, if you didn't read that carefully, you might be tempted to click the OK box.  Well, wait a minute. No, no, I don't want the upgrade. Let's see the cancel box.  Oh, no, the cancel box says upgrade now. Well, both of those would do the upgrade either accepted or do it now. Do it sooner.  Let's click the close box. And this is what's getting people upset.  The presumption, I think, by the way, mistaken that when you click that X, it cancels that.  No, when you click that X, it puts the window away, but it's still scheduled for Sunday, May 22nd, 11 p.m.  The only way to not be updated to Windows 10 is to click where it says click here and cancel.  Microsoft said that's exactly our intent. But a lot of people are saying, well, no, wait a minute.  That Xbox did use to cancel it. When did you change that and why?  And you're tricking people in installing Windows 10. Your thoughts?

And some of your stuff may not work, including some of the hardware Microsoft didn't test for compatibility.  And, you know, I've talked to people like I talked to a guy who was a wife was a teacher.  She had a whole class presentation she needed to do.  She got up in the morning. Windows 10 is on her system.  And she she she's like, I can't do my I can't run it.  That's a big deal for people. I think that Microsoft did this wrong.  I don't I think I understand what they did here.  But don't they owe it to people not to kind of trick them into upgrading to make it very clear.  There should be a big cancel button or no, I don't want to do this.  I mean, they tell you to back up first. No, of course not.  They don't they don't give you they don't tell you anything. They just do it.

Transcript:  I did. I mean, like I live this so I can.  But that's why when I see what Microsoft's doing and I mean, you see it.  Let's see. Someone just wrote about Uber trying to I mean, there's the Google engineer who wrote about how software companies and tech companies are trying to influence your decisions via design.  This is clearly one of those examples.  Uber just is starting to do this with pushing people to Uber pool.  And I think it's Washington, D.C.  And so it's a it's a nudge.  But I mean, we do this in policy all the time to get people to do what we want.  The question is, do we want giant tech companies making this decision?

Start time: 6876.36
End time: 6886.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's different in policy. I mean, I thought these companies were, you know, I mean, don't we're we're the what happened to the customers always right and and customer centric business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand. And by the way, if I'm Microsoft, I understand this.  They want to get everybody to Windows 10.  Everybody is going to tend. It's easy to get application developers to support it.  You probably could make the case it's more secure.  Certainly, they're not going to want to continue to support the windows forever.

Start time: 6925.54
End time: 6997.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, and I think, too, I mean, they did say for a long time that you have a free upgrade from Windows 7, Windows 8 to Windows 10.  And now they're saying, OK, at the end of June or whatever, that's when they're cutting that off.  So if you do want to upgrade now is the time to do it.  I'm with you. They should make it really clear, you know, and you should have a really clear way to opt out and not do that.  But I mean, a lot of people don't like change and there were a lot of changes, you know, to Windows 8 and less to Windows 10, but still changes.  And so I mean, I think this is kind of they're in a weird situation.  They need people upgrade. But I'm with you that they could probably do this in a way that would be less shocking.  If you're you know, by clicking an X button, let's put it this way.  You shouldn't click an X button and then still have it install anyway.  That's that's not correct behavior.  It's kind of like what we were talking about on Mac Break Weekly a couple of weeks ago about, you know, iTunes and its terrible design for trying to delete a track, whether it deletes from your library or cloud or whatever.  These things should be really clear.  But I do understand why they're trying to get everyone on board to Windows 10.  Here's my question. Has anyone come up with an app that you run on Windows 7 or I guess Windows 8?  Although I don't know anybody who would want Windows 8, not Windows 10 that will disable this sort of update.

Start time: 6998.20
End time: 7124.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have it for you. And it was created by our very own Steve Gibson, who hosts security now.  He is a staunch Windows 7 user. He's called Windows 10 a flying turd.  He does not want to upgrade to it. Now, the good yeah.  Never 10 is the name of his product.  The good news about this is he's doing it the right way.  Microsoft did publish instructions, mostly aimed at enterprise and an IT pro who wants to keep all of her machines at Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.  So Microsoft said, well, yeah, you can do it with G-Pol Group Policy Edit or you can modify these registry keys.  But, of course, no normal user has access to Group Policy Edit or wants to modify their registry.  So Steve does it for you. This is a small assembly language program about 80 K.  It also has a button to remove because one of the other things Microsoft does is download three gigabytes of worth of Windows installer and then expand it to eight gigabytes on your hard drive before it even does this.  So you may many of you sitting and watching this may already have eight gigabytes of your hard drive used up by Windows 10 installer files.  So he has a button to remove those as well.  And as long as Microsoft doesn't change their policy, which I think they won't because it would really hurt their reputation in enterprise, this will always work.  And you can delete it once you do it. You change the registry and you just it's done and you can delete the program.  So never 10. If you Google it, it comes comes right up. It's very popular.  So there is a way to stop it, but probably known mostly to people who watch Twitter.  Another good reason to watch our shows. So, you know, OK, I think I did you a disservice because I I instead of just showing this dialogue and saying, isn't this terrible?  I kind of justified it and I think I successfully justified it.  But I don't think the average user is going to look at that and say, oh, no, no, I don't want that.  I think the average user is going to say, well, I'm going to click that X because I don't want that to happen.  And it doesn't fix anything. There's only one way to stop it.  And that's to click here. And that's a smaller typeface than the other stuff.

The UI of our quote, your upgrade is scheduled and quote notification is nothing new,  including the ability to just X out of the notification with no further action needed to schedule your upgrade.  It's been part of the notification UI for months.  Based on customer feedback, we confirm the time of your scheduled upgrade  and provide you an opportunity for canceling or rescheduling. That's that's what customers said.  And that's the way it's going to be. So there you go. I don't, you know, I don't use.

Developers building Apple WatchOS apps should mark June 1st on their calendar.  That's the day that Apple requires that watch apps be native apps, meaning that they can be untethered to a device.  So if you're developing watch apps, definitely want to look out for that.  Also on June 1st, June 1st is a big day.  Comcast opens up its data cap from 300 gigs to one terabyte of data.  That might save you if you're thinking about getting an unlimited plan or whatever.  Comcast is opening it up and that's a good deal.  Check out TechNews today.  We record every Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern.  Myself and Megan Moroney were on set talking about all these stories and a whole lot more.  So you should definitely check it out at twit.tv slash live.  That's it for the week ahead. Back to you, Leo.

Transcript:  Thank you, Jason Howell. Monday through Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, as he said, 7 p.m. Eastern.  TechNews today, our show today brought to you by our Ring Video Doorbell.  Oh, I love this thing. I love my ring. I have it on my front door.  You have it on your back door, Stacey.  This is or no, it was who had it on the back door? Was it you, Phillip?  It was you, Stacey. It is me. Yeah.  I love it because it's a doorbell that connects.  It's an Internet of Things device that connects to your Wi-Fi, replaces your existing doorbell.  One of the problems with doorbells, of course, I can never hear it in the house.  The chime goes thong thong. So this replaces it.  And not only does the chime still ring, but your phone or your tablet or anything, everything rings.  They've got ring apps for iOS, for Android. They even have a ring app now for the Macintosh.  And so you'll never miss somebody at their doorbell, even if you're not at home because it is attached to the Internet.  So you hear the phone ring. I hear it here at work.  Then, of course, it's got a wide angle HD camera on it, microphone and speaker, too.  You can talk to who's at your door.  You can say, oh, sorry, I'm in the shower, so don't break into my house, bad guy.  Which, by the way, it happens a lot.  They tend to come during, apparently, I didn't know this, but the stats say they come.  But 95% of burglaries come during the day.  The bad guy comes to the door, knocks on the door, rings the doorbell.  You don't answer, goes around the back and breaks in.  Well, now you've got crystal clear video of the bad guy.  And you can tell him, go away, I'm inside, even if you're not.  The Ring Video Doorbell. It's easy to install and install it myself.  Looks great. They have a variety of finishes.  Go to Ring.com and get free FedEx shipping on the original Ring Video Doorbell at Ring.com slash twit.  This is just a great idea.  And I feel like it'd be great not only for you, but for family members, maybe your parents or whoever,  to give them a little sense of security.  Ring.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support of our show.  Great panel today from Mashable.  Christina Warren, always wonderful to have Film Girl on the show.  From Stacey on IoT and the IoT Podcast.  Stacey Higginbotham, IoTpodcast.com. Giga Stacey on the Twitter.  And of course, Philip Elmer DeWitt, PED at PED30.com.  Last story, Steve Baker writing in Quora.  Now, Steve Baker is a designer of simulation of aircraft simulators, flight simulators for pilots.  He's been doing that for over 25 years.  And he says, forget about it. There's no way VR is ever going to work.  These devices have been around forever.  He says, I've been using them for years and years and years.  And the problem isn't latency. It's not screen resolution.  All the things that the companies like Oculus and Vive say it is.  The problem is depth perception.  And he says, the problem is that your eyes are converging really close,  but the objects you're looking at are sometimes distant.  You have a disconnect in your caveman brain.  He says, what happens when the convergence system says an object is two meters away  and the focusing system says it's six meters away?  Well, according to our caveman evolved brain, we're hallucinating.  We must have eaten something terrible. Throw it up.  Your brain goes into panic mode, tries to empty this substance.  Now, he says, this is going to happen.  People will always get sick with VR displays unless the content is further than around three meters from them.  And of course, that excludes any kind of application that happens inside a building  because the floor is always less than three meters away from you unless you're a nine-foot-tall alien.  And he quotes not just his own thesis, but the United States Navy and the US Army,  both of which did extensive studies on sim sickness.  And it's even worse than you might imagine, even without nausea.  And maybe not everybody gets sick, but there's a measurable degree of confusion and disorientation  after prolonged exposure to VR experiences.  The US military advises against flying a plane or even driving a car for 24 hours after being inside a simulator.  Quote, one question still not answered is the actual time course of the symptoms experienced by the aviators in the simulator  and the recurrence of delayed effects.  Anecdotal data continues to be received indicating that there is a part of the aviation population  that experiences delayed problems beyond the simulator exposure and for periods that exceed six to eight hours.  That's approximately 8% of the population and for a smaller group, one to two days.  Studies should be conducted to determine which scenarios are linked with simulator sickness  and methods to prepare aviators to deal with these scenarios.  But you shouldn't be driving a car, let alone piling an aircraft.  So Baker points out, look, we're going to put a lot of these devices in people's hands,  not just the Oculus and the Vive, but also the PlayStation VR, which is due out.  I love them. He says, but if you go to the labs where they're making these guys don't wear them for very long.  They know and we're going to have all sorts of problems with people driving under the influence of VR.  What do you think? I have to say, Christine, I bet you've played a lot with these.  What's the longest you've spent?

Transcript:  A little bit, a little bit, but I didn't feel drunk. I mean, look, I don't drive again, so I kind of feel safe.  You're safe in the subway.  I'm safe in the subway. Yeah, but I mean a little bit. I have to say over time, it's gotten a lot better.  I mean, I've seen huge improvements just from like the original like DK2 Oculus to the shipped version.  And the Vive, I think, is a good experience, too.  So I understand the concerns and I think they're really valid,  but I always feel weird about any prognostication that like this is an unsolvable problem  because I feel like technology moves so quickly and we thought that's about other things in the past.  And then it turns out there are solutions.  So I bet I do think it's a valid concern and I do think it's one of those things that we do have to consider as VR becomes a bigger and bigger deal.  And I think that this is one of the things why there are so many people are hesitant about VR, right?  Because it's not just nausea, but it's depth of perception, it's other things.  People, the general consensus is not that this is going to necessarily be the next big thing.  I think that's kind of a toss up between is this 3D TV or is this, you know, smartphones?  And I don't really know the answer of what it's going to be at.  But I definitely think that what he wrote raises a lot of interesting questions and are definitely things that I'm sure everybody at all these companies,  I'm sure they're thinking about these issues and are investing in heavy research and development to solve these sorts of problems, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's fair. But at the same time, I mean, they've had 20 years and yet it was, you know,  a kid who kind of helped kind of come up with like kind of a modern implementation.

Start time: 7935.54
End time: 7964.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but the modern implementation, the big story there is really not that he improved VR, but he got the price down.  Because I remember 30 years ago getting in a VR rig and riding a pterodactyl at SIGGRAPH 92.  And it was exactly the same experience. In fact, probably arguably, he says a better experience, lower latency, higher resolution displays,  more accurate head tracking. The big advance of Palmer Lucky and the rest is they got the price down because it used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Transcript:  Sure. I get sick every time I'm in VR. So does my wife. I wish I didn't.  I'm like, everyone's like, this is the way to be. And I'm like, after about five minutes and everyone's like, it'll go away over time.  But so far it hasn't. Yeah. So I feel like if this is the next big thing, I feel kind of screwed as a reporter.

Transcript:  What the industry tells us is, oh, no, no, no, we're getting the latency down between turning the head and the picture moving.  And that's going to fix it. I don't think it does. Now he points out that cardboard, Google's VR doesn't have that problem as much because you base because they mostly use applications where you're not moving.  You're just turning your head around. Right. That makes sense.  I also should point out that people said that 3D movies and TV would die for a similar reason that your eyes are converging on one distance. Your focal point is a different distance.  So the theater screen is 60 feet away, but you see it a twig three feet away and your brain is saying you can't converge at one distance and focus at another distance.  Throw up. You're hallucinating. I find this fascinating.  It's a big story because, frankly, this is going to be a multi-billion dollar industry.  And if it makes people nauseous or worse, causes car accidents, we've got a problem.

Transcript:  Maybe it'll be a 30 billion dollar. I mean, it's not the smartphone. And just because the smartphone is so huge, I mean, to be able to put the Internet in your pocket is a that's a hard thing to match for any technology.  Well, I'm I my only experience is with the cardboard and showing the cardboard to people.  And what's so cool is you show you show them this and it's really cheap technology.  And it's like the scales have fallen off their eyes and they say, oh, wow, this is amazing. I agree.  But then they don't you know, then so then what's next?  And I can see it for gamers. That's that's definitely a market.  And I can see it for porn and maybe for training airplane pilots.  But, you know, how big is that?  Yeah. So like the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the smartphone put the Internet in your pocket, right?  The idea behind VR and why everyone wants to spend so much money on it is because you conceivably could put the world in your pocket.  Not today. Right. It's more like the PC.  But I mean, if your biggest problem is, you know, the Internet change distribution models, you know, sending digital bits around,  VR is a way to kind of turn atoms into bits in some way.  Not exactly. You know, you can't put you into all places.  Yeah. And that's exciting. Yeah. But yeah, I still get sick. Yeah.

But if you don't want to pay, wait three days and the paywall lifts and it's all free.  That's a clever way to do it.  If you're behind a paywall, you sort of become invisible on the Internet.
