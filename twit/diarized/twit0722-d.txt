Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but apple did i would say the biggest takeaway for me from wwdc on tuesday the keynote or on monday  i should say the biggest takeaway for me was apple has listened and listened in a lot of ways right  but the mac pro is the first one this was the mac pro they should have done in 2013 when they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  super popular well not only did no one like it apple admitted in 2017 that it was misdesigned  that because of thermal issues they couldn't actually make it any better they couldn't upgrade  it they hadn't upgraded it for six years they said we're gonna have a new mac pro we're working on it  now and it'll but it's gonna be they didn't say how long but they said it's not gonna be next year  so and they were right it wasn't it was 2019 it'll be out in september starts at six thousand  dollars but that's modestly equipped like really like a 256 gig hard drive  no one knows how much it will cost but it will be upgradeable to 1.5 terabytes of ram one of the  tech blogs said depending on what they put in there that could be as much as twenty thousand dollars  the 28 core intel w processor sells for around ten thousand dollars just for the processor just for the  processor i'm thinking if you if you put all 28 cores and nobody's gonna put it on with tears  like the afterburner graphics option which gives you not one not two not three but four  radion graphics cards vega pro cards then there's a lot of optional stuff there's this fabric  interleave thing that i don't there's part of the i think part of the reason apple did what they did  is because it's you can't really say okay well how much would a pc cost because nobody you can't  get any of these promise makes the the hard drive module uh nvidia makes or not in video  our radion amd's radion makes the gpu module so maybe eventually they'll offer these for pcs but  right now you couldn't build a comparable pc so there's no way to comp the price  they did claim that the base unit compares with pcs that are even more expensive that's probably

Start time: 368.74
End time: 378.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  true though right yeah i mean it's not so much as it's an expensive mac it's that it's aiming at the  super high end part of the market that's why the price point isn't a huge point of contention like

Start time: 379.40
End time: 390.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  if you're going to spend six to ten k on a computer you're buying the one you want you're not going  like wow this one's 50 bucks cheaper i must go with a pc like you're buying the machine you demand  for your job yeah i think there are people who are buying the same thing but they're buying the

Start time: 391.32
End time: 414.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  same thing i think there are people who would like a mac that expandable oh yeah but not at that level  kind of down several several notches and those people will be disappointed but it seems like  the people who actually apple is trying to target with this they did a good job of doing it it's  just that it's not all that many people it's like eight and they have a lot of money to throw at  stuff because the faster they can render animation or whatever the more money they they can make

Start time: 415.36
End time: 457.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so it's studios yeah and in most cases clients will pay for the hardware anyway i mean that's  in a way as somebody who's going to charge back the hardware to the client wants it to be expensive  because they can add their 10 percent and make more money so i don't think the price is an object  at all and i do think apple you know when apple did their apology tour one of the things they said  is we have gone out and actually hired professional video editors music creators people who use mac  pros we we brought them in house to help us design this and i think that that's pretty clear that's  what they got they got if you said to the designers money price is no object for make the best  modular macintosh you could make this this is probably what you'd get something like this

Start time: 458.82
End time: 475.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it reminds me a little bit of the mclaren senna which is the coolest and best car of all time and  it's just built to go around tracks really fast and if you want that thing this is the thing for  you and if you want to do high quality fast video rendering here's the machine but here's a problem  i can't afford a mclaren senna what i really want is a mac mini with a lot of guts

Start time: 476.26
End time: 509.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and so i was very patiently i'm not mad the mac mini is much better in fact for a lot of people  a mac mini would be a good choice thunderbolt means you can have external gpus external hard drives  so for many people the mac mini or the new iMac pro which is five thousand dollars  that might be a better choice i i agree with you harry there is a little bit of a missing  piece in the middle but not much used to be you could say well what's your budget this is the mac  you want and it was a fairly linear graph of price power there is a little notch there

Start time: 510.68
End time: 532.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some people like stuff like internal drives and i mean if you're into internal upgrades  and you don't have six thousand dollars plus another six or another four for the monitor plus  money for the stand then you might be disappointed okay one tactical error apple made the stand right

Start time: 533.06
End time: 559.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they it's fine to announce the stand to show the stand it's was a mistake to say the price of the  stand and probably what they should have said is the monitor is five or six thousand dollars  and includes a stand i understand why they decoupled the stand a lot of professionals don't  use stands they use visa arms there's a visa mount they'd spend money on the visa mount instead  but just but of course it was a huge mistake and you could tell the minute they said on the stage

Start time: 559.64
End time: 585.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there were groans there were groans i think a lot of it was i mean i mean there are there are all  kinds of windows pcs and workstations that compete for this market you just never hear about them  unless you're a potential customer and apple being apple this thing got a huge amount of attention  made people like us who will never buy this so stuff that looks ludicrous to us is actually  totally saying if you are one of the relatively small number of people who might actually buy

Start time: 585.38
End time: 589.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one so i think that the general reaction of the pro community is this is exactly what we want and

Start time: 589.40
End time: 600.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the people in the room are developers and i mean developers do like powerful computers but even  developers don't need a machine this powerful you don't need a pro display xdr no and as apple

Start time: 600.52
End time: 669.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pointed out and they they started with this you know a really high-end professional accurate video  display would be 25 000 50 000 dollars would be expensive so a six thousand dollar monitor is  not that big a deal i have a question about although i got a quote divinder hardware and  gadget who wrote a 999 monitor stand is everything wrong with apple today you could pinpoint the  exact moment when apple lost the audience on monday john ternes the company vp of hardware  engineering revealed the pro display will cost 4999 dollars that's pricey but reasonable considering  the features but then there was one more thing and not the good kind one hour 42 minutes and  five seconds into the keynote stream he revealed the stand is a separate thousand dollar purchase  the crowd which was mostly enthusiastic until then actually they had huge applause for dark mode and  ios actually the biggest applause i think was the tip calculator and the apple watch app  but uh the audience erupted into cautious murmurs enough to make termis stammer as he continued on  he was unprepared for the apple faithful to question the glorious technology being bestowed

Start time: 669.52
End time: 681.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  upon them it's good writing but here's my question so we all agree that this new computer is fantastic  has a market the monitor is fantastic has a market how big is that market how many people are there

Start time: 681.38
End time: 707.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  actually have you said it yourself how many people have a mclaren ford makes a ford makes  a gt for 450 000 dollars they're going to make fewer than a thousand of them but they make it  and the point and i think this is apple's mclaren or gt it's a halo car equivalent it's a halo car  it's the race car it's the one you make to show that you can make the best thing possible  and and and there will be a market but it may not be more than a thousand people it might be a very

Start time: 707.12
End time: 715.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  small market doesn't matter because i'm pretty dumb and i have disposable money and you know they  could entice me to overspend on a computer but like looking at the mac pro i'm going they have

Start time: 716.02
End time: 727.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something for you to overspend on i overspend on a mac i mac pro for five thousand dollars and by  the way that was the base price and i probably spent a little bit more because i wanted 10 cores

Start time: 728.30
End time: 733.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because 10 is better than eight obviously obviously that way you can run a 15 chrome tabs

Start time: 733.52
End time: 758.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  instead of 13 you know it's totally shameful yeah and that's why you need one and a half terabytes  of ram what is terribly shameful is i have that mac pro on my desktop almost always i will use  my macbook air which i mean on paper is probably a hundred times slower and i can't tell the  difference i literally it's it's not like i go oh this is so slow i have to go use my desktop

Start time: 758.88
End time: 766.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 766.52
End time: 784.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a question so i get that a car is something that you just want to have just to show that you have  a car but this is a machine that you could use to make something and make something great so does it  so does it put independent more independent creators at a disadvantage because they can't  like they don't work for pixar or they just are trying to create something and they don't have

Start time: 784.52
End time: 825.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that power they can't afford it that was my exact response to this editor who said i mean the mac pro  i can't afford it i don't need it i'm going to use my iphone i said this is exactly what i think is  most interesting about the age we live in is that you can create with you there's youtube which  means you have don't distribute a film worldwide with no money there's there's your iphone which  means you can shoot 4k video edit it and distribute it from your phone while you're driving to las  vegas we live in a world where it's really all that really matters is your ability but what about  like technology so you don't do it you make um you know uh you make roma right or it takes a little  longer to render maybe yeah or you take yeah or you get a cup of coffee while you're rendering

Start time: 825.56
End time: 832.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that scene i think the point is good but i don't think this is going to give people that are  professionals and have bigger budgets such a leap ahead of independence that independence become

Start time: 834.50
End time: 861.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  impossible in the market no because honestly the only thing that you need that really is a requirement  is talent and ability desire the technologies there's a huge range in many price points  and i guarantee you they're look steven soderbergh's last movie was shot on an iphone  i guarantee you that there are great things being done with cheap technology we know it all it take  what it really takes is the one thing you can't buy ability right good story so go back to your

Start time: 861.94
End time: 870.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  point like you can drive a less powerful car still very quickly on a track but if you are also the  best and you're the best car you can set all-time records and that's pixar in this analogy and i'm

Start time: 875.52
End time: 880.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 881.92
End time: 885.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i'm weighing my options they both generate the same amount of heat i hear so it's a very close

Start time: 885.56
End time: 910.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  comparison yeah i don't they didn't mention what the tdp would be for this 28 core xeon processor  but i think it's like four or five hundred watts they did mention that the power supply would be  massive 1.4 kilowatts or something yeah one and a half kilowatts um that means your lights dim in  your house when you when you render uh you render faster but you can't see anything i like this car

Start time: 910.80
End time: 916.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  technology analogy thing we should try this more often we've tried it you remember that meme that

Start time: 916.18
End time: 922.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  went around that uh if if cars had improved as fast as technology well do you remember they'd

Start time: 932.82
End time: 972.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  exactly it's an old joke so i'm just saying we've been doing this for a long time yeah  yeah i'm not responsible for that crazy metaphor uh although i probably repeated it many many times  oh are you gonna buy a mac pro the new one no of course not i don't know anybody i literally  know the only person okay so i asked alex lindsey who if anybody that we know is gonna buy a mac pro  be alex lindsey he does professional production he was on a set somewhere he couldn't talk  i said i'd love to know what you think i said how many you're gonna buy he says depends on how  much money i can get when i mortgage my house he said i'll buy as many as i can but honestly  that's that's the level of expense we're talking about it'll probably be it'll probably cost as

Start time: 973.02
End time: 983.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  much as an inexpensive car 20 30 000 yeah didn't we price it out as like four years at a state  school or four years at a state college that's sort of the way i look at money you have a choice

Start time: 984.24
End time: 1031.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you can render faster or go to college which would you like apple listened about the ipad too one of  the complaints i had and i think a lot of people had about the ipad pro was that it was a lot of  hardware running an operating system meant for a phone a phone in about 2007 and they've actually  now maybe it's just lip service maybe they're really doing something but they've separated out  the ipad os it is not ios anymore it's ipad os and they've given a lot of desktop features to  the ipad pro somebody called again the radio show and said i just bought a macbook should i  i have an ipad pro 12.9 and a macbook do i need the macbook anymore yes you say yes well alex is  nodding which doesn't work that well on a podcast oh i'm so sorry yes um harry and i were talking

Start time: 1040.64
End time: 1067.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  12.9 i've used ipads as my primary devices since 2011 you must be thrilled it looks just great i  mean you're right that when they announced the new hardware last year the hardware went way past  what the software was capable of to such a degree that i assumed that the good stuff must be coming  at wwdc because it would be so weird to put in a usb c port and then not let you do anything with  it essentially so most of the stuff that i hoped would happen did happen last week you were right i

Start time: 1067.50
End time: 1074.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  mean that you didn't anticipate apparently all they had to do is flip a switch on that usb c  port and suddenly you they can you could put a thumb drive in there you could put a usb hard drive

Start time: 1074.86

Start time: 1080.06
End time: 1085.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so you you're using a ipad as your day-to-day computer right and the safari on there is basically

Start time: 1086.08
End time: 1122.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the iphone version of safari it's pretty much i mean there's a lot of stuff that works great but  the more sophisticated a web app is the more likely it is it won't work well which in a lot  of cases is not a major problem because some things have great native apps but there's a lot  of stuff that does not have a great native app like like google g-suite we run into that all the  time because we use g-suite for our shows google's apps for the ipad range from sort of mediocre to  really bad and i'd be much happier using the web-based versions which up until now have not  worked at all and if those and if those work really well in safari on the ipad it'll make a

Start time: 1122.58
End time: 1126.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  huge difference only somebody uses the ipad day and day out will understand why that makes a big

Start time: 1126.78
End time: 1166.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  difference the desktop safari makes a big difference yeah because i i spent a lot of  money on this very powerful large screen tablet and google docs google docs and app version  is rudimentary and if you need to use google docs getting access to the full version is is huge  microsoft office is really good on an ipad yes and i don't know there are also web-based versions of  the office apps how do those work on the the the native microsoft office apps are really good  so i don't particularly want to use the web-based ones but they'll be better with the safari  air table we use air table at fast company yeah the ipad app is not very good i think i'll be

Start time: 1166.44
End time: 1191.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  much happier using the web-based version there's also little things like the the grid of icons  which has been so wasteful on the ipad for so many years you have this big screen and you still are  you know there's lots of space in between the icons they're going to fix that and you can put on  widgets on the desktop if you want to this is something anybody's used android for like the  time understands the value of widgets is the main reason i love my android phone even like scrolling

Start time: 1192.24
End time: 1206.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  working on small documents on the ipad is fine but if you're working on like a 6 000 word document  it's been very sluggish to go through it are they did they say they'll be improvement they have  scrolling much more like on a desktop where you can the faster you scroll the faster it'll zip

Start time: 1206.94
End time: 1213.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  through it nice and it's they didn't talk about it it's hidden in accessibility but mouse support

Start time: 1213.66
End time: 1218.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mouse support yeah it's aimed at an accessibility feature for people for people who have challenges

Start time: 1218.84
End time: 1227.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with touching a screen and yet so many people said oh god they did it yeah i mean i think that  there are people who want do you want a mouse on your not particularly and i think people who

Start time: 1227.90
End time: 1238.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  expect this to be just like using a mouse on a mac might be disappointed but it also sounds like  if apple implemented this they've done 80 of the heavy lifting they need to do to offer it as just

Start time: 1239.00
End time: 1291.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a standard feature to everybody they did i thought an interesting thing the reason i want a mouse is  is it's stupid but it's um the switching of the mode from typing to touching is enough of a movement  of the hand that it's disconcerting it slows me down i just need a trackpad a trackpad would be  nice and there are a lot of keyboards that have room for not the apple keyboard but they're the  bridge keyboard for us to have room for trackpad but no trackpad but what they did do which i thought  was really interesting so i interpreted them hiding the mouse as a way of saying well we  don't want to emphasize the mouse because we really think it's a touch device and it should be touch  and you should use touch and you should only use mouse if you can't use touch but but then they  talked about the fact that there are going to be many many more keyboard shortcuts in all of the apps  and that is to me a great thing because i can keep my hands on the keyboard that is a strange thing

Start time: 1291.90
End time: 1308.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  though to put in an ipad and that's when i lose my attractiveness to it i mean to me if you have  mouse support keyboard shortcuts and a screen i have a laptop and laptops are amazing they're so  good this laptop that i have is an old macbook pro it is a tank i've broken that's why you like it

Start time: 1308.78

Transcript:  new platform it has a lot less cruft your mac and windows pc's have like decades of stuff that's  built up i think when i use a mac or a windows pc a lot of the time i feel like i'm devoting 20  percent of my time to be like being a mechanic for my own computer and my mac is telling me i have  all the disk space i need on my mac and despite that it flashes a message every five minutes in  the corner telling me i'm running out of disk space and i should do this or that um i don't  i feel like a lot of ways windowing was a step backwards for computers if you have like 17  windows on your desktop and you're going to have to drag them around and some of them are overlapping  on others i like the ipads approach to it much better where you can have a couple of apps on  screen and in ios 13 they're also adding stuff to make that better but you don't have windows  floating around and overlapping when you don't want to there's just a little bit less  of all the stuff that's built up over the years it's more simpler it's more modern  okay um it's better at touch i mean i'm aware of things like the surface which have touch and it's  it's just fine but ultimately on a surface i'm aware i'm using apps for the most part that  were not designed to be touch first every ipad app is touch first yeah okay and it has suffered  a little bit with the keyboard in the past because shortcuts and things have not been  as predictable but i think the fact that apple has slowly made this into a more powerful  platform has been helpful because they haven't rushed their way through some of these decisions  that are hard to get right like windows 8 famously oh my god what a nightmare yeah microsoft you know  saw the ipad as being really dangerous and very quickly tried to turn windows into something to  compete with that and in some ways it was cool but they made lots and lots of mistakes which even  now they're they're undoing yeah what app do you use to write i use scrivener which is and it's  i mean it's my single most essential app i would not use a computing platform that didn't have

Transcript:  ipad only i mean there's no doubt about it for now this is not the dominant way of doing things  when the ipad first came out there was this brief window where it felt like maybe the pc was doomed  it became clear pretty quickly that was not true all the stories you probably would run on the post  pc era i wrote some of them and clearly the ipad has had a huge amount of influence on the pc

Start time: 1845.42
End time: 1948.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but everybody was running scared pc sales tumbled that's why microsoft did windows 8  we thought we were in a post pc era but that didn't turn out to be relatively familiar pc still has  legs steve jobs at the time said every there's still going to be needs for trucks you don't  you don't get rid of trucks and so the desktop which for programmers and people doing  you know heavy duty rocket ship design maybe still need some heavy duty hardware on the desktop but  there's a lot of that what's really interesting is how many people who don't need that can move  to the ipad and in fact that's my biggest question and i'd like to open it to all of you is what does  this tell us about apple's future plans we know a few things for instance we know that they want  to move away from intel at least well and maybe that's another question maybe they keep using  intel on the mac pro side of the equation for really heavy duty the trucks are still running  intel but they want to move to their i think they want to make all their own chips and i think they  think that the arm chips they design are good enough to replace all desktop chips but maybe  they're going to keep some intel we also know that the iphone is their number one product a lot of  their focus on on the iphone a lot of their revenue from the iphone and yet services are becoming  important so that means they'd like to have people in an ecosystem never to leave they don't want you  to say well i'm gonna have an iphone but i want a windows computer they don't want that they need  to be all apple and then then i've thought for a while maybe they were getting rid of desktop  operating systems that mac os would gradually become ios i i think that the announcements they  made this week change a little bit that what do you think alex well they introduced ipad os

Start time: 1948.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that pace of production probably there's no need for unified os and they're going to keep things  distinct maybe they'll move the processor you know barrier from arm a little bit further maybe even  the macbooks you think they don't need to i think it seems like it's going fine everyone seems so  happy i mean no one left this keynote mad about anything but an overpriced stand they weren't  going to buy anyways it was great for memes i saw a lot of good cheese grater jokes on twitter  but fundamentally the the updates were good and the ios is look strong the ios is look strong

Start time: 2055.80
End time: 2105.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but we do we need a different os for a different job and i think people use things differently  like for example i've been using the ipad more and more as just an entertainment device and  like i have a lot of apps on my phone that i have an addictive personality and apple doesn't mind  that because that's services right that's income yeah and so like i don't keep twitter on my phone  anymore i don't keep instagram on my phone or facebook on my phone anymore but they're all on  my ipad yeah so it's like when i'm when i've made that decision like now i'm going to just it's a  leisure device yeah totally and i'm sure there are other people like me i don't think that i'm  like everyone else just like i you know i don't think harry no but i think that's a common that  makes us that's a sensible usage yeah and if you especially think of people getting older and you  know i mean my dad has bought max his entire life he's retired now is he going to buy another mac  no but he's going to he's bought an ipad every year it also explains because alex is not getting

Transcript:  tell you why i'm reading neil stevenson's new book you thought i'd get that in and you were right  came out this week fall or dodge and hell really good but he talks about a near future  where oh interesting face recognition is everywhere you can't go outside without  many cameras recording your presence your who you are what you're doing at all times i think  we're already there in many municipalities where people create anonymous personas he calls them  purdas it's an acronym purdah and so everybody we all have real identities but people will be  able to create multiple personas that will be encrypted blockchain encrypted that they will  then put out on the internet because it's so dangerous and we already know this people  anybody in the public eye knows dangerous to put out your real last name or your real address  that's being doxxed right that's that's hazardous in the twitter age so they have these identities  and then they wear something called a veil and they point out that you could wear a veil if you  want to avoid face recognition but what these people are wearing everybody's wearing some sort  of augmented reality glasses which i think we all agree will be in the next 10 20 30 years sure so  they're but they have specials they look like sunglasses so you can't see their eyes and they  have little laser lights underneath them that are beaming algorithmically lights on your face to  prevent face recognition from working but you can also program them to be in effect the par a bar  code that's tied to your whatever purdah you want to project as you walk around this is he's he's  novel he's dealing with what he sees as the inevitable consequences of the life we're in  right now and i think he's right with face recognition and all of this i think he's  absolutely right social media he says the internet collapses in 30 years it'll collapse because  there'll be so much false information on only people who can afford an editor a personal editor  a personal editor to go through it will have real information those who can't will be inundated with  so much false information that you'll pick this the the affinity that you have and you'll believe  you'll be and we're already seeing this by the way you'll be in that belief group and that'll be  your group and nobody could tell you different like the tucker carlson fox news media yeah sean  hannity's affinity group uh and and we're already there i mean honestly we're getting there and you  can see this isn't so far in the future but the reason i bring all of this up besides saying it's  worth reading not so much because it's the greatest novel ever written although i think stevenson is  one of my favorite novelists but because the ideas in it i think are really challenging and  interesting but what he's essentially saying is those who can afford it can get real information  on the internet can hide their identity well at least not high but control their identity control  their privacy but it is not going to be inexpensive and and he said most people don't care they just

Transcript:  case they didn't they didn't say oh no we don't want to be anopoly or we're going to do something  about being a monopoly they said no no we are a monopoly essentially wait i don't think they said  those words but that's certainly the takeaway and it's good you should be glad and i think they're  the same thing with privacy they're gonna say and and i think that this might i think their  thing is this might inoculate them against congress against governmental regulation  go ahead regulate facebook break up google we don't care because we're the privacy company  now admittedly this is by the way this is a whole nother thread in this issue of deregulation of  regulation versus deregulation so shoshana zuboff in her book surveillance capitalism says you'll  never see at least our government or and most governments regulating tech too much because  they want the information the tech is getting that's how governments are surveilling us  so there's an unholy alliance between law enforcement congress and these big tech  companies as long as you give us information we're not going to shut you down it's prism in the u.s

Transcript:  but it's good it's 105 but youtube uh has a dark side you know all right i i am on a campaign  to me the biggest problem with youtube is the recommendation engine it's what everybody knows  it's what in fact there was a new york times article this sunday about a kid 21 year old  who started watching you know innocuous videos on youtube and got sucked down the rabbit hole into  right-wing videos and then i don't know how it's kind of sucked into the rabbit hole and left-wing  videos but but it's the recommendation engine that does all that why doesn't youtube just turn

Start time: 5657.68
End time: 5668.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5668.36
End time: 5706.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wrong with facebook google twitter all of the social media is they're optimizing for engagement  it's the business model but that's what they have to stop doing because if you just searched for a  video found it and watched it that'd be the end of it instead of watching a video on how to cook  a steak and then getting directed to a video on on a vegetarianism and then getting directed the  next video on veganism and the next video on is pita and the next by the end of the line you're  you're doing what they just did down the road in petaluma where they you're liberating chickens  you're breaking into chicken farms and freeing the chickens that sounds good to me free-range

Start time: 5706.34
End time: 5740.58
