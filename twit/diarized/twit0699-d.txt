Has another year gone by?  We started, I started the twit network.  I say we because when we do twit, it's really a whole bunch of people involved.  But in the earliest days, it was just me up in an attic somewhere with Kevin Rose  and David Prager and Patrick Norton and Robert recording shows and having a good time.  Robert, what's his last name?  Heron.  Heron, thank you.  Robert's going to think I forgot him.  Recording shows, having a good time talking about tech.  Here we are.  What is it now?  13, 14 years in April later, still doing it with some of the most interesting things  and some of the most interesting people.  I love getting all these journalists together each Sunday afternoon and talking about tech.  Twit is absolutely our flagship show and we're really glad you watch it.  We decided to take the week off because, well, the holidays are upon us.  Christmas is coming, New Year.  New Year's Eve is, what is it, Monday tomorrow.  So instead of, or a week from tomorrow, depending on where you're listening to this,  instead of doing all new shows, dragging people in on the holidays,  we thought it'd be just fun to go back and look at some of the great moments on Twitter from 2018.  Starting, of course, with perhaps the biggest security story of 2018,  the Meltdown Inspector flaws.  Although I think XKCD had a very nice take on it.  Watch.  Well, I guess we should talk about the big story,  which is the worst security flaw in the history of all mankind.  At least it would be if you watched mainstream media.  Yes.

Start time: 199.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And I've been trying to, and I've listened to Steve Gibson's explanation for this several times.  Over and over.  And I think I understand how well I don't understand this, but it's a very complicated thing.  But the way that I would characterize this is that chips for the last...  Since 1995.  Yeah, 13 years now.  They guess what is going to happen to speed things up.  And we've now discovered that that information that they're guessing can be peeked at.  Leaked.  Leaked, harvested, whatever.  Theoretically, it's all theoretical.  So we'll start with the good news or the sunny perspective.  That's why I'm here, Leo, is to provide the sunny, happy perspective.  Mr. Optimist.  Yes.  Which is that, first of all, we don't know of any actual exploit that's taken place from this.  And number two, it's going to be fixed and it's all going to be fine.  That's the best possible scenario.

Start time: 259.46
End time: 633.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's the best possible scenario, but it may actually not be true.  But we'll delve into that a little bit.  These are the two flaws which were interestingly discovered simultaneously.  Meltdown and Spectre.  Spectre affects Intel chips.  Meltdown affects not just Intel chips, but AMD chips and some ARM chips, including Qualcomm chips.  And that's what is really the issue here.  And one of the reasons I say it is probably the most serious security flaw we've seen is because it pretty much affects any modern computer, including an iPhone, including an iPad.  And so that means it's widespread.  What it isn't is easy.  Right.  And there's a...Bruce Schneier talks a little bit about the synchronicity of two completely independent teams discovering this.  And apparently this is not unusual.  Well, Bruce is very literate, so he compares Leibniz and Newton discovering calculus at the same time.  I don't think it's like that.  But I think what it is is researchers tend to look in the same alleyways.  And this is a category of flaws called timing flaws that have been lately very fruitful.  Rowhammer is an example where people were able to kind of look into memory based on a kind of a weird race condition.  So we will...  So in other words, it's interesting that these are discovered by independent teams.  Schneier says that's one reason we should worry about this, because if these two teams discovered it at roughly the same time independently, who else discovered it?  And who might have discovered it even a year ago or two years ago?  Or ten years ago.  Or ten years ago, including the NSA.  Yeah.  So this is...and I think...Mica suggested this XKCD comic strip.  Randall is great at explaining this stuff.  This is XKCD number 1938.  The Meltdown inspector exploits use speculative execution? What's that?  Well, you know the trolley problem?  Well, for a while now...geeks know the trolley problem because it's talked about a lot in self-driving cars.  Well, for a while now, CPUs have basically been sending trolleys down both paths quantum style while awaiting your choice.  That's speculative execution.  Intel started doing it in 1995 because it really did speed up processors.  They would guess what you will do next, start that execution, and if they guessed correctly, it would be massive improvements.  If they guessed wrong, yeah, you'd have to back up a little bit.  But it turned out the massive improvement outweighed the slowdown.  So every processor, modern processor, uses speculative execution except for maybe some of the dumbest ARM processors.  Raspberry Pi, for instance, says, we don't do that so we don't have to worry.  So, you know the trolley problem?  Well, for a while now, both CPUs have basically been sending trolleys down both paths quantum style while awaiting your choice.  Then the unneeded phantom trolley disappears.  They say, well, you didn't do that.  But the phantom trolley isn't supposed to touch anyone.  But it turns out you can still use it to do stuff and it can drive through walls.  What she's saying here and what's happening with Meltdown Inspector is because another technique used by processors to speed up execution,  very fast level one cache right next to the processor in the speculative branch, it will load that cache with data for the next process.  And it turns out the current process can peak at that data.  This is why it isn't the most useful flaw ever, because that data, you don't really get to choose what's in that cache.  But it might contain passwords, logins, credit card numbers.  If you could do it a lot, like for over a long period of time, it might be really valuable.  That's where, by the way, the biggest risk is to people running on processors, shared processors, like in virtual machines or servers.  So often when you have a web server, you're running on the same machine as a hundred other websites.  If one of those websites were a bad actor, he could run software that would then peek into all the other websites,  cache activities and perhaps over a period of time, get stuff.  So that's the biggest risk. And by the way, that's why Amazon Web Services, Google Services, Microsoft Azure, they've all been down lately.  Even Epic Gaming went down.  In fact, they said, if you're playing Fortnite on our servers, you may notice some slowness.  We're trying to patch them as fast as we can.  So this is a big problem on shared processors, because then you wouldn't have to ever have malware on your system.  It could just be somebody else acting badly.  But if you had malware or even, and Apple discovered that this is a scary one, I think it was Meltdown,  can be achieved by a browser running a JavaScript program.  So you could theoretically go to a bad website and the JavaScript hidden on that website could actually try to read your memory contents.  It would only get what was in the cache. It would be really hit or miss.  It's a much better tool for targeted. That's why the NSA would love this.  Because if you know, if I'm going after Mike Elgin, pardon this long explanation, but it's complicated.  I think it's important.  Even the cartoon has to be explained.  So that sounds bad.  Honestly, I've been assuming we were doomed ever since I learned about Rowhammer.  That was the other timing flaw.  That's what's Rowhammer.  If you toggle a row of memory cells on and off really fast, you can use electrical interference to flip nearby bits.  And do we just suck at computers?  Yep, especially shared ones.  So you're saying the cloud is full of Phantom Trollies armed with hammers.  Yes, that's exactly right.  Okay, I'll just install updates.  Good idea. That's the bottom line.  Update, right?  Because everybody, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, even Intel and AMD say we're going to put out patches.  Those would be the better patches, the patched at microcode level.  But if you're running Windows, it's been patched.  If you're running a recent version of Macintosh, it's been patched.  And those patches will continue to come out.  For instance, the Safari patch, I don't think is out yet, but will come in.

Start time: 634.12
End time: 640.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And there will probably be future patches that will be more elegant.  Right now, they're just putting Band-Aids on it and making sure that it doesn't...

Start time: 641.00
End time: 655.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's one issue here, of course.  And the register, when it first reported this on Tuesday, said everybody's hair on fire because they said you're going to see 5% to 30% performance degradation.  Because the at least initial patches turn off speculative execution.

Start time: 655.10
End time: 676.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Exactly. You just turn that off.  Speculative execution, by the way, is the official name of Saudi Arabia's death penalty law.  That's an entirely different issue.  That's if you just turn that off.  And what they're going to do is over time, and Steve Gibson explained this beautifully,  but they're going to get it back to the performance where there's no difference in performance eventually.  I don't know, six months, whatever it is.

Start time: 677.52
End time: 777.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Well, Apple, for instance, in its benchmark said the patch on Safari is going to give you a 1% to 2% performance degradation.  That's not noticeable. Anything below 5%, you wouldn't notice.  Nobody will notice it.  So, bottom line is you should patch as soon as a patch is available.  There are some complications, however.  For instance, this is very annoying.  If you are running a third party antivirus on Windows, it may be blocking the Microsoft patch.  This is one of the reasons I tell people don't use third party antiviruses.  Antiviruses use unsupported calls to make kernel memory calls.  This would be blocked by the patch.  And it would result in a blue screen of death.  So, a lot of people, I've heard from a number of people, said, well, I installed Microsoft's out of bandwidth patch last week,  and I got a blue screen of death immediately.  That's because of your third party antivirus.  And there's a list of third party antiviruses.  This is from ZDNet.  Although the list is being maintained by Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher.  He's got a public spreadsheet. That would be more up to date.  This goes back to January 5th.  A lot of antiviruses have not been fixed or haven't done what Microsoft asked,  which was to change a registry key to signal to Windows Update, okay, it's okay to install now.  So, you may still not be getting it.  It's kind of a mess.  But I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think it's anything anybody should freak out about.  It's very hard to use this.

Start time: 778.40
End time: 825.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If you do want to freak out about it, here's one reason why you might want to do that.  So, up until this point, whether anybody has exploited it is anyone's guess.  And like you've said, it could be a state actor or whatever, who knows what's going on, could be the NSA.  But now that it's been announced, there's a scramble, no doubt, among hackers to figure out if and how and when they can exploit this.  So, it's a challenge.  And so, the industry is quickly patching it and trying to fix it and fix the leaks.  But as you pointed out, some Windows users aren't getting it.  There's going to be different rollouts.  And so, there's a new urgency in the hacker, malicious actor, industrial complex to exploit this.

Start time: 825.02
End time: 829.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Right. They know now it's there.  Exactly.  Timing floods are notoriously difficult. Amy?

Start time: 830.56
End time: 879.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would say to go ahead and freak out about it.  Thanks for calming everything down.  You're from the freak out faction.  But here's why.  If it was the case that, and this is particularly complicated because it's a hardware issue.  And on top of it, it's not a bug that appeared overnight because somebody was trying to sort of make an update.  And in the process of making the update, they broke something.  This was a hardware flaw that has been inherent in the system that people knew about.  I could say the same of Sony, which is no stranger to problems with hackers and has a very, very long history of ignoring all of the weak signals.  Right.  And Sony would be.  Alerting them that something's wrong.

Start time: 881.22
End time: 885.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Their attack was a targeted attack that would be particularly vulnerable to this kind of vulnerability.

Start time: 886.02
End time: 953.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the point that I'm making is the part that people should be freaking out about is that I, you know, are as technology becomes more complicated, it's going to start breaking in in sort of strange ways, which means that companies need to be ever more vigilant about forecasting out in advance and pressure testing systems for things like timing flaws, which somebody somewhere in the organization I have to have thought raise.  They had to have raised that issue at some point.  And it's not like this was a this could not have come as a giant surprise.  And I might even argue that it was an intentional and the consequences wound up being worse than than maybe the risk management people might have thought in advance.  So the reason to sort of freak out is because we think that once we purchase technology, it's ours and we have agency and domain over it.  This is yet another example that that's not the case.  And I know that these these glitches and these hacks are getting more and more complicated for the average person to understand.  However, it's incumbent upon us to keep states focused and and to ask for some serious answers.

Start time: 954.36
End time: 972.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Intel, there are several, of course, class action lawsuits.  That's not really probative.  But there is some speculation that maybe this is a janky way to do it.  And Intel should be faulted for choosing this way to speed up their processors.  I don't know. I'm not educated enough to say.

Start time: 974.59
End time: 993.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'm not a you know, I'm not a hardware person.  You'd have to be a chip designer to really understand if this is not like this was a brand new design and they were trying to do something totally radically different over the last design cycle.  This is going back. Actually, you're right.

Start time: 994.62
End time: 1049.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Ninety five. This was a problem. But remember, a little bit later, Intel's lunch was starting to get eaten by AMD.  Intel went down a bad road with the titanium.  They suddenly realized you can't get faster than four gigahertz.  There just becomes unreliable.  They were up against maybe not by 1995, but but quickly thereafter up against a wall of performance.  And there was huge demand for more performance.  And as I remember it, I remember Intel happened to have this skunkworks project in Israel that they when I titanium failed, they went to that were doing things like branch prediction and speculative execution to get more performance out of the x86 platform.  They were they wanted to move away from it.  And they chose to go with x86.  Perhaps could fault fault them for making a poor design decision.  But on the other hand, it's been 22 years before we found the problem.

Start time: 1050.07
End time: 1078.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And so again, I come back to I hear from a lot of people.  This has been around for 22 years.  It's impossible that it's just now somebody figured this out.  You know, I wouldn't worry about it, right?  If something horrible hasn't happened yet, you know, what's the what's the probability?  And again, to me, this is yet another example of organizations making sacrifices for whatever gain that put consumers in harm's way.

Start time: 1080.70
End time: 1159.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, this is a really good example of something so technical that even we as people who cover tech have a hard time wrapping our head around it.  Steve Gibson, we talked about this on Tuesday.  And even on Tuesday, Steve Gibson was, you know, and nobody hears this other problem might cause a slowdown.  We nobody really understood the impact of this for a while.  And it took a lot of minds thinking about it.  How do you then explain this to regular people and CEOs and other people?  I mean, how do you this is a this is the world we're living in.  In fact, I remember Jerry, the late Jerry Purnell writing.  I think it was in Lucifer's Hammer.  And this was many years ago.  He said, We're already in a world where most of the technology people use, they don't understand.  They don't know how it's made.  You could know how an internal combustion engine worked.  Good luck explaining how a computer works.  And if a catastrophic event were to happen, like an asteroid hitting the earth as it does in the book, we wouldn't be able to recreate it.  Nobody would know how it how it was made in the first place.  We're using stuff that is effectively magical.  And now we're asking the wizards who created the magic.  Hey, guys, don't screw up.  But we have no way to test that.

Start time: 1159.26
End time: 1163.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Just wait until the AI is creating the AI.  Well, that's just a matter of time.  How do we do that?

Start time: 1164.04
End time: 1233.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's kind of already.  But that's already so.  But that's kind of my point, right?  Because we're already so I will preface this by saying there's a lot of misplaced optimism and fear when it comes to writing the book.  You're writing the book.  You're writing the book about that.  Yes.  So but we can't submit ourselves every time we butt up against a rough problem and and sort of just say, well, this is like a black box.  If I had a nickel for every time I've heard somebody describe a complicated technology as a black box that we just can't understand, we shouldn't be in a position where we're creating technology that we can't understand, let alone can't explain.  Right.  You know, and there's a lot of.  You know, there's a lot of that.  So that either tells me that humans have just gotten lazy and we we don't want to take the time to understand.  I mean, obviously, technology has gotten a lot more complicated.  But, you know, we should not be in a situation where we are entirely reliant on tools and services and code and devices that that, you know, we we can't in any meaningful way.  Understand how it works.  Right.  From a journalistic standpoint, hard.

Start time: 1236.71
End time: 1404.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  This is all rocket science.  From a journalistic standpoint, I think that this is another one of those challenges on multiple levels.  One, because, yes, you know, we're talking about trying to explain this to I go back to the book that I was talking about.  I go back to I go back to normal people who people who aren't steeped in technology like we are.  And when when we try to explain this, a lot of times it's like people maybe necessarily who aren't interested in hearing about it and are just like, you know, they'll they'll figure it out.  So it does sort of go back to that apathy, I think about these magical boxes that we don't understand how they work.  And so we're apathetic to the problems because maybe we've never experienced them before ourselves.  And so there are two things that become an issue.  One is just explaining it in general.  But two is like keeping control of the of the message or or making sure that the right message gets out there.  Because inevitably how these things play out is it gets to the people that know more about this stuff and they write their articles, they write their explanations, they put up their blog posts, they make comics, what have you.  And then it trickles down to more mainstream.  It's like secondary. And then the main mainstream, it gets on local news outlets and things like that.  And by the time it gets there, it's been bastardized so much and and sort of translated so much that oftentimes there's so much inaccuracy because of the vagueness of it.  And so by the time it gets to, you know, a family member of mine who is not as steeped in technology as I am, they're hearing a whole different story and it's the worst possible thing.  Then you add on top of that, the fact that all of these news outlets are scrambling for views are scrambling for clicks are scrambling for for page views and things like that.  And you have headlines that tell incorrect stories or don't tell the whole story.  And a lot of times we know, like we can tell from all of these different things that track our our usage and our our activity on pages that people oftentimes don't go through and read the article.  They read headlines. They read, you know, Twitter sized bits of information.  And so what we're doing is spreading misinformation.  And it's so hard to get caught up with that.  And even if we do sort of come back and say, OK, you know, you've heard this, but it's not exactly this.  You try to explain what it is. Those articles get far less views than any of the articles that originally went out there and said, this is the end of the world.  Everything's melting down. So it's it's it's a problem.

Transcript:  Your computer is a time bomb. Film of Eleven.  And but but it is the world we live in where you want to be.  We were talking about this before the show. You want to be first.  You want to the only way to get the links is to be sensational and fast.  And that's the worst situation.  But I think both Amy and Mike are saying what I would completely agree with what is ultimately this is the job of of journalism is to find is to is to do the work to understand the tough stuff.  And whether it's tech or government or whatever, and explain it so that we can have an informed populace.

Start time: 1440.54
End time: 1536.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Right. That's the job. Well, they're journalists, they're reporters, and then there are editorialists like myself.  And so one of the things that I would say is it's it's probably less important.  I mean, the public is never going to understand this stuff. Right.  The public can't locate Australia on a map. Yeah. Right.  So the public is never going to understand this kind of security.  And it's far more important that they have a sort of a behavioral operating system for coping with this stuff.  And here's why. Every time we learn about these things, it's already been out there forever.  I mean, this this one's been out there for two decades.  So it's like it doesn't matter what you know now. It matters what you've been doing for two decades.  So we need to figure out how to instruct the public so that they can protect their data.  Because we're always shocked and surprised by all the different creative ways that our information can be stolen from us.  Every year, there's two or three major stories that is like, I never even thought that was a way that people could harvest all my passwords.  Third party cloud services are routinely hacked and all this stuff downloaded and so on.  And so we there needs to be a much greater emphasis on providing the public with an all purpose set of behaviors and tools that will allow them to keep their data safe.  No matter what is that possible. It's possible.  OK, I like it. It's possible to do the best we can with that.  So right now, there's certainly update. Yeah, update.  Backup in the cloud password.  Amy doesn't seem convinced. Amy, you read the article in The Atlantic in September.

Transcript:  We already have the tools to protect ourselves and in a reasonable way against threats and hacks.  I mean, I would walk I would walk out in the street right now and just ask random people when the last time was that they updated their OS, right?  Updated the router settings. I mean, like updated everything.  People just don't do it for any number of different reasons.  You know, I don't know.  And I would also just I mean, it's plausible to give people the tool set, but it's improbable to give people the toolset.  But it's improbable that that, you know, the everyday person is going to see the urgency and keeping themselves constantly safe.  I mean, it's it's replicate. This is this is why companies don't a lot of companies don't participate in strategic foresight and they don't do the work of a futurist.  Because until something happens, they don't see the value in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and that's right. So, you know, for Sony to have for Sony to have completely changed what it was doing, the net the many, many, many times that it got hacked would have been an investment for everyday people for everyday people to do the type of safeguarding that we're talking about, which isn't just running patches and updates, but also paying attention to the news.

Transcript:  So we're talking about an investment in time and money that companies which have a financial stake in all of this aren't willing to make.  You know, I just don't see everyday people being willing to do that either.  Now, I will say that this, you know, I'm a quantitative futurist and this has been my job for 15 years, but I had a first career.  I was a journalist. I was a correspondent and I worked at the Wall Street Journal and at Newsweek.  I think that's why I lived in Japan and China and I went to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.  So, you know, the comments about journalists exploiting tech news for traffic gain, I think is some of that may be true.  And we certainly live in a digital economy where attention is currency, unfortunately.  But just because you produce, like just because, you know, Randall Monroe creates a really great XKCD that explains this very complicated problem doesn't mean that my dad, you know, is reading it.  And it doesn't mean that my dad will read it even if I send it to him. Right.  So part of the problem is, again, we're quick to blame institutions and we're, you know, we're quick to blame journalists lately.  We are reluctant to blame ourselves in being complicit in some of this.

But I have, you know, I have a very methodical way of constantly updating all my stuff, you know, and I have secondary and tertiary checks running on different things.

Because when we have a network of devices that are vulnerable in some way, it makes it easier for people to find the big payoffs, the big zero days.  Right.

But this is an example of I would I would say, Amy, that if your dad doesn't even understand it, but if your dad were writing for the Wall Street Journal, it would behoove him to talk to experts, find out as much as he can and do the best job he can explaining it to people who need to know this information.

Transcript:  I mean, the easiest way to do here's this.  I think we just I think the four of us actually just came up with the solution.  And the solution is we need some kind of.  No, no, no, no.  Here's the solution, because I think we need like a CDC for.  I love it.  There we go.  You're right.  We need we need a you know, the Centers for Disease Control.  If you stop and think about sort of their mandate and what they do and where they are and how they're funded, a lot of what they do is try to predict and manage epidemics to manage the overall health of people living in our country.  I think that we're probably due for some kind of CDC that does exactly what we were talking about moments ago, you know, which is like there kind of is there kind of is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but I because I've looked at their work before and I just it's not it's it's not the same.  So Mike made a very, very good point, which was that we need to position ourselves so that everyday people have tools and and on that website, if you show it again, there you can follow it.  And on the site, they do every now and then list.  Right. So the current activity and they've got that alerts and tips.  Yeah, they do have like PDFs and things that you can download.  But, you know, it doesn't we need a CDC level kind of sort of institution that has the the press savvy that can that can help educate the public.

Start time: 2043.12

Transcript:  Right. It is. Yeah. I mean, you know, I was just think this is a little off topic, but I was just thinking about this the other day.  There are so many apps these days where one of the first things that asks you is, hey, if you want to get in touch with all of your friends, go ahead and click this button.  And we'll make sure that if your friends are on this app, then you can use it, too.  And then you upload your entire database of contact information to their database, your entire library of contact information.  And it's just it's a small thing, but it's essentially sort of breaking the trust of everybody who trusted you with their information, trusted you with their phone number, their email, their address, whatever ends up getting updated to those cloud servers.  And we all know we all do it. Yeah.

Start time: 2107.16

Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, to me, the most outrageous and underappreciated example of that is Google Photos, which I love.  Absolutely love Google Photos. But Google Photos, I can take pictures of all kinds of people, strangers, anybody, and it uploads a Google Photos.  And then it asks me to say who they are. So I'm basically saying, oh, that's Leo.  Yeah, I didn't ask your permission. They didn't ask your permission.

Start time: 2131.69
End time: 2170.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  But Facebook's even worse, though. Oh, yeah.  And part of the problem is Facebook, for example, leaks information in ways that the user doesn't know.  So there's a friend to friend problem on Facebook, which is if you take a Facebook quiz, which isn't really a quiz.  I know you really want to know which Game of Thrones character you are.  But really, really what's happening is you're giving a lot of information to a third party like, let's say, Cambridge Analytica.  But worse than that, as soon as you agree to that, they get access not to your information, but your friend's information.  So you're leaking. And I don't think people know that. And you're leaking your friend's information.  You probably if you knew that might not even do it. But nobody knows.

Start time: 2171.56
End time: 2224.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So now let's let's just take that entire story, Leo, that you just told.  And instead of photos and instead of face of Game of Thrones and a game, let's say that because what you're describing a communicable disease.  Yes. Right. So so so which everybody seems to want to get is worse.  It's like, give me smallpox. If this was the CDC and if we use the same vocabulary.  Yeah. Because part of the problem is currently like everyday people lack the analogies to understand the impact of these systems and tools.  So you could describe what exactly what you just said and replace Facebook with smallpox and people would immediately understand that, you know, this is something that they should be paying attention to.  We have a shared vocabulary. And I'm not comparing. I'm not saying that Facebook is smallpox.  I am. I am.

And they put it out on January 3rd. They updated January 4th. They updated again on Friday.  Apparently, they went home for the weekend. That's too bad. But so they're underfunded.  But it's pretty good with links to vendors and vendor mitigations, lots of additional information, including the original research.  They refer to the United Kingdom, which has a nice national cybersecurity center.  So they're working with other governmental, similar governmental agencies.  This is right. But what they what they lack is the one thing I think you're right that they need to do, which is a better public facing presence.

Start time: 2276.26

Transcript:  Yes. And it's not written. US CERT is, you know, if you have some of the language and you're a little bit more technically inclined, it's a great site to be on.  It's for sysadmins and IT pros. Yeah.  That's right. That's right. And to be fair, the CDC has plenty of very top level public health and medical vocabulary and language and everything else.  But the everyday person can and journalists can also go onto that website and still make sense of what's there.  So that's you know, we need and we have people from the CDC who go out and speak.  We've had movies made about the CDC. CDC is part of NCIS.  Make it sexy. Yeah. That's right. Yeah.  I like that. So I think we just solved the problem.

Trump's cyber is going to be huge. It's clearly going to get right to work on this.  I know Donald watches. We have the biggest cyber.  Yeah. Maybe we can get Joe Scarborough to talk about it.  Let's take a break. This is a great conversation. And we've just begun.  I think we've done with Meltdown Inspector, but I do encourage everybody.  I mean, the bottom line, you're watching this. You understand it.  But tell your friends and family, make sure you update those systems.  Make sure you do those patches.  It isn't, you know, perhaps as easy as just doing the operating system patches.  There will be microcode patches for the processors.  And I have to say, I've read reports, good reports from security experts who say,  in some cases, new hardware will be required.  That's a big problem because nobody, I just bought an iMac Pro.  Do I have to buy another one in a year?  Throw it away. I'm going to throw it away.  It's got the Meltdown Inspector.  It's got the STG.  It's got the Meltdown.  But good news, I'm Cersei Lannister.  So that's the good news.  Amazon Go opens tomorrow.  This is in the Amazon headquarters. It's the first.  But the idea is there's no humans.  You walk in, it recognizes you, I presume, from your phone.  You pick up what you want. You walk out.  You walk out, cameras register what you bought on the shelves and other places  and charge you for it on, I guess, Android Pay or what they call Google Pay now.

Start time: 2414.04
End time: 2434.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_33
Transcript:  Yeah, this is...  Where's Amazon Pay at?  You still have to register your phone when you walk in.  So you have to say, here's my phone. You scan it.  Now your phone is matched to you.  And then presumably the system with all the cameras in the store  are taking pictures of you, watching where you go.  There are sensors on the products.  This is like a Vegas minibar, right?

Transcript:  Right. But what was interesting about it was that apparently in this demo store,  there were still quite a few employees standing around  to do things like ID checks on the alcohol section.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Interesting.  And if you have any experience, and this is really the basic version of this,  it's not that crazy when you think about self-checkout at Safeway or what have you.  But I don't know how often you've done that.  I'm forced to do it all the time.  It's a pain in the butt.  There are always checkers having to come over and help people  with their transactions for all kinds of reasons.  And those already existing systems don't let you take alcohol through them usually.  So I think it's a proof of concept.  And maybe a little bit getting people used to the idea  that you don't have to interact with a human,  because kind of like the autonomous driving conversation,  it's something that people will feel uncomfortable with for a long time  until they do it and they see those charges pop up easily.  And they'll just be like, wait, I can just come in and go,  how are you going to know and what's going to, and why are you tracking me?  And as I think they're just getting people used to this idea.

There certainly will be a lot of other things to do at these stores, I would think.  But yeah, I'm super excited about the potential as well.  There are definitely times where just going to a gas station and needing a couple of things,  it would certainly be nice to just walk in, grab it and walk out again rather than standing  in line waiting for everybody else to get their coffee order right.

Eero has been a sponsor for a couple of years.  Eero joined us right at the very beginning when they first came out.  That's when I started using Eero.  They've moved on.  Eero 2.0 is now out.  So I upgraded our home system to the new version of Eero.  And I gave the old one to my mom, who loves it.  We're all Eero'd up in the Laporte family.  What is Eero?  Well, it's the solution for bad Wi-Fi, in a nutshell.  The single router model these days, it doesn't work that well.  We all have more devices on our Wi-Fi.  We have neighbors with big old...  I feel like sometimes the neighbors must have big antennas aimed at us  because they interfere with our Wi-Fi.  It's physics.  Like light waves, Wi-Fi waves don't really travel very well around corners,  through walls, upstairs and downstairs.  It's like asking a light bulb in your living room to light the whole house.  So you need something a little bit smarter.  You need a distributed system now.  Years gone by, we've had distributed systems, for instance, at Twitter for a decade.  Most businesses have distributed systems.  But that's been complicated, required an IT professional.  It's not easy to do and it is absolutely not expensive.  Fast forward to the present times.  We have a better choice.  We have Eero.  E-E-R-O brings that distributed Wi-Fi model, the enterprise-grade Wi-Fi system to your home.  Set it up in a few minutes.  You don't need an IT professional.  It is not expensive and it really works.  And I'm here to tell you, I use it and I know.  You put the Eero app in your iOS or Android device.  It walks you through the setup.  It's painless.  You'll plug in the first unit, the base unit, and then you have a couple of beacons.  Depends on the size of your house.  The typical kit has one base and two beacons.  Those beacons, no wires.  They just plug into the wall.  But you're going to use the app to help place them.  You place them as strategic points.  I like to keep them in halls.  Because not only I feel like the bandwidth is, you know, it's like the highway for the bandwidth,  but also the beacons are great because they have a little light on them.  They make great night lights.  So they light up our halls.  You can turn those off if you don't want them to do that.  And then you've got Wi-Fi throughout your house and the Eero app lets you manage the network  in the palm of your hand.  You'll know how many devices are connected to any given access point.  You'll know the Internet speed you're getting.  They test it nightly.  You'll know, I mean, all sorts of stuff.  Plus, they've got this new Eero Plus feature that I adore.  You don't know this is a subscription feature you don't have to get.  You'll get all the benefits of Eero without it.  But Eero Plus really is a nice add on.  It's simply designed reliable security that defends you against threats in the outside world.  Blocks malware from the whole network.  Blocks spyware from the whole network.  Phishing attacks, unsuitable content.  If you have kids in the house and we have a 16 year old, I can just block the devices  he uses from adult content, gambling, violence, that kind of thing on the Internet.  But we can all be blocked, all be prevented from getting malware.  I really love that.  You can also check the sites you visit.  Well, actually, this is what it does automatically against their database of known threats.  So it keeps you from even going to malicious sites, but it doesn't slow you down.  And that's the beauty part of it.  It's actually a deal.  Take a look.  Eero Plus automatically tags sites that contain violent, illegal or adult content so you can  choose what your kids can and cannot visit right in the Eero app.  What else?  Oh, you get a guest network that's completely separate from your network.  State of the art WPA2 encryption.  I can't sell this enough.  They don't mention it, but regular firmware updates.  Very important nowadays.  Don't buy a router that doesn't update automatically.  The Eero does.  They're constantly working to make sure it's the most secure, has the latest features and  the latest security.  And I have to admit, when I first got the Eero, I had some questions about how to set  it up and stuff.  I called support.  They were so great.  You'll get a Wi-Fi expert fast within 30 seconds.  And what was nice is they stayed on the phone with me until I said, yep, it's all lit up.  They really walked me through it.  Great support.  What else can I tell you about them?  The guest network WPA2 encryption.  They've said already that they'll be able to upgrade to the new WPA3 and software as  soon as that's ready, as soon as that standard is defined.  You can look at the Eero app at any time and see everything that's going on.  I just love this thing.  Look, I know the worst thing any geek can hear.  Honey, the Wi-Fi is down.  I used to get that all the time until we got an Eero.  It's great.  It's great.  Eero.com slash twit.  Enter the code twit at checkout for a hundred bucks off.  Now back to twit.

Transcript:  I don't know.  I kind of feel like I was a little bit harder on it than other people.  Do you guys feel that way?  You weren't as hard on it as I was.  Really?  Okay.  Because I felt like it just feels like it's unfinished, right?  Because Siri does a lot more on the iPhone than it does on the HomePod.  So it's been training us to use Siri in a certain way and yet things like the calendar,  which I use a lot with Siri, doesn't work on the HomePod.  Things like hailing a car doesn't work on Siri on the HomePod, but it works on the iPhone  and other things like that.  So it just feels like...  I don't know why they released it when it's not really done.  I mean, indisputably it's not done because that multi-room speaker feature is not out  yet.  What I don't really get is if they're already late, why even come out when it's unfinished?  It kind of makes it hard for me to write about because I'm like, well, the music part sounds  great but all this other stuff doesn't work and that's awkward.  Devendra, you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  I mean, I've only listened to it a bit.  Chris Velasco at Engadget is going to be reviewing that for us.  It sounds really good because it's a $350 super high-tech speaker.  But yeah, I agree.  The Siri stuff is...  It feels really unfinished, really weak in comparison to what we're getting from Alexa  speakers.  I also tested out the Harman Kardon Invoke, which is the Cortana speaker, and even that  felt more fully featured than the HomePod.  That thing's just $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  This was supposed to...  You're not getting the Kool-Aid soaked in.  So let me channel Tim Cook here and say, but what you guys don't understand, it's not a  Siri device.  It's a speaker.  It's all about the sound.  We're reinventing how stereos, how speakers work.  The Siri capability is merely to play music.  You're thinking it's an Echo.  It's not an Echo.  It's a new kind of music listening device.

Start time: 3505.92
End time: 3556.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it was Phil Schiller who said that.  Oh, sorry.  I channeled the wrong guy.  No worries.  Basically, he was saying, he was giving us a history of how the HomePod was made.  So it's been in development for six years on and off.  They tabled it for a little bit in between.  So they started it before Apple Music even launched, before they even bought Beats even,  and before HomeKit came out.  So the HomePod comes out after this.  It's in development before that, but all this stuff comes out in the middle.  And then suddenly they had to get this HomePod to work with these new services that Apple  has.  So you can kind of get the sense of why it was so chaotic to develop this thing.  But then when you try it, you're going to realize, hmm, this thing doesn't really seem  like it's that polished.  It doesn't really seem like it's done.  So how much can you justify it being that dumb?  It sounds amazing.  It sounds great.

Start time: 3557.48
End time: 3616.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  This is where I would disagree.  I don't think it sounds that amazing.  I think Apple fails on all fronts.  Now it sounds good.  It sounds fine.  It's good.  That's the first I've heard.  Yeah.  Look, I'll read some of the headlines.  Apple HomePod review.  This is Joanna Stern.  Super sound, but not super smart.  They agreed with you.  The iMore folks.  Retina for your ears.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  Leelai Patel in The Verge said, I am a speaker fanatic.  And he showed off his analog stereo.  And I think this sounds amazing.  But there's a problem.  There's something called physics.  And I, you know, I know that, that, you know, the Australian prime minister thinks that  physics is not an immutable law, but I think physics is an immutable law.  And this, which is not a HomePod, it's just an amazing simulation.  This is too small to really be a great speaker.  So I think if you're going to say it sounds good, you really should add the clause.  It sounds good for its size.

Start time: 3616.56
End time: 3623.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  Sure.  Yeah, that's a good point.  And it definitely does fill up the whole room.  Like a small size apartment.  That's one thing that's interesting because it has tweeters all around it.

Start time: 3628.16
End time: 3664.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's it.  I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not going to pretend that I know great details about like  these seven tweeters and all that stuff and have like a great attention to detail when  it comes to sound.  But, you know, it sounds really good to me compared to a lot of speakers I've tried.  But I don't think that really justifies the fact that Siri is quite inadequate compared  to how it even is on the iPhone or how it's compared to Alexa even.  Like here's a thought experiment, guys.  So imagine if Apple had waited another year and made all those features work that are  missing on Siri and released it as it is with nice music, nice sound, and all those nice  features working as a virtual assistant.

Start time: 3664.88
End time: 3728.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Well, there's another problem.  It only works with Apple Music.  Here's my opinion.  That's another.  This is designed for somebody who is bathing in the warm glow of the Apple bath.  This is for somebody because you can't even set it up if you don't have an iPhone or an  iPad.  Right.  Not even a Mac.  You can't use a Mac.  You cannot use it without an iPhone or an iPad.  Wow.  Okay.  That's insane.  So this is a product designed for somebody who is absolutely in the, I mean, I'm not  going to say Apple sheep, but somebody who's really in the Apple ecosystem and wants something  that is already a subscriber to Apple Music, wants something that works with Apple Music.  It sounds fine for its size.  My issue is, you know, we did a comparison yesterday in the new screensavers.  We compared the Invoke, the Harman Kardon, which did not sound as good.  The Sonos One, which is Sonos' small Play One speaker with Amazon Echo built in, which  actually wasn't as good but was close and it's half the price.  You could buy two and get a stereo pair that might be fairly competitive.

Start time: 3729.24
End time: 3733.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  We compared it to...  Or get a Play Three and an Echo Dot, right?  There are other ways to do that.

Start time: 3733.32
End time: 3813.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Compared to a Play Three or a Play Five, I don't think the Apple's HomePod is as good.  And I guess the point I would really make is if you want a good speaker, if you want  good sound, this is how I think of it.  You know, I brought this up.  Keith Richards, the guitarist for the Rolling Stone, wrote most of their songs with Mick  Jagger.  He got his musical education listening to a tinny transistor radio in bed, listening  to a pirate radio station out in the ocean.  It sounded crappy, but that's how he heard Howlin' Wolf in Muddy Waters and became a  music fanatic.  Paul McCartney, same thing.  You can...  You're still getting some music, but there's all the music that you would hear in a live  performance.  And then with each smaller device, each less capable device, you get less and less of the  music.  If you're really into music, you should freaking get a stereo.  Spend a little bit more money and get a stereo.  Get two speakers and sit at the apex of the triangle and listen.  And if I put the...  And I did this.  Put the HomePod in the middle and listen to my stereo.  It's not...  It's like a different song.  It's like different music.  It's completely a different experience.  You're getting a half, a quarter of the full experience when you listen to the HomePod.  So for Apple to say, well, no, no, it's not a Siri device.  It's a new way of thinking about music is wrong.

Start time: 3814.02
End time: 3847.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  And the deal breaker for me too that I wrote about in the review is it was picking the  wrong music for me.  Despite all the shortcomings of Siri or in addition to all the shortcomings, I was trying  to go along with like, oh, this should be primarily about music.  This should be great at playing music.  In the Apple Music app, I selected all my favorite artists.  They were like, Smiths, Radiohead, Talking Heads, blah, blah, blah.  And instead of picking artists similar to mine, I would ask Siri to play some music  and it would play Dashboard Confessional, which I'm sorry.  I hate that band so much.  I can beat that.

I mean, you know, I like NWA as much as the next guy, but I was thinking something a little  bit more mellow.  I don't know.  I Baroque or something.  And finally, part of that is because Apple is Apple Music's problem, not the HomePod's  problem, right?

Transcript:  I thought Apple Music was supposed to be better.  So I'm not personally an Apple Music user.  I use Spotify, but you know, I had tested it before and these 4U playlists more or less  had some pretty, pretty spot on playlists generated for me back in the day when I was  testing this.  Spotify's good, I think.  Spotify's really good too.  When I first turned on the HomePod, I said play some music.  I expected it to look at my history of what I listen to on Apple Music and also the artists  that I picked, which is pretty obvious.  And it was playing all this random stuff.  Dashboard Confessional being one, Leroy Francis I've never listened to, Selena Gomez.  I don't even know who these people are really.  Oh, you know Selena Gomez.  Yeah.  You know, like somehow it thinks I'm a 17 year old or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  Yeah.  Here's the thing though.  You, you make a good point about is this a, if you really want the audio experience,  then get a stereo.  But the point of all these devices, the Sonos, the Echo, the Invoke, which I have one of  here and this HomePod, the whole point of it is that you shouldn't have to whip out  a phone or an iPad.  You should be able to just drive the thing by talking.  Right.  Right.  It's the, and so even if it isn't as intelligent as the others, even if it doesn't have the  full Siri experience, you should at least be able to go through the basics and say,  play this, play that, play the other thing, get my entire music collection from the cloud,  play this album or that album.  And from what I understand, it doesn't do that.  And if it doesn't do that, I, you know, I think Brian's absolutely right.  Why did they ship this thing?  There's a case to be made sometimes for shipping things early when they have to be out in the  world and people have to be interacting with them so that, so that the engineers can get  feedback and they can fine tune the thing quickly.  But that's not the case here.  They just ship this thing before it was ready.  Given the amount of money that Apple has in the bank, I just don't understand why.

Start time: 4002.98
End time: 4035.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  Yeah.  It almost feels like they have competitive pressure because Amazon made a killing during  the holidays.  They slashed the price of the Echo to 85 from 99.  I think those are the numbers.  And so, you know, they have more pressure than ever to put this thing out.  But at the same time, Apple has been saying for years, like, we don't rush to be first.  Right.  We're fine with being later and doing a better job than everybody else.  In this case, I mean, I think they could only say that, you know, maybe Leo disagrees, but  they did better with audio quality, but they really just dropped the ball on everything else.

Transcript:  It's decent for what it is.  You know, there are times when you would want a home pod.  For instance, in the kitchen, it's great because you don't stand.  I mean, if you're listening to music, you don't always get to sit in the sweet spot  with two speakers left and right.  Yeah.  You're in the kitchen, you're cooking, you're moving around.  And it's great for that because of the tweeters all the way around.  And it sounds good no matter where you are.  So I think it's but it's a single it's a mono speaker.  They don't have any stereo option.

Start time: 4058.56
End time: 4072.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  Well, you can add a second speaker that plays at the same time.  I think that's not turned on.  You can in a future software update.  In a future update.  And that's my point, right?  It's not done.  So why didn't they wait like six months or something to ship a perfectly polished product  that would have been really nice?

And I don't want Apple to start saying how great this sounds because I think it's doing  a disservice to people who could hear a lot more of the music.  You can't get a speaker that size for 350 bucks that's going to be a great speaker.  You can't.  It's great for its size.  And I think there are even better speakers for that price, frankly.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The Sonos Play 3 is what, 300?  Yeah.  And that thing sounds a lot better.  I think so.  It has more bass for one thing.  It has more bass.  To Apple's credit, I think what they did really well with the HomePod is that you can push  that thing to max volume and it won't distort.  It does handle high volume.  Nothing distorts.  I think partially because it doesn't really go as max as some other things.  We were comparing it to the Google Max and that thing goes much louder and then you start  to hear the bass starts to distort and some of the high notes.  So you can see that Apple is trying to balance something here.  But I think you're onto something, Leo.  Anybody who grew up with iPods or just in general, we got used to OK sounding music  and most people just don't have speakers in their homes.  I think that's a bigger thing too.

Transcript:  And by the way, my ears are shot from years of wearing headphones and listening to rock  and roll way too loud.  But I can tell the difference.  And so I figured that somebody younger with better ears owes themselves something a little  bit better.  The Sonos Play 3 is 250 bucks, 100 bucks less.  Oh wow.  So for 50 bucks more you can get a Play 5, which really sounds good.  And even then though, I wish you would spend a little more and get a stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  Well that's like the ultimate dream.  I would wish more consumers would do that.  But what I love about these devices is that Sonos and everything, it made it easy for  everybody to bring music out loud back into their homes.  The big downside with HomePod for me is that it's so limited, right?  It's limited to Apple Music.  But we're so many people are using Spotify now or you have your library of music on other  devices.  You know, there's no OxJack, of course.  There's none of the things you see even in simple Bluetooth speakers these days.  I really like what Logitech's been doing, honestly.  Like they just released their new lineup, which has Alexa built in and they're also  like Bluetooth portable speakers that you can take around everywhere.  You can put them in the shower or you can take them to the beach.  Like we've there's so much innovation happening here.  Like what HomePod offers just doesn't feel like it's enough today.

Transcript:  Well I think we're beating a dead horse.  But I just I make me feel bad.  I think Ed, you're right.  I mean, I think the future and by the way, this device, the HomePod is great for podcasting,  as is the Amazon Echo and even the Invoke.  Because you can buy voice in your house, say, let's, you know, let me listen to Twitter.  Let me listen to your podcast and, you know, slash film.  And that's great for podcasting and puts podcasting in a way ahead of radio in a way that I think  is going to be very good for us.  So I'm not knocking these devices.  And I agree with you, Ed, that that's the but Apple's not selling that.  Apple's selling it as a great speaker.  And I think that that's I think it's doing us a disservice.  If you just said, here's a pretty good speaker that you can listen to music on in your kitchen.  That's what it is.  Sure.  I'll give you that.  And Ed, you're right.  I mean, the Siri at least does that much.  It plays music.  Apple music.  The fact that does do Spotify is that's going to come to.

Transcript:  Well, this is actually this was actually the original problem with the original iPhone  as well.  Most people forget that the original iPhone, I mean, it didn't support apps.  It you know, it didn't it didn't have an app store.  It didn't didn't support exchange mail.  It had a whole bunch of things that were wrong with it.  And they fixed that over the first year.  But that was also one of the that was also one of the things that had to go out into  the world and be used by people to, you know, to improve in that fashion.  And it isn't necessary.

And Safari browser was amazing compared to the really pared down browsers on old cell  phones. So even though there were all these things missing, like it's hard to compare  with the HomePod, I think we're like the iPhone at least was a working functional product.

Transcript:  For sure.  You know, what's funny is we come almost full circle now because and Microsoft's been  pushing this, they're probably at the Build Conference.  They're going to talk a lot about progressive web apps, which are different, but in a way  they're the same as the web apps for the original iPhone.  The idea that you would go to a website and you'd save it on your home screen.  And now that's an app on your iPhone.  That's what I'm excited about.  Progressive web apps, though, and I feel like that's it.  I wish Apple would get behind that.  They're being a little slow to the party.

Start time: 4476.00
End time: 4547.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so, too.  But in both of these cases, in the case of progressive web apps and in the whole competition  with Spotify thing, what you're really seeing here is Apple protecting its sort of core  services.  And in a way that's very, very Microsoft like.  Yep.  They're they're refusing to disrupt themselves.  You know, and in fact, there was some forget who's who wrote this last week, but somebody  did a study showing that Apple Music subscriptions are rising faster than Spotify subscriptions.  And Apple Music will probably catch up with Spotify by maybe by the end of this year in  terms of the install base.  And so, you know, a cynic could look at this and say, well, one reason that Apple's not  putting Spotify on this and they're making it difficult for Spotify to succeed in the  Apple hardware ecosystem is specifically so that Apple Music can surpass Spotify in terms  of market share.  A lot of money there.

Start time: 4547.52
End time: 4555.52

Transcript:  The proof of that is there's no Bluetooth in the HomePod.  Yeah.  Something that would allow you to open it up to an Android device, for instance.

End time: 4607.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_34
Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's look at the Apple Watch for comparison, right?  So the Apple Watch, you have to have an iPhone to set it up, right?  And it's still that way, even though it's more independent than it was before.  But the Apple Watch so far seems pretty successful.  So and, you know, this is some inside information, but I've heard that they have considered  sharing the Apple Watch of Android phones.  But what's stopping them is that so many Android people are switching to the iPhone.  So why would they give people incentive to stay of Android if so many people are switching  to the iPhone?  So that's how these decisions are made.  But my point being that, you know, counter argument, the Apple Watch only works with  the iPhone, and yet people seem to love it and it's still pretty successful.

Transcript:  If you're in the you know what?  I bet Ed would agree with this.  The advantage of an ecosystem play like that and siloing it like that is you can make it  a seamless, great experience.  And Apple has done that.  So if you live in the Apple world, you've got continuity, you know, you've got handoff,  you've got all this great stuff.  Then your life is easy and smooth and it's better not to have to think about these other  guys and what speakers better you just buy the Apple speaker because it's an Apple speaker.  That's the advantage.

Start time: 4640.31

Speaker: SPEAKER_31
Transcript:  That sounds like laziness, right?  Like what Ed was saying, that is totally a Microsoft move.  People are happy.  Like, yeah, they'll drink whatever you give them.  But this doesn't feel like the same Apple that killed.  You can't deny it's profitable.  It certainly is.  But right, Apple killed the iPod market with the iPhone, right?  The iPhone had to kill the iPod.  Right.  Like think of think of like how Apple's willing to do that.

Start time: 4661.78

Start time: 4743.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it has to, because look, I think it's a justification to say, you know,  the seamless experience is the is the goal here.  That's a that's a great rationalization.  But the reality is there's just so much money coming into Apple's coffers.  And when you sit down in a product meeting and somebody says,  OK, I've got this great idea and but it's going to hurt this business that's bringing  us ten billion dollars a quarter.  There's somebody there who's going to say, no, we don't do that.  We're not going to do that.  And that ultimately, once the numbers get that big, once the the fiefdoms,  the individual fiefdoms within the giant spaceship there become powerful enough,  then they start to they start to block innovation and they start to  build moats around each of their businesses.  And I've seen that I've seen that play happen before.  It's what happened to Microsoft in, you know, it led to Windows Vista.

And actually, to such an Adele's credit, I think he's he's changed Microsoft.  And the attitude is very different now.  It's dramatically and it's and it's made a difference in the in their operations.  Significantly.

Like the surface, the innovation behind the surface laptops, the surface book,  the surface studio that you're using right now, Leo, like these cool new devices that  we're sitting here and watching Apple take away the ports people actually use on their MacBook  Pros and give us keyboards that everybody hates.  Everybody hates that keyboard.  And like I don't see we're seeing any indication that that's going to be fixed eventually.  Like Apple's just going with the super flat design.  A lot of things that we expect Apple to fix, we're just not seeing anymore.  And that's worrying me, honestly.  Like I think to me, like Tim Cook is feeling more and more like Steve Bomber, like he's doing a  good job of really pushing every product line and ramping everything up.  But I don't know if we're going to see the innovation that we're kind of used  expecting from Apple.

But why?  We don't know exactly how much.  Initially, we thought it was a billion dollars.  Now I'm seeing from recode numbers closer to 1.2 to 1.4 billion dollars.  Now Ring is a sponsor.  We should mention we do Ring ads all the time.  I take some responsibility for Ring's success.  I will get zero of this money, but I'm happy for Jamie and his team because that's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Well, but they already have key, right?  They tried.  Remember, they tried to buy August.  That fell through.  In fact, August was pretty pissed off.  They feel like that Amazon found out how everything worked and said, OK, well, never mind.  And they built the shortly thereafter, they built the key system, which allows an Amazon  delivery person.  This expands on that into your house.  There's a camera.  There's a lock.  They can open the lock.  The camera watches them while they put the package in the door and they leave.  Is that available in Houston?  Have you tried it?

Here is some person that you did not know uniform in a normal car because they kind  of do it like Uber where they just they list deliveries that they have and somebody says,  okay, I'll do those.  And so to me, that's like somebody like just somebody off the street coming in my house.  Yeah.  Now I don't have the problem with packages getting stolen because I have a ring video  doorbell.  So maybe maybe that's the I don't know.  So is that why they bought it?  They want to replace key with ring or expand those services or have more.

And I think it ties in with the echo.  And I'm sure that they will continue to find ways to integrate it.  I suspect they're already integrated to some extent, but it's Amazon really having a really  robust offering of home devices.  And I think they're going to have more of them.

They were going to launch last Christmas a security home security system and ADT sued them.  And I think that lawsuit's over.  In fact, my understanding is shortly before Amazon bought them,  Ring settled for a larger amount than they were agreed.  They suddenly said, okay, here's 25 million.  And the ADT suit went away.  So they have now on their page, they are selling their home security.

You know, microcosmic way they everyone's clocked in, they monitor their location.  They and they're about to launch you inevitably into this world where Amazon is directly  Amazon employees will be doing the lion's share of deliveries to the front door.  And this is a way for them to monitor their own employees and their performance and their  behavior.

Start time: 5175.36
End time: 5267.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  OK, that's something this is something that I've been kind of pursuing recently.  I've asked Amazon several times pointed questions about exactly what they do in terms of do  they listen when they're not listening to the keywords?  And are they doing are they doing experiments where they have Alexa doing things that people  don't necessarily expect?  And whenever I ask those questions, they they just stop interacting with me.  They don't answer them.  And that doesn't mean that they're doing those things.  It doesn't mean anything nefarious, but it does mean that they have not answered those  questions yet.  So I've read their their terms of service.  There's nothing in the terms of service that I can find that prohibits them from monitoring  video feeds, listening in through Amazon, doing any of these things.  And I think it's an underexplored area.  We have this black box that we're putting in every house.  And I'm not, you know, a conspiracy theory minded person or suspicious of tech companies  as a rule.  But in this case, I'm a little concerned about Amazon because they're they're so they hold  it so close to the vest.  They don't tell us exactly what they're doing.  They have a history of, for example, with the Fire Phone of when you when you take a  picture of something, they're also transmitting the audio back to Amazon and doing God knows  what with it.  So there's a there's a I don't think they've earned our trust yet.  They're not transparent enough yet.  And I think that it behooves those of us in the media to keep pushing them to find out  exactly what their intentions are, what they do, what they don't do.  And it's especially urgent now that they have all these ring video doorbells.

They don't have to take chances with people's privacy.  They don't even have to make acquisitions of cameras if that makes people nervous.  Now, I'm not a CEO and I never will be, so I don't maybe understand business.  But why would Jeff Bezos take chances like that?

Transcript:  If their whole business model is based on algorithmically determined sort of behavioral  models.  So if you think about what they track and what they do on the Amazon website,  and even when you go beyond the website, they figure out where you're going,  what you're doing, how long the mouse hovers over this.  Does that mean you're interested?  They're upset and look at their grocery store, Amazon Go.  This is not about a convenient grocery store.  This is about a physical brick and mortar grocery store that has the kind of behavioral data  that their website has.  And so they're obsessed with understanding what people do.  And a camera is by far the most valuable sensor for figuring out what's happening  in general with human behavior.  They can see who's coming, who's going, what time, how long, you know, all this stuff is happening.  And so it's all they're like Google.  It's all about the data.  It's about big data and how you can plug in artificial intelligence to get information  that enables you to be more competitive in everything you do.  Ten years from now.

Transcript:  Last night, I finally had it.  I read the story.  By the way, we've reported on this.  We've been reporting on this for over a year.  Facebook, I've told people for more than a year, don't do Facebook quizzes because  Facebook allows a quiz designer not only to get all the information about you because  you took the quiz, but, and this is incredibly infuriating, they also allow the quiz designer  to get information about your friends.  Facebook says, well, wait a minute.  No, we only allow that to...  Let me see if I can find the stupid quote.  We're only allowing collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app.  It can't be sold or used for advertising, except that's exactly what Cambridge Analytica did.  And now we know for a fact, even though we've known this for a while, we now have a whistleblower  who has told the story of how Cambridge Analytica basically stole 50 million Facebook profiles,  got all the information they need.  Cambridge Analytica is owned by the Robert Mercer family and was run at the time by Steve Bannon.  And of course, the information was intended to be used by Trump during the campaign.  Although I don't blame Cambridge Analytica as much as I blame Facebook for even allowing  this to happen.  And you probably could say that other campaigns had done the same thing.  The whistleblower said that since early 2014, they built a system that would profile US voters  in order to target them with personalized political advertisements.  We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles and built models to exploit  what we knew about them and target their inner demons.  This was the basis the entire company was built on.

Transcript:  You know, it's funny because Dan Patterson, who writes for me, was on this story in August  of 2016.  He was one of the first to write about this.  And he was on it from when Ted Cruz's campaign were using Cambridge Analytica.  And he was saying that there's just something fishy about this.  It doesn't smell right.  It's amazing that we just didn't pay attention to this.

Transcript:  I was up in arms a year ago.  The Observer, which broke this story, saw the documents and this was confirmed by a  Facebook statement that said that by late 2015, Facebook knew that this information had been  harvested on an unprecedented scale.  It did not alert users.  It took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information.  And in fact, this really frustrates me when Facebook was told by the Observer that we  have this information, we're going to go live with the story tomorrow.  Then and only then they kicked Cambridge Analytica off the platform.

We've already seen accusations leveled at Facebook saying that they are  actively supporting the regime of Duerte over there.  Horrible.  Quite, you know, I don't want to get too carried away, but carrying out  terrible things against the citizens.  So Facebook could just up from Silicon Valley and relocate to the Philippines to continue on,  and the US government has vectorly zero control, right?

Start time: 5835.64
End time: 5876.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  Like the thing is, there are three companies right now that are disrupting markets,  that are turning society upside down in so many ways.  It's because they are five to ten years ahead of everybody else on data.  And they know more about us than we know about ourselves.  And they're using that data to monetize the living crap out of everything that they have.  And they are incented to keep that as private and as proprietary as possible  because it's a gold mine, right?  It's an absolute gold mine.

That's, you know, you see these quizzes.  Which Game of Thrones character are you?  Are you smarter than a fifth grader?  How's your spelling?  And I see so many people on my timeline saying,  see how smart I am.  I'm in the 99th percentile in spelling.  I'm saying, you're not smart.  You're a moron.  You just took that quiz.  That was a dopey quiz.  That was made up quiz.  They just wanted your personal information.  But you know what really frosts me is I don't take the quiz.  Doesn't matter.  My friends did.  They got my information.  That's infuriating.

Transcript:  It's true.  It was like 270,000 people downloaded the app and 500 million people's information is out there.  That's a huge amount of people that did not do it.  And you're still because you're part of the ecosystem.  In the end, the only thing that matters to Facebook is if you delete Facebook  and ask them to delete all the data that they have on you because they're going to keep it anyways.  And in the end, the amount of media literacy that we teach to our children  and to ourselves.  We are so easily sucked into these applications for internet points that it's pretty sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  The good news is thanks to the EU and the GDPR,  Facebook now has a way to actually permanently delete your information.  In the past, when you got off of Facebook,  they would deactivate your account for six months,  hoping that you would at some point accidentally log in and they go,  oh, welcome back.  By the way, when you leave Facebook,  I should have done this on the air because it's hysterical.  They put pictures of all your friends and they look sad.  And they say, it literally said Georgia Dow is so sorry you're leaving Facebook.  Do you want to send her a note telling her why?  It's the most offensive.  Emotional blackmail.  OMG.  So now you can do a complete delete of your Facebook data.  And I really think this is because coming in May,  they were going to get in trouble with the EU if they didn't offer this.  So it's not just deactivating.  It does still take two weeks.  So last night, and I see here Facebook saying it'll take 90 days  to delete all the things you've posted.  Well, we'll see.  Why would it take 90 days?  Aren't computers a little faster?

Yes, Mark Warner's honest ads bill should go through  and that should require that just as on radio and TV,  political ads have to be identified.  This ad was paid for by so and so.  That's not a requirement, digital advertising.  It should be.  That I hope happens.  But it's still not going to...  Don't we know Mark Zuckerberg well enough by now?  That's not going to stop.

They're doing what they have a fiduciary responsibility,  their shareholders to do, maximize profit.  They're supposed to do it legally.  Okay, honestly, that's probably not right,  but they're not completely legal.  They're trying their best to be sort of quasi legal,  but they're maximizing profit.  That's fine.  So instead of saying, let's regulate them, I'm going to vote with my feet.  And by the way, I don't...  This is not the first time I've quit Facebook,  but this is the last time.

They were able to do this because of what Facebook has and the data that they have.  That data is a gold mine.  Data is the new oil.  Data is where the money is.  Like I said, there's three companies that are so far ahead of everybody else.  Not Microsoft.  Google.  Amazon.  Amazon.  And Facebook.  And Facebook.  They have so much.

Transcript:  Alibaba and Tencent are amazing.  And they're ahead.  But in terms of global reach, they're still so focused on the Chinese market that...  They will eventually be global companies, but they aren't currently.  But those three companies are...  Because they have very, very close relationships with their government,  they're a bit protected for the moment.  But those three companies that I mentioned,  they have really been able to run roughshod over the entire globe with the exception of the EU  and basically be able to do whatever they want with all this data and have no transparency  about what they're doing.  And that's the problem.  Cambridge Analytica is just like a gnat that was able to use this platform to siphon a little bit  off, right?  The real problem, the real issue is the data and the fact that we have no regulation about it.  And we're getting later and later in the game.  And the EU and GDPR is making a difference because these companies, as well as a lot of others,  they essentially are making that their baseline.  If they're going to have to do that there, then in Europe to be in that market,  then it is having an effect on what they're doing in other markets as well,  because it's just less expensive for them to get back to fiduciary responsibility.  But we still have this huge problem that we just haven't woken up to the fact  that data is the new oil and we can't let it be a wild, wild west.

Transcript:  And even if they're operating somewhere else, if you put legislation in place,  that if you're operating here as well, which they want to in the states is a huge area for them,  so then they'll end up falling into line.  And in the end, what we need, though, is media literacy.  We need to teach our kids how to deal with social media, what's happening with it and why.  And I think that old data is worth nothing.  And old is a really short period of time when we talk about the technological age.  So if a lot of people, there's an exodus from Facebook, which I don't use Facebook,  so I think that would be great.  But most of the young kids, they're still using other sets of social media.  And our brains are primed for wanting to get those clicks on social media.  That validation is going less and less with real people and more and more with internet clicks.  And we're primed for that.

But it's a lot harder.  It's easy to leave Facebook.  So I'm putting a stake in the sand here, but I admit it's challenging.  And I still buy a ton of stuff from Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but Amazon, I think the elephant in the room here is the political angle  and we haven't touched on that.  The simple fact is that the data that Facebook let their partners,  because these were signed up legally obligated partners  who promised not to steal the data, but they stole the data anyway,  highlights the fact that Facebook has very little control over its data,  had very little control.  And even now has.  I agree.  Once you order a Facebook employee, you can basically do anything you like.  And the only reason we haven't seen more of this is just sheer blind luck.

But the real issue here is that Cambridge Analytica was a UK company funded by Alt-Right,  run by Steve Bannon, which is in Trump's government.  The whole Alt-Right got involved in the Brexit thing here in the UK.  We've now got the Information Commissioners Office in the UK announcing that they will  open an investigation into this whole issue.  So Facebook is now under fire.  You're talking about the right wing of the American government is now looking at Facebook  going, are you with us or are you against us?  Oh, that's scary.

Facebook has been co-opted by governments, strongman governments, to control the population  and to control the flow of information.  And there's no reason for Facebook to stay in the US.  It could just bunk out at any time, except for the fact that the US is the market which  generates the most revenue for them.  But they could probably just scoot off if they needed to, if they thought the pressure.  And they're childish enough.  I mean, your average Silicon Valley executive has the mental brainpower of a 16-year-old  with a lot of hormones.  They're so competitive.  They're so inwardly looking.  They're so focused on winning.  They're not focused on the money as much as they are on the winning.  They're socially incompetent to the level where I'm winning if I'm making more money.  And so they're not actually following capitalism.  They're not following any rules of society.  They're just trying to win blindly, aggressively, over and over and over, win, win, win.  And the way that I keep score about winning is to make more money.  And at some point, that's going to come off the rails because there's no more money to  make, I suspect, or something else happens.

And I think you've seen him the last couple of years in pretty clear some statements knowing  that this thing has gotten out of control and he knows there's some serious problems.  I mean, his New Year's resolution for this year was fix Facebook.  That's pretty bold statement.

Transcript:  But I'd be interested to see what he's actually doing to fix it.  The latest thing is Facebook told CNN, oh, it was a rogue employee.  We figured out it was a rogue employee that gave up all that information.  So it wasn't our fault.  My real problem is that if you're a normal person using Facebook, it's a very attractive  thing.  It's how you stay in touch with family and friends.  You discover your high school sweetheart and what she's been up to.  It's very attractive.  Facebook acts as if you're giving them information, but they're keeping it private.  You have control of it.  You say who's a friend, who's an acquaintance, who is not to see your stuff.  They really act as if, you know, you are controlling that information.  They don't tell people that when you take a quiz, you're giving all your information  to that company and you're giving up all your friends.  I mean, you're literally, they don't tell you that.

Start time: 6704.18

I would love to think that Zuckerberg is actually, you know, wants to fix Facebook  because who knows what that means.  But the best way to tell if someone's behavior in the future is by their behavior in the  past.  And they waited two years to be able to deal with this.  They were not transparent about it.  They only deleted them from their system when they found out and the information was still  there anyways.  So we know that in the end, their most important thing was Facebook and saving face and making  the most amount of money.  So no, I don't think that they really want to make a difference in the world or try to  do the right thing.  I think that they'll only do that if they have to or if it ends up hurting their bottom  line by people deleting Facebook.  And in the end, that's really like legislation, I think is important.  But I think that you're right, Leo, that deleting Facebook is the biggest message that you  could send to them.  And if there's a huge exodus, they'll start to listen.

And of course, she was on a media tour.  We're over and over again.  She talked about industry leading thought idea, like industry leading thoughts, industry  leading ideas, industry leading policies, which was all lobbyist code for regulation.  So days before, like while she's doing this and days before Zuckerberg shows up on the  Hill, Facebook was meeting with lawmakers in different states, one of them being Maryland,  where and I can find the link to this, but Facebook wrote the legislation.

Transcript:  Right.  But they so so like nothing is like everything that happened was Zuckerberg giving testimony.  That was all that was all for show.  That was all for show.

Transcript:  So Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president for state policy says, yeah, we helped draft  the Maryland legislation and we look forward to implementing it.  No, that doesn't that's not necessarily bad.  That means they want to get the heat off of them.  Maybe they found a way that they think will help.

Start time: 6879.17
End time: 6896.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And if there's some regulation that gets started, that takes all of the heat off of  Zuckerberg because technically nobody broke any laws that that's that's so this is all about  avoiding this is all about showing up in public, keeping the share price high and avoiding  federal regulation.

Transcript:  So part of the problem is that the laws that affect broadcasters about political ads that  they have to, for instance, reveal who bought the ad don't apply to digital.  Right.  And this is the honest this is the federal laws, the Honest Ads Act.  Is Facebook supporting the Honest Ads Act?  I think they are.  Or not.  This Maryland law looks a lot like the Honest Ads Act.  It says this is an article from the Baltimore Sun.  It resembles legislation in Congress aimed at monitoring political advertising on social media.  Would affect Google, by the way, as well as Facebook, New York, California, Connecticut,  also weighing their own measures.  We want to keep the platforms accountable.  I'm trying to find the part where it says what.

Transcript:  Whether they are or not, they will they will have to really what all of this is about at the end  is that and I know I've said this before on the show, but there's three companies that know data  better than anybody else.  And they're eating the world.  They're disrupting industries.  And they are undermining the privacy of people every single day.  More and more.  Right.  Facebook, Amazon and Google.  And they're doing it largely with a black box of data that they control.  And that data being the new oil, they're using that to become one of the three of the most  powerful companies in the history of humanity.  And the transparency issue is a big part of the issue.  Facebook, the least transparent, Amazon somewhere in the middle, Google a little bit more  transparent of what they do with the data and all that.  So all of these companies, you can bet over the next over the coming years are going to be under  enormous pressure to tell what data they're actually collecting, what they do with it, what  they do with it, what it's worth to them and what they can do to actually empower people  to better understand this and take responsibility for it.

Start time: 7021.46
End time: 7069.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_33
Transcript:  Well, it is so interesting.  I think what you said is such a great summary of what we're dealing with here.  And the analogy as data as the new oil is a really compelling one.  And what's fascinating about this is this is the first time probably in human history  when the oil or the diamonds or the gold or whatever it is, is actually us.  Yes.  We're being mined.  We're being mined.  We're being mined for our money.  It's like it's basically an outgrowth of the advertising industry plus a lot more on top of that.  And shouldn't we at least know when we're being mined?  And when we're offering up bits of ourselves to somebody who's going to then turn around  and sell to us, it's almost like we're giving something away  and then being asked to buy it back through purchases that we make.

Transcript:  I have to say though that on the face of it, the idea that Facebook would work with Maryland  legislators to try to craft something that is both helpful and something that Facebook  could live with is not necessarily a bad thing.  That's how politics works, Amy, right?  You're trying to reach consensus.  Right. And it's not unprecedented.  Not at all.

Transcript:  I mean, that is what lobbying is.  So I think that my job is to collect data and to figure and to model it and to figure out  what all of it means and what the next order, risk and opportunity is many,  many years into the future.  But one of the early signals that we look for are contradictions.  So to me, it was very like these were some weak signals that I was paying attention to  over the past couple of weeks.  The fact that sort of quietly this legislation was being written,  it potentially becomes the model.  It eludes some regulatory challenges right around the same time that it becomes apparent  that our data is being continually mined, refined and productized.  But in ways that we may not have thought through or intended, like all this sort of constellation  of interesting facts and data over the past couple of weeks, I think points us in a direction that  we should be concerned about.  But it's hard to be concerned and to really think through things when the spectacle is so  fascinating and fun.  I mean, it was fun to watch all of this happening, right?  Yeah.

I think that most people, if you ask them, like, did you see what happened this week?  They'd be like, oh yeah, Mark Zuckerberg, he looks like data from Star Trek.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  That was it.  That's what most people got out of that.  Mark Zuckerberg is boring.

Transcript:  I mean, I would have if I was him.  He escaped any serious questions.  Clearly, I mean, did you hear some of the questions?  I think it was Senator Orrin Hatch who was trying to suss out whether or not Facebook  and Twitter were kind of the same thing.  I think one of the questions, I might have him confused with Lindsey Graham,  but somebody asked the question, is Twitter the same as Facebook?  And it's like it wasn't even rhetorical.  He escaped unscathed.  If he had gone in front of people who wouldn't have had to ask, people were asking questions  about whether or not even if you log out of Facebook, you're still being tracked.  It's a clear indication that they don't understand cookies, right?  So if he had actually faced people that asked serious questions, or if anybody who was up  there that didn't understand the tech could have and would have pressed on the other  sort of civil liberties piece of this, I think it would have been different.

I said, this is really just going to be a chance for a member of Congress to stand up,  say something that they can use in an ad later because in the Senate, they got five minutes.  In the House, they got four minutes.  There was no time for follow up.  Mark very cleverly used up the clock by doing longer answers, which many members of Congress  were at pains to interrupt trying to get their second question in.  Yeah.

Transcript:  That's a larger issue that probably isn't for us.  But there's the larger political issue.  We talked about this on Wednesday.  There's an economic theory, I think it's called the Peltzman theory,  that there are three constituents here.  There's monopolies, big business, there's politicians, and there's users.  And they each have kind of differing goals.  The politicians want to get reelected.  The users want to pay less.  Or, you know, in the case of Facebook, where it's free, maybe,  I don't know, get spied on less.  And the big businesses want as minimal regulation as they can get to continue on with what they're  doing.  And what happens is you get this kind of nice little feedback loop and everybody gets kind  of what they want.  Nobody is 100% happy.  But at the same time, we don't get any kind of the voters really don't get any kind of  privacy protection or regulation of these companies because that's not what politicians  are looking for.  In fact, Facebook's very helpful to them.  They're not trying to shut down Facebook.

Transcript:  No, and if there was somebody I wish I could remember who wrote this piece, but there was  a piece sort of documenting which politicians went up to Zuckerberg afterward and basically  fawned over him.  We're so proud of what you started in your dorm room.  He's a kingmaker.  We can't.  This is the symbol of American success.  There was, I don't think, a lot of interest in actually angering or unsettling him outside  of that grandstanding for sure.  But I think it would be interesting to talk for a second about whether or not people would  have the appetite to pay for a service like Facebook.  We were just talking about that.  They brought that up.  Journalism, they brought it up.  People have been bringing it up for the whole week.  Hey, what if we paid for it?  Do you need to change your business model Facebook?  And I think this is again, I keep coming back to this, but it's sort of a personal responsibility  thing.  I don't think that there's any actual appetite for paying for social media.  As soon as any service starts to bring up a fee, people freak out and walk away, which  is weird because we'll pay what like 12, 13, 14 dollars to go to the movies.  It's kind of confounding.

Transcript:  There have been plenty of studies.  The information was always a paid product.  The challenge is there's a cognitive bias.  Once it's free.  That happens.  When something has been, when something was free and now you're being compelled for whatever  reason to pay that, you know, it feels like something is being taken away from us.  And historically speaking, regardless of what industry or field it is, we won't do it.

Transcript:  It doesn't work sometimes.  Like think about with cell phones, we completely destroyed the value of cell phones for about  five or six years there.  And then eventually we got to the point where now we're paying, you know, whatever, 40 bucks  a month or 30 bucks a month or, you know, having to buy one separately.

But once the truly smartphones hit, so the not so like my, the first smartphone that I had was  an iMode from entity dogma, which was a totally different kind of phone.  Everything else was free, but you had to pay for that.  You know, we've shifted over to the fancy models like the people pay for it because  there's never been an alternative.  There's never been a way not to pay for a brand new iPhone.

And that's part of the problem I have is that news, especially I'm kind of the opinion  software, all software should be free that the paid software model is a broken model.  And certainly social networks should all be free and news should be free.  You've got to find other ways to monetize it because it's undemocratic to say that only  people who can afford news should be able to get the good news and the rest of you  are going to get fake news and crappy news and link baiting news.  That's not right.

Transcript:  And to close the loop on the Facebook thing, I do think, you know, Facebook is primarily  over and, you know, every under 30, there's hardly any people, you know, that are actively  engaged on Facebook.  So what's next is the important question.  And for the hearings themselves, I think that you have to take what happened, not just in  the event itself, which was somewhat sad and disappointing and, you know, not what  it could have been or should have been, but think of it as a first step or maybe second  step, right?  Because they did call after the election a few of these tech heads before the Congress  to testify.  Again, it's about the scrutiny coming on to these folks about the way that they use data.  And while this wasn't ideal, it wasn't what it could have been or should have been.  It is a start.  And you're going to increasingly in the coming years see more pressure on them to be  transparent.  And the Maryland legislation, I think, is another step in that direction.  They're going to be more transparent about what data they take, how they use it, how  much it's worth, and then what they can do to give people control of their own data.

The issue is more using my mood to take advantage of me to sell ads or selling my information  to a foreign government or using my information in kind of sleazier ways than just straight up.  You talked about Jeeps.  You should see Jeep ads.  What would be wrong with that?  You're actually interested in Jeeps.  They're taking more data than what they're telling us.

I mean, Facebook saying, if at the end of all of this, the end result is,  we'll give you the opportunity to opt out so that we won't use your data to surface ads.  That sort of shields us from everything that's coming.  The next social networks are going to be part of mixed reality, not  text and photo and video based social networks that we have right now.

There must be some other way to create the next thing  that doesn't require this kind of skeezy invasion of privacy or is that not going to happen?  Twitbook.  Twitbook.  I like it.  Well, as we know now, at the end of 2018, Apple announced new phones this year,  stopped selling the iPhone X.  At least we think so.  There have been rumors in the last few weeks that Apple might be making the iPhone X again.  Turns out it was pretty darn popular.  In fact, we had this story about how popular iPhone X turned out to be.

Start time: 7860.08
End time: 7893.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.  Okay.  So it's been a headline grabbing week for Apple.  When has it not been?  But we just have to report that when it comes to actual smartphone sales,  Apple and the product line are taking over a third of the entire revenue straight out the bat.  So all those mobile phone manufacturers out there, the billions of smartphones out there,  Apple is sucking it up.  Now, we have a mixed panel here.  Some Apple users, some Android users.  Mike, you've actually bought your wood-framed iPad here.  Yes.  You haven't gone for the iPhone X or X depending on how you describe it.  No.  10 or X?

Start time: 7893.87
End time: 7991.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Which one would you?  Yeah.  We'll go with the 10.  Yep.  Because I think the next one is going to be an 11.  They pulled the Microsoft.  They skipped a generation.  There has been no iPhone 9.  But yeah, iPhone X for sure.  iPhone 7, 8, 9.  No, sorry.  One of the things I was surprised about, obviously,  Apple always dominates profits.  If you think about what does Apple make, the one thing they make better than anyone is profits.  But iPhone X actually had much significantly higher profits than any of the other iPhones.  Because they're ridiculously priced?  Yeah.  Well, I guess.  We're probably going to talk about the Samsung, the cost of the Samsung screen and so on.  So it's expensive for them to make.  It's amazing they got as many people to buy it as they did.  35% of the industry's profits were the iPhone X.  19% the iPhone 8.  15% the iPhone 8 Plus.  6% iPhone 7.  5% iPhone 7.  The first non-Apple device on the list is the Galaxy Note 8 at 3.9%.  Basically 4% of the industry profit.  So Apple, once again, is winning it all.  And this doesn't even tell you what they're making on app sales.  They get a third of all the app sales.  A colossal amount of money.  Getting on the streaming services like Apple Music and so on.  It goes on and on and on.  They make money on everything, every aspect of the, just about every aspect of the phones.  But this is just for selling the hardware.  And it's really, it's the business story of, I think, the decade or the millennium or something like that.  They just are printing money.  And it's kind of ridiculous.  They're on track to be the first trillion dollar valuation company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I am an Apple user.  And I use pretty much all their products.  I'm, you know, it's not a surprise.  They are aiming at the high end of the market, where the profits naturally are better.  They made Apple an aspirational brand.  So you want to have it, maybe even if you can't afford it.  And they have a variety of products, you know, in a variety of price ranges.  So I think they're being very smart about it.  The question is, is how much can they sustain?  You know, they have earnings coming up on May 1st.  And there have been several analysts who have said, well, they're just not doing as well as  expected on the iPhone X.  And so we'll actually get a better look at what is actually going to happen when those earnings drop.

Start time: 8063.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm an Apple user or an Apple consumer.  I'm not a fanboy.  I was a fanboy, but increasingly I'm less inspired by Apple's going forward.  I think the price is getting out of whack with the value being delivered.  So, you know, as it says here, 21% of the total revenue goes to Apple, but they make 35% of the  total industry profits.  I've heard different numbers.  I heard they sort of take 30% of the total revenue, but 70% of the total profits or whatever.  But either way, Apple's charging is working in the premium end of the market and charging  premium pricing that it has a vast profit margin.  But then not only that, but part of the reason they're making the profit margin is a couple  of things. One is security.  Unlike a Microsoft or an Android, your device is more or less secure, although there's signs that  there's cracks in that coming forward.  It's not buggy compared to anybody else's smartphones or anybody else's products.  And so they do actually have a reason for being regarded as a premium supplier.  But I think the other thing that we are not covering here that's not covered in this report,  of course, is that Apple is very much increasing its ARPU, Avenue Revenue Per Customer,  or Average Revenue Per User, to be literal, by having things like the headphones, the Apple  earphones they've got with the X1 chip inside, Apple TVs.  The Mac has increasingly an accessory to the iPhone.  The App Store, the music, the HomePod, all those accessories mean that you're not just buying  the phone anymore.  The phone is the linchpin of an entire ecosystem around which you're going to buy one or more of  those fries with the iPhone burger.  And I think you don't underestimate that part of the strategy.

Start time: 8168.22
End time: 8194.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Greg, just to follow up on that and clarify, you said that your understanding was that the  Apple was north of 70% total profits.  That used to be the case, and now they're up to 87%.  The 35% is the iPhone X alone.  So the iPhone X by itself, as one of the many profitable Apple devices, makes more profit  than the top 600 Android makers combined.  It's utterly bonkers.

Start time: 8196.20
End time: 8223.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  With Android, it's a race to the bottom, whereas Apple has just said,  yeah, let's make this a premium thing.  But then it isn't really reflected in their other product lines.  And Greg, you said this is the linchpin, but I know a lot of MacBook users who are really,  really annoyed at the moment that their laptops are not getting love.  We're using outdated hardware.  They've just said that the next MacBook isn't going to be coming through the line until 2019.  Has Apple given up on laptops?

Transcript:  I think there's a few things happening there.  One is Intel's product line has been disrupted.  They've missed a couple of generations in the CPUs.  We always expected to see Intel release new CPUs.  They did the TikTok, and we expected them to happen every year.  And then Intel shifted to a three-year strategy.  And I just have the sense, and this is just pure speculation on my part,  Apple was doing something and they missed a generation or two because whatever it was  they were working on didn't work.  So I know that, for example, Apple, Intel completely failed to deliver on mobile  processors and mobile CPUs.  Yeah, that's right.  And so if you were betting you had a whole production line ready to go,  and then Intel suddenly pulls the pin on that CPU that they were going to push out there,  and your Apple, because Apple puts all of its weight behind a single product.  Samsung, they have like nine to ten product families.  Apple has two smartphones in the market today, basically the X and the 8.  They don't have this massive diversity which allows them to fail in one product line and fail over.  They go all the way in.  So if Intel pulled the product line too late, then Apple might not have had  a backup strategy in place.  And that's why we haven't seen the iteration.  So I'm not entirely sure that putting the blame at Apple's feet is the thing to do.  Of course it is because it's up to them to meet the market and meet users' expectations  and to manage user expectations.  I think that's the thing that Apple's failed to do here.  We have an expectation as Apple customers to see a refresh cycle on the Mac roughly every two years,  a major trend.  And we haven't seen that.  And they haven't come out and talked about it or been public about it.  And we really feel a bit abandoned.  I'm sitting here with a 2012 Macbook waiting patiently for the next one  because I'm not leaving my ports behind.

I'll tell you one of the things the best of is for me,  and it's not just been this year for the last 10 years.  LastPass.  My password manager.  You use LastPass, right?  If you use LastPass, listen to this commercial anyway.  So you can tell your friends why they should get LastPass.  Actually, you might want to tell the boss,  because we use LastPass at work.  Let me tell you.  It's one thing to protect yourself,  but if you're a business, you have to remember,  you know, you can have all the best IT in the world.  And we do here.  Russell's great.  He protects us against all sorts of threats.  But your employees could be the weak link.  They might be using bad passwords.  Remember, you have to give them access to your bank account,  your website, your bookkeeping, your servers,  all the stuff that you use on the internet,  they have access to.  And they may not have the best password hygiene,  if you know what I mean.  Look around your office.  See if there's a Post-it note.  Stuck on a monitor like that, with a corporate password on it.  I bet there is.  This is why you need LastPass.  No more Post-it notes.  Throw them away.  In fact, your employees will love it.  LastPass generates long, strong passwords  that you can't remember.  But you don't have to remember,  because LastPass keeps track of it in the password vault.  LastPass is strong encrypted.  In fact, we ran it through Steve Gibson,  because I wanted to make sure,  before I was recommending this to people,  I've been using it forever,  Steve interviewed the guy who wrote it, Joe Segrist.  He looked at the source code.  He said, yeah, they're doing the right thing.  Things like PBDKF, so that you can't even brute force this thing.  And it's only decrypted on device.  Even the guys at LastPass can't get to your password vault.  Only you can get to your password vault.  Of course, they support two factor.  We require employees to use it.  That's another thing you can get with LastPass Enterprise.  There's over 100 sane, strong, secure policies you can implement  regarding master password length, two factor authentication.  You can have password resets.  You really control the whole thing.  If an employee leaves, access is revoked.  Passwords can be chained automatically.  You can even give people passwords  without giving them access to the password.  They can log in to QuickBooks,  but they can't actually see the password.  Things like that make a huge difference.  I trusted so much.  We put everything in there.  Not just passwords, database keys, SSH keys,  PGP keys, software licenses, all our business information.  I even put my passport and driver's license.  Everything's in LastPass.  It's what you need, a secure store  for the most valuable stuff in your business or in your home.  LastPass, they have a great multi-factor authenticator program.  I love it because instead of making you memorize six digits  and entering them in, it just you press an approve or deny button  on your phone, it automatically logs you in.  And you can, by the way, as an enterprise user,  you can require that.  Two factor is a huge improvement in security in general.  And LastPass makes it easy.  If you're at a Microsoft Active Directory company,  you can use your AD credentials for a single sign on.  That's so great.  Here's the deal.  Choose the LastPass that's right for you.  For your business, there's LastPass Teams  for businesses of 50 or fewer.  And LastPass Enterprise, that's what we use.  For individuals, there's LastPass Premium.  And actually at home, we use LastPass Families  because that way I could share passwords with my wife.  She's my kind of emergency access contact point.  So if something happens to me,  she can get access to my passwords and settle my affairs, things like that.  That's actually really important.  I can give you a thousand reasons to get LastPass.  Just do it.  Go to lastpass.com slash twit.  Join the 16 million users and the 43,000 businesses  from leading tech brands like MailChimp to Fortune 500 companies and Twit  who trust LastPass.  It's the number one most preferred password manager.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  Make security a priority in 2019.  Back to This Week in Tech and the Roundtable.  A great article which made me feel a lot better about GDPR.  I have such mixed feelings about GDPR.  On the one hand, this general data protection regulation  that the EU put into law two years ago  but now is actually going to go into effect on Friday  does things that everybody would agree are good.  For instance, requires companies that have a data breach to disclose  within 72 hours.  Really fast.  Also, put some real teeth into those laws.  These regulations have existed but there was no enforcement in the past.  Now, there will be.  In fact, this is a really good example of what happens  if you make a law or you make a regulation.  What was the name of the privacy regulation, Patrick,  that it's been in effect for a year or two?

Start time: 8901.62
End time: 8963.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  No, not that.  But there's a general privacy regulation that effectively was GDPR  but had no teeth and has been in place for a while.  In any event, the EU decided, well, we've got to have some,  if this is going to work, we've got to have a significant penalty.  The penalty is fairly significant.  As much as 20 million euros or 4% of your global revenue, whichever is higher,  that's enough even to scare a big company like Google or Facebook.  Clearly, it's intended for them.  Some things I think I'm in favor of.  Then there are other things that I think a lot of people are very worried about,  that compliance will be difficult.  I read a good article.  This is Jacques Matey, I think you pronounce it.  He wrote a piece on his blog called GDPR Hysteria,  which calmed me down a lot.  It's in here, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21

If you're out of compliance, you're going to get a warning.  That's the maximum fine.  There may not be a fine at all if you fix it.  I am in favor of privacy.  I think also here in the States, a lot of people say,  how dare the EU tell us how to run our business?

Transcript:  Well, they're not.  They're telling you that that's what you have to do if you have customers in the EU.  They could perfectly make two different sets of rules and settings,  one for the EU customers and one for the US customers.  Now, of course, it would get interesting reactions from the US customers and the press,  I'm guessing, because the EU customers would have settings and rights to delete their data,  portability of their data, downloading what you have used on their network,  and magically, the US customers wouldn't.  Actually, for a while, we thought Facebook might do that.

Start time: 9037.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_21

Transcript:  It's the power of government.  Yes, government is sometimes overbearing and cumbersome,  but sometimes you need it because it's the only entity that can  have some kind of influence on other more very potent entities like some huge companies.  I do think that Europeans have always been more concerned with all of these issues than  the Americans for a couple of reasons.  Historically, we have more genuine concern about all of this and the way our data is used.  Those big companies are usually not in the EU, so we have an easier time looking at them and saying,  these internet giants.

Start time: 9094.24
End time: 9100.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_21

Start time: 9101.90
End time: 9197.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No one is saying that what is being required of those companies is completely unreasonable,  especially for the big ones.  It's things that really they should have implemented themselves a long time ago.  I went off on a tiny, tiny rant on Twitter because after the 25th email I received from  one of those companies saying, at company X, we value your privacy and this is why we're doing this.  All of a sudden.  If you valued our privacy, you wouldn't have waited until the law obliged you to do these things,  you put them into place.  I would have preferred that some of them would say,  so the GDPR is coming into law and it requires this and this or so we're making these  modifications.  You didn't have to put that hypocritical PR spin to it saying, well, of course, they did have to  do it because that's how they work, but it's a little bit frustrating.  I understand the concerns and again, I think it's good to ask and discuss them, but overall,  I have a hard time justifying a full criticism of this GDPR  ensemble of requirements.  It seems like things that should have been put into place maybe earlier and I have to  admit that myself, I might have been a little bit skeptical about all of it until a couple  of years ago, but I think now it's clear to everyone in Europe that it's needed and I'm  guessing in the US most people agree.

Start time: 9199.22
End time: 9234.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_36
Transcript:  I agree that it's needed and I think that you make, I basically agree with everything you  said.  I do have some questions still about how this is actually going to be enforced.  I think if you're a larger company, a Facebook or Google, a Microsoft and Apple, a Samsung  and Amazon, you obviously are going to be in compliance because you're going to be watched  very carefully, but if you are a Chinese based company or if you are an Eastern European based  country who's not part of the EU or if you are just smaller and don't care, I am curious  about how these things are actually going to be enforced.

Start time: 9235.38
End time: 9269.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  I think actually that's why Leo mentioned this piece specifically because I read this earlier  in the week also, Leo, and the point that he's making is that he's specifically saying,  are you just a person that has a blog?  Are you going to be on the hook for $20 million or whatever it finds?  And he's saying, no, that's not the way that the EU works.  Things like the DPD, the European Data Protection Directive, he said that's been in effect for two  decades.  Two decades?  But you've never even heard of it because the point is not that they wanted to suddenly  fine everyone.  They wanted to have the laws in the place.  Right.

Start time: 9270.96
End time: 9312.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_36
Transcript:  Right, and I understand that.  What I'm saying is I'm not necessarily talking about your website or a small company who,  I'm talking about potentially big conglomerates, big industries, big players who are based in  countries that just aren't going to care.  How are they going to enforce this against someone like Tencent, for instance, or someone else?  If someone's really going to come back, that becomes the interesting question.  Are you going to start blocking access to their traffic?  How much teeth is this really going to have?  And I guess we will have to see on that because what we've seen before with Right to Be Forgotten  and other sanctions that have gone against Google and other companies, those companies  tend to fight back even when it is the law.  So I don't know.

Start time: 9313.18
End time: 9326.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes, but the Right to Be Forgotten has been implemented.  Initially, I thought it was a horrible idea, but it has been implemented by Google and it  seems to work relatively well.  Of course, there are always issues in every...

Start time: 9328.14
End time: 9348.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I still think that one's a horrible law because instead of saying pull down the original content,  they're putting the burden on the search engine to pull down the search results.  They're also putting Google...  In the position of judge and jury, Google has to go through each of these requests  and judge whether it has merit or not.  That's not something Google should be doing.

Start time: 9350.10
End time: 9396.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes, but Leo, this is the practical approach to problems.  Sometimes the solution is not perfect, but it's better than doing nothing.  This is what we're asking of YouTube, of Facebook, of Twitter.  We're telling them, take away the objectionable content within 24 hours.  This is horrible.  It shouldn't be on the internet.  My initial concern was we're asking private enterprises to be the judge of what is acceptable  or not acceptable to say.  I agree.  This is a valid concern.  However, on the other side of it, and I'm sure some people would have more to say about it than me,  but you see some horrible things on Twitter.  Sometimes you are very frustrated that it's still there and that the accounts aren't blocked.

Start time: 9396.80
End time: 9410.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Is the right thing to do to go to Google and say,  hide that Twitter search result or to go to Twitter and say, pull the tweet down?  That's the problem I have with Right to be Forgotten.  It makes Google responsible for this, not the site that hosts the bad content.

Start time: 9411.04
End time: 9436.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think in the case of Twitter, obviously you would go to Twitter,  but there are many other instances...  The Right to be Forgotten is about Google.  Yes, absolutely.  It's not about the link to Twitter.  If it's a link to Twitter, you're going to go see Twitter.  In practice, Google is our doorway to the internet, especially in Europe.  Remember, they have 80%, 90% market share in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Andy in Germany is in the chat room and he says,  you still have to delete the content from the original sites by yourself.  You go to those sites, but the reason Google is in the equation is because they cache all this stuff,  so you have to get them to kill the cache as well, I guess.

Start time: 9452.89

Transcript:  Absolutely.  I completely agree, but I will answer to you what I basically  would like to formulate to Christina about the concerns that he was voicing,  which is you're always going to have issues in any system, in any rule, in any law.  You can point out instances where it doesn't work or where it breaks something,  but having a few exceptions where it doesn't work out well doesn't mean that you shouldn't  do something about the problem.

Start time: 9510.40
End time: 9564.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_36
Transcript:  I agree.  Without a doubt, I agree.  And to be clear, although I actually have a lot of issues, especially from a first  amendment perspective with the right to be forgotten, I have serious, serious issues  about that.  I don't have a problem with GDPR, and I think that these are things that I'm with you.  They're very different.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And I think these are things that, frankly, most of these big companies should have been  doing already and that they were actively avoiding.  And I think that the fact that we've had two years and there was all this pushback is proof.  Facebook being publicly forced through the terrible press it was getting to  not have two option screens, but one is kind of proof of that.  I agree with you.  I'm just saying, not to say not to do it, obviously you still do it, but I do have  questions that other than some of the biggest American-run conglomerates, that you might  still have some very big services that will just not respond to this.  And I think that that's just something that people should reconcile.

Start time: 9565.91
End time: 9607.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So sure.  So the thing is, if one of those big companies, let's say, a Chinese company, for the sake  of argument, if they do business in Europe, if they are big enough or serious enough,  at this point, they still do have to have some kind of presence in the country.  Usually you need to have a company that is created in Europe to do business with European  customers.  You might have employees.  You have someone who's responsible.  So if they're big enough, the likeliness is that if there's a big problem, there is  someone you can point to go after a company you can find, stuff like that.  Yes, there might be a few instances where this doesn't happen, but it's...  Actually, that's an interesting question.

Transcript:  I'm too small.  They're not going to, obviously.  Yeah, exactly.  But yeah, I guess Google's going to pay or at least they've appealed it,  but Google's being fined what was it?  1.7 billion or something.  They'll eventually pay that.

Start time: 9675.76
End time: 9712.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_36
Transcript:  I mean, or they'll get it knocked down.  Well, because this is my question.  This is what I'm saying.  Speaking of Google specifically, they've been fined multiple times by the EU.  To my knowledge, they've paid much smaller fines than what's been issued to them before.  2.7 billion is the current one.  Yeah, but there was a Google shopping thing that I think this might be a shopping one.  That's the shopping one.  Okay, there was another one too that they put off.  I mean, they've been putting this off for years.  So part of me does kind of wonder, like, when are they actually going?  I'm not opposed to this law at all.  As I said, I agree with it.  Part of me, though, does wonder how much of this is bluster  and how much of this is just going to carry on in the courts ad nauseam.

Transcript:  Well, I agree.  Look, when I first joined Microsoft, I joined Microsoft a year ago.  I was, they were already deep in the GDPR rollout plan.  It was already deeply underway.  I'm sure that that's the same way that it's been at every other major company.  This is not something that two months ago people were like, oh, we've got to get on this.  This has been probably in the works for two years at most of these places.  I agree.  I'm just saying, you know, if people find that there isn't enough being done or Google  or another company were to do something that the people claimed violated this,  I have no doubt in my mind that there would be an appeal for Verney is sort of fine.  And actually, I mean, I think this is a good thing.  I'm just pointing out.  I think that sometimes we say, oh, it's fixed now.  And that's not necessarily going to be the case  because companies will look for ways to still capture what they can.  I do have a question because I'm not clear on this.  If you ask users to opt into your agreement that says, I will willingly give you this  information, can you bypass some of those restrictions?  If you are able to get them to agree to a different user agreement that says,  it's fine. You can capture my information.

Start time: 9793.10
End time: 9802.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the point.  I think you have to explicitly have them agree to giving you this information  instead of implicitly doing that.  And they have the right to delete it.

Start time: 9803.64
End time: 9805.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  They can come to you and say, I delete my information.

Start time: 9806.76
End time: 9891.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And that is the other point I wanted to make.  We can argue about whether or not they would comply or not.  The fact is they are complying.  You now have the ability to delete all of your information from all of these networks.  Of course, most people are choosing not to do that.  And are probably going to keep choosing not to do that.  But if you want to talk about how much teeth that law has and how much weight the EU,  ultimately, it's all about money.  All of these companies are making a lot of money in the EU.  And they're willing to invest a little bit of money in modifying their systems.  First of all, because it's ultimately the right thing to do.  I think a lot of them are saying now, well, maybe we should be a little bit regulated  if it's the right way.  And second of all, it's a small investment compared to the money they're making in the  territory.  And yes, they could close down their offices in the EU and have everyone go through Amazon.com  or whatever US site it is.  But in practice, that's just not the way it works.  If you want to do business, even in the age of the internet, you need to have a presence  in the country or at least in the EU.  So it's currently working.  Now, of course, if they end up having a fine of 20 million euros or however much it might  be 4%, they will fight it.  It will take years.  But that's not even the point.  The point is the deterring effect is working because they're already doing it.

Transcript:  Yes, from data from our from our data apocalypse that is always seems just upon us.  But I did a personal process that I went through courtesy of these artists and activists out of  Germany called Tactical Tech that lets you kind of review your own exposure to data.  And so I did a personal journey and took notes and chronicled it.  And out of that experience, which I've been processing for over a year, honestly,  I wrote a humbly titled New Tech Manifesto.  On ways I think that we could collectively not just be afraid of what the present is,  but like write a better future.  My hope is that we don't feel disarmed by all of this or too depressed by it, but that we  actually feel inspired.  We're still early days of the internet in this whole networked world.  And it doesn't have to be an advertising hellscape where we are all in someone's dossier of us.  So I encourage folks to check that out.  I think the timing is good.

Transcript:  I feel like we're making progress in that regard.  Thanks to GDPR and the Facebook debacle.  We were watching the Facebook.  So on the NBA playoffs, there were three, not one, not two, but three apology commercials.  Yes.  Facebook, which has been running for several months.  And I love Facebook because it said, you know, all the things you love about Facebook.  And then something happened as if they had nothing to do with it.  No, it was like a passive event that occurred.  They were the victims here.  Then something happened.  Fake news happened.  Poor Zuckerberg, really.  We should all just privacy sympathy for him.  People lost their data.  It just happened.  It was pretty funny.  And then there's Wells Fargo.  They took a little more.  I think a little more.

Start time: 9996.06
End time: 10002.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  The Wells Fargo ad was the most annoying ad to listen to, but it was the most honest,  I think, in admitting their own flaws.  They said, we lost your trust.

Start time: 10003.35
End time: 10009.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Accurate.  I wish Facebook had said, own it.  Yeah, own it.  That's the only kind of apology that works.

Start time: 10009.94
End time: 10078.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One of the things, one of my favorite, honestly, my favorite line from my little short series was,  Facebook has been not just on an apology tour, but like a corrective blogging exercise where  if you go to newsroom.fb.com, which I encourage everyone to do, because we probably haven't,  they are launching all these new tools.  And they're saying, we're going to audit the app developers, and we're going to get them.  We're going to get them for abusing your data.  And it's like, dudes, it was like you opened the door.  You left the keys in the lock.  You had signs up that said, grab all this data while you can.  Everything must go.  So Facebook auditing and investigating app developers is like Walter White investigating  Jesse, all that meth Jesse made in Walter's lab using his scientific knowledge.  And until they not only apologize, but really come clean and acknowledge  that it was part of their corporate growth strategy to let all these folks in and sell  us all out.  It's going to be very hard to take them seriously when asked for our trust back.  I can't even trust you to be honest about the problem you helped create.

Start time: 10078.38
End time: 10083.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_28

Transcript:  I think it goes right back to the business model.  I mean, Zuckerberg has been playing fast and loose with his users data  since he was in short pants in Harvard.  And he keeps apologizing.  And it's always the same thing.  He's dependent on his business is dependent on the users sticking around watching ads.  And whatever, you know, if you're going to prioritize user engagement,  then you're going to have things like the 2016 election.  Did you see the thing that they did on the Daily Show?

Start time: 10380.04
End time: 10396.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And the idea that Facebook knows all these things about us and has been making money  the whole time off of that deep knowledge, that is, to Alex's point, more specific to Facebook  than Twitter, which is an uncontrolled space, but not as deeply ingrained in our psyche as Facebook.

Start time: 10413.16
End time: 10457.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I would say best yet.  I think it was a solid year.  It's an interesting, we're in a sort of weird transition state for E3 because many of the big  publishers are pulling out or having satellite shows that are concurrent with E3, but not  actually part of E3.  And so the big crazy floor chaos that used to be what defined E3 has subsided a bit, and the floor  itself is still cacophonous and intense and has a lot of companies, but fewer than it used to.  EA does its own event now in Hollywood instead of downtown Los Angeles.  Microsoft this year pulled out and had an event that was adjacent at their-  Isn't that funny?

Start time: 10457.52
End time: 10461.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I thought they were at E3 because they had the press conference, just like always.

Start time: 10462.06
End time: 10529.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the Microsoft sponsors the theater at LA Live now, so it is adjacent to the convention  center, but it wasn't actually part of E3.  And their floor presence on the show floor of E3 was nonexistent because they have their own  location now.  They did.  Yeah.  So it's interesting.  It's in a really interesting state.  And of course, Nintendo for years has done what they call Nintendo Direct, which is not  an actual press conference.  There are no human beings in an auditorium listening to someone on stage.  They have a pre-recorded, edited, composed presentation that they just live stream whenever  they feel like it.  And they do that at E3, but they do it multiple times during the year.  And I think you're going to see many companies moving away from E3 and moving to that model  because they have control over the message.  They don't have to deal with pesky human beings.  And they're able to cut out the middleman.  As you keep saying on this show, many times I've heard, disintermediate.  There's no reason to have press between you and your message anymore.  Yeah.

Start time: 10529.62
End time: 10555.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  That's what's killed or not killed, but certainly caused problems for trade shows in general.  I mean, Microsoft pulled out at CES.  Comdex has disappeared.  Apple showed the way.  Apple doesn't go to these events.  You just have your own events and you get more attention.  You're not competing with anybody else.  Somehow though, it seems like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo still feel like they have to be  somewhere around E3.  That's still the week, right?  It's still the week.

Start time: 10555.94
End time: 10611.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's the week that all the news is coming out.  Right.  And for a gamer's perspective, you don't really care if Nintendo is announcing Smash  as part of E3 or with the Nintendo Direct.  I just care that a new Smash is coming out.  So I really hear what you're saying, Jeff, but they've struggled with this for years.  Leo, you were saying this was the first E3 that was open to the press.  If I'm remembering this correctly, they tried that a few years ago.  Letting people in, then they shut it off to journalists again and let people back in,  if I'm remembering that correctly.  I just think ultimately it matters what games were announced and what games are coming out,  because they're all competing for that mind share.  Is Fallout 77 going to be the big game that people care about?  Is Anthem?  I think what we saw this year were some fresh new IPs really getting a lot of attention from people.

Start time: 10611.73
End time: 10623.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think according to GameSpot, E3 opens to the public for the first time ever.  15,000 tickets.  Oh, wait, that was last year.  Okay, there you go.  So it is the second year in a row.

Start time: 10624.00
End time: 10670.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, second year.  And this year was the first time they had different hours for the public and the press,  which was kind of nice.  We got a couple of hours at the beginning to go in and just have press only.  But I agree with you, Brianna.  I think you're right.  I think it ultimately comes down to what games were shown, what things were talked about,  because it is the biggest week in the gaming calendar.  And that's really the most important thing.  It is interesting how the show is changing and I think kind of receding in a certain sense, but  from a gaming standpoint, from just what was announced, it really was a strong year  for some exciting stuff.  We did get a lot of sequels as we always do,  but some exciting new stuff, some interesting trends.  Go ahead.

Transcript:  And just the, I too am a gamer, although I suck at games.  It's a huge part.  It is explicitly my hobby.  I'm not working if I'm playing games.  And it's been fascinating to watch games both pioneer some of the spaces that we've talked  about, specifically social hooks.  I mean, in social mechanics, they figured out long before social media, cyber security  and cyber defense game, the game industry had to pioneer these things.  And they're now kind of following the SaaS model.  And it's interesting to see the games industry take a page out of the services book and really  transition almost every major publisher has transitioned from releasing standalone products  and single player products over the last decade to these always on service models.  And whether you, I mean, gamers, I know are very vocal with their opinions, especially  on Reddit, but whether you love this or hate this, it really has represented this kind  of massive sea change that's happened in a multi-billion dollar industry that the mainstream  media has kind of turned a blind eye to.

I'm sure there'll be more like that.  Look, what else can be hacked?  Everything can be hacked.  I mean, it's true.  Everything.  We'll be back with our best of in just a second.  The stock market is crazy, isn't it?  It's going up and down.  Betterment is the smart way to manage your money.  It's the largest independent online financial advisor.  They're designed to help you build wealth, but also plan for retirement,  save for college, achieve all your financial goals.

When the market goes down, Betterment will help you  save more of your money by taking advantage of things like tax loss harvesting.  Betterment provides unlimited expert advice designed to help you make smart financial decisions.  You're still in control, but Betterment can help you.  And I can't underscore this enough.  They're what they call a fiduciary.  That means everything they recommend is based on your best interest.  They are not incentivized to recommend certain funds.  They don't have their own investment products to sell.  They are working for you.  And you can't say that about most financial advisors.  This is what you want.

It's a very small, very affordable flat fee based on the amount of money you have invested.  And you can look it up on the site because it varies depending on what you're doing.

Transcript:  Well, if you watch the whole video, I don't think Elon necessarily was expecting it,  but haven't there been tweets between his girlfriend and another musician  about him getting stoned all the time?  I seem to remember a story about that.  He's turning balls on acid when he was joking about taking the company private.  Yes, right, exactly.  And so I think he's got- I think he's not- I think he's 420 friendly anyway,  and he's not the guy actually working, turning wrenches on the rockets, so I'm not sure exactly  how that extends up.  One of the things that's really fascinated me about the legalization of pot around the country  is you have places where it's now legal, but you have businesses who will fire you if you do it,  and this kind of dovetails into that a little bit, because what are Tesla's and SpaceX's rules  about doing marijuana, even on your own time, and certainly in public?

Start time: 11444.02
End time: 11466.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a report of a woman who was fired from Tesla because she tested positive for  marijuana, cannabis, and she was mad because Elon was out there smoking weed.  I don't have a problem with what you do on your own time, for sure, but I do think that it was  a failure of crisis communications, too, in the middle of the struggles that Tesla's had in the  last 12, 18, 24 months to go through this level of distraction and stupidity into the mix.

Transcript:  The question I have is how does Musk understand his relationship with his shareholders  and his board of directors, because it's one thing when it's your company, and there are not  people who have put their money into it and are relying on you to make the kind of decisions that  will increase market valuation, but when you become a public company, you are essentially  making a contract with shareholders that says, when I act as a representative of this company  in the public space, everything I do, I do in the interest of increasing value.  He hasn't demonstrated an awareness of that. He hasn't demonstrated an understanding that once  your company is publicly traded, your relationship to both your intellectual property and your  corporation is much different than when you own the whole thing the whole way down.

Start time: 11517.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_28
Transcript:  Self-defeating, even, but this is the story of Elon in the last couple years. I mean, he's done  with, through his firms, a lot of really great stuff. I still watch SpaceX launches,  because I'm a huge nerd. No, no, me too. He's revolutionized that area.  The live video is fantastic, and the Model 3 launch has finally revved up. They're claiming  to hit profitability this year. If he just said nothing, a lot of stuff would have gone away.  Instead, Joe Rogan, a large blunt, and a thousand million memes that were born from that moment.  I mean, just unnecessary, and he needs better friends to tell him not to do this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what that is. Yeah, it's definitely in there. I wouldn't contest his innovation or his genius  in a lot of ways. In that interview, one of the things I really liked was how he nerded out over  alternative energy sources and the idea of breaking free of the fossil fuel economy. I mean, good for  him for getting those ideas out to an audience that is not typically hearing those ideas. Good  for him for that, and good for him for being smart about this stuff. But is he smart about how to be  a CEO of a publicly-facing, publicly-traded company? In that same interview, he also

No, they're not. No, they're not. That R. Okay. Are we the feature part yet?  So I can just do it. I want to hear this. He was going.  Let me tell you something. Dual SIM cards. Welcome to 2012. We got dual SIM cards. You  know you can do that, right? You got to eat some card. Okay. Have you ever had that? Cool. Okay.  Next thing. Stereo recording. What? They had another phones too? Oh my God. But ours is  magical stereo recording because we have waves in the video. It's amazing. Oh, wait, what's another  feature that we have? Oh, we have HDR picture technology, nano by gigabyte thermal timeout  learning. Oh, pixel had that in their camera last year with the, oh, okay. So what do we have new  again? What do we do? What do we innovate? I don't know. I don't. So then you go talk about the  battery life. What cell phone have you ever seen in your life that doesn't just tell you 13 hours  with an asterisk, 14 hours or asterisk? Apple came along and said 30 minutes more than the old  phone you used to buy. 30 minutes more than that little phone you used to have. And maybe 15 minutes  more than this new phone you going to get if you get the big one. Just tell me how long the battery  lasts because you won't tell me what's in there for the battery. And then the one meter versus  the two meter. You couldn't have just made that all the same depth. Really? I still got you just  the 2.4 cents it would have cost you because you told me I still got the same chip in it.  And I'm not supposed to be jealous. Then you come with this wackadoodle screen. You charge $749.  This phone should be $599. They want this phone for everybody and every kid. There's so much  better phones out there for that price range that you could get in the world. And they say, oh,  $749 for everybody. For who? Entitled children are going to bug their kids so they can do this  emoji thing. That's all it's for. You're just trying to get money. Apple ain't innovated nothing.  All they do, I'm sorry I'm yelling. I'm so upset. All they do is raise the price of their phones  and they make more money on the margins. So when I spend $1,100 on a Mac and I only get 64 gigs,  and I look at a note and it starts at 128 gigs because they live in America and the world as we  live in and they know that nobody wants the 64 gigs. Then they offer you a phone at 512 for  $1,000, $2,500. And then you could put another 512 on top of that. I could get a terabyte of space  with a note. You know how many videos of cats and dogs and my child I could do with a terabyte on  my phone. I can record my life for a month straight with a terabyte. But Apple is just squeaking on by  with a 64 then to a 256. I hate so much the things that they do. Now ask me if I'm buying it and which  one I'm buying. 11, I'm sorry, 17 anonymous sources in government, three letter agencies,

Transcript:  Amazon and Apple said that Chinese spies had placed a tiny rice sized microchip on super  micro motherboards in 2015. These super micro motherboards were used in many, many places,  servers by Apple, the Department of Defense. We even had one because this all came to light.  According to, now I'm going to say this a couple of times in this story because I want to emphasize,  according to Bloomberg Businessweek, we even had one because it was first discovered by Amazon when  they were doing their due diligence. They were about to acquire a company called Elemental  Technologies. Elemental makes a streaming box, a box we've used for some years, a very expensive  box that takes our video, compresses it and then feeds it out to Ustream, YouTube, Twitch, Mixer,  whoever it is that's restreaming our stuff. These Elemental motherboards, Amazon during a routine  securite before the acquisition found this little chip. According to Bloomberg Businessweek,  the chip was posing as a support, a minor support chip on the motherboard. Nobody would pay any  attention to it. But when the motherboard was first booted in a server, would modify the operating  system, phone home the Chinese military and help the Chinese military hack these servers,  in the Pentagon. Elemental is widely used. As I said, we use it. I presume if this is true,  our motherboards were hacked. But then the story gets weirder. So 17 sources, anonymous sources,  Bloomberg Businessweek, highly credible source. The next day, Amazon, Apple, even the freaking  Chinese government unequivocally deny it. They say it never happened. Apple said  it was the story was wrong and misinformed. The Department of Homeland Security yesterday,  well, actually, their denial was a little less unequivocal. They said,  we have no reason to doubt. We have no reason to doubt that Apple and Amazon are telling the  truth. That's not exactly like Noah never happened. That's like, well, we have no reason. In this  particular circumstance, we currently have no reason to doubt. Nevertheless, the denials from  Amazon and Apple were really strong. No, it didn't happen. Bloomberg's completely wrong.  How does this happen? Is this a trick? Actually, I'm going to poll you. We'll start with you, Rich.

Transcript:  Who's right? Oh, man, I feel like this is kind of the biggest fear of kind of the tech world,  right? Like all this stuff is made over in China. This is kind of the perfect way of infiltrating  the systems with a tiny chip that nobody recognizes or even cares to notice. And, you know,  they can take control of these things. They can modify the system on startup, whatever they want  to do. So it's tough for me to believe that Businessweek has this many people saying this  happened and it hasn't happened. And I understand why these big companies, including Amazon and  Apple, are strongly denying this because it's pretty bad for them if this happened to them.  So I sort of believe it. And I think that just reading the story, I mean, it's fascinating. I  couldn't put this thing down. It was so well written and so like I just wanted to know more  and more and more. But I think what was missing in this story to me is kind of the consequence,  like concrete, like what they did with these little chips. And maybe I missed that, but I didn't  see like, you know, did they take down something? Or is this all just like kind of laying in wait  for something that they want to do in the future? That was kind of the part that I was confused

Transcript:  Yeah, right. They come forth pretty quickly about it. And then I just think back to other  scenarios in the past with Apple, as far as like when we had that shooting at that school in  California and they wanted to search the phones and Apple was trying to do the right thing from  a privacy and security standpoint. So I just, my gut just says, I'm going to go with Apple.  Now, had it just been Amazon saying, no, that's not true. I'd have had the hairy eye.

Apple has never found malicious chips, hardware manipulations or  vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Daniel Rubino, what do you think? You've been  covering this for a long time. What do you think? Yeah, I'm leaning towards this is just got to be

End time: 12335.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  some truth to this now. But we may not know where the exact details actually, we don't know the  exact details. And there could be some crossed wires here on information. Maybe some hardware  was shipped to Apple, but it was caught in time and never deployed it. In which case,  both things could be true. But yeah, you know, there's been a lot of reports around Huawei and  other companies to write about this possibility, this threat, and it works both ways. You know,  there's concerns to the US companies doing the same. I don't know, my hunch says that there's  probably some truth to this. It's just a question of to what extent the damage was done. But  none of this is surprising to anyone who's been covering this industry for the last couple of  years, as this big concern over the strength of Chinese tech and its influence on US economy.  Everybody knows that the way you wage war is changing from a pure, you know, military  exercise to work technological or information in the case of what Russia has been doing or accused  of doing a lot recently. So just because the companies deny this stuff, if it's an issue of  national security, they can be quite funky told to don't talk about this because you don't want to  expose those vulnerabilities. Maybe there's active investigations going on. We don't know  all the details here. But I find it hard to believe with 17 sources that none of this is  true. I think it's more about degrees at this point. Zach Whitaker, who writes about security

Start time: 12335.94
End time: 12445.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  at TechCrunch and has worked most recently at CBS, he's been covering security forever. He says,  welcome to the murky world of national security reporting. He says, even with this story,  my gut is mixed. There is one potential scenario that maybe means both of these that the companies  aren't lying, but the story is true. I have to say, to add myself to this poll, there's no way  Bloomberg Businessweek runs this story unless, and they stand behind it by the way, unless they  absolutely have unequivocal evidence of this. 17 sources, all anonymous, yeah, but you'd have to  say Bloomberg Businessweek is making this up. That's too many people to not be true. So here's  maybe a very narrow, maybe the Apple PR team that responded, and this was John Gruber's theory,  didn't know about it. If something like this happens, you're not going to send out a memo to  everybody in Apple saying, hey, by the way, look what we found. You're going to keep it very quiet.  So maybe a handful of people at Apple know, and the ones who don't know are the ones making the  unequivocal denial. There's also a possibility there's a US government gag order, although Apple,  again, says we are in no way under a gag order. But again, maybe the people who are under the  gag order are a handful of people, not the people writing the press release. That's the only way I  could see both sides being accurate. I don't think Apple PR is lying in such an outright.  They would say nothing, or they would say little, or they would say there's lots of ways they could  slice this without saying, no, it did not happen. Yeah, it's odd that they came out so strong

Usually the way Apple works is they talk to the certain media that covers the  beat that they want to get the story out with. This time they just sent out a blanket email  through their legal guy denying it and linking to this, which I found to be very heavy handed.  It's one of these things where you want to believe Apple, but at the same time it seems like it's  overly like what are the... I understand they have a lot to lose in this, but it just seems like they  really want to make sure that like, no, we are not involved in this. This is not true at all.

Transcript:  I was going to say another angle to this, possibly is more of the conspiratorial angle,  is that this is really a story. The US government has a vested interest in undermining Chinese tech  or at least eroding the trust in it for such circumstances. We all obviously know about the  Qualcomm Broadcom attempt to buy out and how that was blocked. Do you think Bloomberg got played by  the US intelligence community? In a way, no. 17 seems like a lot. On the other hand, this is  kind of what intelligence is supposed to be doing. I don't think we can discount it.  I still think there's actually a threat from China in this sense, because why wouldn't they?  It's just that's how counterintelligence works. We do the same thing. Like I said,  there may be some truth to this, but it may have been played up by some people in the government,  too. Even this current administration is very much against giving China too much leverage when  it comes to manufacturing. It's a hard story to follow and believe, especially when you're talking  about espionage, counterintelligence, and national security. Bloomberg breaks the company's denials

Transcript:  are countered by six current and former senior national security officials who, in conversations  that began during the Obama administration and continued under the Trump administration,  detailed the discovery of the chips in the government's investigation. This has been going  on for several years. It sounds like Bloomberg reporters have been working on this story for  several years. One of those officials and two people inside Amazon provided extensive information  on how the attack played out at Elemental and Amazon. That's another thing. You would not only  have to... It's one thing to say, well, you can easily get 17 CIA people to say,  yeah, it just happened. I mean, that's their job. But then you're getting people inside Amazon  saying, confirming it, the details match. The officials and one of the insiders also described  Amazon's cooperation with the government investigation. In addition to the three  Apple insiders, four of the six US officials confirmed that Apple was a victim. 17 people  confirmed the manipulation of Supermicro's hardware. The sources were granted anonymity  because of the sensitive and in some cases classified nature of the information. Daniel,  that's an interesting theory though. I kind of... Maybe this is... You know, it's clear something's

Who do you believe? Who do you trust? And when you undermine all institutions around you,  people can't even trust new sources anymore. So we're in a brave new world. I'm kind of nervous  about it. When I did political science, undermining classic institutions is the first way you  destabilize society. So it's a real threat to it. That's exactly right. Well, and from the consumer

I mean,  this is becoming a reality for the average person to think about the stuff that we're carrying with  us and the stuff that we're putting in our homes, the routers, the systems. And this becomes very  clear that, oh my gosh, this is something that of course we've thought of, but not into this detail.  And you're just like, this is exactly how it's done in a big way.

And they could easily just push a button to make  things just go nuts on me and maybe cause some even bigger problems if they wanted to. Because  we don't know... I can crack this machine open and I don't know what all of these transistors  and capacitors and all of that... I don't know what any of that stuff is doing. I just know

Very few people understand  the complexity of our modern world and fewer still understand the security issues and could  detect these problems. And if you have a determinate adversary with national state level  resources behind them, even if it's just North Korea, it seems to me that it would be very,  very difficult if you had somebody who wanted to do this to prevent it. Everything is made in China,  almost everything. So the supply chain is coming out of China. And even if you're buying a phone  made in Korea or Taiwan or Thailand or India or Brazil, many of the parts are made in China.

I'm going to go from the flip side, though,  on the fact that China knows that all this stuff is big business. And I think, I mean,  clearly we love to believe in these conspiracy theories and we love to imagine that it's like  us versus them versus Russia. I do think there, of course, are elements of that in our world. But at  the same time, I want to believe that they know that the business that they're going to make off  these components are way better than the business they're going to make off of the whatever  marketplace they're dealing with.

So there are,  absolutely, I would say most of the Chinese government wants to maintain good relations  because after all, we're their biggest market. On the other hand, there are, and this hack,  it's presumed came from the Chinese military, there are, I'm sure, hardliners in the Chinese  military who say, yeah, let's just in case, let's be ready for cyber warfare. I don't think it's  monolithic, in other words. And I completely agree with you, Daniel, this completely could be a  conspiracy from the United States government who wants us to say exactly that.

Jerry Pornell, I've mentioned this to  Jerry before he passed in his book, Lucifer's Hammer. The story is that a giant asteroid hits  the United States. It's a great book. Yeah, isn't it good? And there's just a few survivors in the  world who kind of have to cobble together existence again. But he points out that we live in a world  where we use stuff every day. We have no idea how it works nor could we recreate it if we had to.  And that's your car. That's your freaking microwave oven, let alone your computers and your  phones. I'm guilty. We're all guilty. And I don't think there's any one person who could do this,  who could recreate this. So that's kind of the consequence of that is there's a huge amount of  trust in using all of this stuff. And if you had an actor who decided that he didn't care about  being trusted or wanted to subvert this, it's a little... Is it chilling or is it industrial  espionage? A lot of these servers are used by the Department of Defense. These elemental servers alone  are used all over the place. The CIA, the NSA, they're used in drone placement.  They're used controllers.

Start time: 13071.48
End time: 13100.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  wouldn't that be part of this reporting? I think that's what the original report actually did say  was that when Amazon was looking to buy Elemental, they sent their boards for review to a third party  company who found a little chip on there that was not part of the original diagram designed for that  chipset. And that's what the red flag was. And then I think trying to figure out what it does  or its potential was a matter of sort of reverse engineering it. Well, I can bet that everybody

Transcript:  who has a super micro motherboard and has the capability... The problem is who has the capability?  There's a lot of little chips on there. Have you ever looked at a little motherboard?  And they're labeled. But I mean, I don't know how you would have to take the thing apart,  test each one individually. It's non-trivial. And who has those resources?  An Elemental costs $30,000. I am not taking my Elemental. I actually proposed this to our  engineering team. I said, because we have a new Elemental from AWS that we just got a few months  ago. So that will not obviously. But we had the old Elemental from this time frame. We were using  it back then. But unfortunately, we had to send it back. Where's the iFixit tear down?  Yeah, I want to tear down. iFixit maybe could do that. Yeah. They specialize in identifying  unlabeled or poorly labeled or incorrectly labeled chips. I think we can all agree that  there's potential for this to happen, whether it actually did happen or not.  And I think Bloomberg didn't get it wrong. I just don't understand  what happened, what the response is and why the response is that. And I don't think it's,  I don't think Apple is so venal as to say, well, that will hurt our business. We better lie about  it. I agree with you in that case. There's no way that's the case. I think it's much more that  whoever issued this release didn't know, if anything. And nobody's talking. Maybe even Tim  Cook doesn't know. I don't know. Photographers like Trey Ratcliffe made his name on Google Plus  because it was such a good place for photographers. People like Mike Elgin really sang its praises. I  loved it. But I mean, I'm looking at my Google Plus pages filled with spam of a sexual nature  in many cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_36
Transcript:  Why did it not win? Google fundamentally doesn't understand social. As a company,  as a culture, they fundamentally don't understand social.  If you just give people a great tool, why don't they use it?  Don't think anybody building the products or steering it understands social. I just don't.  And I think that you can have all the best things, but if you're not coming at it from  that perspective, I mean, there was an interesting medium post or it wasn't a medium, sorry,  but somebody's blog, someone who was on the design team for the first eight months, who  kind of talked about his experiences and they're obviously colored in some ways that maybe aren't  fair to the final product, but it was always from the very beginning, it was a defensive move,  always. And that comes through. And I think that the fact that it was designed because Google  realized that they'd missed social and then the fact that it was pushed down everyone's throats  so much to the point where there wasn't even a reason for people to want to use it. You're  almost turned off. I mean, there was a point where it was linked to all of your Google stuff.  I'm verified on YouTube because of it, so I'm thankful for that. I had a ridiculous number of  Google plus followers. I would joke about it because it was hilarious. It still is. But I  didn't really ever see that sort of engagement. It was just kind of this weird thing foisted upon  people. And I don't think it ever had direction from people who saw it as anything other than  we've got to try to beat Facebook because that's an important part of the future going forward. And  I mean, it is what it is. It's a shame, but it is what it is. It is a shame.

Transcript:  When Ed said that, I just imagined him putting it on speaker and holding it to his ear the way you  see people in coffee shops talk on the phone. Really loud. Everybody can hear it. They don't  know there's an earpiece. It's like on FaceTime or something and it's stuck up to their ear.

Transcript:  person from Huawei just this week because I really like the P20. But I said to her,  the first thing it does is say, can we send everything you're doing back to the office?  And she said, here's the good news. That's all sent to Germany, not to China.  So there, I feel better. That actually is good news. Actually, it's much better if you're going  to send to one country in the world, send it to Germany. Exactly. They started by talking about  Macs, which first was very, as a Mac fan, was very gratifying. Hallelujah. Well, little Mac love.  They announced a new MacBook Air with frankly an anemic processor. Yeah, very poor spec.  Very poorly spec'd and very inexpensive. $1199. We were hoping it would be sub-a-thousand. It's not.  They do have a sub-a-thousand MacBook Air. It's the old one. And then they announced a Mac Mini,  which with lots of ports. We bought both. We're going to use that Mac Mini.  Also more expensive. Well, $100 more than the base model last time, which was,  let's face it, four years ago. Last time, I think the dollar was worth less. But nevertheless,  then they go to the iPads and suddenly everything's shiny, bright, new, faster.  Yeah. And I realized if you had started with the iPads and went to the Macs, it would have been like,

Transcript:  oh man, how depressing is this? But also it's the essential message they're pushing, which for me was  you will buy an iPad whether you like it or not. We're going to price and spec our systems to do it.

Transcript:  It felt very much to me like the end of the line on the Apple II. You remember that probably, Mike,  where they had a conference. Apple had a conference in San Francisco. Apple II forever.  They had a song, Apple II forever. And they killed it like six months later.  And it was very clear to me that this is basically the end of the line for Mac OS.

Transcript:  They emphasize the, we're giving them what they want. Some people for some reason like our  laptops. So we're, we don't get it. We don't know why. And for some reason they like the Mac Mini.  So here's another Mac Mini. But now let's talk about the future of computing the iPad.  And it was, yeah, it was really, it was really clear.

Transcript:  They're doing an eight core CPU, a seven core GPU. They even have a machine learning core,  dedicated machine learning core. It's so, it seems to me that all of the real innovation that's  happening at Apple is happening in those chipsets. When I saw that the new Apple pencil magnetically

Transcript:  So it's not, it wasn't just me because I'm, I love Mac OS and I want to keep using Mac OS.  Apple also had AutoCAD on stage and they said very clearly this has the desktop AutoCAD engine in it  at Adobe's conference a couple of weeks ago. They announced Adobe Photoshop,  basically all the features of desktop on the iPad.

Transcript:  This comes back to what Mike was saying earlier. They want iOS because it's a nice little wall  garden that they control absolutely and completely and commoditize that. Whereas Mac OS is messy,  other people play in it. And for all the tools.

Transcript:  Furthermore, they're also beholden to Intel, right?  Yeah.  One of the reasons that Apple's Macintosh line has been held back is that Intel is stymied.  Can't seem to do a 10 nanometer chip. Apple is very clear. We've got the first seven  nanometer chip in production, the A12X by the way.  Yeah.  I feel like Apple would love to get out from under Intel.  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  Even for the Macs.

Start time: 13881.02
End time: 13912.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, Intel's got massive problems at the moment. Their work on 10 nanometer is completely stalled.  Cobalt, which they were trying out as a method of getting around it, hasn't worked.  At the same time, other chip companies are eating their breakfast  and they've got major supply problems on the server side because they've got 99% of the market  and people are still buying those chips and they can't produce them fast enough.  So, I mean, and plus they've lost their CEO in rather unusual circumstances. So,  yeah, Intel just seems to be flailing at the moment. I don't blame Apple for trying to dump them.

Transcript:  The other thing is that they're grappling with a new generation of people who, like you were  saying earlier, only want to use their phones. They grew up with touch devices. They only remember  touch devices. There are lots of kids these days who never used a mouse before. They think it's  kind of a weird contraption from the Victorian era or something like that. And let's face it,  this is how change really happens is old people die and young people are born. And so they basically  they're thinking, okay, in 20 years or 10 years, how are we going to get today's iPhone,  20 year old iPhone users to buy a really expensive second computer for their desk?  And it's got to be something that's going to be iPhone. Otherwise, they're not going to buy it.

Transcript:  there's a future for giant iPad-like devices. The Surface Studio will be an iPad. Exactly. And I  think also there'll be things like office windows will be TVs like that one. Giant screens that can  be... So I think there are going to be screens everywhere. On your face, on the wall, on the  desktop surface will be a screen. But this whole touch, it's all going to be iOS-like. It's all  going to be touch gestures and that sort of thing. But Apple has a couple of issues. Go ahead, Brian.

Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say that's fine and great, but there could be a fairly long interim here.  Before that reality comes. So the question is, and this has been debated. I'm not the first one to  bring this up, but at what point do they risk... Apple's always been the company of creatives and  high-end professionals. It's the thing that kept Apple alive as a company in the late 90s.  What's the tipping point where those people have to go away and go to someone else? And also,  what is the tipping point where Apple is fine with that? Well, Brian wasn't at the point of the

What a year this has been. I am so thrilled that you decided to watch our holiday rap special.  I know many of you have seen all these segments. It was fun to get them all together.  Thanks to Carson Bonney, our producer and our crack editors who stitch this all together.  I'm really glad they did because it gave them and me a chance to take this week off. I hope  you're enjoying your holiday week, celebrating it with family and friends. I also hope you have a  wonderful new year 2019. We will be back for the first twit of 2019, which is what? January 6th,  is that right? January 5th, 7th, yeah, 8th, January 7th, 6th. One of those numbers is right.  January 6th, we'll be back. As always, Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern,  2300 UTC for This Week in Tech, our tech news roundtable. One of the things we're going to  keep doing, I hope you like it. All of our other shows have a regular cast, but for some reason,  I think historic reasons, twit is a rotating cast of people that I think we've all come to love.  I like that chance to get new voices, a variety of voices on talking about the week's tech news.  We're going to keep doing that in 2019. I hope, I pray you will keep listening. In fact, do me a  favor, subscribe at twit.tv or in your favorite podcast application. That way you won't miss  another episode of twit. I've got to raise my glass. Yes, I've been drinking eggnog all  show long and I'm getting a little tipsy. I've got to raise my glass to all of you. Thank you so much  for making twit a part of your lives, for giving all of us a chance to make these shows. We love  doing what we do, but it wouldn't make any sense doing it unless you watch. So I really appreciate  it. Here's a cheers to you and yours and to a happy and peaceful 2019. And now, without further  ado, a word from Santa. Good night everybody. Another twit is literally in the can.
