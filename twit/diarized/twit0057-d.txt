Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Twitter, This Week in Tech, Episode 57 for June 11, 2006.  Hi, this is Leo. One little show note before we begin. We recorded this show at VloggerCon on Friday, June 9, 2006 at the Apple Store.  Just before the show I spoke with Robert Scoble and he indicated he might be thinking of leaving Microsoft.  He asked me not to say anything, so I didn't. Just a few short hours after we recorded the show, Robert announced to the world that in fact he was leaving and joining JohnFurrier'sPodTech.net.  So the show you're about to hear is Robert Scoble's last appearance as a Microsoft stooge. Enjoy.  And a very good day to you. I'm Leo Laporte and we are doing Twitter once again from the Apple Store in San Francisco, California as part of VloggerCon.  And there are a lot of vloggers across from us doing their presentation. We'll meet some vloggers as time goes by.  But I think part of the problem with the term vlogger is I'm not sure what it means. Everybody on this panel has done video on the internet, but is that a vlog? I don't know.  Let me introduce the panel starting from my left with Jason McCabe-Kalakannis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for having me. It's been my dream to be on the show.  I've been quoting you on the show many, many times.  You know what? I do get that information on a very regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jason has been a long time member of the electronic community starting back in New York City. Were you part of Pseudo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did a radio show on Pseudo, which was Josh Harris' company back in the streaming media days, starting in 96, 97.  A long time ago.  He used to rent AM radio and then have a chat room on Prodigy in 95. So that was the first interactive thing being done.  It was part of NYU's ITP program at the time. All kinds of crazy stuff. That was a fun one.  You started the Silicon Alley Reporter?  Silicon Alley Reporter, Venture Reporter, sold it to Dow Jones, then started Weblogs Inc., which produces Engadget and a number of other blogs, and sold that to AOL.  In 18 months he flipped that sucker.  18 months, yeah. I've been at AOL for about six months. I'll be announcing some new stuff in a couple weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So are you running Weblogs Inc. in AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CEO of Weblogs Inc., which is an American online company. It's a subsidiary. I'm also running a couple of other departments at AOL. That will be revealed shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But right now the only guy on this panel who's not actually doing video on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me? I have a number of video crews who work for me. I've got about six or seven full-time video people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what you're saying is you have people who do that?  I got people who do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand, Leo.  We do video on Joystick, we do video on Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true. Engadget does a lot of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of video. I've got two full-time predators on staff. We call them predators, producer-editors.  I like that.  They can actually go find the person to interview, interview them, cut the video and upload it.  We did a lot of that on Joystick at E3. It's a good video at CES this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we're glad to get you on the show. We really appreciate it. There's a lot to talk about this week.  Patrick Norton is also here, DLTV. He's doing IPTV, both streaming and downloading.  Downloadable video. It's good. Video on the Web.  Bring back memories, doing that screensavers entry?  Yeah, hot, sweaty and trying to figure out why I was running while I was being chased.  Why am I running into a crowd of people?  I just thought it would be fun to try it out that way.  Amber MacArthur is here down from Canada. Of course, she is the producer and host, Predator of Command N,  but also my co-host on Call for Help. It's great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great to be here. We've been shooting Torrent in the city, which has been fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Torrent is a new show on G4TechTV Canada, which is all about video podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we really take the best video podcasts that we find on the Internet,  and we put them together in one show per week, and we find lots of great stuff.  We featured lots of shows from people who are around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it was your idea to come to VloggerCon. I didn't even know about VloggerCon until you mentioned it.  I mean, this is an interesting event. We'll talk a little bit about what VloggerCon is all about.  Perfect.  Also to my right, John C. Dvorak, who is a cranky geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at this. On this thing, there's a little bitty camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just a green light. Pay no attention to that.  That's it. Don't touch the lens. John's playing with my MacBook.  Don't touch the screen, John.  Yeah, don't touch this thing. It's so delicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's try the old drop test on it.  No, please not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're actually in a weird situation. We're on the bridge at the Apple Store,  which goes across the staircase as people come in and they go up to the auditorium.  That's because the VloggerCon convention has a Meet the Vloggers event in the auditorium across from us.  But what's weird is there actually is gaps so we could drop things through.  I know. I hope we didn't have an earthquake.  Watch those twit brushes because they could go right through the crack there.  We could go too.  Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention dvorak.org slash vlog.  Thank you very much.  I have one of the funniest posts I've ever done right now. It's online. It's a cat.  Has anyone seen this thing, by the way?  Some jokers put a cat toy on an overhead fan and this cat's reaching for it and then he gets caught in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's not bad. The cat just goes around and around and gets thrown against the wall.  It's quite humorous, actually.  Is this a video or an anime?  It's a video. It's a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually somebody put together like a 25-minute collection of viral videos of cats doing weird things.  Cats doing weird things.  Yeah, that's definitely worth checking.  It's called youcat.com.  Yeah. Remember the scan, the cat scans? Remember that? They had scans of cats.  People would upload their, they would put their kitty on a scanner and they would scan it.  Yeah, cat people plus cat people.  I don't remember that.  Bad combination.  One more person to introduce. Actually, there's going to be lots more coming through, but I'm really thrilled Andrew Baron is here.  I called you Andrew Cogden last week, but that was just a slip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is an Andrew Cogden, though, and he's here, actually.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm the actual genius behind the incredibly successful Rocket Boom, and I confused you with Amanda Cogden, who is your host on Rocket Boom, but I didn't really.  I knew you weren't Amanda. I just, it was my mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't have any expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you a vlogger? What is a vlogger?  What is a vlogger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The word just fascinates you to no end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. There's a lot of different terms that are being thrown around right now, but video blogging or vlogging, you know, the shortened word for it is just very much like vlogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which originally Rocket Boom kind of was, but it's moved more to a show now, wouldn't you say a daily show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It originally started as a daily show.  It was always intended to be that.  And we just, we use blog software. We are talking to bloggers. We get a lot of our news from blogs.  We have comments and we archive everything, and it's kind of short, and you know, it uses a lot of the same sort of style.  How many pages do you get a month?  How many pages a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ask him how many he gets a day.  Well, a month is a number I can tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We count by video downloads per day, like complete and progressive.  How many do you get a day?  We have around 300,000 typically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to get a rec to place.  How do you pay your bandwidth bills?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, we actually, I mean, when we got started, bandwidth costs were 90% of what they are today.  Today it's only 10%, in other words, of what it was just a year and a half. So it's just, it's so cheap.  I mean, even today it's our biggest cost, but it's really nothing at all even to mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You get 300,000 a day though, partly because when you go to your page, they start watching the show, right?  But you're counting from, you fully watch video, not just started video.  We can pull downloads.  Pull downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not just on our site because we distribute it on so many different platforms like on TiVo or, you know, BitTorrent distributions, all kinds of stuff.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many people, do you have any indication on how many people open it?  That's the statistic I'm always dealing with is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now don't bring this up because advertisers keep saying that to me.  They say, well, yeah, you got the downloads.  I'm sorry. Well, of course, they all open them.  How many people subscribe but don't read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just can't ask that of a web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The other thing too is a lot of times with our shows, like a lot of people will watch them at work and stuff and they share it kind of with their friends.  So they like, three people sit around and watch.  Pass around, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pass around. I remember that from the magazine business.  Exactly.  That's why I got out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  PC Magazine, we have a multiplier by the number of issues and there's so many people read.  About 2.2 people or so like read every issue.  One thing you can say for sure though, because at least unlike television where Nielsen rating is a guess, you at least know how many people download the show.  It's not just a guess. These guys are statistical geniuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to have a way to only find back-end users.  Who are you explaining, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm telling you. No, actually I defend them.  You defend them?  I think Nielsen does a good job.  You're one of the few, John. In fact, it's the director of a local television.  I didn't say they do a job.  Local television, I don't say they do a good job, but nationally I think they do.  Another voice joins the party here. Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer is here.  Here we are.  He is perhaps best known as a blogger.  He's known as Scoble.  He's best known as Scoble. More than anything else.  He's the face, the blog face of Microsoft.  What do you mean Microsoft?  He's the Microsoft shill.  That's it. I've sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Scoble, admit it.  I've sold out. I've sold my fool.  You also do video, though, with the Channel 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've got the Channel 9 right there.  What's great is he's kind of like a gorilla videographer.  Hey, you've got a new camera there.  That's HD, isn't it?  Bill has some cash now.  He's got an HD camera. This is the kind of money he's getting made.  When you sell out to Microsoft, you get good gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can sell out, go for high dollars.  That's what HD stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now we've got a real panel.  At some point, Eric Nichols, Ask a Ninja, is going to show up.  But we'll know he's here.  Will he be coming out as an ninja?  He's coming out as an ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not dressed as a ninja. He can't be on film.  We want to see what he looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Ask a Ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me too. It's my favorite video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's really good stuff out there.  I have to say.  Do you worry, Andrew, because there's a lot of people  who are breathing down your neck trying to do what you do basically?  Are you afraid of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Afraid? No, we encourage it more and more.  I think this is the most exciting thing about this really,  is that everybody can jump in and there's really room for everybody.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there's a theory is that it validates it.  The more people who are in the category, it validates the category.  More video I've got on top.  Until it all implodes.  Which it will do eventually.  It's a cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think there's some big differences that's happening in this medium.  That is that traditionally up until now, our whole lives,  all of us have only ever seen either major silver screen movies.  We've only seen a few of those.  Or we've only seen what's on just a few stations.  Therefore, some of the greatest works that have tried to get onto the platform  just couldn't make it.  Maybe because the guy was a bad business person  or maybe it was because somebody didn't sleep with somebody else.  You just never know.  You just go like all of that stuff.  Plenty of that.  There's never an avenue for all these other possibilities.  So now of course,  Right, we get to see a lot of such stuff.  Plenty of niche quality stuff actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're missing out video bloggers everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The most amazing thing actually about all this too is that most people have not,  there have not been a lot of people that have actually had the tools  and their possession to work with.  A lot of creative artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what excites me.  The technology democratizes it.  But just as when we first got laser printers and fonts  and you saw the world's worst desktop publishing,  you're seeing the same kind of thing happening with video too.  You never really saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That never really came to be, I don't think.  Oh, there was ghastly stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most of it was never that bad.  It was worse before people had all these tools.  When you had to do those cut and paste stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You also get no spam.  John gets no spam.  He gets no bad laser art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He hasn't gotten the email yet, so that's solved the spam problem.  That email thing's overrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny you say that because there's been some people writing about that topic.  They're saying that email is dead.  And it's not going to be used on anything.  It's an excellent article in SecurityFocus, in fact.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Electricity and gasoline as well.  I wish to email the guy.  A good spam filtering system like I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  Oh, please.  We want to give it one plug before we move on.  Yeah, you just go to the blog at davark.org and click on I get no spam.  And you go right to Mark Purkell's end of the highway.  How are you doing, Mark?  I know you're listening now.  Or go to seatime.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But John, you bring up the lack of quality on content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just got on HGTV and I sit there and watch the Discovery Channel for hours on end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no content there.  It's pretty.  TV notorious for bad content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  HD content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But like Tom Merritt from C9 was so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He got on HGTV and he goes, dude, I'm watching soccer.  And I'm like, that's strange.  He goes, I hate soccer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I can see the shoelaces and the blades of grass.  It's like so.  He watches baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You get over it.  You get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But do you have an over-the-air receiver?  No, I don't.  Oh, you've got to get an over-the-air receiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amber MacArthur, what is a vlog?  What is a vlog?  Oh, you're still on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really think that it's possible you can call it the same thing.  I mean, there are video podcasts, video blogs, vodcasts, vidcasts, whatever you want.  There's a bunch of different names.  Yeah.  And that's okay.  I don't consider that DTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's a distinction here because there are people here who say I'm a video blogger.  We're watching it on the screen right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It all has to do with either A, what the technology is and which it's distributed and or how that  particular person happens to identify with what they're doing.  How big their ego is.  Not necessarily, but what their entry point is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are people here who would say that none of us are vloggers even though we do video  on the Internet.  We don't count because we're not doing, quote, a video blog.  I would be one of those people.  It's easier to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think you're doing a video blog.  We know at least podcasting has to have RSS with enclosure spec, right?  So if you don't distribute it over RSS with enclosures, it's not a podcast, period.  Right.  That's it.  It's purely defined based on the technological distribution.  I agree 100% with him.  Blogging or video blogging can't...  You're missing my point.  You're missing my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't think he is.  He's talking purely semantically.  My issue is cultural.  You're asking for the definition.  It's cultural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The cultural part comes into the video blogging part.  This is what's next.  So now that we could take, like Rocket Boom, for instance, fits into video podcasts because  it's distributed with RSS enclosure.  We call it a video blog because we personally identify with that medium, with the blogging  medium.  But you've never really been a video blog.  How do you identify what a blog is because it's so...  I'll tell you what the difference between it and a video blog is.  Unfiltered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unfiltered is the defined character of blogs because once you put editorial process on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it, then it becomes a website.  But there's always editorial process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have editorial process here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Filtering.  It's a personal approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When people come to a blog, they expect that it's your view of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You hit the publish key and nobody changed it.  And I think that for vloggers, it's sort of the same thing.  Like, I took the video and nobody cut out the part or the blooper.  It's a personal approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I picture a lot of editing going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not even me on the editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A video log is a single person putting a single piece of content out there.  More individual.  We can argue whether Boing Boing is a blog because that's done by a team of people.  It's kind of a featured keyword thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's gray areas to the definition, but we get the general sense.  So when you apply that to video blogging, the only difference from blogging to video blogging  is just simply that the information is presented in video form instead of typically predominantly text.  So it's a blog with video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't think anybody in the general public can give a crap about the VT.  I mean, whether Boing Boing is a blog or not, I personally think it is.  Mainly because they use blogging software.  And the team thing doesn't mean anything to me one way or the other, and that's what I do.  There's no question that video is moving to the Internet.  In fact, today Apple announced or CBS announced that it's going to put some of its primetime shows now.  It means that Apple has every major network on for download.  I mean, IPTV is real as of today, right?  Yeah, but that's not IPTV.  See, now that's where I'll get into a disagreement with you about what IPTV is.  Well, all right. What is IPTV?  IPTV is stuff that goes to the television set, the main TV set.  What if you hook up your iPod to the main TV set?  Or what if you download it to your Mac?  I don't mind videos.  You can distribute it right out to a media center, an Xbox or an Apple Macintosh.  They hook up to a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because he's listened to the propaganda from Microsoft, but they're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I am the propaganda from Microsoft.  What do you mean? He's not listening to it. He's saying it.  He's actually getting paid by the word as we're here.  Does Steve Jobs know you're in the store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  IPTV is basically, you can take any kind of content, obviously, doesn't matter what it is.  You distribute it onto the TV set, which is a loaded thing.  Over IP.  Over IP versus cable.  Again, it's a technological distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So 20% of DLTV's audience is IPTV and the rest is downloading a video blog?  Well, that's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, because the way everyone serves, we find out there's actually a huge amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is, when I use my little camera, even though it's a $3,500 one,  I'm still only playing the video at a 320 by 240 video.  You could, but it's hard to distribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm going after distribution medium of iPods and of small devices and desktop computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is, when I run into the TV, Steve showed me when it came out.  I've got a cable, it goes, it's NTSC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or I download it to my mini and I have my mini hooked up to my TV.  Or you offer multiple resolutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The kind of resolution I get off of Discovery Channel is a lot different  than I'm going to deliver to you off this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only because you don't want to pay the bandwidth costs.  What about a movie made for TV?  Look at the guys, Kevin and all the guys from System 3, Remission 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's made for the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what gets to the distinction right there, is that it's whether you distribute it on that platform  or whether you identify the content as being specific for that platform.  So CBS does it, it's not IPTV because they're putting it on regular television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, CBS can do IPTV too.  It's TV, but now they're doing a new platform in which they're distributing it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does that change the nature of the content?  Not really, it's just a new distribution platform in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're focused on what the content is, not the distribution.  IPTV is going to let TV stations or cable networks or telephone networks  deliver new kind of video content.  For instance, we have IPTV running in our offices in Silicon Valley,  and we can get four HDTV channels at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now I can watch a baseball game from four different manage points all on the same screen,  all delivered at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's interesting because that's exactly what happened on Friday in the House of Representatives.  They approved a bill that allowed AT&T and Verizon, among other telcos, to start,  to make it easier for them to do subscription TV.  I think this is a bluff.  The House said that they're going to say a nationwide license,  instead of like cable companies, which are sold, and we learned this through bitter experience at Tech TV,  you've got to go to every single town in the country with a bag of cash and a little black bag,  and say you get your hunting license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That means you get to go to all 14,000.  This is a bluff.  This is a bluff.  A bluff for what?  AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A bluff so that they can get approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The House of Representatives also basically turned away the Republicans' manage to knock the Net Trutality bill down.  They don't have to bluff anymore.  I'll tell you what the bluff is.  The bluff is there's a secret or sweet deal between the cable companies and the phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't touch my content, and then I won't touch your phone lines.  So the cable companies, if they just stay out of the OIP business, but they're apparently not,  so these guys are going to say, let's go, let's see we can screw you over with IPTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the phone companies are going to come into the video arena.  That's what IPTV is all about.  It's the Cold War right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except in this Cold War, somebody will push the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is what DSL was.  It was video dial tone.  The whole point of DSL was for the telcos to deliver video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing it in France.  When you get a DSL on in France, it comes with 20 channels of basic cable,  and it comes with all free phone local, all local calls free.  So it's going that direction.  There's no doubt it will get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huge antitrust violation.  If you think they're colluding and saying, okay, you take phone, I'll take television.  So effective over the last few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you think they're actually doing that?  They're making that agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they're pushing guys left and right, performing giant monopolies.  If they get caught, this will make Enron look like.  They get caught.  The reason Enron got busted is because they were crooked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see this, by the way, that there's a company called Inboxer that specializes on searching and sorting through your email?  They've taken all of the Enron emails that were made.  Oh, yeah.  There's a couple sites doing that.  Because they were a deposition.  And now you can search through it.  You can search through all Enron's emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's been around for over a year.  Well, I've got a question about net neutrality that I've been wondering about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe you guys could shed some light on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Before you talk about that, Andrew, let me point out that in this telco bill,  there was going to be a net neutrality provision ensuring that the telcos would not charge Google extra,  were not trying to charge Carriers Extra for carrying their content.  That was thrown out by pretty resoundingly.  So that is at least the first defeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was like 250, 168.  It wasn't that resounding.  And it was pretty much the skill on target.  It's the first defeat for the net neutrality forces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say, well, we're not done yet.  We'll go to the Senate next.  But it is a defeat for net neutrality.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I saw on Lost Remote yesterday about the case where it looked like,  I can't remember if it was AT&T or Time Warner, somebody was blocking Craig's List.  That was Cox Interactive blocking Craig's List?  Yeah.  It was a bug in their soccer.  It turned out that it was a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but on TechMeme, it says that they did it, so it must be true.  And it was the number one story on DIG, so it's true.  Just like AOL blocked those free...  Yeah, AOL blocked the people who wanted not to use GoodMail,  except they sent their email, the punchline of that was,  the EFF sent an email without permission from the users they sent it to.  They just all put their emails together.  So they basically spammed to say, don't allow AOL to use anti-spamming techniques.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So what I noticed was my feeling, it was the first time where it sort of was like,  there's a gleaming example of exactly how it could work.  Precisely the problem.  And then as soon as everybody sort of jumped on Cox and was like,  what's going on? How could you do it?  And then they're like, oh, we had a bug. Sorry.  Whether or not they did or not.  What's this?  Okay, hold on.  This is a quick question.  Here's my question.  Let's say one of the major telcos says, we're going to go ahead and set up our tiers.  If you pay extra money, we'll give you everything.  If not, we're going to give you this limited service.  Why wouldn't that prevent the competitor to come along and say,  we're going to give you everything for this price?  The competitor is in bed with these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This whole deal is a sweet deal.  I agree with you.  They're in collusion.  The market would take care of this.  I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep in mind, these guys own the last mile distribution of your house.  So like I have cable modem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What am I going to do to replace that cable modem?  Get a phone line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on where you're at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some people don't have an option.  Some people have the option of cable, DSL, Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're experimenting with WiMAX, right?  They're coming out with huge numbers of communities.  So those people don't have an option.  Or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mind and my head has not.  It's not available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just telling you, these guys collude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no evidence that it's going in the opposite direction.  It's going in the direction of a very few sources for getting connected.  And those guys all work together.  They have lunch with each other.  And they basically collude.  And that's what's going on.  So you think that that won't balance itself in that case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You think it's too elite?  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the fact of the matter is there's reasons why they don't.  Whoever heard of net neutrality like a year ago?  I never heard of this term until recently.  It's only cropping up because it's becoming apparent that something like this is needed.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When Bell South is sitting up and going, we're going to basically segment.  We're going to have preferred tiers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there's this weird mix of you're watching.  You've got a bunch of engineers who are going, actually, we wrote a paper that said we can't actually deliver all of the bandwidth we've sold to anybody unless we like quadruple the price  because we can't give the service unless we charge everybody like, you know, OC3 connections.  We have heard of net neutrality before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was legislation of the telcos back in the 70s, 60s, 70s when they had a monopoly on how we called each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jason, you're in an interesting, AOL is an interesting position both as a content provider and as one of the big internet companies.  As one of the big internet service providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and we're for net neutrality.  Do you help each other internally?  No, no.  I think everybody, you know, I think that this issue is if anybody's too heavy handed, the market will correct itself.  That's one of the great things about it.  I don't buy that as a monopoly.  If you squeeze, I would not, if I was one of these telco companies or a cable provider, want to jump.  I wouldn't push one on one push Microsoft, Yahoo and Google because Yahoo and Google could say, you know what, we've got billions of dollars too.  We're going to Wi-Fi all the major cities and we're going to give away for free and we're going to do it just to screw you.  And that's what I was wondering.  We're going to do a marketing campaign about the free web.  Well, and these guys are going to start getting really hit hard.  But that takes time.  So there's going to be distortion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not going to take time.  There's always distortion in any free market.  That's backed up a second.  But I think Google is much farther along this road than any other.  Well, why do you think they're doing Metro Wi-Fi?  Metro Wi-Fi is their poison pill.  They've got Metro Wi-Fi.  That is their poison pill.  They've got these famous data centers in the parking lot.  They are doing it in order to send a message.  I'm not going to argue that.  So why would they be doing these big data centers?  Here's why the problem.  Here's what you're overlooking in this.  When Philadelphia tried to go Wi-Fi, the first thing that happened was Verizon and Comcast got together with the governor.  No, no, no, no.  It's OK.  But the law that's passed and that started in Pennsylvania because of Philadelphia and has passed in 11 states, as long as it's not the municipality doing it, anybody can come in and do it.  The fact that they can even get a law like that through means they can get even more onerous laws through.  And that's what they're going to do.  That'll keep Google out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why the net neutrality debate is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even if no legislation happens.  So that people are aware of this as an issue.  And I think that if the public doesn't get it, they're not going to fight for it.  It's much easier to screw the citizens of every community in Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia.  It's much harder to actually screw over somebody like Microsoft or Google.  They have much better lawyers.  Yeah, tell that to Microsoft after the death they trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have more lawyers than most of the companies I've worked for.  Left and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Poor guys do have all these lawyers because it's one thing after another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, they were pushing it pretty hard for a pretty long time.  I'm not saying they didn't deserve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got to ask you guys, what did you think of the new Microsoft Flexco proposal?  This is basically selling computers like cell phones.  You get the computer very cheaply, but then you buy minutes and you have a little card that you scratch off.  I hate that idea.  Wait, I'm sorry. This is a joke, right?  This is not a joke.  Introducing Microsoft Flexco.  Donnie, you're talking about the idea of the onion?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.  What happened?  Cell phones is a stupid idea?  This is the backer of whatever.  The cable box is a stupid idea?  We've got Microsoft's propaganda here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you explain this to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Until now, people in emerging markets have faced two formidable financial barriers to PC ownership.  The first is the high entry cost in markets without widely available consumer credit.  So it's not for us, it's for third world nations.  The second is the often high fixed monthly loan payments required to finance a PC  combined with uncertain paychecks from month to month.  These are not close to the MIT $120.  They held up.  Nobody wants to...  This is a wind-hick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not going to work.  The little... I can't even think of it.  The ultra-portable PC.  The UMPC.  This is what's affordable.  No battery life, no middle-end charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like seven times as expensive as the market in MIT.  When I was over in China, what was everybody using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cell phones.  That's what the emerging markets are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's one of the fundamental arguments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cell phones is a different experience.  More than half the world's people live on $2 a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the night spent on a Starbucks latte coming over here.  Hey, Scobel, you don't have to throw around all your weight over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know that you're ordering $6 lattes.  We know you've got all that Microsoft cash.  I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to let me near the money machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The survey says iPods are more popular than beer on college campuses.  This is a global mail story from Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, the Canadian headlines you bring out.  Beer and iPods. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, was that MIT's campus or every other campus on the block?  It says every campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a survey of 1,200 students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's like the last time anything was more popular than beer was 1997.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The internet was more popular than beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  iPods were more popular than sex.  It's like the Nielsen writings. It's scales. It's mathematics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's everywhere though. That headline is all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at here. Seven people are deciding what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everywhere. I've seen that headline before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's scary how those polls can work like that.  Wait, wait, wait. Is there a student in the audience?  Presidential polls and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the way you have to do this is on a Friday night, you have to put,  everybody put their iPods out and then have a keg of beer.  And then you just see kegs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're Nate Lifter, you're in the audience.  Yeah, we're not worthy. We're not worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dave Weiner, who you can't hear because he's off the mic.  Dave Weiner is taking pictures of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're here talking about podcasting and blogging and the guy who invented it  is hanging out in the galleys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give the microphone to Dave. Come on over on that side.  Come around.  We've got people to do that.  We've got predators here to do that.  But we'll get Dave Weiner over here. I think that's pretty cool.  Can somebody drag Dave or drag a microphone over to Dave?  Next story.  Windows Genuine Advantage phones home after the Microsoft guy's gone.  Did you see this story? Duh.  People are a little concerned because this Windows Genuine Advantage every day,  apparently, is checking with Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have fans of making sure you comply with the licensing and keeping steep tabs on the customers.  It's no big deal.  They just want to see if you've been stealing software or music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might be interesting to see if you're maybe meeting the people you should be meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Scoble wanders up and the question about Windows going home comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want to put him in an awkward position.  Did you see Office 12?  I haven't seen it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty dramatic.  Bill Gates showed it at the D conference last week or the week before.  It's very funny to watch Bill Gates.  He was very combative in the interview.  Although he's more mellow these days.  Every time Walt Mossberg or Paris Swisher would ask him a question, he'd go,  OK, the way you ask the question is wrong.  Let me rephrase the question.  And he'd rephrase the question for them.  And he's talking to two really brilliant people.  But he actually made every question better.  Well, that's good.  And that's how brilliant he is.  But then he showed off the Office 12.  And it is very slick.  And it's beautiful looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually really easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's really easy to use.  And I looked at it and I said, wow, it looks a lot like OS X.  It's starting to look more like smooth and windowy.  I think we're going to see.  Friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The time will come, and we'll probably later this year, when we start getting people saying,  oh, Vista, oh, what an ugly, how horrible, oh, Office, they took out the menus,  oh, my God, what are we going to do?  Because any time there's a big change, remember what happened when XP came out?  Everybody said the Fisher Price interface.  You get used to it.  The change is different.  Dave Weiner, come on, have a seat.  Dave Weiner's here.  Thank you, Leo.  It's great to have you here.  Pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you here for VloggerCon?  Yeah, of course.  I'm a video blogger, didn't you know that?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I want to be a video blogger.  And I do actually do.  I thought you shut your blog down, Dave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't shut it down yet.  OK.  So you're going to go in the flash of vlogging?  No, I'm just going to fade out.  I'm going to go in the flash of vlogging.  You know, like old soldiers, right?  Yeah, one day you'll go, oh, Dave?  Who is Dave?  I don't think that's going to happen.  Oh, yeah.  And I doubt very much that if you have anything to do with it, it'll happen either.  I can't see you going out quietly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will.  Believe me, I will stop, absolutely.  No.  No?  No, it's time to do something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm going to be back in the studio.  I'm going to be back in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to be back in the studio.  I'll be back for it, yeah.  I have to say I think that there's like a...  I don't feel like jumping on the building or anything like that, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is definitely a curve to blogging.  The number one factor we had at Weblogzinc, the number one challenge we had as a business was blogger burnout.  And somewhere in year two, or year three in Scobal will speak to this, you're just like, you know what?  Everybody shut up. I don't want to talk to any of you people anymore. I can't stand the viciousness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's happening with podcasting. We're kind of almost at that crux. It's almost two years old.  Podcasting's different, isn't it?  How is it different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you don't have comments, dude.  I think people just get sick of doing stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But where are they right now?  Yeah, I got hideous nasty comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got a lot of comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not here right now.  No.  But they're believing.  If they were here right now, there would be a pie or something.  It would be great because I could see them and I could hurt them when they say the wrong people things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my rule. When people write crazy comments, I say, listen, write whatever you want, but I have like my nephew reads this and my mom reads it, so keep it like civil.  I say the same thing.  And I say, also, if you want a rule of thumb, like if you wouldn't say it to my face, then don't say it on my blog.  Does this work, Jason?  And it works all the time. And then one guy says, oh, no, I'll say it to your face. I say, great, here's my schedule.  I'm going to be at this conference, this conference, this conference. I know you live in that area. Come say that to my face.  And the guy didn't say it to my face.  So I'll have to try this.  That's the Brooklyn rule. It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it works, I would like to do it. I just like the idea here. I hope you get this on camera.  Three of the most important people in blogging right here. We've got Scoble, Dave Weiner.  And somebody.  I just think that's pretty amazing, just the three of you sitting there. And I'm really thrilled.  And there's a bunch of video bloggers here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not about important, though. That's not what blogging is about.  It's a math medium. And it's not important to be a blogger. Blogging is important.  And the people who do it are important. And what they know and what they have to say.  That's why it's ridiculous to think of A-list bloggers and gatekeepers.  If there was ever a gatekeeper in blogging, they would just route around him instantly.  So we bring all of our 20th century values into this and try to figure out how does this rate as a 20th century medium.  But it's not the 20th century anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. And Leo, that same kind of sentiment also applies to the video blogging world, too,  where there's a lot more of this sort of... It's different than just pushing out content for money and entertainment.  You're all just a bunch of hippies.  Yeah. Damn straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a little bit to that. I think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But these kids are too young. Andrew, you're too young to be a hippie, right?  Yeah. I'm not a hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These kids are other than hippies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's about being authentic. I think that will be the last memory of blogging is going to be about authenticity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You said that in your blog. And I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The only thing that really works in blogging is authenticity. And it carries over to your life.  I found that when I was doing business before blogging, I was on point, I was on message a lot, and I stuck to the script.  You needed to when you had a magazine and stuff like that in the old days.  And now with blogging, I just don't care anymore. Life is too short.  I'm going to say what I mean in a field because if you live with that level of honesty and truth...  You have a toothbrush.  I feel like that. It's in Kumbaya.  But I feel like if you live your life like you blog with authenticity, you have a better life.  You have less to explain, you have less battling, and you're making a big deal out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dvorak is co-authentic and I love him for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I was 13, 14 years old, I was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak is not authentic, right?  He's authentically from Unchained.  He has like 80,000 people writing for him, right?  He's a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? You write all that stuff yourself?  Everything except when it comes to the books.  And I also have some guys blogging with me, but their names are very clearly on the post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that right? Okay. So that's not authentic then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John Dvorak is usually by me unless somebody did it.  Usually by me.  Or one of the Dvorak clones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would submit that John's voice is very authentic.  He's authentic.  You may disagree with what he says, but he knew sensors based on whether you're going to agree with him or disagree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To me it's not just about authenticity, it's about anybody can get access to readers.  Because 20 years ago I had to talk at CNN or CBS or MTV into airing what I had to say, and now I don't have to do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just go to a video blog tool, put up my video, and if I don't have any audience it doesn't matter. I put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well that's the point. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it matter?  So yeah, okay, you have access, but if nobody reads it, does it matter?  What changed in the last 15 years?  It matters.  It matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mother has a blog and not many people read it.  So she's writing for herself?  No, actually not.  Because when she writes her thing about, she's got this thing about buses leaving their engines on when they're parked.  So she writes this impassioned essay about that, and somebody else is passionate about it and looks it up at Google, and then they find her and they find each other.  And so you don't need a billion people reading it, you need the right people reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gotta be honest, that really pisses me off too. I'm gonna blog about it later.  And you know, this is how it starts. I bet you if every single person's panel writes a thing about how pissed off they are about it, somebody will stop, start, turnoffyourgoddamnengine.org.  And this will become like a big training thing that everybody will hit that blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got news for you. They didn't need to do that. And they now have rules that in her neighborhood, they have to turn the things off.  So she's been effective at doing what she wants to do, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kent Nichols is here, ladies and gentlemen. If anybody has a question for a ninja, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're asking a ninja?  Yeah.  Okay. I'm the ninja here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you like to sort of rotate some of us old timers out?  I don't know if we can get a ninth person on the panel.  We can do this anytime, you know. I mean, I'll make room for the ninja guy, okay? I'll see you all later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. Dave, it's great to see you. And on behalf of podcasters everywhere, thank you. There wouldn't be podcasts without Dave Weiner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say, you know, like with Dave, like this is one thing that doesn't come across in blogging sometimes is tone.  And like I hadn't met Dave in person. And Dave blogs with passion. Sometimes people say like, oh, Dave's a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's notorious for being, you know, ruffling pith feathers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. But then you go meet the guy in person and you never think that again.  And then the people who know me are like, oh, Jason's a cool guy. And then the people I never met who blogged.  That bastard.  Are like that **** has a whole lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, wait, you're a calcaneist? Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I didn't realize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is something that can be lost is tone in blogging is a problem. I will admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe we have the ninja here. I didn't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you actually the guy in the ninja suit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We work very closely with the ninja. So, you know, me and my partner Douglas Sarine, you know, we're, you know,  the international order of ninja chooses you. You don't choose them to do a podcast about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if people knew you were a ninja, you'd probably have to kill them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely. So, you know, like we're real, you know, we're real protective of, you know, the ninja.  And we're just grateful he doesn't kill us every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I were to ask the ninja to define blogging.  Now, here we go again.  Laporte said it again.  What would the ninja say? Define blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. It's like it's a real personal media. Like Douglas and I, you know, essentially we do the whole thing in my apartment.  With the ninja.  With the ninja.  He just jumps in the window and then jumps back out.  I'm sorry. I saw you black Macbook.  The ninja wants our Macbook.  Seriously, 17 years laptop, please.  But again, it's a real, it's a kick to us that, you know, 300,000 people every week watch us.  You know, it's a very personal expression where like I'll release the episode and I'll know that instantly there's no like there's no one above me going,  oh, that's not funny or this or that.  Like we get that feedback from the from our audience directly.  And like that's really amazing and really refreshing and brings kind of almost a theatrical quality back to, you know,  filmed entertainment where you get direct feedback, you know, instantly where before if you do television, you know,  it's months and if you do films, it's years.  And with video podcasting, it's like you get it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find that working in traditional TVs, I always think where I work at G4Tech TV in Canada,  that all the VPs are in one part of our building and they're all making decisions and not talking to you at all.  So you have no idea ever what they're thinking or what they're doing.  Whereas being in podcasting, it's so great because you make all the decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick and I found out that television executives actually do watch all the time, but they haven't watched with the sound off.  So there's no sense of content at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, with the people on the phone saying like, why does that girl look terrible?  Put more makeup on her.  That's what they care about.  Somebody told me a story about like Anna Mampour, the woman who does like.  Christiane Mampour.  Yeah, and they said the first thing when she was reporting on the war that one of the producers said,  this is somebody who works there, the first thing the producer said was tell her to get some sleep and put on more eye makeup.  She looks terrible.  That's the only feedback I've ever heard.  It's a war zone.  You know, like I may have said that.  They're like, are they asking that guy with the gray hair when he's in New Orleans, Anderson Cooper, like to put on?  Maybe they do.  They do.  He's a good looking man.  Good looking man.  He doesn't need makeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Working for a network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even more uncomfortable.  Is that all they have to do is talk about your high level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where's San Francisco?  Lighten up.  I think that that's really true.  And what underscores is the exact antithesis of what we've been talking about, which is that content and authenticity are important in this medium.  They are not important in mainstream television.  It's all about presentation.  It's all about how it looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But like that said, I still think a lot of people want to, there's a lot of debate in the community about.  Yeah, you're not really about content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could say.  Well, hey, screw you, buddy.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't deny the 2,000 years of storytelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  15,000 years of storytelling.  Exactly.  You know, that's why we have a clear beginning.  We have a clear middle and we have a clear end.  That's a story arc.  Well, it does.  I mean, basically, you know, when you hear that weird song and then when you say, thanks for your question, I look forward to killing you soon.  You know that that's it.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  That's a very good point.  There are some things, there are some tropes you cannot break.  Do you find that, Andrew, that there are things that you need to do that make it more television or more video that bother you to do that?  No, we don't ever think in that perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But, you know, here's how we're fishing around for definitions and trying to explain it.  You know what I think the best way to explain video and try to categorize it is in terms of distance.  Really, it doesn't matter where you distribute it, whether you distribute it over IP, over traditional broadcasts, you know, if you want to send it over a WiMAX tower.  But really, it's about where it's comfortable to watch, you know, and what platform like and that comes to distance.  If you're sitting on your couch and the TV is sort of further away, you know, like a nine foot distance, say, that's where you're going to sit there and watch content that you're going to share with people.  You're going to be relaxed and you're going to consume it.  It's not an interactive experience.  It's just sort of like a typical TV experience like we know.  People yell at the television all the time. It's pretty interactive.  The content that we're used to on TV is like that because it's catering to the person that's sitting at that distance from a television set on the couch.  Now, as soon as you get content that you're watching on the computer, that distance is only a couple feet.  And in that case, when you have that close of a distance, you're in an interactive position typically, at least with the computer.  And you're not going to sit there for an hour. You're not going to share it with your whole family.  It's a personal consumption of a shorter thing.  Exactly.  I can't watch a TV show.  And now let's move to even a closer than a computer is what?  Like an iPod or a watch or something where it's like a one foot distance.  And in this case, of course, the content works even better when it's shorter, like a cell phone content really short and quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you. Because this is one thing that radio has known for years.  And this is the difference between radio and television, which television is more distancing.  Radio is very intimate. Audio has always been very intimate.  You listen to it directly into your head. And we do long form in radio all the time.  This is a long form show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I listen to your show, I get intimate with my people.  Thank you.  Oh, too much information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see these as two very different meetings and two different kinds of experiences in which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why you have links at the bottom, right?  You watch Rocket Boom and the links to what you talked about are there.  It really is like you're doing a little zeitgeist.  You make money.  No, no, no. Those are editorial links.  They have links of what they talked about in the story.  So you start with Rocket Boom. You see Amanda.  And she's cute and she's funny and she's witty.  And boom, it's over. And now you go on your adventure.  So it's almost like a tour guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Our intent is to take that information that's out there and compact it into enough to where it's like a headline.  And then if you're interested and you want to get even more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can be short because you're really giving people richness down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think what I was trying to get at here is that really content is defined mostly by what platform it's created for.  The furthest distance is the silver screen.  And that's a two hour thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What really reminds me of most is cable access.  And I don't mean that in a derogatory way.  Cable access was incredibly innovative.  It was authentic.  It was authentic and real.  And what it lacked...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially in New York City.  Well, yeah, New York City was a whole special place.  Robin Bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I was flipping through channels during the night and Wayne's World came on.  And I watched the whole thing from the beginning down and I said this is what it's about.  It's about people doing it with passion, authentically, and not for money.  And it's economics that is one of the drivers here.  You're not doing it for money, but all of a sudden you guys are making a living.  And that is, for a lot of people, success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But those numbers, they should be making more than a living.  It doesn't need to, though.  Imagine making a living for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most people aren't at the stage in their career where they become a personality like you are or a business person like I am.  These people are at the point at which it's like, oh my God, I left my day job.  That really sucked.  And now I work three hours a day doing something I love and I make more money on my underwear.  This is great.  And that's the fact is, let me tell you something.  When you're a mainstream media company, you can't compete with the passion of somebody like that.  That's why the mainstream media can't compete.  That's why you guys are number one and they're number two on iTunes, right?  It's passion.  We're number four and they're somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever.  Well, iTunes is just a tiny fraction of our audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And iTunes is not measuring overall distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's measuring how many people have signed up for it.  Okay, that's why these guys are doing more than MSNBC does at their peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  I mean, that is mind-blowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what's weird to me is that MSNBC and these other guys must know this.  Do they ever think about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're the VP of ABC News, like cited Askeninja as a direct competitor to it.  And it was just like, you're joking.  You're a billion dollar company.  I would like to see Askeninja and Keith O'Brien go at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was Bernie, a guy who I know as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And everybody in the mainstream media, they are getting it actually.  And they learn their lessons a lot from the MP3 days when...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you think the executives are getting it or is it just the smart kids that have to be working there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the executives are getting it too, believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why Major League Baseball says, Sling Media is stealing our signal because they're allowing you to watch Major League Baseball in another city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what the number one consumer of bandwidth, video bandwidth in America is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's Major League Baseball.  They blow out more megabytes of video than anybody else in the country.  More than YouTube?  Yes.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, for YouTube's sake, the major league baseball is making money hand over fist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We have a larger audience per day than the National Hockey League has in America on a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not impressed, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a business guy, let me give you a piece of advice.  You never compare yourself to NHL.  That thing's on the break of going out of business, okay?  MSWC? Great comparison. NHL, terrible comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just think it's fascinating because what they did to the hockey games, that support, it's just amazing.  People have a limited amount of time to spend with media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can consume more now because they have no downtime with the video iPod, whatever,  but there is a limited amount of time and blogs will be 20% of the media pie.  It's got to come from somewhere.  Blogs will be 10-20%.  It's got to come from somewhere.  Let me tell you something, 10-20% of people's time, that's a hell of a lot of time,  which means there's a lot of market and there's $1.5 billion a year in extra advertising coming into our medium.  That's in addition to what's already come in, the 8 or 10 billion a year.  There's not enough inventory for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the demand, we've been hearing from everybody.  There's infinite inventory.  No.  I'll tell you why there's bad inventory right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Advertisers do not want to put their ads on a MyFace page.  That's not it.  Quality inventory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, the traditional inventory, like all of the Turner media and everything that's ever been produced in the history of humanity,  it would be so easy to throw online.  It's not time for that yet because people are not sitting at a computer and consuming that kind of data so quickly.  MTV is the only broadcast company that's been to a traditional company that's had short little clip type content that's easy to consume on these various platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll be working at a major media company within five years, I guarantee it.  And at major media companies we'll be doing this more than we want for the five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If any guarantee would be a collaboration but we won't be co-opted or sold out, I can tell you that.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, anybody got a time stack?  We have a very good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, no, actually I've studied how you've created your blog network and I actually use you as an example a lot about a lot of things that we would do differently in terms of how we're not interested in flipping it.  We've already been through the venture capital stage and we've passed it without needing it.  So what do you want?  That makes you get even more money by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can be authentic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are people who make indie films their whole life for one or two million dollars and that's fine.  Is that what you want to be?  People want to make a blockbuster.  It happens.  But nobody makes blockbusters with an indie budget.  But see what's happened there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And this is what's so exciting.  The thing that's so fascinating is that say with your particular business, it required just like almost every single business, it required venture capital.  We didn't have venture capital.  In order to scale it up to a large scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even Microsoft didn't require venture capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't have venture capital and we raised a very small amount of money from Mark Cuban and myself.  You raised money for it is the thing.  No, no, we raised a very small amount.  Let me tell you what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You didn't raise anybody, you raised a small amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We raised a small amount but we never used it.  We never actually touched it.  This was so profitable.  That small amount of capital that Mark Cuban gave us and it was under a million dollars.  And the small amount I put in, we never actually touched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This cracks me up because Jason isn't old media for crying out loud.  Weblox Inc. is far from old media.  But I love the fact that I'm the man now by the way.  You're the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was 18 months ago.  Let me tell you something.  You don't have to compromise your integrity.  We sold the company.  None of our bloggers have ever been edited to this day.  And that was part of the deal and we sold it.  You can do the same thing with yours.  Well, let me ask you, Andrew.  What's your vision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, our thing is that our primary interest at this point is sort of has two stages.  I mean, this is just in our dreams.  Who knows what's going to happen but this is how we're directing.  And the first stage would look something kind of like what Jason or Nick has done with their blog networks.  Where we have a lot of similar types of niche video content that shares resources  and does a lot of cross promotion and all that kind of stuff.  That's only just the first stage though.  The second stage really includes a lot of the one thing that we've noticed.  Even though we're really interested in just creating the content in the midst of Rocket Boom  and going towards starting to create other content.  There's all of the auxiliary things that we didn't realize that we'd be doing.  Like creating an ad department suddenly.  Like now we could easily just push that off but by creating it ourselves we're ingrained in it.  Because as publishers we're publishing the advertisements.  Same thing with licensing.  You're not answering my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not saying what you want to do, how you want your business structure to be.  What's your vision for your business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The vision then as a result of all these auxiliary business opportunities  and business support systems that we weren't expecting that we would be getting off into.  We're seeing the whole entire thing looking something like Lookout Rupert Murdoch.  You want a network.  I mean, but a network has basically like a needle and a glomer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you become Rupert Murdoch, get a second hit under your belt.  All of the structures that you've built are commodity structures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all about the people that you and the talent that you bring to it.  We're launching a new video podcast on Sunday with a mainstream television personality behind it  because she's frustrated by being on mad TV and not getting her voice heard.  It's not about who can control the video camera or who can edit or all that.  It's just finding those voices and giving people a medium to agree with.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's everything we were talking about blogging and how blogging is sort of more grassroots  and it's more personal, that sentiment that we were saying you can also apply to life.  You can apply that to business, especially in this particular scenario.  So you want to be Rupert Murdoch with heart.  I think that what we can do is we can...  There goes our Rupert Murdoch deal.  Hey, I mean, it's ridiculous.  Everybody's going to roll their eyes when you say that.  Would Rupert Murdoch be Rupert Murdoch without heart?  That's the potential.  I've heard a lot of entrepreneurs...  No, that's a legitimate answer.  Give us a break.  I mean, everybody should be able to dream.  That's a legitimate answer.  I think that's fine.  Opportunity is out there right now for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not like you're not showing signs of success.  I wouldn't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing you have to remember is, and I remind myself of this a lot, is just because you're first  doesn't mean that you're going to win.  And so you were the first and so you get a disproportionate amount of audience and attention.  And when I did Silicon Air Porter, I was 25 years old and I had bright eyes like you did,  and I got way too much press.  But then the hard work starts and you have to learn how to scale a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, Jason, if you look into what has been going on, we feel very confident because we've maintained it  for so long and we've been able to...  Do you have a second show yet?  Yeah, we actually just launched it yesterday.  What's it called?  Jet Set Show.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean...  It's a kid's show.  When you get 20 shows and you've got a couple million people, then it's a business.  Right now, you're at the start.  The other thing too is...  It's a big difference between those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The monetary value is so great too.  Like where it only cost us $25 to create the episode and now we're making $80,000 a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And typically when businesses start and there's no competition, there's great margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I disagree with you on some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For one thing, I don't think you have to be a mega company before it's a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can be a small, extremely profitable small company making millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like Home Star Runner, Red vs. Blue, those are all...  Absolutely.  Most people would be happy to...  He said he wanted to be Murdock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I was picking up on the Murdock thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to be Jason Caldani.  He's got a great dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's about to bark at you.  We'll see.  I would take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you'll get there.  The thing is, I lived through the down market when you couldn't get advertising.  It's a different game.  That's coming again, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's coming next month.  We're talking about blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not going to be next year.  I got to get this book done.  Why aren't you talking about blogs when you say you couldn't get advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm talking about just the advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Advertising can turn off like that.  Like some jerk off lights off a bomb.  The economy, the consumer gets a little less confidence.  The housing market.  There's a lot of tenuous stuff.  Everybody here is talking about being the next Rupert Murdock.  If you have no margins, you're never going to be the next Rupert Murdock.  If you were to get the whole advertising off, it can really get tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's another thing, too, though.  The moving image is the most powerful medium in the world.  You can win wars with it.  You can crash stock markets.  You can really...  Many have done the same thing for words, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's not powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who will be the Lenny Rep install of the video bloggers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a very intense medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To bring this back, though, you were talking...  Before, you were saying there's a six-inch experience, there's a 16-foot experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know a lot of people.  How many people are downloading movies off of a BitTorrent,  watch them on a computer, watch them on a notebook, watch them on an iPod?  Long format, short format.  It's either going to stick with somebody and they're going to keep coming back to it, or they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're in a transition time right now where we've got content moving around all over the place.  Screens are becoming more ubiquitous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if that's transitional or if that's how people want it.  I think that maybe how we want it.  It's changing.  It's a lot of stuff available.  YouTube, whether or not it has a business model, are they going to afford their bandwidth in the next year?  It's very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's very successful, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? If I offered all that software for free, I'd have a big long line, too.  Yeah, I don't see how they're going to make that money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the flip side is the demand for these viral videos.  Millions of people are watching these or forwarding them around the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and they're showing them in your email box seven times a day.  People are going to enjoy it.  They're going to enjoy short formats.  They're going to enjoy long formats.  None of that's going away unless peak oil hits and we're all running around.  All these video formats are going to be available on all platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People watch DVDs.  I'm watching V for Vendetta on my video iPod right now.  Every time I get in the pre-tour, I watch another half hour.  That's right.  I'm watching V for Vendetta. You know what? I like the acting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll watch a two-hour thing on my watch if I'm in the right place because I'm in a weird spot.  You have a watch that actually gets you.  No, no. But I just mean that...  I know. It's really far ahead.  It's really far ahead.  Stereotypically, I think the general long-form content is going to be more at that distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great to think that, but right now, how many millions of people are downloading V for V on a daily basis,  long-format videos?  The long-form is not going anywhere.  I mean short-form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I've heard this called short-form arguments.  Back in 1998, 1999, from Adam Films and a whole slew of venture-backed companies that had $40 and $50 million,  and you had nothing. You got more audience than they got put together.  That's right.  So there is some things to what you're saying. The video iPod has changed things, and broadband has changed things.  However, certain things, the long-form format, the 30-minute sitcom, those things are in great.  They're not going to go away.  No.  And shorts are not going to wipe those out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. No, but those will be continued.  In fact, they wouldn't even put a dent in it.  Exactly. I agree. In fact, it's going to actually grow all of that content even more.  It's just that those will mostly be watched.  Like if you're going to sit down and watch something for an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, at Microsoft, I do these hour-long commercials basically, and I get tens of thousands of people watching them,  and all my coworkers are going, that's too long. I can't watch this stuff.  I go, yeah, but our best customers care about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you show them what you do live stream, and there's like 96% retention for the entire thing.  You know what I mean? It's amazing to watch some of that.  We are running out of time. I really want to thank everybody for being here.  We have to fit on a CD, because AOL apparently can't figure out how to get it moved over digitally.  Yeah, CDs only hold so much, and that's us.  I'm not kidding.  Oh, really?  Yeah, part of it.  I know what we're helping you with.  When we do it right, they say the CD is full of it.  I think he knows people who know Stable.  No, no, well, we'll talk.  We've got to get everybody Blu-ray, right?  Part of the content management system at AOL, when they move this over to the AOL radio side,  they have to burn it to a CD, so we have to fit on a single CD.  And also, many of our listeners like to keep it down to under 80 minutes, so I think we should do that.  I really want to thank you all. It's been a fascinating conversation.  And I think really we just got started. There were so many great voices here, and I'd love to do this again.  Andrew, I really appreciate your time.  Thanks for having me.  AndroVar, rocketboom.com is a great video. And what's the new one? Jet?  Jet Set Show.  Jet Set Show. Is that at jetsetshow.com?  Yep.  That's great. And it's for kids?  Yep.  How about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, actually, our correspondent Zadi, who lives in Los Angeles, she and her fiance have mostly put this one together,  and Amanda and I have been kind of executively producing it.  And we released the beta, and actually everybody's freaking out and saying they don't understand how this could be geared towards kids.  And in some regards, that's good, because we wanted it to be a really sophisticated kids' show.  How do my kids look at it?  We have a lot of work to do, I think.  Great.  We need more feedback from people to say, no, no, yes, yes, so that we can, we've been sort of in an isolated world,  so it'll be nice to beta.  I'll put a link on our page so I can go.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Andrew. John C. Devorak, it's been the word slash blog.  Devorak.org slash blog. It's been great.  We'll go back to talking about news next time, but this was a lot of fun.  Actually, next week we're going to be at Yahoo doing the show.  Yeah, I won't be here next week, so I'll see you the week after.  We'll see you the week after, and then everybody will be here.  Everyone can be listening to me in two weeks.  In two weeks.  Amber MacArthur, of course, is very visible on the net at commandn.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, and ambermac.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ambermac.com, and of course, The Torrent Show, which you're filming here in San Francisco for Canadian TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Inside the Net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Inside the Net, which we do on the Twitter network.  Call for help on Google Video now, so that's exciting.  And it's on Google Video.  Yeah.  If we get the server working.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on.  They have a problem.  Let's go shopping.  No one knows better than Patrick Norton about that.  dl.tv.  My Heart Flashed.  You push a lot of megabytes out.  Yeah, terabytes.  Terabytes.  It's getting really interesting, actually.  Yeah.  We've got to find out where Andrew's getting his cheap sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you wouldn't.  Throw it away, Andrew.  We've got to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jason Kalakannis, it's always great to read your blog.  And now to get you on Twitter.  I'm thrilled you were here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thrilled to be on the show.  I've been waiting for a long time.  Well, anytime.  You're always welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this episode 58?  It took us 57 episodes.  We finally got you on.  That's huge.  And I really appreciate your time.  Where's the best place to go to read your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kalakannis.com is my personal blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's well worth reading.  I read it all the time.  C-A-L-A-C-A-N-I-N.  You got it.  And Eric Nichols, ask a ninja.  I'm sorry, what?  Hey.  Hey, Leo.  Who the heck is Eric?  Seriously.  Seriously.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, the ninja stopped by briefly.  Did you see that?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this guy.  Why do I got to sit next to the ninja?  He could kill me at any moment.  I'm going to flip out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to do it.  Call me Eric again.  The ninja could throw me right off the balcony.  How about a toothbrush?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll feel better.  He could kill me with that toothbrush.  I apologize, but I'm so glad you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We love Ask a Ninja.  Everybody loves Ask a Ninja.  It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the new one's going up on Sunday.  Hopeisemo.com.  It's a funny podcast about a sad girl.  About an emo girl?  Yeah, about an emo girl.  My daughter is an emo girl.
