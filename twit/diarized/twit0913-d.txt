Start time: 402.58
End time: 497.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Tuesday and it's a global thing all over the world.  Connectsafely is the host here in the U.S. and we've been doing it since 2014.  We had Kamala Harris at one of our events.  We had Chuck Schumer.  We had superintendents of schools.  But this year, we talked about this last time I was in your show, we funded a bunch  of schools to do their own events.  So and it really worked out well.  We're going to reach 25,000 students, you know, nationwide by giving some money to educators  to do their local events.  But people here can still participate.  We've got a live virtual event on Tuesday the 7th at 730 Eastern, 430 Pacific that we  are co-hosting with the National PTA.  Really great for parents.  The other thing we've done is we put together a ton of videos at saferinternetday.us or  you can go to Connect Safely and find a link there to saferinternetday.us.  A ton of videos with like the chief scientist of the American Psychological Association  talking about mental health and well-being and, you know, folks from the Cyber Bullying  Research Center and one of the that in fact, that's a picture of Britton Heller, who's  an expert on the vet on the metaverse.  Just a ton of videos and the idea that families can watch these videos or have conversations  Tuesday night.  We give you discussion points.  It's the internet in the box.  Those are our sponsors.  So it's an opportunity just to talk about, you know, are you spending too much time online?  Are you spreading misinformation?  Are you forgetting to watch Twitch?  I mean, all important things that everybody should be focused on.  Don't watch Twitch kids.  Watch Twitch.  Did I say Twitch?  Watch Twitch.  Actually Twitch is one of our sponsors.

Start time: 497.90
End time: 507.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitch is one of your sponsors.  So I'll give you, I'll let you go.  This, by the way, is an unbound book that maybe Connect Safely should get called Taming Gaming.  Guide your child to healthy video game habits.

Start time: 508.50
End time: 518.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly the type of stuff we publish.  Although we do, our guides are much shorter than that.  This is nice.  And we have quick guides that are two pages long and longer guides that are eight pages.  But we haven't done books yet.

Start time: 519.36
End time: 534.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, there's a section in there about what's legal and what's illegal on the internet.  So you've got like a whole sort of synergistic circle of twit hosts this afternoon on between  law, between safety, between publishing where we've got it all covered.

Start time: 534.30
End time: 544.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got it covered.  This is the Animal Crossing.  So this actually has game recommendations and then pros and cons, what ages is for,  stuff like that.  This is the Animal Crossing page, which is a great...

Start time: 545.02
End time: 591.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should send me a review copy.  We review books occasionally.  I'll hook you up.  I know the publisher.  Hook me up.  You know the publisher.  But anyways, everybody should tune in.  You should go to saferinternetd.us.  Don't go to the org unless you want the international event.  The US event is dot US.  And tune in on Tuesday night and have a conversation at home.  I mean, whether you use our materials or not.  If you've got kids, ask them what their favorite game is.  Ask them what their favorite apps are.  Just talk to them.  Don't lecture them.  Don't make it an inquisition.  Just...  And by the way, ask them about privacy and security.  They might not only surprise you how much they know, they might actually know more than  you do.  You'd be surprised how smart.  Denise, you've got an older teenager.  My guess is that he's probably pretty savvy when it comes to security and privacy, at  least the privacy that matters to him.

Start time: 591.94
End time: 595.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  They either know everything or they think they do.  Right.

Start time: 596.48
End time: 603.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He probably knows about privacy like keeping you from knowing what he's doing.  I mean, that's probably important to him.  At least it is to a lot of teenagers.  We were talking about...

Start time: 603.94
End time: 608.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somewhat.  But fortunately, we have a pretty open back and forth on that kind of thing.  I bet you have a great...

Start time: 609.04
End time: 611.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure you do.  And that's important.  That's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter was probably in fifth grade.  She was really into something called Neopets, which is still around.  This is 20 years ago, 25 years ago.  And I said, well now, honey, when you're online, you have to really be careful to be private,  not mention once...  She said, dad, I'm a 32-year-old guy from Detroit who drives a Camaro.  You don't have to worry.

Start time: 636.49
End time: 638.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good.  That's good thinking.

Start time: 639.80
End time: 724.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She also does something that now may be illegal.  I don't know.  I'm going to have to ask our attorney.  She has my Netflix password.  She's in my family.  She lives a few miles away.  Netflix used to say, here's a tweet from Netflix from 2017.  Love is sharing a password.  I took Netflix...  Whoa.  I know.  I took Netflix.  Yeah, right?  That's only five years ago, six years ago.  That's not unreasonable.  I think that maybe they approved of it.  God knows I'm paying enough for that multi-user, multi-streams thing.  Netflix actually got in a little hot water because it leaked out what their...  Because they've been trying this internationally, but hadn't done anything about password sharing  in the US.  Their potential plan for password sharing leaked out this week to an internet furor.  This was on the Help Center page.  It said among...  Oh, now I have to get...  Now I've retracted it, by the way.  It said, Netflix account is for people who live together in a single household.  People who do not live in your household, which my daughter does not, will need to use  their own account.  And then they furthermore said, we are going to require that they check into your locale  at least once a month.

Start time: 727.14
End time: 734.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does check in mean?  Yeah.  Don't people have vacation homes?  And that's a problem?  Or you travel?  I don't think they enforce that.

Start time: 735.14
End time: 736.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So much for being a digital nomad.

Start time: 739.58
End time: 769.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The update to the plans was met with significant backlash.  Apparently a number of people were sufficient to scare Netflix.  By Thursday they responded and said, oh, that was an accident.  For a brief time yesterday, a Help Center article containing information that is only  applicable to Chile, Costa Rica and Peru went live in other countries.  We've updated it.

Start time: 769.54
End time: 770.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What have they got against those guys?

Start time: 773.58
End time: 774.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And screw the Chileans.

Start time: 778.40
End time: 792.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in those countries, they've been testing something called page sharing, where if they  notice that you're sharing your password, a thing pops up on the screen and says, oh,  I see you're sharing.  Well, no problem, but you're going to have to pay an extra $2.99 for that.

Start time: 796.77
End time: 805.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Have you ever added up your streaming bill and compared it to the old cable bill?  I think it's worse than the old cable bill.

Start time: 805.82
End time: 841.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's much more.  In fact, this is all calculated.  I got to point out, first of all, the cable companies knew this was going to happen.  They've raised their internet rates gradually to the point of nosebleed because they knew  that people would still need internet if they're going to cut the cord.  Meanwhile, the cord cutting services have raised their rates.  I was going to use YouTube TV until it got to $65 a month for basic cable, comparable  to basic cable.  That's the same price.  Plus, now I pay $20 more for 4K.  What's it like in the UK?

Start time: 843.11
End time: 851.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man.  So I would say it's not too bad in the UK.  So obviously we sort of pay the compulsory BBC license fee.

Start time: 852.54
End time: 857.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they have little vans going around town looking for unlicensed television sets?

Start time: 858.32
End time: 877.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The vans don't exist.  The vans are a prop.  I was going to say propaganda.  They're proper vanda.  The vans never have existed.  There never were those vans?  No, they've got no idea.  You're in a block of flats.  They've got no idea which one person in a block of flats is.

Start time: 877.66
End time: 880.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was propaganda that the BBC promoted.

Start time: 884.42
End time: 914.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we have that.  Disney is not too expensive.  You pay sort of, I guess, the equivalent of like $10 for that, sort of $15 for Netflix.  The digital only version of Sky, which is kind of the closest thing we've got to cable  here is sort of $25 maybe.  What absolutely blew my mind is I just subscribed to American Hulu for the upcoming March Madness.  In America?

Start time: 914.98
End time: 918.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just call that Hulu, just so you know.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah, no.

Start time: 919.63
End time: 934.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there isn't a British Hulu.  I subscribed to American Hulu.  It was like $65 a month and I was like, sheesh.  And all I do is watch one channel.  I watch ESPN and that's it.  It's the same thing if you're Google TV basically.

Start time: 935.22
End time: 937.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a basic cable basically.  They've just taken it over.

Start time: 938.54
End time: 940.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got direct TV.  It's similar.

Start time: 941.66
End time: 944.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, but didn't direct TV just lose the football?

Start time: 945.80
End time: 950.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  Yeah, they did.  I think Amazon has it now.  No, no.  Google bought it.

Start time: 950.82
End time: 952.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google bought it.  Yeah.

Start time: 952.90
End time: 959.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the good news is that I've got all of those services and that's why I don't have  any money left at the end of the month.  It doesn't matter.

Start time: 960.74
End time: 975.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a leak in the bank account, a big hole in the bank.  Really?  No kidding.  So I think Netflix might still go ahead with this, but it's good that they had such a strong  reaction to it that they had to say, oh, that was Chile.  That was Costa Rica.

Start time: 975.10
End time: 990.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the meantime, they're cutting back on their production.  Their less original series coming out.  I was watching a video podcast about this, a listening podcast yesterday about how Netflix  is really trying to go on the cheap and they're not going to be investing in as much great  content that they had in the past.

Start time: 991.80
End time: 1020.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they're just learning the really hard way that quality content costs lots and lots  and lots and lots of money and is cheaper to make reality.  And that's why cable went so heavily reality and why Netflix was so refreshing because  of all the premium content.  And of course, it's now nosedived in the wrong direction.  But it seems like that's just sort of one of a number of tech companies this week that  are all just having an absolute nightmare with sort of with money, right?

Start time: 1021.52
End time: 1043.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look at Discovery, Time Warner, whatever the hell.  I can't keep track of it.  But the owners of HBO have basically moved stuff off of HBO, selling it to free TV and  to be it's a Pluto TV.  Pluto.  Yeah.  Those are ads supported.

Start time: 1044.22
End time: 1051.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but the ads like every three minutes is a 10 minute advertisement.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  I mean, how much they inundate you with ads on some of those channels.

Start time: 1052.08
End time: 1062.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is this...  Well, you can guarantee that YouTube 60 bucks a month is going to be going up with a football  because YouTube is down, what, 8% this quarter in the Google earnings?

Start time: 1062.90
End time: 1091.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're still going to get, just to be clear, don't mean to scare people, next season when  it starts in August, you will still get your local football games.  Those will be broadcast on broadcast television.  The DirecTV had this NFL Sunday ticket package where you can see all the games on a Sunday  and they were paying a billion and a half dollars a year for it.  It really was a money loser.  The whole idea with DirecTV is, oh, we'll get all these new subscribers and that'll  make up the cost of this.  And it just didn't pencil out.

Start time: 1093.05
End time: 1099.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was also a terrible experience.  That Sunday ticket, the way that they framed everything was just like, was awful to watch.  Really?

Start time: 1100.76
End time: 1102.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you know?  Yeah.

Start time: 1102.80
End time: 1105.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, you know, you know.

Start time: 1106.34
End time: 1107.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you getting American Hulu again?

Start time: 1108.28
End time: 1116.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, you know, sometimes you stay in the US and you see these things on a Sunday, you know?  So YouTube...  When I'm located in a hotel in New York.

Start time: 1116.80
End time: 1163.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube got a seven year deal, a little more than two billion dollars a season.  Two billion dollars a season, which is less than the NFL wanted.  They wanted two and a half.  But seven years, that's a good deal.  And why would YouTube do it?  Because you will have to pay extra.  So they will have subscriptions and they're hoping that what it'll do is drive new users  to YouTube TV, which is, I mean, to be fair, is a pretty good system.  I like YouTube TV a lot.  And then they'll have the upsell.  They do a lot of upselling on YouTube TV, by the way.  You can get HBO and Showtime and everything, but you have to pay extra.  So yes, Sunday tickets starting in the late summer will now be on YouTube.  Apple was in the running for this.  In fact, Apple really wanted it.  But didn't...

Start time: 1164.02
End time: 1168.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you pay to just get the football or do you have to get the whole YouTube package  to get it?

Start time: 1171.65
End time: 1175.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think everyone's waiting to find that out.  I don't think they've said...  I think YouTube has officially announced it.

Start time: 1175.84
End time: 1261.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now it's, believe it or not, three to four hundred dollars a season for the Sunday  ticket.  I'm going to guess since the NFL probably gets a portion of that, that that's not going  to go away.  YouTube though, Google could subsidize it.  Right?  Although given that they just fired 12,000 people, I don't think YouTube...  I mean, Google is really in the mood to subsidize anything, including a lot of their own stuff.  Verily, Jigsaw, which was their kind of pro bono stuff, all suffering massive cuts, even  Area 120, which was Google's blue sky R&D, almost all of it cut to the bone in these  latest layoffs.  So all of these companies have decided at least for now, let's not spend any more than  we have to.  Which it got to hurt if you just found out that the parent company just gave DirecTV  two billion dollars a year for football games.  YouTube ad revenue, Alphabet did put out its earnings.  This is the week of earnings for a lot of tech companies.  They missed their Q4 earnings estimates, but the big one is YouTube ad revenue dropping  Not YouTube TV, that's YouTube proper.

Maybe I wasn't supposed to know that their tick their clone TikTok now averages more  than 50 billion views a day.  50 billion.  The scale of YouTube is mind boggling.  That's up from 30 billion early last year.

Although I am pretty sure just looking that when he puts an ad, when it's a promoted  video, it doesn't get in the for you page.  There's no promotion at all.

All of it is basically well, we see them on TikTok.  Let's get those creators over here.  And honestly, if YouTube's offering more money, a creator, I've talked to Henry about this.  I said, well, you should do it. He does the shorts.  You should do more shorts.  The problem is they're getting whipped.  Creators get whiplashed because then YouTube will stop paying them and the next one will  come along. And you every time you move, you leave your audience behind.  So I think Henry's smart enough to know that that's you can't chase that revenue.  So he does, you know, he doesn't worry so much about what he's going to get from creators,  funds or any of these systems and really just focuses on monetizing it as own.

And they also said they're going to fire a bunch of people.  Fire a bunch of people and a 40 billion dollar stock buyback.  So a lot of this is just, you know, hey, don't don't get scared.  Their revenue was up a little bit.  Thirty two point one seven billion.  They restructured charges for its family of apps segment and its reality labs unit.  So it's hard to say they did.  And this was a big number.  Top line number.  They did announce two billion daily active users.  That is kind of amazing.  Daily, daily, almost three billion monthly active users.

Famously, Microsoft told Paul Therotte when he asked them, why do you have ads in Windows?  Why don't you offer a subscription version with no ads?  And they said to do so would be tantamount to admitting that we're crapping up your Windows.  So maybe Facebook doesn't want to say, well, for fifteen dollars, you could have a real nice experience or you could just still have your crappy experience.  Revenue in the fourth quarter fell four percent from last year.  This is the down part we were talking about, Will.  Third straight quarter of declining sales.  But this is a big one.

Transcript:  Metta, the company, when I say the company, I'm talking Metta expects its total expenses in 2023  will be 89 to 95 billion dollars.  That's lower than they thought due to slower anticipated growth and payroll expenses,  maybe because they laid 11000 people off.  That would do it.  Data center construction going down.  And again, the 40 billion dollar stock repurchase plan,  it's a good way to keep your stock price supported.  That's Apple learned all about that.  Actually, this helped metta stock a little bit, which is good.  Apple did not have a great quarter.  Apple sales shrink as pandemic rally ends for iPhone makers,  says the Wall Street Journal.  Quarterly revenue down on Apple for the first time in four years.  Manufacturing disruptions in China meant it couldn't make enough iPhones to sell.  That, I presume, is turning around.  Maybe that'll show a better result in this next quarter.  Although Tim Cook once again invoked the headwinds, he said,  Good morning.  The wind was in our face for the fourth quarter.  Economic pressures.  Apple's revenue down 5% for the holiday quarter entering in December.  Well below analyst estimate.  Of course, I'm sure the stock did not get hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, interestingly, talking about, thinking about headwinds and tailwinds,  the interesting sort of noodle on the Apple revenue was that if you took out  the currency fluctuations and the varying weakness and strength of the dollar,  Apple's revenue actually grew year on year.  It was just the fact that the US dollar has been surprisingly resilient  to the rest of the world having a meltdown.  That actually it's meant they made slightly less money,  which is an astute lesson in currency hedging.

Start time: 2171.16

Transcript:  Yeah. But it's interesting though,  I think that Apple has just sort of decided that it doesn't really want  these huge personalities dominating its kind of its news cycles, its pressures.  And I think we've seen like the last, you know, even the last few announcements,  you see more and more VPs and SVPs from different bits of the company  standing up and giving these presentations.  And it seems to me like they're really trying to move away from like,  you know, Steve Jobs was always the icon of Apple.  And when Steve Jobs left, that was a huge hit.  Johnny Ive was sort of the next icon when he leaves.  That was obviously a huge hit.  It seems to me like they're sort of going more along like having a squad  rather than having just a handful of stars.

Transcript:  I think it's fair to say they felt burned in the last years by Johnny Ive.  That it was Johnny Ive who insisted thinner in the face of all functionality,  including battery life.  And he was the one who championed the butterfly keyboard  and would not let Apple get rid of it for years.  I'm pretty sure. I mean, we don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure.  Because as soon as Johnny left, it was like,  we're putting ports back on these things.  We are taking away the butterfly keyboard.  So I feel this is projecting, but I'm going to guess they felt a little burned,  maybe even by the cult of Steve Jobs.  But at least when it was Steve and Johnny, Steve could keep kind of a lid on it.  And Steve did seem to have a good eye for functionality and the right thing to do.  Johnny was designed. I mean, look at this nose.  I mean, talk about overdesigned.  Johnny was always doing that, right?  And I think that they felt a little bit burned.  So maybe that's why I think everybody agrees,  Evans Hankey was an excellent design chief.  But the fact that...

And you can see what Mark Zuckerberg is currently, you know,  he is absolutely spaffing up the wall at Facebook on this VR project.  Yeah.  It's not something that they would do at Apple.  I think there's a little bit more financial discipline there.

Right.  So he's got a good reputation.  I think, you know, one of the things they did, and Tim did this, to keep Johnny Ive,  who I think in some degrees was kind of the Steve Jobs legacy.  And maybe in some ways trying to preserve a little bit of Steve,  is he gave Johnny, put him in charge not of just industrial design,  but in charge of software, in charge of everything.  And I think in hindsight, that was a mistake for Apple.  Apple went through some bad years.  And as soon as Johnny left and they came out with Apple Silicon, their new chips,  this is a different company.  So, yeah, I can see why maybe they're saying,  do we really want somebody with that much power?

Transcript:  I missed last week's show.  Did you guys talk about the price cuts at Tesla at all?  No, you're a Tesla owner.  So my net worth just went down because I own a four-year-old Tesla,  which used to be worth $40,000.  And now it's worth about $30,000 because they dramatically lowered the price.  It's fine with me because I don't plan to sell it right now.  But I mean, but they really got a lot of people angry who had just bought a Tesla  to find out a week later that they could have bought that same car for $15,000 less.

Transcript:  If Elon is listening, if they would allow people who paid for the full self-driving,  which is now $15,000, if they would allow them to keep that software,  and if they buy new hardware, the way Microsoft does, right?  If you buy a new computer, you can keep Microsoft Office and put it on your new computer.  If they were to do that, they would sell a ton of new Teslas  to their existing customer base.  But there's like a $15,000 penalty to upgrade if you want to keep that full self-driving software.

Transcript:  So, Elon is a little bit in the news besides that because they...  Two stories.  One is that Twitter is cutting off free access to the API for everybody.  And there's some concern among Twitter users that this is going to get rid of some of the  things that made Twitter the most interesting.  Some of the automated accounts that people really liked at Twitter because they're going  to have to pay too.  And many of the people who run these automated accounts say,  yeah, yeah, we're not going to do it.  There's an example, BuzzFeed has an example of a Twitter bot called MakeItAQuote.  Are you familiar with this one?  Has more followers than me, half a million followers.  You can reply to any tweet, add the tag at MakeItAQuote, and then the bot responds with  the tweet's text overlaid onto an image.  But the guy who does it, 23-year-old German student named Daniel, said, I'm not going  to pay to do this.  He says, it's a step in the wrong direction.  Most of the API usage brings a lot of value to Twitter.  And even though I run one of the biggest bots on the platform, I'm going to consider shutting  it down.  Now, they still haven't said how much it'll cost.  I could see Elon.  Elon, there's no policy that's not changeable.  I could see him changing his mind saying, well, for you, whatever.  Sure.

Start time: 2825.64
End time: 2882.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think one of the things that's been sad about the whole API access thing, I mean,  quite apart from the fact that the tweet bot was my favorite client and is about a million  times better than the official Twitter iOS client, which is verging on unusable.  If you run multiple Twitter accounts from a desktop as a professional, you probably  use third-party software to manage the sort of flurry of DMs and replies and in-comings.  And by killing that API, they're really making it difficult for the people that they're selling  to.  Elon keeps saying, what's more advertisers?  What's more advertisers on the platform?  Great.  But if I'm an advertising agency and I run 15 different Twitter accounts, you need to  make it easy for me to manage them, not have to log in and out of the actual Twitter dashboard  30 times a day.  He really has not got the left hand talking to the right hand on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a bot called Pepito the cat who tweeted, oh, this change will kill Pepito the cat.  Pepito is part of Twitter history.  He posts quality content with great engagement.  And of course, Elon said, well, okay, I guess we could give all verified users access to  the API for posts like this, eight bucks a month.  I don't understand what Elon's at because he's not going to make enough money from these  onesie twosie, you know, small dollar amounts to make up for the $44 billion, $13 billion  of which is borrowed.  So I don't understand why he's screwing with it.  But you know, that's his to screw with.  Nobody can deny that.  The other story is actually a big victory for Elon Musk.  You remember the tweet, funding secured, in which he announced, apparently, lyingly, that  he was going to take Tesla private and that he had secured funding for that.  Well, it wasn't true.  He had sued Tesla for torchlighting 70 billion dollars in new CLRs.  But he will continue to do what he's done.  He'll set up Mr. Sir.  Will you archive the new diamond?  Will you use a needs站?  He was second?  Is it another person who wants to sell their latest parts to Tesla and to take all that  into account as well?  I've remained in contact with Mr. Musk.  You could tell us, Denise, there have to be damages.  I like real damages.  You can't just say, well, I was offended.

Transcript:  Here's the first tweet from Elon Musk.  This is back in 2017.  Am considering taking Tesla private at $420.  By the way, obviously a mean number.  Of course, he believes that.  He paid $5420 for Twitter.  So anyway, a share.  Funding secured.  Now, if you own Tesla stock, or maybe if you don't own Tesla stock and you look at the  price and you say, oh, I could make some money if I bought a lot of Tesla stock right now  because it's going to go for $420.  He settled a lawsuit from the SEC, paid $40 million, agreed to run every tweet by a  lawyer before, which he's not doing, I don't think.  In a second tweet, he said, investors support confirmed.  Only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote.  I think the later the facts of the case, I believe, were that he had in fact not.  I mean, he just made up the whole thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the crux.  Elon has gotten to the point, and I think this is what came through loud and clear from  what the jury did in this private shareholder lawsuit.  The jury basically said, we don't take what he says seriously.  You can't take what he says seriously.  They had to determine whether the statements that he made had a material impact on their  decisions, whether to buy sell hold, et cetera.  And they found, nope, it didn't because basically they didn't spell this out.  But I think what the jury's sentiments must have been is it's Elon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the judge said, no, you can assume that the tweet about securing funding was  not accurate. You can, jury, you can say we're going to stipulate it wasn't accurate.  So then the question is, if the market's response to that tweet was Elon's fault and  whether he and the board should be liable.  And as you say, we don't know exactly what the jury was thinking.  But after a mere two hours, which is pretty quick, it takes an hour to have to fill out  the forms, probably. The jury said, no, they're not responsible.  Musk's lawyer in closing arguments said, just because it's a bad tweet.  Doesn't mean it's fraud.

But more than that would require everyone to submit government ID  before they can set up a social media account.  Talk about privacy issues, security issues.  It would establish a database of young people in Utah.  And we all know that databases can never be hacked.  So it's a law that I personally in the name of protecting children  actually might harm children.  So we're kind of looking into this.  I'm just beginning to learn about it.  But apparently, there are hearings going on this week.  So if you're in Utah or if you just love Utah and I like Utah,  check out this SB 152.  It might be something that you want to do.  Check out this SB 152.  It might be something people might want to weigh in on.  Unbelievable. It is pretty unbelievable.  And they claim to protect children.  But first of all, doesn't a 17 year old have some free speech rights in America?  Does the First Amendment say something about you have to be 18 to enjoy the right  to, you know, access information or say what you believe in?

Transcript:  All right. I told him I wouldn't get political.  Sometimes you got to SB 152 Utah.  Let's take a little break. We will come back.  I have more to talk about with our wonderful panel.  But first, I want to talk about a great sponsor.  I got introduced to called Miro.  And I told him immediately, I said, this is going to you're going to have  this is going to be a challenge because Miro could be anything you want it to be.  So how do I describe Miro?  Go to Miro dot com. Take a look.  You can. It's like a whiteboard.  Yeah. But you could do so many things.  Flow charts, can bands, mind maps.  Brain writing, timeline builder.  If you're using if you're doing Zoom meetings,  you definitely want to use Miro to time your meetings, to have  to have polls in your meetings.  It is an amazing tool.  I want you to go to Miro dot com and check it out  because it's infinite, collaborative whiteboard gives teams  a space that lives forever, not like your whiteboard in the conference room  where you can just drag and drop insights and data.  And nothing is lost. Nothing is forgotten.  And the breadth of use cases for Miro is mind boggling.  You could build visual assets. You could present with Miro.  You can run brainstorms, cross-functional teams.  It's the perfect thing for a hybrid workspace where you have people at home,  people in the office.  If you're doing products, it's incredible for product teams.  One great product needs input from everybody.  That's where Miro can come in with its capabilities to democratize  collaboration and input for brainstorming.  Miro users love it.  But my challenge is how do I describe  what Miro can do? It can do so much.  Here's another thing you might want to take a look at.  Go to the Miroverse at Miro dot com.  This is a universe of of user created and contributed Miro boards.  Let me just show you a few of these. These are incredible.  For everything from icebreakers to calendars  to service blueprint template, I don't even know what that is.  Here's a midnight sailboat retrospective or a Beatles retrospective.  You'll like this one from the British government.  A Harry Potter retrospective  contributed by the UK government.  Isn't it nice to know what your government is working on?  All these templates are available to you as a Miro user.  And by the way, did I mention you can start Miro and use up to have up to three  boards for free right now? Valentine's Day love.  Share the love by writing a note of appreciation for one of your team members.  That's a nice idea.  This is the Miroverse, just hundreds and hundreds of great ideas  of things that you can do.  This is the problem.  It's hard for me to describe what Miro could do because I don't know how you might use it.  So start thinking about what you might use Miro for in your meetings,  in your product planning, in your design kickoffs.  It's just endless. It's visual. It's beautiful.  It's permanent. It's it's the largest board you can imagine.  Miro.com slash podcast.  Miro gives your team the chance to always stay connected to real time information.  And it gives project managers, product leads, a bird's eye view of the whole project.  So nothing slips through the cracks.  Go to Miro.com slash podcast right now.  And you can get three boards free to start working better.  I want you to try it. First three boards free.  Miro.com, Miro.com slash podcast.  By the way, we've been using it for our podcast planning.  It's great for podcasts, too.  Miro.com slash podcast.  We thank them so much for their support.  Let's see. Amazon came out.  This was a lot of earnings come out. Revenue below expectations.  But Amazon Web Services, a 20% sales growth.  I didn't mention that with Apple. Apple Services also big growth.  In both cases, these are annuities, right?  These are things people subscribe to and the cash comes in every month.  This is that average revenue per user kind of thing.  So Amazon Web Services, which is still the king of cloud services,  doing well, a little below expectations.  Advertising.  Did you know Amazon's business is advertising?  They made about half what they made on AWS with advertising alone  and above expectations, 11.56 billion dollars.  But it was their slowest year of growth  in a quarter century as a public company.  Revenue for the year increased 9%.  Oh, that's got to hurt.

The top result is the sponsored result. Right.  And that's what people pay for.  The great thing for Amazon is that, you know,  the AWS business kind of came out of nowhere  because, you know, it was the great idea to use the data center capacity they have.  But it's quite, it's high margin,  but obviously there's a lot of cost to running those data centers.  The cost of running the Amazon ad business is almost nothing  because you'd be displaying those listings anyway.  So the margin on it, even though it's a smaller business  in revenue size than Amazon Web Services,  you have to imagine that by this point, it's actually more profitable for Amazon.

Now, this is from the New York Post.  So I guess maybe you want to take it with a grain of salt, except it comes from a lawsuit.  A data scientist who worked at Facebook, George Hayward,  was fired in October, sued.  That lawsuit now has been shut down because like many companies, Facebook has  clause in its contract that says you have to go to arbitration.  You can't go to court.  But the lawsuit was up long enough that we learned about the cause for this suit.  Hayward, who claimed in a Manhattan federal court lawsuit, he was fired in November  for refusing to participate in something called negative testing.  It allows tech companies to, quote, surreptitiously  run down your mobile phone battery in the name of testing features or issues such as how fast their app runs and low power or how an image might load.  Hayward said, I told the manager this can harm somebody.  She said, by harming a few, we help the greater masses.  Hayward said, pointed out that killing somebody's cell phone battery is a risky business.  I refuse to do this test.  And it turns out if you tell your boss, no, that's illegal.  It doesn't go over very well.  He would have hired in October 2019, fired November 2022 because he refused to do the negative testing.

Start time: 4431.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could kill somebody if you can't call 911.  If you're phone guys, it could literally kill you as well, the better.  But why would they do it?  Would they actually bring it down to the lower?  Because that way they could see how their app worked in a low power phone.  I'm trying to think of the motivation for that.

Start time: 4444.50
End time: 4460.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's also I think it's partly how does things work?  How do different phones scale their performance and how does your app get impacted by that performance?  But also what new features that they introduce kill battery life quicker.  Couldn't they just buy a bunch of phones and test it in a lab?

I have never seen a more horrible document in my career, he said.  You know, I mean, we probably won't know the outcome of this because as a lot of companies, including  Twitter, I might add, have contracts that say you won't sue us, we'll go to binding arbitration.  Is that still legal, right, Denise?

Transcript:  Yeah.  When we were worried that we were going to get, remember there was a podcast troll and we  hired a very prestigious law firm.  And of course, they explained to us that all of these patent lawsuits happen in, what is it?  Is it Eastern Texas?  Tyler, Texas, because there's a judge.  Delaware.  Eastern District.  Eastern District of Texas.  Because there's a judge there who is very favorable to these patent lawsuits because he  believes, you know, these big companies are taking advantage of these small inventors.  And so companies go there and we said, well, can we get a change of venue?  Could we get it?  They said that's one often good strategy.  Sometimes companies are able to change the venue to a more favorable locale.  They gave us some interesting advice.  We were lucky because the EFF filed an intra-partis motion to get the patent overturned,  which succeeded.  We thought about doing that and our lawyers said, well, that's a double-edged sword.  If you win, great.  If you lose, you're screwed because now the jury has even more reason to rule against you.  So you can only do those if you're really...  So we didn't have a choice about whether the EFF was going to do it.  I was biting my nails, but the EFF prevailed.  It was also thanks to Adam Carolla, who raised a lot of money in a GoFundMe or one of those  and actually did go to court and defended it.

Transcript:  It was very scary because we got a letter, as many podcasters did, asking for millions of dollars.  Our attorneys laughed at that.  They said, usually they ask for a number that's going to be lower than the cost of defending it.  They've asked for so much money that you really need to fight it.  Of course, that was the attorneys who would get a lot of that money.  Anyway, yeah, that podcast troll went away thanks to the Electronic Frontier Foundation,  for whom I have been donating ever since.  Let's see.  Oh, here's another one.  Speaking of court cases.  The New York Attorney General has won a case against a company that sells tracking software.  Stalkerware, the bleeping computer calls it.  There's a guy, Patrick Hinchy, who sells software called, among others, Auto Forward, EasySpy,  DDI Utilities, HysterMobile, PhoneSpectre, SurePoint, or the properly named TurboSpy.  These are apps, you probably know a little bit about this, Larry.  These are apps that ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, parents put on people's phones that then spy on them.  They turn over location, browsing history, call logs, text messages, photos, videos, email activity,  WhatsApp and Skype chat, social media activity.  The idea is you can remotely monitor a user, in some cases even activate the camera or the microphone.

So snooping on a partner's phone without consent isn't just a sign of an unhealthy relationship, it's against the law.  Today we stopped several companies from illegally promoting products that allowed spying on calls, texts, photos, videos, emails and social media.  Henshin now is going to have to alert his customers' victims.  This is worse than the $410,000.  He's going to have to put a notice on all of these apps, pop up a notice on all the phones with these apps on them saying, you are being secretly monitored.

Because people were, you know, I mean, AirTags are amazing for keeping track of things, but people were hiding them in former spouses or former lovers' cars or handbags or pockets or wherever.  And then using that to track not just what they were doing online, but their physical location, which is super dangerous.  And Apple, you know, this became reported and Apple proactively then took the step of changing the AirTag tracking such that if an AirTag that isn't registered to your phone consistently pops up on your phone, near your phone for like sort of a couple of days in a row, it's like, hey, is that your AirTag?  Because there's definitely one that's kind of following you around.

Transcript:  And if you have any relation, any reason to suspect someone in your household, a partner, whatever, don't give them access to your phone because they can go in and turn on find my phone.  They can put such byware on your phone.  For example, I have what is the Apple thing?  Friend finder, right?  Well, that's great.  But I have a friend who I'm linked to who and I haven't gotten a notice in years, but I still can tell where that person is.  And luckily, we're still friends.

We I can know where she is.  She can know where I am.  And that's a choice we've made.  Please send.  And they do periodically send you a notice.  They periodically notify you, which is a good thing, because, again, you might have a relationship that could go south.  And it turns out that that person may not be as honorable as I suspect.

Because they used MDM, which requires putting a profile on the phone and giving it really breaking the phone's security.  Apple came to an agreement with Life360.  But yeah, Apple has.  So I have a widget on my front page of my phone with all my family members and I could see Lisa's in her car.  I could see where she's going.  She has the same thing for me.  But that's by consent.  And it should be by consent.  Obviously.  It reminds me in Harry Potter, they had a clock.  Remember the Weasley's had a clock that each hand was a member of the family.  And it would go around and tell you where the and I thought that was pretty cool that we could see where each other is.  And you know, I think that's a handy feature.

So I've received text messages, we all have, that are designed to get you to respond like, oh, gee, Dan, I'm sorry, I  can't come to work today.  My car broke down.  I hope you could find a replacement.  And then, of course, being a good Samaritan, you go, oh, this isn't Dan.  I'm sorry.  Do you need any help?  And then the person says, oh, aren't you nice?  No, I guess I got the wrong number.  And it starts up a conversation, which inevitably always leads to them talking about their very  big gains investing in cryptocurrency.  Oh, yeah.

Sophos said on Wednesday, they found two apps in the Apple App Store that were part of an  elaborate, this is from Dan Gooden's article in ours, part of an elaborate network of tools used  to dupe people into putting large sum of money into fake investment scams.  At least one of those apps was also in Google Play.  Sophos says first time they'd seen them in the app store, though.  Pig butchering, aptly named, relies on a rich combination of apps, websites, web hosts  and humans, sometimes human trafficking victims.  So there's that's something, another whole another part of the problem to build trust with a  mark over a period of weeks or months, often, Larry, under the guise of a romantic interest.  Or perhaps financial advisor, successful investor.  Eventually, the online discussion will turn to investments, usually involving crypto, that the  scammer claims to have earned huge sums of money from and then says, maybe you'd like to get a taste.

Transcript:  Once the market deposits money, the scammers, this is interesting to be aware for this, will  initially allow them to make withdrawals.  But eventually they lock the account claim they need to deposit as of as much as 20% of their  balance to get it back.  Of course, you pay the money.  Money's not returned.  Scammer comes up with new reasons to give them money.  The pig butchering term derives from a farmer fattening up a hog months before it's butchered.

And it doesn't it doesn't you know, it doesn't say that it's you know, for pig butchering,  obviously, usually has some value, not necessary.  This case, it was a QR code reader.  That's all QR code checker.  And the reason these get through the app store is because often they are completely benign QR  code checkers at first, but then updates slowly add features.  Another app was a little more obvious called MBM Bitscan, a real time data tracker for  crypto currencies.  One victim Sophos track dumped $4,000 into the app before realizing it was a fake.  Looks pretty normal, right?  It's just a crypto exchange.

Transcript:  Well, honestly, I mean, I don't it's too bad because if crypto had any benefit or value  or NFTs any benefit or value, that's long ago been, you know, hidden by the fact that  it's primarily used by scammers and you know, people like this.  I mean, maybe there's some hidden value deep within.  I'm not convinced, but I think we can safely say at this point, stay well away.  Our own Kevin Rose got hacked.  He got social engineered out of his squiggles.  You got to, you got to, is that an NFT?  Yeah.  You got to really hurt for a guy who, you know, he's got so much money.  He made, he and his consortium made $50 million selling these owls, moon, moon, moon  birds.  But apparently he, he also liked to invest and somebody social engineered him and stole.  Let me see if I can find his squiggle.  He says a really nice squiggle stole one of his squiggles.  It's worth thousands.  There it is.

And if you move out of an area or move into a different area, you get a refund  on the amount that you paid that you've now overpaid, right?  Because you pay sort of in six monthly advances.  And they sent me a check back for my refund and I discovered that you can,  if I open my online banking app on my phone, you can take a photo of the check.  And then it'll deposit it in your account.  Yes.  Isn't that wonderful?  Can I take several photos of it?  You can take as many as you want.

I, it's always a good time to do your shopping is during the Superbowl or  when the, anytime the 49ers are in the playoffs, it gets very quiet around here.  Everybody stays home.  Yep.  Our show today brought to you by express VPN.  This is the only VPN I use, the only one I trust.  And I'll tell you why this is the VPN you want to use.  So there's three reasons people like having a virtual private network  software you put on your phone, your computer, even on your router.  That routes your internet traffic encrypted through the internet to a  server somewhere else and then goes out into the public internet.  Well, three reasons.  One, of course for security, because if somebody's monitoring your traffic,  your internet traffic, they can't see what you're doing.  If you're at a coffee shop and a hotel, they can't see your traffic.  They just see an encrypted blob heading on out too, because well, frankly,  privacy is an issue every single time you got on the net with your personal IP  address, people go, Oh, there he is again.  Your internet service provider is probably the worst offender.  ISPs perfectly legally can collect all your internet activity and sell it to  data brokers or big tech companies.  They spy on you.  The third reason you might want to use it in case like Will Harris, you want to  watch American Hulu or British Netflix or the BBC.  It's nice to be able to say I'm geographically in the UK or in Japan or  in France or wherever you want to be.  We were in Mexico over the holiday and I wanted to watch a Thursday night  football, Amazon said, you can't, you're in Mexico.  I said, Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm in Miami now.  Thanks to express VPN.  And it went right through.  It really is a great thing to have.  Here's the one problem though, with a VPN that you ought to be aware of all of  those things, you're just kicking the can down the road.  So you've got to trust the server you're using that they're not spying on you.  That's why I prefer and use and recommend express VPN.  They take the extra steps to make sure your privacy is a hundred percent protected.  They have independent third-party audits on their technology, on their privacy  policy to guarantee that they are living up to it.  They actually go an extra step that a lot of companies wouldn't even think of.  For instance, all express VPN servers, and they're all over the world, run a  special Debian distribution that automatically wipes the drive and  reinstalls every day at startup.  So there's never any data collected.  In fact, even better, they run their special server server.  They've created a VPN server.  They've created called the trusted server.  They run that in Ram sandbox.  So it can't write to the disc.  So when you press that button on your express VPN app, on your Mac or your  PC or your iOS or Android device, it automatically spins up a server in  Ram can't write to disc.  And then when you're done, it's gone.  And so are, so are all the traces of your visit.  There is no way anybody could know you're there.  And we know this not only from the regular audits, but we know it because  from time to time in countries where they don't believe in knocking before  they bash down the door to take the servers, they've done that to express VPN.  And there's never anything on those servers.  We know you are private express VPN.  And the other thing is they invest in their, in their infrastructure.  So they rotate their IP addresses.  So they're always fresh.  They, they, they, they make sure they have enough bandwidth at every  server so you don't feel sluggish.  I know you've probably used VPN said, I don't want to use that.  That's slow, not express VPN.  And you can, you can actually watch HD video with express VPN and  you'll never notice the difference.  I know a lot of people put express VPN on their routers and you would not know.  Your whole house is now protected and nobody will say, Oh, why is it  slow because it isn't that's why express VPN is rated number one by CNET, by  wire, by tech radar, countless others.  Me too.  Express VPN.com slash twit, spell it out.  E X P R E S S VPN.com slash T W I T.  If you go there right now, you'll get three extra months free with a one year purchase.  I know you're going to say, Oh, I get a free VPN.  No, no, you really want to spend a little money because you want them to put that  into the infrastructure, keeping things up to date, working on things like that.  Trusted server technology, express VPN.com slash to it.  You want to know more?  There was a great article in bleeping computer last year, all about express VPN  and how their servers work.  It's really great.  Thank you.  Express VPN for your support.  Thank you for supporting us by using that address express VPN.com slash tweet.  We had a lovely week this week on Twitter.

Uh, I don't know what's gonna, what's gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, if, you know, if you have a copyright and something and someone has used it for  commercial purposes without your permission, you've probably got a pretty good case  against them.  Isn't it derivative though?

Start time: 6231.96
End time: 6237.06

Start time: 6238.84
End time: 6290.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, you might, I mean, yeah, derivative works are part of the fair use doctrine.  So you could come back and say, Hey, it's fair use, but a lot of factors go into  determining fair use, including whether it's for commercial use or not, or whether  it's for education, whether it's for news.  Um, so you'd have to go through that whole analysis.  The other thing that people can assert, and someone brought this up in IRC is if  they're scraping to get all this material, which yeah, exactly.  So, um, there are, there are ways you can prevent and not just physically block that,  but you can, you can have, um, lawsuits that complain and successfully, uh, get you  damages for people who have scraped if they've, if they've not just, if they've  damaged you from the material they've gotten, but they, you have to show their  impact on your site or service by doing that.

Transcript:  Right.  And, and I, I don't know if they're making you click on a license agreement  or not before you kick the tires on the thing and put it to use, but I'm guessing no.  Um, so I mean, the way that'll all go forward is if there's, you know, it  will depend on the licensing terms and just like the things that we use  technologically to create creative works now, uh, Microsoft word or, you know,  whatever, um, certainly Microsoft doesn't own your, your works that  you create in their products.  And I think that that's how this will have to evolve is that either there  will be an applied implied or an express license that you own the works that  you're creating using these tools.  But who knows?  Someone may decide to try and claw that back a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's basically a mansplaining engine.  Yeah.  Confidently wrong.  So I'm looking at the use, the, uh, user terms on chat GPT and it says you can't  use it in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates any person's  rights.  Uh, you can't, you can't, it looks like you can't, you know, try to reverse engineer  it.  Doesn't say anything about not, you may provide input, input and output content.

I mean, so many of these things that chat GPT is doing, like there's a great, this  great article in semaphore about why even the creators of open AI can't figure out  why it won't do certain things.  So in this instance, if you, if you ask it to write, um, a viral tweet that was this  week was, um, when asked to write a poem about the positive attributes of Donald  Trump, chat GPT refused to wade into politics saying that wasn't his job.  But when asked to do the same thing for Joe Biden, it wrote a poem.  Yeah.

This is scaring the hell out of Google, which calls this a red alert because, uh,  and they, you know, are right now testing a lot of responses.  Google's asking employees to test, uh, something called apprentice barred using  its Lambda technology, but Facebook said this, uh, young Lacuna is their AI.  One of their genius AI guy said, Oh, chat PT GPT is nothing.  We've got stuff like that.  Most of these other companies, unlike open AI are doing it in private.

Transcript:  That to be fair, I once had to, if we're, if we're into old, old technology  journalism stories, I once had to try and work out one earth.  I had an editor come back from a very, very traditional boozy English lunch  with a, with a PR colleague.  Filed this incredible copy.  He was like, I've got the greatest story.  I've got the greatest story filed this story.  And I had to copy edit it.  And when I looked at it, it looked like complete and utter gibberish, but complete  and utter gibberish in a way that sort of looked like it made sense.  And when I sat there and looked at it, I looked at it and I went away and made a  couple of coffee about half late.  I realized he'd written the entire thing.  One key to the right.  But it just been so drunky and noticed he just touched type the entire thing.  One key to the right.  And I transposed it all back.  And it was a great scoop.  ChatGBT could have done that.

Transcript:  You could just say, hey, transpose everything.  One key to the right.  Literally that's the probably thing I could have done.  So the verge has been really hammering CNET.  Now I think there's somewhat of this as an intramural war between two competitors,  but they've been hammering CNET.  We had Connie Guillermo, editor in chief of CNET on a few weeks ago on  Twitter when this story broke that CNET had used its own artificial intelligence.  I think they call it wordsmith to create 75 articles in their personal finance section.  She said, look, these are articles no reporter wants to write.  So we had the AI write them and then a human editor check them and edit them.  And then we put it out because no one wants to write these basic articles, but  we need them.  Then the verge said, well, okay, first of all, there's still plenty of inaccuracies  in these articles.  Second, it looks like Red Ventures, the private equity company that bought CNET  and a number of other sites, including the points guy and creditcard.com is using  these to create SEO friendly articles that yeah, no one wants to write them  because they're stupid, but search engines will come up with them as a search  result if you search for, you know, where do I get the best credit card rate or,  or the like, and so they're very lucrative for Red Ventures.  Now the verge is doubling down on this and this doesn't have to do with AI anymore.  The verge is saying this week that CNET pushed reporters to be  more favorable to advertisers.  Now, Connie was pretty hopped up about the verge taking aim at CNET.  She said, this is an overblown story.  This didn't happen.  I don't know how Connie or, you know, we've had Lindsay Turrentine, who is, you  know, now a big wig at CNET Red Ventures on the show too.  We have a lot of CNET people on.  I like CNET people.  I like a lot of these reporters.  I'm wondering how they feel about this.  According to the verge who says we have many sources under the  ownership of Red Ventures staff has been fighting to protect CNET's editorial  independence and rigor amid a push towards sponsored content and affiliate  marketing by its new corporate owners.  One staffer told the verge, everyone at CNET is more afraid of Red  Ventures than they are of AI.

Transcript:  Oh, this, I hate to be like the grumpy old man on this, but this is like the  story of running every media company of all time that relies on advertising.  Right?  It's like you've got one group of people who are the salespeople who are going,  Hey, I could really close this deal if there was like just, you know, just one  little thing, if you could say something nice on the site and all the journalists  go, no, get lost and all the advertisers people go, well, you wouldn't have jobs  if you, you know, we didn't bring in the advertising and all the journalists go,  well, you wouldn't have jobs if we didn't write all the content and it goes back  and forth and back and forth.  And it's literally been like this way since the invention of the newspaper.  I feel like the verge is just going like super holier than that.  I would wager a large chunk of money that there is somebody at the verge, right?  Which is also owned by a venture capital company, which is also, right?  It's the same everywhere.

Transcript:  A good company and I've worked at a few, including Ziff Davis back in the day,  we'll have a firewall between the Chinese wall, right?  The Chinese wall between, and we don't say Chinese wall anymore, but that  would, you know what I'm talking about.  Sorry.  It's the kong wall or whatever they call it.  No, the Chinese wall between editorial and advertising.  And I remember at tech TV, we were going to do a story on how to hack the  X-Box and the ad sales folks went crazy.  They said, Microsoft buys a ton of ads on tech TV.  And we said, well, what do you want us to do?  And to their credit, our management said, no, no, go right ahead with that.  They'll be fine.  Maybe they'll pull ads, which they did for a while, but they'll come back.  We don't want to have our editorial influenced and a good company will do that.  Yeah.  You know, there is a, you know, because we're a small company, I do the ads.  We don't make a lot of our hosts do ads, but the in-house hosts do ads.  You've heard me do it.  And we just, but we have some standards.  We don't approve advertisers.  We don't like, I say no all the time.  We always disclaim when we do a story that talks about somebody  who was advertised with us.  We say that.  And I will say, absolutely.  I always tell all of our hosts and you'll back me up on this to tell the truth.  It's not the advertisers should not have any influence over what we say or do.  And there've been times when that's been problematic, but, but everybody in our  company, and I would assume at a good company understands the editorial integrity  is what makes that company succeed.  If people start believing that your editorial judgments are influenced by  advertisers, you've got nothing to sell the advertisers.

Transcript:  You know, I can tell you, Leo, you know, I've been in this business probably  about the same time you have 40 years and I've worked for, you know, CBS,  I've worked for the LA Times.  They worked for the New York Times.  I've written for the New York Times.  I have never, ever been pressured.  I have never, ever been censored, but there was another CNET story.  And I'm embarrassed to say it was at the time, my same employer, CBS  owned CNET at the time when CNET pulled a product of the CES award.  Oh, I remember that.  Remember?  And Dish Network was in a dispute with CBS.  And as a CBS employee, many of us were very embarrassed.  I mean, the people in the newsroom were very upset about it was, you know,  whoever in the company did this.  Yes, it was blatant and they got slapped around for that.  So it's not the first time that they were accused of that.  But I'm not as cynical as you are, Will.  I mean, I do know that it happens, but I also know that there is such a strong  esos, that means the same argument I have with people who accuse the  mainstream media of fake news.  I mean, do they pick stories based on biases?  Maybe, but they don't go out of their way to lie.  And when they do lie, they usually, when they do, when there is an error,  it's incredibly embarrassing.  And I've made errors in print and I'm very embarrassed.  And I always insist on a correction.

And so for someone to imagine, you know, I find it difficult to imagine that it's  better or worse at any particular, you know, at CNET or the building.

Transcript:  It is, it is a fine line.  And I think what's changed in our lifetimes, Larry, is that thanks to YouTube  and influencers, this line has become more and more blurred.  And one of the, one of the accusations from the Virgin, again, I, I said it  upfront and I'll say it again, the Virgin is a competitor to CNET.  And so you got to take a grain of salt.  But one of the things they accused CNET of is a video, YouTube video, published  by CNET at C from CES, which was last month called Moen unveils innovative  smart sprinkler products at CES.  The CNET host takes viewers through the company's booth, interviewing company  representatives, testing products.  The video is an ad, but the host doesn't say that.  Neither does the video description and the title didn't include a disclosure  either.  Now, Denise has told us many times, you've been very good about this, that  the FTC looks frowns on this.

Transcript:  The only disclaimer was a small pop-up that YouTube inserted when an uploader  has indicated there's a paid promotion in a video, though CNET doesn't actually  specify what in the video is promoted.  After the verge asked Red Ventures about the ad disclosure was silently added to  the video's description.  The FTC is very clear that when, for instance, if I don't tweet about sponsors,  but when one of our sales staff tweets about a sponsor, they have to put hashtag  ad, hashtag sponsor.  They have to very clearly disclose that this is a sponsor.  Hashtag partner.  We see a lot.  Yep.  But I have to say, YouTube is the Wild West when it comes to this and no one  can, there's so many videos, I don't think anybody can enforce it.  It happens all the time.

I watch enough YouTube to know that people who care about maintaining their  YouTube channels and their followers and staying in good standing with YouTube  itself, much less the FTC, they are very skilled at this.

A lot of us in a situation, we're selling advertising at the same time as we're  creating content.  So it is a new world.  It is not the old world where you had this big media company that would defend you,  that has lawyers, that has a Chinese wall between advertising and editorial.  That that's all in many cases it's gone.  So I trust Connie and Lindsay.  I'd be very curious what they have to say about this.  They've been on our shows many times.  And when Connie was on not so long ago, I think she made a credible defense.  But clearly there's something to talk about here.  And I guess the most important thing is to say now it's let the buyer beware as a  consumer of editorial content.  You always have to ask yourself, you know, how credible is this?  How much integrity is this person being disclosed?  Because times have changed.  Right.  Yeah.  Larrysworld.com.  I think a close personal friend of the show wrote this.

When I look back at things that have happened, I mean, first of all, the early  PCs were a paradigm shift.  The Apple Mac was a paradigm shift.  Obviously the iPhone was a paradigm shift.  Broadband was a paradigm shift.  You could count them on probably two hands.  The ones that I've witnessed in my career, the tech journalists.  I mean, the laptop was not a paradigm shift.  It was just a smaller version of a personal computer.  The tablet wasn't a paradigm shift.  It was just a bigger version of a smartphone.  And so I'm thinking about what are the paradigm shifts of 2023 or 2020?  Right now, and the two that come to mind are metaverse and AI, or at least the  evolution of AI as witnessed by ChatGTP.  And I'm thinking the metaverse, I'm not sure how much of a paradigm shift it's  going to be because it's too early to know.  We don't know.  Yeah.

Exactly.  And who knows when that's going to be?  Apple's apparently having difficulty making that a reality and they've put that off.  I do think that there's a real legit question that AI is at some sort of  inflection point right now.  And I've been asking this on all of our shores because at first you go, wow,  look, what's going on with images, text.  We now have AI music.  This is something happened.  This is an inflection point.  Things have changed.  But I've also asked the question, or is this just yet another AI spring that  will be followed by an AI winner?  You know, we thought cars would be driving themselves by now.  We thought, I mean, I bought one that was supposed to drive itself.  Right.  It's turned out to be harder to do than we thought.  And I'm wondering if, for all of its marvels, if chat GPT or mid journey  really is just a parlor trick.  And you know, in the next few years, we're going to look back on it and go, yeah,  I guess that didn't happen or not.  Or is it about to explode?  What do you think Denise?

Transcript:  It works every time.  Every time.  Hey everybody, Leo Laporte here.  I'm the founder and one of the hosts at the Twitch Podcast Network.  I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twitch,  because I think it's unique.  And I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech  audience, you need to know about what we do here at Twitch.  We've built an amazing audience of engaged, intelligent, affluent listeners  who listen to us and trust us when we recommend a product.  Our mission statement at Twitch is to build a highly engaged community of  tech enthusiasts.  Already, you should be, your ears should be perking up at that because highly  engaged is good for you.  Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.  We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use  technology in today's world.  And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge comes from our  advertisers.  We are very careful.  We pick advertisers with great products, great services, with integrity, and  introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm.  And that makes our host read ads different from anything else you can buy.  We are literally bringing you to the attention of our audience and giving you  a big fat endorsement.  We like to create partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for  the long run, long-term partners that want to grow with us.  And we have so many great success stories.  Tim Broom, who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one,  has been with us ever since.  He said, quote, we would not be where we are today without the Twitch network.  I think the proof is in the pudding.  Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible that have been with us for more than 10 years,  they stick around because their ads work.  And honestly, isn't that why you're buying advertising?  You get a lot with Twitch.  We have a very full service attitude.  We almost think of it as kind of artisanal advertising, boutique advertising.  You'll get a full service continuity team.  People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support you  with everything from copywriting to graphic design.  So you are not alone in this.  We embed our ads into the shows.  They're not added later.  They're part of the shows.  In fact, often they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in  on the ad saying, yeah, I love that.  Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, man, I really got to buy that.  That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience  trusts saying, yeah, that sounds great.  We deliver, always over deliver on impressions.  So, you know, you're going to get the impressions you expect.  The ads are unique every time.  We don't pre-record them and roll them in.  We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show.  We'll give you great onboarding services.  Adtech with pod sites that's free for direct clients  gives you a lot of reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working.  You'll get courtesy commercials.  You actually can take our ads and share them across social media and landing pages.  That really extends the reach.  There are other free goodies, too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter  that sent to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff.  We give you bonus ads and social media promotion, too.  So if you want to be a long term partner,  introduce your product to a savvy, engaged tech audience.  Visit twit.tv slash advertise.  Check out those testimonials.  Mark McCrary is the CEO of Authentic.  You probably know him, one of the biggest original podcast advertising companies.  We've been with him for 16 years.  Mark said the feedback from any advertisers over 16 years  across a range of product categories,  everything from razors to computers, is that if ads and podcasts  are going to work for a brand, they're going to work on Twitch shows.  I'm very proud of what we do because it's honest, it's got integrity,  it's authentic, and it really is a great introduction  to our audience of your brand.  Our listeners are smart, they're engaged, they're tech savvy,  they're dedicated to our network.  And that's one of the reasons we only work with high integrity partners  that we've personally and thoroughly vetted.  I have absolute approval on everybody.  If you've got a great product, I want to hear from you.  Elevate your brand by reaching out today at advertise at twit.tv.  Break out of the advertising norm.  Grow your brand with host-read ads on twit.tv.  Visit twit.tv slash advertise for more details.  Or you can email us advertise at twit.tv  if you're ready to launch your campaign now.

Because it's coming out February 10th.  There is a movement afoot because of J.K.  Rowling not to buy this new Hogwarts game.

Start time: 8169.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of fascinating for multiple reasons.  First of all, it's a game that doesn't include the words Harry or Potter  anywhere, despite that being the sort of multi gazillion dollar franchise.  But the really fascinating thing about it is that I think it is the first time  that a triple A game release has come out on the new generation of consoles  quite substantially ahead of the previous gen.  So we've previously seen lots of games that are if they're PS5,  they come out on PS4 and PS5 on the same day.  Or if they're Xbox, Call of Duty, it comes out  on Xbox Series X and, you know,  a Series S on the same day and PC quite often the same thing.  So. It's very, very odd to have what Hogwarts Legacy is doing right now,  which is it's an early February release for PlayStation 5 and the latest Xbox.  Yeah, we don't get it until April 4th.  What do you get PlayStation 4 in the Xbox one?  Oh, and you don't get it until the end of July for the Nintendo Switch,  even though it's exactly the same game, they're all extensively finished.  And it's, you know, there's a lot of people talking about it.

Transcript:  Do you think Sony or Microsoft might have paid them to say,  make it exclusive for three months?

Start time: 8257.34
End time: 8264.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's just it.  They're exclusive to their top end consoles.  Not even the Lorand.  Yeah. But keep it off the Switch.

Start time: 8265.10
End time: 8268.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep it off the Switch for three months.  Screw the Switch people.

Start time: 8269.02
End time: 8300.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like it would be one thing if it was, you know,  February the 10th for the PlayStation 5 and 4  and April the 4th for the Xbox series and PC and Xbox one.  But it's the fact that it's all the latest gen stuff is coming out first.  And then the lower gen stuff is coming out later.  And then the sort of ancient stuff like the Switch is. Yeah.  Yeah. And it's a paperback comes out the year after, right?  You don't put up a paperback.  I don't think it's been done for a triple A title in this generation.  And I wonder if it would be now.  If this is the breaking point.

Start time: 8300.98
End time: 8320.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if there's some concern about the response to it.  That's what I wonder about.  I've already heard people saying I'm not buying another JK Rowling.  She didn't have anything to do with it, as the companies are quick to point out.  But of course, this is her intellectual property.  A lot of this is based on the books.

Start time: 8322.70
End time: 8337.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and of course, then just to make it just a little bit more complicated,  if you buy the deluxe edition for an extra 10 pounds,  on PS5 or Xbox X, you also get it three days earlier  than the people that already get it early.

Transcript:  When's the TV series based on the game coming out?  Yeah, that's the hot thing right now.  Have you watched The Last of Us?  Are you getting that yet on your American Hulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's so we get it on.  We get it on. We get it on Sky over here.  It's quite. Yeah, I mean, that's.  But I loved I don't know if you guys saw Pedro Pascal on SNL last night.  I heard he was wonderful.  Yes, he was wonderful.  He did the most amazing skit about an adaptation of Mario Kart, the video game.  And if you haven't watched it, it's on Twitter.  It's on the official SNL Twitter feed.  It is just brilliant.

Transcript:  No, but I got a lot of Mario's.  I got a book for you.  I'll tell you, this book is a fantastic look at the inside.  Look at Mario's, but it's all in here.  Look at that button.  Phoebe Waller Bridge, who was a discovery at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival  and then created Fleabag, which is an amazing series later Killing Eve.  She's working on a Tomb Raider TV series.  She's a great writer.  She won't start it, obviously, nor will Angelina Jolie.  I don't know who's going to who's going to star in it.  But I think the success of The Last of Us and I think this is people  are going to look back in this and say this is when TV series based on video  games finally lived up to their promise.  Might open up the sluice gates, as they say, for a whole bunch more like this.  And to get Phoebe Waller Bridge is pretty much of a coup,  especially because she's a feminist.

Start time: 8451.28
End time: 8463.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Tomb Raider is going to be coming off a hot streak this year with  having co-written the new Indiana Jones movie.  Oh, you'd have to think having co-written the new Indiana Jones.  She'd know a little bit a little bit about Tomb Raider.

Start time: 8464.76
End time: 8474.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I think she's going to be feminist.  So this is not going to be Tomb Raider, not known for its  feminist qualities.  Subtleties.
