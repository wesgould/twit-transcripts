Hi, how are you today?  It's great to have you on.  Likewise.  We tried Skype, we tried video, but you know Steve, you're just a phone guy.  I just don't come across the pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just love getting you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're glad we got you on.  You've had some really great Gilmore Gangs and News Gangs lately, especially the conversation that you started about Friend Feed I think is very interesting.  We'll get to that and talk about that in just a little bit.  You also had Google, the guy in charge of search at Google on.  Was that just yesterday, the day before?  He's not the guy in charge of search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's Mark Lukowski who was the guy who was the architect of Hailstorm.  Remember that?  Hailstorm, that's right.  Yeah.  And now he's overrunning the APIs at Google.  Yeah, I haven't listened to it yet, but I can't wait.  It's on my iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm looking forward to that.  Also, I'm going to talk about the Google Play Store.  Also here with us, Mr. Patrick Norton, of course, of Tekzilla fame, the most listened to show on Revision 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  That and $2 will buy you a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to have you aboard.  You and Veronica getting along as well as you and I did on the screensavers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Veronica is fun.  She's smart.  She's witty.  She's charming.  She's knowledgeable.  She loves getting hands on with stuff.  And she gets your jokes.  Yes, actually.  And she's actually got a punk rock history, so she'll even understand some of the stuff I'm humming in between.  Oh, so she's a flogging Molly's fan too, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's a Dropkick Murphy's fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dropkick Murphy's.  Yes, one of your favorites, Leo.  I know from here.  Yeah, wow.  Barroom Hero, it's a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also here, stoking up right now on Brain Tonic, Mr. Randall Schwartz.  It's great to have Randall actually in studio with us.  You like the Brain Tonic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually a decent taste.  I appreciate this.  The best part about it is it's free while I'm here.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With all the Brain Tonic you can drink, they're not a sponsor.  We just drink their stuff.  I don't know how that happened.  Randall is the author of this new book.  Let me plug something for you.  It's called Pearls of Wisdom from Randall Schwartz, A Press.  And it's great articles about Pearl from many magazines.  He's also the author of many great Pearl books, something like a dozen, including the classic  learning Pearl, which everybody who starts with Pearl.  And now Randall is a completely abandoned Pearl in favor of Squeak.  Is that what you're now?  Smalltalk, yes.  You're Mr. Smalltalk now.  The Seaside Web Framework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been doing a lot of promotion for that, but I haven't totally been in Pearl.  In fact, the last two weeks and next week I'm actually billing with Pearl Time.  I actually have to pay the bills for a while.  Can we mention the company that you're...  No.  Well, they won't allow me to do that, otherwise I would.  It's a really large company that ends in an exclamation mark.  Let's just leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God, you just completely gave the show away.  I can't believe that.  I hope nobody's watching from...  Hotmail!  Yeah, exactly.  Randall is also the creator of the...  Well, I wanted to say Geek Cruise's news, but you've changed the name.  It's now the Insight Cruise's news because Neil Bauman, the master cruise master, has

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  decided that the name Insight Cruise is more fit for the modern generation.  I'm going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My next Geek Cruise won't be till next year, but I'm going to go to China with you, Night  Mania 9.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Right.  It's going to be very cool.  Good to have you along again.  So I'm not going to Sweden.  I thought I loved Sweden until I saw this story.  The Swedish government...  I don't know if this is kind of Patriot Act Scandinavia, but they're moving towards, very  quickly, towards a law that would take effect in January 2009 that would allow surveillance  without court order, without any oversight of telephones, of internet access, of any  electronic communications.  This is kind of, seems kind of backward for a country that seems very progressive.  In fact, really, in some ways reminds me very much of what our government is up to.  The government claims that the function of the surveillance program is to track email  and phone conversations that cross the borders.  That's exactly what the Patriot Act is.  Well, we don't listen in unless you're talking to a foreign national.  They also say, oh, this isn't going to encourage widespread domestic surveillance.  But the fact is that all internet traffic originating in Sweden ends up crossing the  country's borders at some point.  Even if it's email from a guy in Svensk to a guy in Stockholm, it's very likely going  to go to servers that are somewhere else.  And all mobile phones apparently are going across borders for tariff regulation reasons.  So this basically allows the government to watch everything that's going on domestically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, think about it this way.  One of the questions we're talking about next week on Texil is about, you know, a bunch  of college kids have emailed, like, I'm traveling, I'm going to Europe, what should I do for  an internet connection?  And it's really funny, but after the bombings, it's not funny at all, actually.  After the bombings in London, Italy put a law into effect so that anybody who is using  an internet cafe has to, if they're a foreigner, has to produce a passport.  And all of the internet cafe owners had to buy some fairly sophisticated tracking software  so that, specifically for the reason, so that you can correlate traffic in what would normally  be an anonymous environment to an identity verified by a passport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that anyway, that seems like that could have a very strong anti- I mean, that seems  to make sense, especially if you've got cafe bombings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's the real difference between that and, you know, basically...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it could be, you don't have to be a foreign national for them to have to ask  for a passport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True.  I don't know, is Sweden really a capital of intellectual freedom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, I just like the food.  I don't know, no, I don't.  Lutfisk.  Lutfisk.  No, I don't know, I just, if they feel like they are, maybe not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that where Pirate Bay is?  Or is it in Norway?  It's in there, it's up there somewhere.  Somewhere up there.  We're showing our inner faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't the issue that, you know, these things all make sense in terms of trying to protect  ourselves against evildoers, but they also impinge on rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's that it would give up freedoms for the promise of security.  And desire.  Neither.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have personal experience with that being a bad issue.  I mean, there are laws that are very broad and very vague that are already on the books  that, like for example in Oregon, pretty much using a computer for anything is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, what do you mean?  You're saying I'm using a computer for anything at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you can redefine what authorized means at any level.  Oh, I see.  Without authorization.  Well, it's badly written.  The laws are completely badly written.  That makes a lot of sense.  But that's also true for many laws in the U.S. that are related about computers.  And they say, well, we're only going to use this against the bad guys.  But who defines the bad guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll talk about some bad guys.  You guys noticed that on Friday Amazon was down for two full hours.  And when I say down, they were down.  Not anywhere outside the U.S., but the Amazon.com website was down.  And Amazon released what was essentially a completely non-informational quote that said  something like, well, I'll say exactly, Amazon systems are very complex.  And on rare occasions, despite our best efforts, they may experience problems.  We work to, this is like for first grade, we work to minimize disruption and get the  site back as quickly as possible.  They didn't say anything as to the cause of it.  In fact, if you just kind of listened without paying much attention, it would imply that  we made a mistake.  But now the plot thickens because one of Amazon's wholly owned subsidiaries, the  Internet Movie Database, IMDB, went down.  Run on Pearl, by the way.  All Pearl there.  Run on Pearl.  And you can't blame Pearl for this.  Not blaming Pearl for this.  Because it was down exactly the same two hours.  And, according to, well, this is from the Defense in Depth blog at CNET.com.  Supes Ranjan, what a great name.  He's a senior member of the technical staff of network protection and management company  Norris.  Supes Ranjan said in his blog post, he found evidence that at least one of the IP addresses  used by IMDB, an address wholly owned by Amazon, fell under a sustained DDoS attack  between 10.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. Pacific time on Friday.  And he said the attacker seemed to open multiple connections with the IMDB's web server, Port  80, while incrementing his source port for every new connection.  You know, Randall, that's a typical part of the attack.  You can't use it.  You have to spoof the IP address on every...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, every connection from web browser goes to a new source port.  That's natural.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's nothing new.  Oh, he's incrementing the source port, but not the IP address.  Not the IP address.  I think that's probably a misquote because that's obviously what you want to do.  You want to use raw sockets and spoof the IP address.  The attackers, now, in this case, this attack was only three megabits a second, which, with  a company like Amazon's not nearly enough to bring them down.  They probably have tens of thousands of megabits a second capacity.  And I'm sure, as most big companies do now, they have insurance policies.  They have, in effect, extra bandwidth that they can turn on when they're getting attacked.  Nevertheless, the fact that this guy spotted a denial of service...  I talked to somebody on the radio show today who I didn't want to be named, but he said  if I did a little scan on their DNS servers in Amazon's, stealth was leaking.  Stealth DNS was leaking.  So, there were some vulnerabilities on there.  I think Amazon was DDoSed and Amazon doesn't want to admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this paragraph, they're talking about the new source port for every connection  and only being three megabits.  I could easily see that.  It would really depend on the payload of each one of those calls.  Well, it could just be...  Would it just be a SYN flood?  It could just be that it was simply a guy trying to scrape it on the front end.  Three megabits is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, that could be from home.  That's not a big issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just pretty simple.  The incrementing the source port is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's normal for a new connection every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was just somebody scraping the site.  So, it is the DDoS.  Maybe this is a big issue.  I think it's...  I think this guy is wrong.  I think he's misled.  Unless we see that the content doesn't show typical patterns of scraping.  Right.  Yeah, so we need to know more and more about the content to say anything about this.  This does not look that suspicious to me.  I gotta look at the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's Dr. Antonio Nucci's blog at narus.com.  If it were, let's say, is it plausible that it could have been a DDoS?  Which is worse for Amazon?  Was it DDoS or that they screwed up?  Because according to CNET, it costs...  I don't know if this is accurate or not.  $30,000 a minute for Amazon to be down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can probably lend a little help here.  Please do.  One, the CNET numbers are based on the quarterly results for Amazon.  It's just $4.3 billion.  So, they were a wild-ass guess, in other words.  Well, it's probably a fairly accurate start.  I mean, at this point, whether it's retail sales operations tend to make most of their  money in the fourth quarter anyway.  But I don't know if they make it on a Friday from 10 to 1.30, but let's say it's an average

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's still a bad, because you figure, like, the end of the week, people are a little  burned out.  They're spending more time messing around on the internet than maybe doing whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I discovered it because I went there to buy something and I didn't end up buying  that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's safe to say a lot of people buy stuff from Amazon most of the time.  All the time.  So, whether it's $10,000 an hour or $31,000, or $10,000 a minute or $31,000 a minute, it's  still an awful lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's somewhere between $1 and $3 million over the two hours.  I mean, it's a big loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, let's accept that.  What I heard from various and sundry sources who are in partnerships with Amazon is that  it was one monster attack.  It has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, Amazon must have, you know, the equivalent of an OC48 or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they have several in several locations on several backbones.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, how do you bring something like that down?  Do you think it...  I asked...  We talked at the time, and one of the things we're going to start doing with Twitter Live  is, when these things happen, we'll go live with it.  We talked with Sean Allen, who is at Kino Systems, and I know...  We're with Leo in the internet, Cam.  Leo?  He was.  He's on Skype.  But it's something that you and I had done on Patrick many times.  We talked to Kino Systems when these things happened.  He was of the opinion that it couldn't be a DDoS attack because it would take so much  bandwidth to bring a company like Amazon down.  But at the same time, I said, well, is it a BGP router error like Pakistan made?  It brought YouTube down?  Is it...  He said, no, it's not the border gateway protocol.  He was puzzled, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it could be that there was some sort of...  Like, I know that Cisco had a note recently on some of their routers.  There were some back doors open that shouldn't have been.  There was a security note about two or three months ago.  It could have been a hack.  That's what I'm saying.  It could have been a hack that caused the routers to go the wrong way for a while and  took them a while to discover it.  And they don't want to let people know.  Two hours?  Well, you know, when you can't get to the machines to probe them because your routes  are wrong, it's a lot harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So...  Would there be a symptom if you...  I mean, how would we know if that had happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The traceroute goes and dies on its way there and it sounds like that's what the reports  with what happened.  I should have tracerouted it.  I didn't.  I was just sitting there.  You want to see where it stops because if it stops where the routes have to take the  right routing from there forward, that would be an interesting indication.  So, I didn't know about this or would have been doing it on Friday as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish I...  Next time I'll call you, Randall.  Yeah, please.  The error message I was getting was HTTP 1.1 error.  You know, I mean, it was a really lame error.  It was like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that probably means that their front proxies were reachable, but the actual back-end  machines that were trying to do the right thing behind it were broken and that would  mean an internal routing error.  That would incline you to believe that.  It's either bad sysadmin or somebody broke into one of the routers or...  I kind of doubt that it was a DDoS at that point.  And malicious maybe, stupid maybe, but I'm not so sure it was an extraordinary...  Which is worse, malicious or stupid?  When they have the same effect of losing a million bucks an hour or whatever, right?  No, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could see absolutely why Amazon might not want to say what it was.  Right, because they don't want to also admit maybe they've got some downright syscos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that would be a vulnerability going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never announce your security vulnerabilities until you fix them all.  Yeah, very important security tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve Gilmore, did you try to buy anything on Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I tried to buy one Beatles book two years ago and failed.  Failed?  Yeah, they keep sending me cross references to things that I would buy since I bought the Beatles book, which I never got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So every time you go to Amazon it says things like, oh, people who bought...  People who attempted to buy Beatles books may also be attempting to buy Abbey Road.  Exactly.  He bought a book, he just never received what he bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of like eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, my wife does all that.  I sit back and don't wait for it to come.  I love Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to at some point we have to do some accounting around Twitter.  Especially this week or this month because we bought a lot of stuff for the setup, but for Twitter Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick was a little hard to hear just then, by the way.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shout out, Patrick.  Use clear language.  Clear language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that one of two things happened.  Either Cisco was doing a marketing effort or it was Twitter trying to take the heat off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter, maybe they started using by accident.  They routed through Twitter's servers.  That could be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Twitter did it deliberately to take the heat off of them.  Exactly.  Right.  Oh, Amazon.  Look how much it had Amazon in it.  Even the MDB is gone.  Everything goes away, really, people.  Stop blaming us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is just the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll take down Pound and Jaiku next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Up time to nine nines still isn't 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a very funny exchange on Twitter earlier this week between Jeannie Jardin and I can't remember who she was talking with about the Friendster diaspora.  And the same thing, Patrick, I know you remember when Friendster was so hot.  I've never actually seen a Friendster page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe it was on call for help.  So Kat Schwartz and I are talking about Friendster or maybe it was at Silicon Alley and I were talking about Friendster.  And we all signed up and Friendster would go up and down, up and down because it couldn't sustain this.  It couldn't scale.  And everybody was on Friendster and Friendster was a huge success and should have sold because they got a big offer, I think, and they didn't sell.  And then everybody left because it was terrible.  You couldn't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same thing with early Orkut.  And now Orkut is a huge success internationally.  Orkut was the Google's.  No, no, it's big in Brazil.  In Brazil, mostly.  Is it big anywhere other than Brazil?  I don't know, but when I go to the conferences in Brazil, I walk by the terminal labs and there's all these purple screens as I walk by.  It's really bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just got to remember that Randall is big in Brazil.  So he doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  I think everywhere.  We're not talking about my weight now.  Come on, Leo.  So are we going to see a Twitter diaspora, Steve Gilmore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  What does diaspora mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's when the people of Israel went across the land and were dispersed across the land.  Is it diaspora or is it diaspora?  I don't know.  Now you're asking me.  Or just spore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People keep saying that it's going to be a ghost town, but I don't buy it.  I think there's too many addicts walking around waiting for the boat to come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It comes from the ancient Greek diaspora, a scattering or sowing of seeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are they going to go is the real question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook.  It plurts briefly was very interesting.  You think Facebook, Randall Schwartz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To go away from Friendster.  No, no, Friendster for Twitter.  Oh man, I don't know.  I'd love for them to come up on a Jaiku or something because I think Jaiku is a much  better design model.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Jaiku, Google missed the boat.  Google bought Jaiku.  And then they stopped their subscriptions.  They can't get anybody else on it.  They closed it down as invite only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know whether they missed the boat.  I ran into one of the co-founders at Google the other day.  Yiri or Petri?  What was the first one?  Yiri.  Yiri.  He's a great guy.  Yes.  And he seems to have something up his sleeve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that's just that smoke tearing that they like so much.  With Jaiku?  Jaiku specifically or just?  What somebody told me is that because I asked the same question.  I said, what's happening with Jaiku?  And they said, well, Yiri and Petri are busy putting presence everywhere in Google's stuff,  particularly Android, right, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's a good guess.  But I think that they're going to resurface looking completely different but completely  embedded in everything that Google's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now's the time because I think there are if...  Do you think, Steve, if there were a credible...  I don't think Friend feeds it.  If there were a credible successor to Twitter that you could see this kind of sudden flocking  to it?  No, I don't actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't?  I think the Twitter is...  I'm ready to go.  Twitter has the core audience and they're not going to lose it no matter how pathetic  the service is today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am ready to leave Twitter.  I got to say it's just it's really getting to be...  But you're also fickle, Leo.  I'm very fickle.  But don't you think everybody who uses Twitter is very fickle?  I am not fickle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am not fickle.  Because the other thing is like...  Because you never join anything.  Well, I've joined Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It took us a long time to get you on Twitter.  In fact, Veronica was the one who got you on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I can also say that in the time it took me to get on Twitter, some people I know,  some of whom may even be on this particular episode of Twitter, have gone from like Dodgeball  to Twitter to Haiku, flirted with Plounts and then ended up back on Twitter and are  now talking about Plurk, all of which essentially exist in the same space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're just looking for one thing that'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But for me, it's got to have threads.  It's got to have Jaiku style threads or I'm not going to be happy there.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing I do like about Jaiku.  That's why I like Friend Feed is it's very much like Jaiku in that respect.  It has the threaded conversation.  Jaiku also has, as Friend Feed does, the ability to add your RSS feeds to it.  And it has what it has at Jaiku that nobody else has very well is that great Nokia client.  If it would work on Android where it can.  And the iPhone.  And the iPhone.  Please.  And BlackBerry, that automatically updates your location.  And it was a very nice way of updating your status as well.  I thought that was a great, I loved Jaiku.  You and I were the only people who used it though, Randall.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still use it.  I still have a big following over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I post there.  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you engage in a lot of conversation.  Yeah, I do.  else answers my question.  I really like that because for me it's a miniature version of Usenet, which I really like.  I'm an introversion of most web forums, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually, that's exactly how you half the time when I'm on Twitter, I'm engaging in  a conversation with the people that are following.  And it's not made for that.  It's terrible.  It's horrible for that.  Absolutely horrible for that.  No, but that also seems to be the way, because I've also unlisted people because they didn't  feel like watching, getting like 22 at-sweets every time when they were making decisions  about where to have lunch.  So subsets of your followers or friends would be a really good idea for a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What really needs a service that has not only people you follow, but maybe let them add  keywords to each message.  Then I could say, well, I only want to hear Leo's messages about where he's going to be  this week.  Right.  Or I only want to hear Leo's messages about, you need to have a two-dimensional matrix  Much more refined tools.  People and keywords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I think you need much more refined tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing is, couldn't you?  Seaside.  Seaside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here, you're a programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Couldn't you whip something up?  Please somebody do it and tell me about it and I'll join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here, with somebody that has the expertise to talk about this, why is Twitter having  such scaling problems?  Why do so many sites like this have scaling problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have one master MySQL and two slave MySQL servers.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what everybody's saying.  Yeah, that's part of it.  And why is that a problem?  Because of the bottleneck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're using, from what I understand, I haven't done a lot of research on this,  but they're using a sort of a blog architecture when they really should be using a message-based  architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems like a mistake.  It is.  It's not blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't there a reason they use the blog architecture?  For those of us, including myself, who don't know exactly what a blog architecture is,  what exactly is the difference between a blog architecture and a messaging architecture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things that ties it down is that every message you're typing has to go all  the way down to be essentially a new post on a thread down with your user ID.  But really, it only needs to go out for a couple of hours at most to all of the people  who are subscribed to you.  So it should have stayed more in sort of a local cache rather than going all the way  down making a full detailed post like you would have in a blog model where you want  to come back six months from now and see all those messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is I actually like the architecture where I'd be able to search everything and  look at older stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not saying this wouldn't be possible.  I'm just saying that what they should do is have two levels where most of it is about  getting messages, short messages from one user to another and that's one level of the  system and then behind that is an archival system that then means for a longer level.  This has been discussed in a couple of blogs I saw about this.  Is to have like a two level thing where you have a message switching architecture in the  front and a long term archival and look up service in the back and then you don't need  to take every message all the way down to an archival system.  Is that how Jaco does it, do you know?  I don't know how Jaco does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's interesting what you're saying there because I think that if you split  the service into those two components, the second part of that is really not a, there's  no issue with latency.  The only problem right now is that the APIs are pumping out the whole ball of wax and  so everything that any service that wants to do, the second part of that has to put  their bandwidth constraints on the real time part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, yeah exactly what I'm saying.  You really have two different needs to go to that data and they've built it all under  one architecture.  Again, from what I understand, it's only with the stuff I see in the public so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a contrarian from your guys' perspective however.  I think that the ability to be able to search down using the track mechanism into Twitter  in real time and to nail up live real time conversations is fundamental.  The difference between an IM conversation and a semi-public conversation where you're  not only broadcasting but you're also talking to specific affinity groups.  I know this is a lot of buzzwords and the people on TechCrunch hate me for saying it  but I think that's a revolutionary capability.  Well FriendFeed does this very well.  I don't think so because the problem with FriendFeed from my perspective is that it's  like a silo where comments and conversations go to die.  You can't find them after they go in there.  It's like the Hotel for conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree.  In fact, my big complaint is that my blog post goes on FriendFeed.  People comment on it and that's it.  Now it's buried in FriendFeed.  I want to keep that conversation alive on my blog.  I found there is a WordPress tool that will allow you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We really need more open two-way.  Isn't that what open social is?  Silo's are bad.  Open social isn't supposed to solve some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Silo's are bad.  That's why we don't want to put our data.  The last thing he said was in April and he said we're porting Jaiku to the Google App  Engine.  That's that wonderful thing.  Do you like the Google App Engine, Randall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's in Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you why.  I mean it's a great deal for anybody who wants to kind of prototype a new website because  you get a lot of, I can't remember what it is, a million or two million visits a month  for free basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the, I have to say I like the Amazon EC2 a little bit better for the reasons that  you've got more flexibility about the architecture you're using to get into it.  I am talking to some of my small talk friends though about maybe figuring out a way to get  that into Google's engine which would be interesting.  Oh, that would be very interesting.  That would be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well anyway, I know people hate it when we get too off a far field with Twitter but I  think it, you know, there certainly is a conversation there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking about Twitter?  We're talking about Jaiku.  We are talking about Jaiku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're talking about if a service like that can succeed and if it could would people move  there and Steve you say no, everybody's going to stay exactly where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't say that.  I said that by the time there's a service that's going to compete with it, it's going  to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter's going to be, Twitter will be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's working pretty well today.  It is.  Tomorrow will be an interesting issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's move from Twitter to murder.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's happening?  Not the Worldwide Developers Conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm wondering.  Leo, what have you heard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  About WWDC.  Well, I'm hearing the same rumors all of you are hearing, right?  I mean, you know, I think it's pretty clear although there's one contrarian who says Steve's  not going to announce a new iPhone but he's a voice in a wilderness because everybody  agrees that 3G iPhone that AT&T really has pre-announced is going to be out on Monday  tomorrow.  We can't do live coverage by the way.  Not from the WWDC.  We can't actually do a coverage.  So what we're going to do, you know, and Gadgets there, Gizmodo's there, Mac, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually I've heard that a lot of people and maybe I'm just talking to the wrong people  but I heard that press access was enormously difficult for this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Much limited.  I asked for pass and they did not give me one.  The problem is that this is the first Worldwide Developers Conference for Apple that's been  sold out which tells you that Apple's got a market for developers writing on the iPhone  platform and Apple's clearly, you know, people are very excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not just the iPhone but the Macs are really making headway now too which is really, I  mean, it's coming across all the way across.  I mean, what are they, a third or a half of machines over a thousand bucks?  And they're growing fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we talked about that last week.  It's a very strong platform.  So we will be covering it from outside the room but I think this is going to be more  Andy Iannacco inspired me because last keynote from Steve Jobs, Andy did his couch keynote  where he was sitting in his apartment in Boston, you know, refreshing a gadget like all of  us, making a sandwich and he would blog the whole thing.  Let's see what's on Battlestar Galactic.  Nothing much.  Let's see what Steve has to say.  So what we're going to do is Andy Iannacco, John Maltz who wrote Crazy Apple Rumors which  is one of the funniest sites ever and I will be covering, doing meta coverage starting  at 9.30 tomorrow morning Pacific Time.  So we'll be refreshing the, we're refreshing gadgets so you don't have to.  You should get a big couch on a flatbed truck and sit it right outside the building.  Next year.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Outside the building and say, in those walls, Steve Jobs right now is saying this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Chris Breen who writes for Macworld Magazine, I asked him a couple of days ago, I said,  are you going to be in there?  He said, I don't know yet.  We only have limited seats.  He is going to be in the keynote.  So when he comes out the doors, we're going to grab him.  We'll get him on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are, so you're actually coming down to San Francisco for this?  No, I'm doing it from here.  I'm not moving.  Oh, see, I was, I was hoping you're actually going to be at the event.  I couldn't get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple wouldn't give me a credential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you said you were going to be sitting outside.  No, that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Randall's idea.  But I think it's a great idea and I think maybe one of these days, maybe next year we'll  do that.  I think it's not kind of fun to have a couch out there and do twit live from the street.  Certainly you can.  I mean, it's not hard to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you'd have to get a parking spot like a week before.  Yeah.  And just leave the truck there and sit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what we're going to do is we'll sit here.  I'll be sitting here.  Andy will be in Boston.  I don't know where Maltz is.  And we'll be on Skype.  We'll be doing just like this, we'll be talking about what's going on.  And then we'll get somebody who was actually there, Chris Breen, after the fact.  But you know, we can't, you can't stream video of the keynote.  They won't let you do it.  So anyway, to answer your question, Steve, you know, obviously a 3G phone.  It looks like the firmware is pretty clear.  It's going to have a GPS capability built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most likely.  I see some disagreement with that, though, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seems like you'd want to.  Did you see the pictures, though, of the...  Yeah.  So the putative pictures of the iPhone.  It was color and it has pla...  It looked kind of like the old...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But one of them is missing an on-off switch.  So it was a bad Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's bad Photoshop.  I don't think Apple's...  I think Apple doesn't let this stuff...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the only thing that I saw in that picture that they implied in that story was the idea  of a front-facing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well they need a front-facing camera for...  Video conferencing!  Video conferencing!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's a pretty big deal, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well we would be able to see you for a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably not, because I'd find something to make it not work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well you make a good point.  I mean, from my point of view, this is exactly what I would love.  In fact, maybe Chris Breen will come out of the door with one in his hand and he'd be  doing it from...  I would love that!  That would make me really happy.  So I think that...  There are a couple of things they can do.  But really, I think what's really interesting...  Maybe they'll make some announcements that'll make everybody sit up and take notes on the  iPhone.  I think one of them is going to have to be a subsidized phone only because it's only  been out for a year.  What about me and all the people who bought our iPhone a year ago from AT&T?  We got another year to run before we get another phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no way they're going to pay the subsidy to non-new customers though.  So we're screwed anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  I think they need to do a deal for early adopters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we paid our money.  We paid our money to get our service already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to make a lot of people mad if they come out with a 3G iPhone and it's  going to cost me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, how many times have you bought a laptop the next day the price went down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not a laptop.  This is a phone and it's a very different world.  Steve, do you think they'll offer some sort of deal for early adopters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that they'll allow you to be able to upgrade without having to change the  service contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, thanks.  Well, actually, that would be a big one.  It doesn't bump it to another two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they can guarantee that anyway because all I do is take the SIM card out and I'm  done.  So there's nothing you can do to stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the iPhone is not like your traditional GSM phone where you just swap the SIMs.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have two iPhones.  I have one that I bricked so I know exactly how this works.  I do have one that I bricked.  Now it's a pristine state sitting at home finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't mean they actually couldn't do something with the next generation iPhone  SIM card and then tells you...  With all due respect, Apple can lock down anything.  Apple can lock down anything.  Yeah, they're good at it.  And yeah, they're good at it.  They're comfortable with it.  And if there's a profit to be made there, working with AT&T, absolutely will they do  something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean...  Yeah, and the other thing is the whole elitist thing, which is that you have to pay in order  to be one of the new generation.  I think that they milk that for all it's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They exploit that.  Absolutely.  They exploit electronic.  I mean, I've got a three-quarter dead iPhone right now and I'm not looking forward to cracking  the case and replacing the screen.  So I'm kind of half-tempting they do announce it and release it.  You're gonna want it.  Well, I can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got an old iPhone if you want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it bricked?  No, it's reset now.  It's reset now.  I could use some of the parts off of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Well, you can just take your SIM card and put it in the iPhone.  It works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so it's working.  I thought it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 1.3 release unbricked it, thank God.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He bricked it.  Yeah, 1.3 was very generous that way.  Yeah.  Because the phone I have is actually from DVD John.  You have DVD John's iPhone?  Wow.  After he was done using it to develop some software, he sold it.  So...  Oh, you bought it from?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll trade you straight across the working one for that one just for the history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little damaged, but I would be glad to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll put it up on my shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'll be great.  DVD John's iPhone.  This is the phone.  He cracked the iPhone DRM with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it was a hoot because he's like, I'm selling and I'm like, I'll buy that.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, that's...  He lives in San Francisco, doesn't he, man?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have actually been in his super secret development location.  Oh.  It was cool.  I had to talk for like an hour and like, you're so cool, man, and tried not to drool and got  the hell out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you do an episode of System in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  I would love to, but he's pretty busy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you want to talk about the GPS thing about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, let's take a break.  I want to talk about GPS.  I want to talk about other things that Apple might announce because I mean, I think it's  going to be more than an iPhone.  I think there's other stuff up their sleeve.  And just a second more about WWDC, but I want to remind everybody that this show is  brought to you by iStock Photo.  We've got a special deal for our twit listeners.  iStockPhoto.com slash twitstock.  Don't you love that URL?  But before I say what the deal is, I want to tell you what iStock Photo is.  It's really the world's busiest image market.  They've got new customizable subscriptions.  This special offer I mentioned.  So iStock Photo is where designers and marketing pros go who are looking for images for their  websites.  Video too on a budget.  In fact, it's very, very popular.  I just found out that an image is downloaded every 1.4 seconds on iStock Photo.  Wow.  It's kind of astounding.  They're also now they have subscriptions, which is kind of cool.  You get a daily credit subscription service that's customizable.  So if you're doing a lot, if you're one of the people downloading an image every hour,  you can get credits to download files every single day.  It's very affordable anyway for a onesie twosie, but this is really good for people who are  using their royalties free stock photos or vector illustrations or video.  They also flash.  And coming in September, I can make this announcement now.  iStock Photo is going to be doing audio files.  So we might be starting to use some of them for sound effects and stuff like that.  So there's also corporate accounts.  Now, here's the offer.  And by the way, if you're also a creator, I know you take a lot of great photos.  Do you do any stock photo stuff with your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've tried a couple of times, just haven't gotten around to it.  I've got a lot.  We've got to get you on iStock Photo.  I've got 40,000 pictures on my website and none of them are bigger than one megapixel  as they're uploaded.  So I've got plenty of place to take the original eight megapixel pictures and put them somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you could be making money on this.  Money, money, money.  I suppose.  Sure, sure.  What do you mean, I suppose?  What's wrong with money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not everyone's actually obsessed with filthy Luca, Mr. LaPorte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I am.  I am, let me tell you.  And I want to thank iStock Photo for giving me more filthy Luca.  So we have filthy Luca.  That's a good word.

So I'm looking forward to, and the MacBreak Weekly team talked about this a little bit,  a tablet iPhone.  Would you, what if something like a Nokia 810 with touch, with a pinch, with all of the  features of an iPhone, but basically a bigger screen, not a laptop, just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  I got into a conversation slash argument with Callie Lewis about tablet PCs or tablet MacBooks.  You like them, don't you?  You know, I've just never found one that was worth owning or using because I'm not, you  know what I mean?  I'm not insurance guy or I'm not in a hospital where the forms are all integrated and there's  a motivation for that.  And I type much faster than I can scribble on a tablet.  And then there's the whole correcting my scribbling thing once it's copied into a Word file.  But I gotta say, a seven inch screen on an iPhone, especially with the GPS capabilities,  that would be my mark.  Yes, you see what I'm talking?  I would be all over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus you get this developer commuter that's all excited about this.  You know what I'm most excited about, Steve, is what applications Steve Jobs announces tomorrow.  Because you're going to see some really, really cool stuff.  Although Patrick, I know you mock the idea of the fact that, you know, not only are you  tilting the iPhone like a Wiimote, but the screen is going with it.  It's a little bit tough that way.  If you're playing monkey ball, you'd have to go like, you know, oh, oh, oh.  But I think there are going to be some really neat applications.  I think they're going to use the accelerometers in very innovative ways.  I'm very excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tell you the one thing I'd actually be excited about in terms of having a tablet.  And that would be that when I'm finding myself doing now on long plane trips, I'm no longer  taking out my laptop to work or even watch DVDs.  I'm watching shows on my iPhone all the time now.  Right.  It's a great.  So if there was a tablet that would give me a larger screen surface that I could take  with me on flights.  More memory.  Yeah, I'm not so.  I mean, I can only put more in my 8GIG iPhone than I can watch in eight hours.  So it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But remember, bigger surface means more battery, higher res.  Yeah.  I mean, this is a pretty compelling device.  I would love.  I hope Apple does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm so glued to my laptop that I doubt that anything smaller than the full laptop  can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I have some I have an ACES EPC, I have an OLPC, I have a tablet.  What do I bring around?  You don't actually use any of those.  No, I bring my MacBook around because you end up wanting all that power and a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  Since I got the Air, I haven't touched any of my other Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's essentially, you know, it's an ultra portable.  You know what I mean?  I know, but ultra portables are coffee computers without, you know, without an optical spindle.  Did you see that guy who cut his meat with the Air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It was a cake.  It was a cake.  Not meat.  Meat would be tough.  Do not use your Air to cut meat.  In Japan, the MacBook can be used like a knife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This brisket is so tender, I can cut it with a MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, you know, I had an Air for review.  I sent it back and I didn't have any trouble sending it back.  But now I'm starting to think maybe I made a mistake.  And then we got one for Abby because my daughter is going to France for a year and she needed  a laptop.  And I said, you can get, you know, a MacBook.  She said, I want an Air.  And I got it for her and I'm watching her and I'm very jealous.  I actually do.  I'm starting to come along around Steve.  I think the Air is exactly what most people want because you don't need more than two  gigs.  You don't need more than 80 gigs hard drive.  You don't need all that power.  You just need something that surfs, does email and it does it fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again, from my strategy, the things that I want to do with the day, though, I didn't  rush out and get an Air.  An Air really didn't have that gain for me.  It really didn't seem like it would be something useful for me because again, I need all this  stuff.  Yeah, this is the 17.  This is 17.  Yeah, 17.  So it's a monster.  And it's fully loaded.  I got the biggest disc.  I got the most memory, everything I can.  And also, I'm on the road 25 weeks a year.  This is my office.  So it wouldn't make much sense for me to have a small machine and a large machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what happened.  That's what changed for me.  That's what changed is I'm no longer going to Canada.  So I don't need the big powerful machine to take with me to Canada.  But I would love for just little trips, I would love the Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what I am finding when I'm doing those, I am using my iPhone while I'm standing in  line and waiting at the airport and actually on the plane.  So a tablet, if the tablet completely replaced the iPhone, I could see it.  But I also don't want to hold a big tablet to my head.  So I don't know how that's going to work either.  I mean, it's a little crazy.  I mean, when Neil Bauman, the guy that does Geek Cruise, has found out about using a Skype  phone on the ship, he was holding the entire laptop up to his face.  Oh, that's ridiculous.  It was like this giant cell phone.  That's just crazy.  So yeah, I don't want to be doing that with a tablet.  That really doesn't sound like the right place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So because we do this show live now at twitlive.tv as well as recorded, and many of you are  listening recorded, of course, we can also ask our chat rooms.  We have two of them on Stick Cam 1 and one on irc.dslextreme.com.  Room is pounded at twitlive.  What they expect to see, KJ says, I think, and I think KJ's might be right here.  I think Steve will be trying to preempt the hoopla that's going to accompany Android phone  releases later this year.  In fact, didn't HTC say they were going to do an Android phone in July, like next month?  So that may be that they need to do something to combat Android.  Steve, do you think Android is going to be a killer platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I completely couldn't have cared less about Android until I was at the Google  I.O. conference a couple weeks ago.  And I was even not looking at the stage.  I was sitting in the front row and just completely couldn't have cared less.  And all of a sudden I looked up and I went, oh, wait a minute.  This thing is not going to, you know, Jobs will always be ahead of the curve, but he's  not very far ahead of the curve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  What do you like about Android?  What do you think makes Android stand out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the thing that was interesting was that they have gestures, you know, like the ones  that we have gotten used to, you know, pinch, et cetera, that are slightly different.  And they're not the same, but they also seem to work.  In other words, it opens up the idea to developers and users that these tools don't necessarily  have to have a one common interface that's owned and copyrighted by one vendor.  And I think that's a pretty powerful, I mean, first of all, it means that every other phone  manufacturer and play, like starting with Nokia, they've got a big problem because all of a  sudden Google is in second place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  Leapfrogging ahead of everybody else.  I mean, you know, I saw an ad for...  But is it really Google or is it whoever, whatever handset makes your maker makes an  Android handset?  I mean, Google's not saying we want to be in this business exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's very similar to the old Microsoft play with Windows Mobile, and, you  know, except that it seems to have a slightly different kind of feel to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it more, isn't it open source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean...  Yeah, of course.  But I mean, let's not go crazy about that.  It's tied to you have to use Java in order to write it.  Ew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ew.  That's not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the other things they announced at the Google I.O. conference was  the Google Web Toolkit, which essentially makes...  It's kind of like an ASP.NET for Java, which I think actually makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things Zilch in our chat room says, don't forget, AT&T, Apple's locked to AT&T,  Android is not locked to any carrier.  That's a big advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple won't be locked to AT&T for much longer, though, not with all the deals they're making  internationally.  Well, and that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will they be locked to AT&T after tomorrow?  I wonder if AT&T is going to get the heave-ho tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a rumor that Australia, that the next phone will be available to all carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in Australia.  I don't know what that means here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't France already like that?  France, some other country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Law, French law require that, but they sell both locked and unlocked, I think, or they  will unlock it for you.  American law is changing in that regard.  You can now, after your contract, if you've paid for the phone, in effect, they have to  unlock it for you.  But all of this only makes sense on GSM.  The problem with the States is we only have two GSM carriers, neither of which most people  want, T-Mobile and AT&T.  If there were an iPhone on Verizon, don't you think, or Sprint, don't you think it would  do better?  Verizon's a huge carrier.  They just bought, I'll tell you, they're now just like the king of the hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really miss my CDMA coverage with my Verizon phone.  I was with Verizon for a number of years.  And Verizon EVDO is very fast.  And Verizon EVDO is good, but Sprint has no restrictions on bandwidth, which helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sprint's a better deal for EVDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sprint's definitely a better deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've always liked Sprint.  Patrick, are you still a Sprint customer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually, I left Sprint because their customer service, they kept basically lying  about fees and services.  And I kept finding charges on my bill that I told been waived.  And I left them and went to Verizon for two and a half months until I moved 10 blocks  inside of San Francisco into a...  It stopped working.  You laugh into a Verizon sinkhole.  So I could get service eight miles south of West Wendover, Nevada, which is kind of like  saying the middle of nowhere but near a small casino in a McDonald's.  But I couldn't get service inside of San Francisco.  But because it's in the green zone, sir, unfortunately, there's no possibility that we  can...  Basically, they screwed my wife and I for $300 in kill fees because there's no possibility  that the phones, which had a 70 to 80% dropped call rate because the only way we could get  a single bar was to walk outside the front door and climb onto the back of my truck.  So I got hosed for $300 in kill fees plus two phones, the cost of the two phones.  And then went to AT&T, who will also get me connected to, you know, in a lot of the middle  of nowhere but also actually works inside of San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's virtually 0% chance that iPhone will go to CDMA ever.  I think that's really the wrong choice for you.  The chipset's entirely different.  The design's entirely different.  It wouldn't matter.  And it would be a whole different set of licensing fees to pay.  So maybe we'll see something tomorrow.  No, no.  No.  No, I'm saying no.  No chance of CDMA for iPhone.  No chance in the least.  Not even at all.  You couldn't do a CDMA iPhone?  No.  You don't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on.  You could do a CDMA.  Who's the company that owns that?  That's...  Oh, Qualcomm.  Qualcomm.  Qualcomm has got some pretty steep licensing fees from what I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the advantage of adding CDMA?  Just that the coverage was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A new market.  A better market.  Yeah, and the coverage was a lot better for me.  I still get...  I can't stand my GSM coverage, but I loved my CDMA coverage everywhere I was at.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is Qualcomm related to Broadcom?  No, they're competitors.  Okay.  Because you saw the Broadcom...  You laughed, right?  You laughed when you said that, I hope.  Yeah.  Yeah, sorry.  Okay.  You saw the Broadcom story.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Is there...  Oh.  I'm just been...  I'm in...  You know, let's...  Shall we get to the sleazy gossip portion of This Week in Tech?  I thought we were there already.  Oh, no, no.  We've got murder, we've got mayhem, we've got prostitution, and we've got ecstasy.  Yes, it's a...  And Leonardo DiCaprio.  Okay, we're ready.  But first...  But wait, don't call yet.  But first, this word from audible.com.  You know, this is kind of cool.  We are now at the one-year anniversary of our association with audible.com, which makes  this, as far as I know, one of two longest-running sponsorships in netcast history.  Wow.  And the only other one that I think is longer is Astaro, which has been with Security Now  for two-plus years.  Audible has been with us for a year.  And I have to say this, I'm going to just...  I'm going to say it briefly, I'm just going to revel in this and move on.  They wanted one day, they bought one show, they bought Twit, and they're still with us  now, 365 days later, 100 shows later, something like that, 50 shows later, because it's been  such a great relationship.  We love audible.com, and I think Audible's very happy with Twit.  So we're going to celebrate Audible's original audiobook, the Chopin Manuscript, which, by  the way, won an award for the Audiobook of the Year for 2008.  It's so cool.  What they did is they got a bunch of the best mystery thriller writers together, each wrote  a different chapter.  It's an incredible audiobook produced by Audible.  Fifteen of the greatest writers, Jeffrey Deaver thought up the characters in the plot.  Then they each wrote a chapter, and then Jeffrey put it all together.  So this is the Chopin Manuscript, and here's the deal.  Free.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you...  We have a special...  There's two Audible offers, but I want you to go to the Audible 749 offer, so that's  audible.com slash twit 749.  If you haven't signed up for Audible yet, you can sign up there, and the deal that you  get is your first three audiobooks are $7.49 each.  That's 50% off.  And they throw in the Chopin Manuscript, so you really get such a good deal.  I mean, the Chopin Manuscript is a must read.  Audible has so many great books to choose from, and we're just really thrilled that we  can make this special offer.  You're 50% off your first three audiobooks and a free copy of the Chopin Manuscript.  And I've got to put the CG up so that you know how to do this.  For those of you watching at home, I'm going to add this here, because this is a special  deal.  It's twit 749.  So it's audible.com slash twit 749.  You know, there's the audible.com slash twit.  This is a special one.  And you'll get a free copy of the Chopin Manuscript.  I never asked you, Steve Gilmore, have you ever listened to audiobooks?  You don't have to get involved in the ad, but I'm just wondering if you ever listen  to audiobooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the one that I listened to was a little bit of the Bob Dylan book.  Oh, and he reads it?  No, he doesn't.  Oh, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's his name?  Sean Penn reads it.  Exactly.  If Dylan were you, you wouldn't be able to understand it.  Man, man, man, man, man.  No, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, man, man, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sean Penn does a great job with it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't sound at all like Dylan, because you can understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's really good, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know, the book is amazing.  I love that.  That's an audible book, actually.  Let me recommend that.  It's a great performance.  You know, when somebody sort of combines those two aesthetics, it can be really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only Sean Penn could do this.  And I'll tell you, I read an excerpt when the book came out in Newsweek, and I read  it, and it was so disjointed and weird, I thought, I'm not going to read this book.  But I got it on audible, and it was fantastic.  I really, really enjoyed it.  So that could be our pick.  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Chronicles 1, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chronicles, that's right.  And it is abridged.  I wish it weren't abridged, but I guess they probably couldn't get Sean Penn to do the  80 hours, whatever it is, that they would do.  I mean, it's amazing they got Sean even to do this.  I'm sure it's because it was Dylan that Penn was willing to do it.  But Chronicles Volume 1 by Bob Dylan, read by Sean Penn, five hours and six minutes.  What a great book this is.  That could be your 749 book.  50% off your first three books and the Chopin manuscript is free.  Audible.com slash twit 749.  Woohoo, one year.  Happy birthday, happy anniversary.  Where's our cake?  We should have some cake.  The cake is a lie.  Well, I don't want to, I'm not going to mention this because I can't extend this to you, Randall,  and I can't extend it to you, Steve, because you're not twit regulars, but all the twit  regulars are getting free Audible accounts as well.  That's their thing.  I heard that from last week.  Is there a reason for you to start becoming more regular on the show, Steve and Randall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought that Dvorak didn't want me on the show again, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not you that Dvorak doesn't want on the show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew I'd smoke something out with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We won't talk about that.  I don't want to, you know, it's so funny because I think the show is just a bunch of guys  getting together, having a good time.  Most of the people who are on the show take it in the spirit that it's intended,  that it's intended, it was just fun, you know, gassing.  But I think you went through this with the Gilmore gang, didn't you?  I mean, I don't know.  How much of that is acted and how much of that is real by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we all really hate each other.  It's all acted because half the time we sound like we're okay with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing.  I can't figure it out.  But then people will have, you know, storm off in a tizzy.  But you actually all like each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I had never encountered this and maybe it's because we started working together, Steve.  But now I've got people who will do the same thing.  What, storm off?  Yeah, they'll say, I'm not going to be on the show with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, you can blame that on me.  But, you know, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's never, it's not you, Steve.  That's the funny thing. Everybody likes you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess, you know, if I start doing this live on TV, I think you'll see that there's a lot of smiling going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry that we didn't get your video because that was a really nice looking video.  We got it this week. Let's get it working.  Well, I was using the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, underpowered, underpowered.  No, no, I think there's plenty of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm telling you, the air is, I think that they're going to announce something about the air tomorrow.  Well, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was actually, I was very tempted to get an air when I got one for Abby.  I thought, you know, I should get one.  Then I thought, no, I'm going to wait.  You never want to buy anything before Steve speaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have or after we'll get to it.  Yeah, wait till I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then it's safe to buy.  That it's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I just think that something's going on with not the touch interface so much on the air,  but the ability to be able to, I mean, I've got this nice little 3G card from AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Patrick, wait a minute, Patrick, what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a combination of the baby doing something very strange upstairs involving a not quite rolling toy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it doesn't sound like that. It sounds like you're opening packages or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorting through a stack of magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Are you tearing little corners off of each one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was trying. I was basically moving one pile to another.  No, it doesn't sound like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like a panda is chewing some eucalyptus leaves or something going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's no pandas in there.  What are those?  I think I may have been chewing on the inside of my cheek because I kept thinking there was somebody walked up and said,  you work with so and so and so and so and they're just, it must be, are they as wonderful in real life?  And I remember thinking like how in the office everybody pretends to function well.  Imagine if your office was broadcast live in front of a large audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm proud to say that I am the Mike Scott of Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, did you hear Bomber said that there won't be magazines for 10 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bomber's right. Don't you think Bomber's right?  No.  Arthur Oaks Salzberger said there won't be a New York Times print edition in 10 years.  Well, I think that's right.  Well, why would a magazine survive when newspapers don't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Airplanes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The John. Airplanes, I like that. Maybe. I guess you're right. Airplanes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they've also, but as someone who started out with magazines, but I mean,  magazines have changed so much in the last decade for a lot of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But aren't they hideously expensive to produce now and going up?  And are people buying advertising in them? And are people, I mean, maybe that's wishful thinking.  Steve Bomber thinks everything's going to go online, but you still need something for the first 10,000 feet, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now here's a question for the esteemed panel.  Can I leave the Kindle on and read the Kindle while we're taking off?  No, not according to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can as long as they don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It doesn't look, but it looks like a computer.  Does it?  Yeah, it looks too much like a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You think that they're going to say you're looking at a computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There have been complaints about iPhones who people, they didn't realize that the iPhone could be put in airplane mode.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they think it's a phone.  But that's just stupid because every phone can be put, I mean, in Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, I've had, I've actually physically taken a phone out of somebody's hand on takeoff.  Oh, I love you, Patrick.  Well, yeah, but I mean, it was just, you know, everybody knows that's ****.  I'm like, you know what? If I die, my hands are going to be wrapped around your throat when we barrel in at 600 knots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. It may be, it may be, but just in case, could you turn it off? Just in case.  And I don't want to hear you and your business deal while I'm sitting here in terror.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While I'm sitting here concentrating very hard on keeping the poorly aerodynamically designed sheet in clean air.  But I mean, it's, but it's from, I met some, we actually had some guys show up once that were avionics technicians for United.  Right.  And partially because of a whole, you know, we hate anything not made in the United States.  They all claim they will never ever ride on any, any Airbus planes.  They also, they had, they had no problem with planes with phones on takeoffs.  They've, they felt on certain planes they really didn't want anybody using a phone on landing.  Oh, really? It was the landing.  Well, they consider the landings are a little, a little sketchier.  Landings are sketchier than takeoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you why they don't want people working with anything like electronics during takeoff and landing.  It's because they want their full attention in case something goes wrong.  They want to get everybody's attention.  But essentially that same reason they won't let you like have like an iPod or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, in Canada they make you take the headphones out of your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. You need to be, you need to be attentive to what's going on because that's when they're going to want your attention most.  They don't want anybody not paying attention during that first 10,000, the last 10,000 because there's things that could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they want to maintain a firm grip on your wallet. I think that's why they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying is do you think a Kindle is a problem?  Because I'm frankly, that would be the only compelling reason for magazines or books to survive in my opinion is just for the first 10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised. I'm surprised they don't make you take magazines.  I'm sure they don't make you put magazines away because that's distracting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. How am I show of hands when they say, could you please cease your conversation so we could tell you how to put on your life preserver?  Do you cease your conversations? No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have ignored the safety dance far too many times already.  We've seen it. We've seen it many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you ready for are you ready for gossip? Are you ready for murder, mayhem, sex, drugs and rock and roll?  I love this one. All right.  Let's start with the hands riser story since since obviously Mr. Schwartz is taking great rags. Did you ever know hands riser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't. I've actually not met him, not exchanged email with him. I don't even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's a Linux programmer who wrote the riser FS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even run Linux on anything that matters. So it doesn't matter to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the riser FS was the first journal file system. You know, you had the choice between the EXT2 and riser. It was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for them. Well, the story of hands.  This is this is just insane.  And I'm mostly interested in the story because I'm I'm I'm amused by it.  I'm shocked by it. And for those of you that don't know in the audience there, apparently hands riser has offered to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We should say he was convicted of murdering his wife, even though his wife, Nina, even though nobody was ever found or murder weapon or murder weapon.  In fact, some people said, you know, this isn't this isn't really right.  They convicted him basically because he was a nerd and he did weird things like pull a seat out of his car.  And his attorney said, you know, he's just a weirdo. We acknowledge he's a weirdo, but he's not a murderer.  However, so but he was convicted. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, first degree murder, first first degree, which carries 25 to life.  So what he's trying to do now through his attorney, apparently, is he's saying, could you reduce that to second degree murder?  Yeah. If I show you where the body is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't do it. This is insane.  And my wife fled to Russia. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the Russian angle of it. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, if you do reduce my sense, I'll show you where she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I just I couldn't stop laughing.  And I posted this in my jacuzzi thread.  I have people commenting on that. Just insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like somebody said in the chat room, it's just a theory in the chat room says he's the nerd.  Oh, J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With all the company company features, we finally have our nerd.  Oh, J. Oh, this is just this is just you know, they're not going to believe that when they make the TV movie about this, which you know they will when they get to this part, the editor is going to have to scribble that out and say it ain't no way this ever possibly happened.  And we'll pull up the wire. Nobody would believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Well, there's your murder story.  Yeah.  The story too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing what a person will make you do.  Huh?  Amazing what a, is he been a, I have this vision of him getting to prison at about 48 hours later calling up his lawyer and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll do anything. I'll do anything to get out of it now.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not like he was out scouring the streets looking for her while he was going through trial because he was in jail the whole time.  Wasn't it? Wasn't on bail?  Their big mistake was letting him testify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was on the stand 11 different times had the crate.  I mean, this thing was crazy.  You know, they, I don't even want to read.  If you want to read, somebody's going to write the book and make the movie because it'll be incredible.  Wired stories are really comprehensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So check it out on the Wired website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is in jail without bail.  His sentencing is July 9th.  And apparently they're contemplating.  Well, I mean, show us the body.  I can't believe it.  They want the body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know where she is, but she's probably right there.  I didn't kill her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's in Russia.  But if it will help my case, we met the Russian River.  Not Russia.  Not the actual Russia.  Here's the sex and drugs.  Yes.  Henry T. Nicholas III, who has one of the best names in.  He's the billionaire founder of Broadcom.  He's been indicted on narcotics charges that include allegations.  He slipped ecstasy into the drinks of business associates.  Maintained a drug warehouse with ecstasy, methamphetamines, cocaine,  and concealed his illegal contact with bribes and death threats.  He's also been charged with 21 counts.  This actually all started because of a stock options back dating scandal.  He's got 21 counts of stock options back dating.  But then as the trial or I guess the indictment went on, they included a lot of other stuff.  The guy's a billionaire.  He's got a lot of money.  It's an 18 page indictment.  And I'm looking at a story from The Telegraph in the UK, which in the UK they have a greater sense of scandal than we do.  In one of the counts, the Department of Justice alleges that Nicholas told a Broadcom employee to hand five to ten thousand dollars in cash to a drug courier in the company's lobby.  In another, on a plane he had chartered to fly from Orange County to Vegas, he smoked so much marijuana that smoke and fumes entered the cockpit forcing the pilot to don an oxygen mask.  Could you please turn off your Kindle and put the doobie down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, there's there's I mean, on one hand, the only reason this is a story is because, you know, it's a CEO at Broadcom.  I mean, if this was a rock star or any of a lot of people.  Good point.  There are scumbags everywhere and this is all horrible and terrible and wrong.  And but the reality is, is the only reason this is a story on Twitter is because it's somebody who has a distressed relationship with the technology industry.  Well, that's right.  But hang on a second, guys.  E-X and Nerns can't be scumbags too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about you guys, but I haven't in a long time.  But I used to be in that culture.  Really?  Twenty five years ago.  Okay.  And there is one thing that you learn about drugs is it really does affect your judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He built really?  He built a cave.  In fact, there's actually a picture of him giving a tour.  I got to show you.  I got to show you guys.  This is the cave.  He built a cave.  He's great.  Picture of him in the telegraph showing off his tunnel under his house.  He looks like Vincent Price in the I mean, this is crazy stuff.  Darth Vader.  The guy, the other reason this is a big story, it is a tech story because he drugged other tech executives or is alleged to have drugged other tech executives.  But also it's a story because he's got so much money, the guy's a multi-billionaire that he's, you know, I mean, he could do more than the average bear.  He's got more money than Mick Jagger.  And he can, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But all Mick Jagger's victims are voluntary.  Good point.  We're happy about their experience in the end.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does this mean?  Does this mean that back dating leads to harder stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently.  Back dating's a gateway drug.  Yeah, they're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can have a very special announcement tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then finally, if you were going to write the story of Nolan Bushnell's life and make a movie of it, who would you pick?  What Hollywood star would you pick to star in the biopic of Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari?  Of course, everyone knows Leonardo DiCaprio.  They look alike.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  That's enough.  That's our gossip section for today.  I don't want to make you guys crazy nuts.  Can we go back to technology, Leo?  I just couldn't resist that.  That's great.  That's great.  Chuck E. Cheese.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
