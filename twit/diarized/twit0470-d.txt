It's like well, what startup has like flutter?  So it is going to be the story of flutter. I was thinking of calling it flutter colon the study story of flutter  But nobody knows how to start a son of flutter son of flutter could be that or year zero to  The flutter years, but it won't be it won't be a sequel to year zero  It'll be just sort of written in the same very general universe, but it won't be about music at old aliens  Yeah, it'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But a lot of confusion about a novel by Rob Reid you'll know you have the right one when you see the alien  listening to music on the cover actually I'm gonna change tack I was gonna start with the  the hacker revelations at  Defcon and black hat, but you know down that you mentioned social media. I think this has been the summer of negative  News about social media in many respects this week. We learned that secret whisper and other social  secret social media networks have hired a company in the Philippines to screen all of the  Messages to make sure there's no bullying or harassment going on  a  Facebook decided to split Facebook and messenger and a lot of hue and cry over the privacy  issues with messenger  Four Square and swarm also split  This has been an interesting summer for social media  I actually deleted Facebook and Facebook Messenger from my phone this week Facebook  It's not I don't know if it's happened to everybody but it happened to me  Starting Wednesday they if you were using the Facebook app on your smartphone. It said sorry, you can't use messenger anymore  You have to get a separate app download messenger  So I did and then I found I couldn't turn off notifications for more than a few hours and little chat heads kept popping up  Oh gosh, so I just deleted and you go offline though on messenger  Well, I actually got some help when this is a we're gonna make this a little tip from the radio show  You can't in the messenger app  You go to turn off notifications, I'm actually gonna show it to you because it's it's so annoying  You go to turn off notifications  Where's the messenger app? I reinstalled it just so I could demonstrate this  If you go into notifications and and you say I want to turn them off  You go off it says okay. We'll mute notifications. Would you like it to be for one hour or until 8 a.m?  Wow, that's your choice  Now every other

Start time: 539.50
End time: 550.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would say you could say I don't general everything right it to mute everything can't you just mute  Each of them individually completely by unchecking them. No, here's the checkboxes

Start time: 550.26
End time: 582.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can turn off notification previews vibrate light sound you could choose a ring tone  And you could have a free call vibrate on lane ring  But you can't disable any granularly any of these and if you do the off it says oh, yeah, great  No problem. We'll turn it off for an hour or until the next tomorrow morning, which would you prefer now?  That was enough for me to uninstall it because I don't want chat heads pop by the way. I started having chat heads pop up on  Other apps oh my god it had turned my Android phone into that horrific Facebook home phone

Start time: 583.36
End time: 596.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a soul that is incredibly mean like there's so many things that are wrong about that  But I think what offends me the most is to keep it shut off  You would have to get up at 8 in the morning every single  It's not a morning person that alone doesn't seem right

Start time: 596.54
End time: 621.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't seem somebody very kindly showed me that at least on this phone  And I think this is true on Android in general in the settings you can if you go into the app settings on an Android phone  You can say I want all notifications turned off for that app  So I'm hoping that that that in fact does does prohibit prohibit this I guess you can globally prohibit it  But that's not certainly was not Facebook's intent that you have to do it at the system level

Start time: 621.78
End time: 627.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a system level thing that that allows you to block everything that all the notifications that come of this app

Start time: 628.22
End time: 645.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my fear will also break it will probably break it  This is a this is the one plus one phone and it has cyanogen mod  Which has this great thing called privacy guard when privacy guard has enabled the app will not be able to access personal data like  Contacts messages or call logs by turning that on I'm probably breaking messenger

Start time: 645.82
End time: 660.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but I did turn that on and I disable notifications the trouble with that is you have to turn that on at 6 in the morning  every  Terrible feature. I think that's a reasonable time and in  Wherever Samsung is but it yeah, and people are pointing out well

Start time: 660.06
End time: 702.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no point having Facebook Messenger if you don't have notifications  But the way I like to use Facebook is not have it push stuff at me, right?  But when I open it up I could see what messages people have sent  Yeah, and now I have to do that on desktop not a big deal, but I just I feel like  Facebook is as usual pushing it as far as it can until people go hey wait a minute  There are other issues with the new Facebook Messenger Facebook says it's not our fault. It's Android's fault for instance  Among the permissions you give it when you install it are the right to make phone calls without your permission  They say well, that's we don't want to but the Android makes us  Ask for that right

Start time: 705.48
End time: 725.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says I'm not sure what they're trying to do with that  Permission but I think what they said was that they can't change the text for that permission which makes sense  But they they're not actually going to be making phone calls without their permission. But yeah, as you're reading there's no  Option for them to clarify this

Start time: 727.04
End time: 793.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually want to do we've seen that with text messages where if for instance  What's app the way what's app validates your whatsapp account is it sends a text message to your phone number?  Which it then can read so it has to both send the message and read it and  So you have to give it permission to send and receive and read your text message, right?  But it's just for that constrained purpose. I don't know what the phone call permission could possibly phone calls without your permission  so weird and  And then there's the issue of it and I think others  other programs do this  It  Tracks you all the time because so it could put your location in. Yep  Presumably sending that information back to Facebook. I don't know if I care about that, but that's another I mean the phone's tracking you all the time  he's also  and  apparently  When  There's something called passive listening  Messenger may listen to the first 15 seconds of the audio  That's going on while you're writing a status update so that it can say what you're listening to  God update

Start time: 796.08
End time: 800.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do like a sound hound thing and like yeah, oh, you know listening to in sync

Start time: 802.84
End time: 818.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some one on Twitter  Guillaume is telling me that the permission for the phone call thing is so that you are able to click on call  When you're speaking to someone when you're talking to someone to call them, so that's the free calling feature. So you press call

Start time: 819.26
End time: 864.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really Skype I think you press call and it makes that call  So it has to be the app has to have that permission that makes sense  It also the app has a permission to take pictures and videos with the camera at any time without your confirmation  I understand people being scared by this stuff. Yeah  But Facebook says no, but we have to say it that way because that's how the text reads in the permission  They say the pictures and videos is so that you can take pictures and videos within the messenger app  So the app has to be able to do that  Recording audio so that you can send voice messages make free voice calls and send videos directly. So there's reasons for all of this. I  Don't blame Facebook on that actually really was the notification thing that drove me up the wall

Start time: 866.14
End time: 914.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, I guess even for that  Though if they knew, you know, they're testing their application. It seems like my video quality is really bad  Isn't  Sorry  but  They know their their  product  Hopefully they knew what was going to how it was going to work in that respect as well and they should have I don't know  It's really hard  But shouldn't they have anticipated that issue and said we're you know, it to some people at least to the journalists  We know we have these weird permissions that we need to ask for but this is why  We have to ask for them and at least you know give give  weapons to the to the journalists that would see that thing coming to answer the the concerns of the  Of the public it seems at least they should have done the other way to do

Start time: 914.62
End time: 993.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the way iPhone does it which is on installation. It doesn't ask you anything  But when the issue comes up in the context it says in contact  Yeah, yeah, and I think that might be a better way to do it than how Android doesn't sure  They spoke about it on TNT and Mike posted Mike Elgin our news director posted the very long list of  permissions that Facebook Messenger requires access to identity contacts calendar location SMS phone photos media files the camera the microphone  Wi-Fi connection information device ID and call and free. That's pretty much everything. Yeah, does that leave anything out?  So no wonder there's a market for this. This is the black phone which is now on sale from silent  From silent circle this is a it's from Switzerland, so it's got to be good. It's got to be good. Yeah Swiss  No privacy Swiss phone as accurate as a Swiss phone. It's as good. It's a Swiss watch of phones. Yes secure by design first of all  Yes, it's Android, but it's a special version of Android called private OS  It does not allow you I would guess  Certainly doesn't that give you access to any of the Google services including the Play Store  I presume it does not allow you to download any application otherwise. It wouldn't be a very secure phone, right?  It does come with privacy enabled applications

Start time: 995.58
End time: 1031.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Smart is cool, but you know you're saying Leo no wonder there's a market for that phone  Is there really I mean there's gonna be people who are going to want to buy it?  But is can we really say there's a market for a phone like this because people you know people are gonna be  Interested in the concept of okay. I'm gonna have a phone that's actually secure and private cool now  Where's my Facebook right?  Maybe not us it doesn't do any of the things you want to do. How do I get to the supermarket right? Where's the nearest gas station?  It's cool that that phone exists, and I think it should but I don't know if it's gonna be very successful

Start time: 1033.26
End time: 1069.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this this is one of the things one of the kind of the motifs the leitmotifs of this summer and social media  Started with the right to be forgotten in Europe and the European court recording Google a report requiring Google to  Delete search results for people who requested it because they don't want the world to remember  That they went bankrupt or they had molested children or whatever it is  They didn't want people to know about it strikes me that the internet and smartphones  Especially are not private and then if you try to make them private you break them mm-hmm

Start time: 1071.00
End time: 1121.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the case well it's an interesting it's it's kind of a duel between  you know privacy anonymity and the services that people want to access and  You know there's an interesting debate going on about secret and so forth about whether anonymous speech is something  That's almost they don't quite put it this way  But it's almost a question that some people are posing of whether anonymous speech is something that's worth protecting  And I think that that debate has for all intents and purposes  Bubbled up in Pando daily and some other places as people have been debating that kind of you know those kinds of services  And yeah, you know if you try in the black phone is a great case in point  It'll be very interesting to see if it does succeed because you know  getting that great degree of privacy will inevitably result in a far less functional phone and  It'll be it'll be interesting to see how these things play out in the marketplace  Somebody in the chair pointed out

Start time: 1121.90
End time: 1133.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure this is the case that the Facebook messenger requires no more permissions than Google's own hangouts app than whatsapp  Yeah, I mean any messaging program is going to require those it's the nature of messaging. Yeah, and I sometimes think that

Start time: 1135.00
End time: 1161.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know we in the tech press community  Get more agitated about these issues than the general public does I remember there was an interesting story  When one of the sort of privacy things kicked up about Facebook they were asking  Somebody to survey and basically asked x hundred or x thousand people  What would you be willing to sell more or less unbounded access to you know your personal information for?  Most people are like three or four bucks right most

Start time: 1161.88
End time: 1180.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Care that no people want they want control yes what they they don't it's not necessarily that they wouldn't give it to you  But they want to control it yeah, and for instance Google now is a great value to me  And in order for that to work Google has to know more than  More than a little about my whereabouts and what I'm doing, but I find it very useful. It's fascinating

Start time: 1180.64
End time: 1192.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a fair trade. It's fascinating when it comes up with an amazing message like your flights late, right?  Or there's a traffic jam between here and the airport right leave. I see you're at the airport. Here's your check-in exactly all that stuff

Start time: 1192.16
End time: 1193.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very useful

Start time: 1194.88
End time: 1283.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a lot of the the  Very important piece of information that's lost in a lot of those debates about privacy  As you were saying Rob it's  Well both of you actually it's completely part of that package right if you  Want to protect your privacy you you are going to lose all of these functionalities  But the problem is in the tech community  We often often focus on the privacy aspect and say it's important to protect and to  Protect all of to protect all of this  But we don't explain to the people that  we are yelling these  problems to  That if they want to go the privacy route, they're going to lose all of these functionalities and  That's definitely a problem. And I think the the key piece of information to take away from this is  What you were mentioning Leo control and that's where the real  Issue is a lot of these companies are not willing to give us control of the of the the  how we provide the information and  So I fear that by asking for basically to summarize my my my thought here  We're sort of fighting the wrong battle when we're trying to say we absolutely need privacy  What we absolutely need is control not privacy itself

Start time: 1285.04
End time: 1291.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's an important distinction and I think the control to turn off notifications even and then also I think of really a

Start time: 1292.22
End time: 1342.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  vital piece of it is something that you you  Glancingly touched on but as we're having this conversation, I think it's very important which is  Contextual notifications. I mean so what happens is typically you'll sign a EULA and it gives somebody blanket permission to do absolutely  Everything and it comes at you 90 pages and three-point font and nobody reads that. Yeah  Is that notification? Yes, is it transparency? Absolutely not and presenting you the useful information in context  I think that's transparency. I don't think like this massive disclosure  It's kind of like we walk into any garage in California now  Somewhere on the wall like a huge public parking lot somewhere on the wall on the third floor is this massive notice that says  this facility contains  Elements that could be carcinogenic and it's probably some good-natured law that said we need to alert

Start time: 1343.06
End time: 1348.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  55 yeah, it's everywhere in California. It's everywhere and by doing it they've completely dulled

Start time: 1349.72
End time: 1359.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally I'm back to these warnings that the warning has no impact whatsoever. Everything causes cancer  So that sign is everywhere its ubiquity and its sweeping this makes it useless

End time: 1382.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I first learned this lesson when I was in fifth grade. We went to a power plant  I remember this very well and even this is a fifth grade. This is in the  60s  Everywhere in the power plant had signs that said conserve conserve conserve, you know be green even in those days  Wow, and my teacher said well they do that for a reason because the more you see it the less you think about

Well, no, I mean no the opposite  I mean, I was sleeping in in  wooden houses in Kyoto when I was living there and you would have  fuel like a  gas-based  heaters and  Anyway, so yeah, that was not good at all. It was very very frightening. But either way I should warn you that

Start time: 1484.14
End time: 1507.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Benzene has been known by the state of California to cause cancer. I think it's important to make that point  I just want to make sure we follow the prop 65. What is  You know, we've actually been thinking should we have the cookies warning on our Twitter site because of course we said every site has cookies  Yeah  Warning this site uses cookies should be but should would do we need to have it?

I mean Google is doing it and initially  Don't you just go to Google.com if you want to find something because it's only  Google that fr yeah, but of course, but I don't think I don't know how many people will actually do that  They'll just Google something and not find the result that would have been in  Criminating or that that others wanted to have hidden and of course, you know journalists might might still look into that  But generally the the reaction has been  widespread ignorance of any of that issue  except  Google has been  Act, you know acting on it so diligently and so quickly that they actually  provoked a very high  visibility reactions the Guardian and other very big outlets have  Very big outlets have  Mentioned it and talked about it and complained about it. So there's a very that was Google's intent by the way  Well, exactly. Exactly. That's that's a lot of people are saying actually Google legally  They were not bound by the decision at that point  So a lot of people are saying they went really far really fast in order to shine a light on the issues that this would  Cause and now that they have actually I think they're not necessarily going to to revise the issue right now  But there are votes coming up in the next few weeks or months and I don't think people are  Ignoring the issue in the same way anymore. At least people understand the consequences of that specific  Decision and that specific route that they would have maybe gone if if Google hadn't gone so far  In this instance, so it's probably a good thing

Transcript:  Wikipedia very upset  By in fact  They've started to replace pages that are blanked by the right to be forgotten on Wikipedia because there's quite a few  with notices  This page has been deleted or or blocked due to the right to be forgotten. They want to call attention to it  Because  Of course as as Jimmy Wales has said  He had a great quote. I don't can't find it here. But  you know, he has stuff he'd like to have forgotten but but

Transcript:  Of course and the big I mean you've discussed this already  But the big issue is that they're not actually if they legally had a right to go and remove that content  Then of course go do that. But the the index the index indexation of that content  Removing that is very questionable  And actually the EU you were talking about the notice that Wikipedia is putting up for those pages  the EU actually gave a call to Google and Bing because  When they were accepting removal removal of content  To a specific site  they would send an email to the webmaster of that site informing them of  the removal which is possibly why the Guardian and others have  Actually found out or realized the extent to which so and the EU was what it was calling Google apparently saying  You can't do that or you know, we need to talk about this because this defeats the purpose  So I was saying they realize the issue  Now, but maybe they actually don't quite quite get it. I think Google's very K. They deleted

Transcript:  91,000 search results 91,000 pages. I think very cagey doing it aggressively and early to raise the issue  Wikimedia  Had its conference the annual Wikimania conference in London this weekend. Here's the quote from Jimmy Wales  He called the EU's right to be forgotten as deeply immoral  He warned the ruling will result in an internet ridden riddled with memory holes  But this was my favorite quote. He says I've been in the public eye for quite some time  Some people say good things some people say bad things. That's history  And I would never use any kind of legal process like this to try to suppress the truth history is a human right  and one of the worst things a person can do is  To attempt to use force to silence another hmm, and I think that's a that's pretty right on

Transcript:  Well, another interesting aspect of this is the blowback that some people have unintentionally triggered on themselves  Did you hear the story about the the guy who wanted to have it forgotten that he went to a tantric sex workshop?  So there was somebody who did a takedown notice of an article from the 90s that mentioned in passing  He attended this tantric sex workshop  So, of course the Wall Street Journal immediately writes an article about this fact and calls the guy up and interviews him.

Transcript:  Okay, is there is there another side to the story though if we try to take you know  That I'm gonna try and be the devil's advocate for just a second that poor guy  who  defaulted on his payment in Spain in  Like 15 or 20 years at the source the original case the original one  Where the the the Spanish court called on the EU to get there, you know a decision on a specific aspect of that of that  of that case  Should you because you've it's not even something bad that you've done  It's just something that happened to you or you know, you were in a in an unfortunate  Situation  Google is go if that's the only thing that you've ever done or that has your name on the internet  That's always gonna come back. It's always whenever you know, no matter what you do and there might be some  public records  There that you can't really go to and ask them to remove  Because it's public record and it's important to have the public records as well  But the effect that Google has is that it makes this one thing that is on the internet  The sum of your life, right? So isn't there an argument to maybe not  The right to be forgotten to be enforced in that specific way  But isn't there an argument to be made that maybe that is also not a good thing and we should try to address it somehow

Transcript:  But is it Google's job or is it your job to create more stuff?  So that it's not the only thing that appears on the in release a pop song immediately do more stuff. I agree  It's not fair and it's not right and of course to further your point Patrick  Google does exercise maybe it's algorithmically but editorial judgment about what your life is  It decides what search results are important about you and what aren't it? It says well, it's done by an algorithm that is  You know completely unbiased and so forth, but I think the any algorithm has bias built into it

Start time: 1993.44
End time: 1999.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1999.76

Start time: 2007.44
End time: 2015.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah encryption. There you go. That's now while we all think that's a good thing  That's an example of editorial control and as soon as Google does that once  Yeah

Start time: 2015.40
End time: 2049.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then it is now exerting some editorial control over your search results and they are so all powerful in terms of driving traffic to sites  That their you know editorial judgment about whether encryption or sort of policy judgment almost has the effect of  Enforceable government policy it becomes so powerful because they are so significant and in this particular case  I think yeah more encryption is great  But it gives you they're almost in a position or they are in a position to de facto regulate the Internet  It's just fascinating. So just so you know on this on this editorial on this story

Start time: 2049.22
End time: 2112.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just so you know a Google has decided that among all the signals it accepts to rank pages  It's going to add another signal whether the page is using strong encryption HTTPS  By default which most pages ours does not most pages don't yeah  Because there's no reason for me to encrypt the data that I'm sending  To you until now, but now there is yeah, and I agree  I mean we we we on security now. We've talked about the this idea of HTTPS everywhere  It wasn't done originally because of the overhead the calculation overhead and now computers  I'm sorry, sir  So it's fast enough more than fast enough there really isn't a penalty or much of a penalty for securing the traffic  But there is an expense you have to get a secure certificate. That's not free right it's hundreds and hundreds of dollars in some cases thousands of dollars  There's no reason for me to encrypt the traffic that's coming to you from twit or any of my pages right or encrypt your traffic to me  so  That's an interesting thing that Google's imposing on us

Start time: 2113.82
End time: 2143.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually  enacting  Shaping I think you know you were talking about editorial  Control that Google has this is it causes pauses an even bigger question  They're actually influencing the architecture on the internet in this case  We're super happy that they're doing it for the right reasons and in the right way  What about you know they decide that they are going to bump up the sites that they that use VP 9 or how's it called?

Transcript:  It's it's that there's always been the fear and I trust Google. You know I use Google for everything  But and I actually think that they're out there to in some ways  While making a lot of money they do have initiatives that seem to be furthering the the common good  But that being said I'm just saying that here. They're stepping into  actually  shaping the internet's technical  Infrastructure and and through their algorithm. I think that's done that before a little bit

Transcript:  It's a very lightweight signal affecting fewer than 1% of global queries  And carrying less weight than other signals such as high quality content while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS  But over time this is Google writing we may decide to strengthen it because we'd like to encourage all website owners to switch  To HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.

Transcript:  We tried to get Steve on Steve Gibson on this episode, but he'll be talking on Tuesday about bad  USB we'd been hearing about this before but the black hat  Conference  finally revealed the details of the bad USB  Hack and father Robert balacer who was there and he'll be talking about it on twit said it was the talk of the conference  Very active very interesting Q&A afterwards. It's kind of stunning kind of hard to believe  the researchers who discovered bad USB  Found that almost all USB devices including most USB keys most USB drives have  Reprogramble firmware with the right hardware, which is widely available easy to get you can modify the firmware to carry a malware  Payload in a such a way that it's indetectable  Hmm can't be removed and could bite you bad  Sounds very Stuxnet II. Well, it's interesting because Stuxnet which was the virus that infected the  Iranian  Centrifuges where they were enriching  uranium for building we  People thought perhaps nuclear bombs  Those centrifuges they were made by Siemens, right? Yep  They they use the SCADA system. Yep, and they were air gapped  That's a good protection right you don't connect these things to the internet because that's how malware gets in  but unfortunately for them not for us, I guess I  Think it was probably some governmental agency managed to subvert somebody who worked there give him a USB key  Which yes thumb drives. Yeah plugged into the SCADA. Yeah  Modified it and I think it caused the USB it either caused the centrifuges  To spin up to such a high rate that they broke or play AC DC music. I'm not sure it was one of those  But in either event, it slowed down the enrichment process considerably  So the difference there is that was an auto run. We believe we don't know. Yep. I talked about this with Steve last week  It's thought but not known that that might have been an auto run on those USB got it  Yeah keys and of course we've known about that for a long time  But this is worse because it's in the firmware. Yeah, and the real revelation  I think had we known this I don't think it would have been so hard to figure this out  The real revelation is that so many thumb drives have reprogrammable firmware. I know idea  Capability they have EE proms on them. Yeah  Why who would have thought that?  This is the research comes from SR labs  The details are on their website  They say the versatility of USB is also its Achilles heel since different device classes can plug into the same connectors  One type of device can turn into a more capable or malicious type without the user noticing  So that's that's part of the issue is it doesn't it could be a it could be a phone that you're plugging in but it could be  Seen as a mass storage device and copy data over and so forth  And we're back to the to the balance between security and and convenience

Start time: 2677.64
End time: 2703.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, the convenience of the USB which is what what made it  So what makes it so widely used and and well convenient is what makes this hack possible and  It's the most frightening thing about all of this is that there is no real solution  To to there's no fix there or at least no easy fix  We're gonna talk a lot about it

Start time: 2704.38
End time: 2747.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure on Tuesday and security now and that's why I wanted to get Steve on but he's out of pocket  As he usually is on Sundays. I've seen articles from a lot of people saying oh, it's no big deal. Don't worry  Yeah, I've seen others say this is the worst thing that's ever happened  The real question is  The real question is is it in the wild because malware can't the malware and in the firmware cannot be detected by normal  Antivirus programs. We don't know although I think  Is it either Norton or McAfee has reported that there have been some bad USB in the wild detected?  So maybe they've come up with some sort of scanner

Start time: 2747.90
End time: 2856.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's it's it's definitely it's definitely frightening and on what you were saying this is kind of  not a big deal and  Hack 5 has built this rubber ducky right that that basically functions in the same way  It's a rubber USB key a rubber duck USB key  That pretends to be something else something that's not a big deal  It's a rubber USB key a rubber duck USB key  That pretends to be something else something other than it is and that allows you to well do a bunch of hacky stuff  But it's very difficult to to figure out who to trust  Is it really the end of the world or is it you know, absolutely not a big deal?  It's probably in this somewhere in the middle, but it's definitely not it doesn't seem benign at all  It seems like something serious that could very possibly lead to  Serious issues and hacks and attacks that being said it's also very new  so even though you can't really identify it when you plug in your USB key because the  the virus scanners  Don't have access to that  EEPROM and so they can read the contents of that ROM to to figure out this is something  Something that's that shouldn't be on there and and remedy it they could  Probably figure out that something weird is happening on your computer  And something, you know, but you're gonna have different types of viruses using that  that  Burn vulnerability  Yeah, that's part of the question is how hard it is to do this

Start time: 2856.70
End time: 2949.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you obviously have to have physical access to the USB key? Do you need EEPROM burning software?  I mean, that's and I'm maybe they did at the presentation. We haven't heard yet  Yeah  We'll find out more about that  The other point to be made is that if any company wanted to be malicious, of course  There's firmware and everything and it'd be easy enough to bury malware into firmware  We're trusting the people we buy our hardware from 100% and there have been plenty of examples of that being a misguided trust malware being delivered  On a new computer that kind of thing  I should also point out that the one of the NSA exploits revealed by Edward Snowden cottonmouth  Three is a USB hardware implant which will provide a wireless bridge into a target network as well as the ability to load  Exploit software on the target PCs the NSA had this years ago  Hmm fact it may even be the same vulnerability. Yeah  One thing we know the NS because we had we had an analyst we didn't  Unwittingly I put an NSA analyst on the show last week  Tano one thing we know for sure the NSA has very smart people working for it. His job was to reverse engineer malware  Presumably so that somebody in another division at the NSA could then use it  They have smart people and if this exploit exists they knew about it at least five years ago  In May 2009 according to the slide  Presentation if they didn't create it themselves, but if you think about it, there's a cut I mean  If you knew all you need is the information that there's a programmable firmware in these things and you'd go

Transcript:  a  Convenience for manufacturers manufacturers said well, it's frequently, you know, we're halfway through the production and oh we got a bug in the firmware  We want to be able to not have to throw out all those USBs  They could and I imagine they some will use unburnable ROMs, but that's been a feature  In fact, it's a feature of iron key, which is one of the most secure  USB keys is that you can reprogram the firmware the firmware is updatable  nice, I  Think iron key has addressed this issue  with signing and other techniques, but I imagine that  There's no reason why especially now you couldn't make a USB key with a ROM. That's unmodifiable  And I think they should put that on the can't can't burn the firmware on the front of the package  But you still trust in the person who made the ROM didn't put something in there and manufacture

I mean he gets he gets all the scoops and Apple really loves  Gruber  He implies that Apple's going to announce their wrist wearable thing next month  He's talking about an article from the verge on how you'll charge a moto 360. Apparently Motorola has announced that their  Smartwatch will use chi charging wireless charging right on great all the watches I've used including the pebble  You have a kind of proprietary dock you get a snap it into  This is the the Android wear watches have the same thing  But Motorola is gonna do a round one and they're gonna built-in chi charging  Here's here's what Gruber says  It looks like Motorola's designers try to draw as much attention as they could to the 360 stupid  Flat tire display shape  The only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn't even ship until after  Apple announces their wrist wearable thing next month knowing John  He's slipping in a little bit of a tidbit there.

I don't know  He's it looks like he's pushing it too much. It's like all right  If you have that piece of information at least you know, we understand  This is no big deal for you because you have you know, all of these  Leaks all the time and all of the information but at least write a couple of sentences on that topic  It's I don't know

Transcript:  It would I would be very surprised if they announced their watch  There I mean it's pretty much established now that they're gearing up to announce the phones right and  Apple traditionally does not announce a new  Product and launch another major product at the same time. It would be that's why I think it he was actually  Trying to make a joke  It would surprise me that they would announce both at the same time. So

Transcript:  But that's why everyone's waiting for Apple to do something right because that's a lot of people say ah, come on  Stop it with Apple. You're always pointing to them to and waiting for them to do something when we already have watches  It's it's exactly the issue  We had with quote-unquote smartphones before they they came up with the iPhone and with tablets before the iPad and a bunch  Of things so that's really the promise that Apple is going to make a product that is going to fulfill a function  We didn't really know we wanted  Because although you're absolutely right. I mean, yeah, that's the thing  We've seen a lot of those watches and none of them are really compelling  So the big question mark is we've seen from Google from a bunch of people and none of them are compelling  So will Apple be able to make that into a useful new product category and make it into a massive?

It's that now we know, you know, they've done it three times  Maybe even more if you count, you know other things  They've done it three times. We're sort of all wondering are they gonna be able to make it again and even more importantly  They have done it in in ways that we didn't really think were we didn't imagine it was gonna happen like that  So the big question is are they gonna come out of left field and do something that we didn't really imagine  That is and that's why we can't really get excited, right?

Transcript:  Speaking of Apple Thunder. Well, let's take a break and I want to talk about the  Persistent rumor that Apple's gonna abandon Intel. That'd be a big blow for Intel wouldn't be big. Yeah, but I think Apple  You got to think Apple's suffering some pain right now  They've been waiting for Intel to come out with its successor to Haswell  the 14 nanometer  Broadwell chip and it's much delayed and Apple's been kind of stuck. They can't release a new Mac  Yeah, or at least not update the new Mac significantly until Intel gets off off the stick and it the delay is  It's been a while now  So we'll talk about that. Is it armed for the next?  First a word from a carbonite. It's online backup time. I  Know people who every time they watch twit. This is their backup time, right?  I'm gonna I'm gonna be listening to twit and I'll be backing up now  That's fine  As long as you don't forget and as long as your hard drive doesn't crash the day before twit and you lose six days worth  Of data the best backup would just be you wouldn't have to think about it, right?  It would just happen be automatic and and more than that. It wouldn't just be on Sundays  It would just be on Sunday  More than that. It wouldn't just be on Sundays  It would be continuous whenever you're online and best of all it would be off-site because as we all know  Having backups sitting next to the computer is a recipe for disaster if there's a fire a flooded tornado  Somebody breaks it and steals your stuff. I love carbonite  Not maybe not the only thing you do you can have a local backup that carbonite now makes a hardware appliance for business  That does both local and cloud backup best of both worlds and that's great because as we know in business high  Availability is important getting back in business is important carbonite is great for business. It's great for home  It is a great way to save because your data because you don't have to think about it  It's very affordable $59.99 a year to back up everything on a Mac or a PC  They have plans for external drives network attached storage small business and all of it automatic  Continuous off-site the things you need now  It's free to try it and I want you to do so by going to carbonite comm and all I ask is  When they say where'd you hear it? What's the offer code use twit?  That way they'll know you heard about it on twit and you'll get two months free if you decide to buy  They've got plans for every user for every situation  But all of it is the best automatic backup you pay once a year  You don't have you can you pay for it and you forget it. That's what I love about it carbonite comm  Try it today. Please use the offer code

He's actually quoting a  16 year old blogger Matt Richmond who wrote a blog in 2011 saying Apple and arms sitting in a tree  Matt said I don't know exactly when but sooner or later Max will run an Apple designed arm chips now as time goes by this becomes  More and more compelling Apple has announced a desktop grade chip for its latest iPhone the a7 right?  They made a big point of it being 64-bit  Intel's way behind on Broadwell  Apple would love to get a Broadwell processor in its max, but they have to wait  even though Apple's one of their biggest customers and  Usually gets the chips before anybody else. They're still waiting  Even  Strong rumors been going on for a long time that there's a skunkworks of Apple. That's porting OS tend to arm  I'm sure that OS 10 and arm is up and running somewhere at one infinite loop  Does this make sense and is it something I imagine be bad news for Intel? I'd be terrible in there

Transcript:  So I mean I think that the reason to do it would probably be margins and control  I mean they certainly hate for somebody else's  Slipping product to slip their own product and that looks like it's gonna happen with the new max in this holiday season  The reason not to do it is probably software compatibility and performance  you know, I mean it's  Intel just is an extraordinarily powerful engine and  You know when you think about way back when they first announced  Transitioning over to Intel had a huge positive impact on the Mac market share. I was so negative about that

Transcript:  Yeah, and and I'm I'm certain that they are at least exploring the possibility again of  Running Mac OS on arm chips as they were  When they had the power PCs and they were you know, they had the blue box and the yellow box  They were running Mac OS on  Intel for a long time or at least it was rumored but it turned out it was probably true  For a long time before actually debuting that transition. I think the problem here is  They've done that transition a few years ago, maybe ten years ago  Yeah, something like that  They they in order for that transition to become  Relevant you need to have a much  Heavier weight on that delay from has well to broad well  It can't a few months of delay is not gonna provoke that  Remember they stuck with power PCs for a very long time  I mean two or three years when they were way way way behind the Intel chips and they were doing  ridiculous things like putting  multiple  CPUs on a motherboard in order to try and get enough to suck enough power out of the  Power PCs that couldn't keep up with Intel and that would also be an issue sure you would have a lot more battery life, but  the a7 the iPhone chip is really powerful for a  Phone for a mobile computer on it. It's yeah exactly for a mobile chip  It's it's nothing like what an Intel, you know PC a desktop class chip can do or even notebook class  So is that true? I mean

Transcript:  There is one big company that's running both Intel and arm  It's called Microsoft and Windows Pro runs on Intel and Windows RT runs on arm admittedly  It's kind of ugly when it comes to running apps because it's not the same app store for both  You know, you can what runs on RT runs on RT and only RT  In fact, I think Microsoft's probably killing our team gonna replace it with Windows Phone on those smaller devices. I  Just think it's possible by the way  We talked last week and I think it was confirmed about the Google case where they caught a child pornographer by scanning  His email and it has been confirmed as we surmised that they did that using hashes provided by the National Center  For missing and exploited children not by looking at email directly and we we at the time  Speculated that perhaps and it seemed likely that other email providers like Yahoo and Microsoft might be doing the same  Guess what Microsoft tip ends an arrest of alleged child porn hustler. Yes the same thing  He was using hotmail to distribute child pornography  Go and in this article by CNET by Derek her  She says Google Facebook and Twitter as well as Microsoft all use something called photo DNA  It's the same technology. The hashes are provided by the National Center of missing and exploited children  And then these companies scan through the images  All images looking for matches and if they find a match they report it to the NCMC MEC  So yes  Microsoft does the same thing  everybody does  So don't worry. It's a good law enforcement  Some good discussion speaking of Microsoft about Microsoft Windows the next generation. The code name is threshold  Believe it or not  Windows 9 is due next spring. It's amazing. How did that happen?

That's you would have celebrated the invention of the paperback  Oh, they're talking about the old days. Actually, this is a misquote  They misquoted George Orwell  They misquoted George Orwell  Which is funny on two levels one because they got it wrong they said or well  they they quoted or well saying public if publishers had any sense that combine against paperbacks and  Suppress them but really the full quote makes it clear  He thinks this is a great thing the penguin paperbacks are only six pence and he thinks he's gonna sell a lot of copies in  1984 and he says in jest if publishers had any sense they stopped this and he said it in jest  He said in jest because he's in he's in favor in fact of paperbacks  That and the fact that Amazon yanked 1984 from its Kindles  without any warning anybody a few years back make this kind of a  dubious  Attribution what was the purpose of that again?

Transcript:  So in France we have a slightly different issue  We have the issue of the fact that book prices are fixed  You cannot discount them more than 5% and that's in order to protect  the small mom-and-pop shops  so that the big the big  Chains and particularly  Supermarkets, yeah, yeah, they can't price down. So are there a lot of small bookshops in in France  Well, the thing is they're dying anyway now because no one you know, even if you don't go to Amazon you're gonna go to the big  Big supermarkets and hyper, you know the costco's of France  And the idea was initially you were those stores would carry, you know  a hundred two hundred different references and you wouldn't get the depth and of culture that you would get in the smaller specialized  Stores because the big guys would only want to get what's that sells and once once good  The issue is now against Amazon you can have obviously a lot more  diversity on Amazon that you can in any tiny store. So that law is kind of  Very difficult to put in place for for this specific context and they also had an issue with the  Free shipping they they said Amazon cannot do the 5% and then they can't do the free shipping  And of course Amazon turned around and did shipping for one cent  Yeah, exactly but I mean this whole show has been

It's tough. Yeah, there's and there's also something to be said about

Transcript:  ease of access and  Again, you know as we've seen many times with the internet the the old monopoly in effect  Crumbling down I went let me give you an example  I went to to the bookstore a few years ago when Game of Thrones starting getting really big and I figured you know  I'm gonna buy it to paper version a dead tree edition and and read it and  I looked at the prices in French for the French versions and  so they what they do is that they they  Divide each book which is admittedly pretty big into two or three small books  And each one of those is sold for  Between 10 and 15 euros sometimes even more  Which is you know about $150? No, I'm kidding. It's like $20 or so  15 to $20 and so you have in the whole series now  I think 15 books maybe even more which are sold for 10 to 15 euros each  So that's you also I mean to work around it. Yes interesting  I understand that the translation is gonna cost you a little bit of money, but that feels like a  Publisher abusing their position so  Well, I don't know I mean I'm sure  We're not back to Orwell George RR Martin

I and Fox it have  the entire crypto locker database keys  So you may remember the crypto locker was a virus that was really ravaging  Computers all over the world you got a an email that said, you know  Somehow got you to run something it would encrypt the hard drive  Pop up a message saying your hard drive is encrypted in 72 hours if you don't give us  $300 or some amount of money. We're just going we're going to  Erase the encryption key and you will never again be able to get your data  It was a devastating hack, but the good news is  Because the infra lot structure of crypto locker was taken down in June by operation Tovar  They actually have the master decryption keys for a lot of  services  That have been hacked a lot of hard drives have been hacked if you go to decrypt  crypto locker  dot  com  FireEye and Fox that are providing  Free keys to unlock your system  So if you're a bit by crypto locker declined to pay or maybe you paid and didn't get the key.
