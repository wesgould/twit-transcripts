You know we have a  large and diverse community and we love our community. It really is what keeps this show going  and all of our shows and we love you all. Last year we had a guy who was very active very much  part of the community. Steve Lauren. He has chat handle was Steven3X and he was just really great.  We had him in the regular in the game on and he was regular in the LAN party and we heard a lot  from him. Right Chad? I mean yeah and he just disappeared in May of last year off the face of  the earth. We just didn't hear from him and that happens from time to time. People get busy in life  or they get tired of us and move on. But we found out recently Dan in our chat room our chat mod  told me that Steven had passed away on May 15th and so his last tweet was just the day before.  It was very sudden. He was a young man 42 and we found his brick. Actually this is a picture he  took of his brick Steven3X. So I just wanted to mention Steven3X and acknowledge him. You know I'm  sure we've had other members of our community pass away. There's so many of you but we just really  care a lot about everybody. So we're thinking of you Steven wherever you are and we thank you  and we miss you and it kind of kind of explains what happened. He just disappeared and we never  really knew.

Transcript:  what yeah Patrick De La Hanty. P De La Hanty in the chat is the web wizard. I'm just the idea guy  who waves his hands and say I got a vision to make someone a virtual ghost and continue to  essentially post previous tweets forever if you don't hit a dead man switch and the idea is  all this talk about like oh when you pass away you have to clean up your digital profile.  There's nothing you can't do. It's done. Well exactly. See I want the opposite. I want to cause  more chaos and mess stuff up because what is a ghost? Like the guy in Demon. You want to

End time: 543.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ghosts if such a thing existed are basically go around doing their daily stuff over and over  and over again like they didn't even know they were dead and so the idea with afterlife.me  was like when you croak your ghost profile continues to tweet the kind of things that  you tweeted when you were alive and it's and like nobody bothered to tell you that you're dead  and the problem was shortly after announcing it Twitter got like way restrictive on their API use  and you had to be an approved partner and they had to like your idea and so that sort of slowed  development on it but I assume that you asked because of some of the other news that's related  to this right well go ahead I don't know it that's the loss of a twitter a twitter

Transcript:  google will have failed if that's how people wind up using this device i think that they there's a  there's a consistent message that google keeps trying to send with this and that's the way that  this is going to succeed or fail if they keep telling you that this is not a way of cutting  yourself off from the real world but a way of becoming more engaged with the real world  because it's a way to share things in the real world with your social circle with your social  net without having to stop take out your phone to activate your activate the camera oh wait switch  it off of movie mode put it back into camera mode stand there look at what you're doing on the  screen so many reasons why i was filled with three and three and a half minutes worth of hatred for  josh one of one is that he stole the louis ck reference that i put into my piece so i had to  pull it and oh no what did he say louis ck has this great has this great bit in his in his current  act when he talks about how he was at the use that a dance recital for for one of his daughters and  everybody's not looking at the daughter they're looking at the daughter on video on their phone  instead of actually watching this that's right and of course he goes on from there but yeah there  is that point so once that doesn't those as much as i disparage using this as a first person  video camera collection device part of it is going to be once the price gets down to a certain level  the value add that certain people are going to have to say that i can be able to watch what's  going on and capture it and share it with the grand grandparents and share it with these other  people in my circle that's going to be worth you know if there's a 500 dollar price tag they're  going to say okay i would pay 180 dollars worth of that is worth that one feature let's see if  the other features total up to 500 dollars or more than 500 bucks to me the glass go ahead mike okay

Transcript:  and they can do it with the google the queue i mean the nexus q really demonstrated how little  risk that google takes by introducing new products right that would have been a humiliating failure  for apple or or microsoft or samsung or any other company to make a big splash announcing this  product then never actually shipping it because they suddenly realized that this was a terrible  terrible idea i mean this is this is every company has its own signature personality its own quirks  about how it how it operates when the when the when glass was first announced where they're  just showing off here's the design prototype and here i am wearing this mock-up and explaining how  this thing is going to work it got a lot that google got razzed a lot for introducing this  pie in the sky thing that they don't know what it does yet they don't know if they're going to  ship it or not and now they have really just a promise to ship at some point and a video  but the fact that they're not like apple that they're not going to just simply wait until they  have something to ship and they know for a fact they're going to start selling these things then  that's when you find out about it that they shouldn't really be dinged for that it's kind  of cool to see them start to play with this device and start to build their own enthusiasm for it and  now that we're in 2013 and we're we've been told that google glass will ship to consumers by the  end of this year it's kind of interesting because it's going to be fun to see what happens when  5 000 people have these and see what they do with them well well and it was presaged in an early

Start time: 3214.66
End time: 3277.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well especially because they didn't show the actual unit they didn't show the controller  was going to be yeah but from what i understand uh that they did the exact same thing with the ps3  and with the ps2 now this comes again not from from me but from my director of digital john  tilton who is an obsessed sony fanboy so he said this is exactly how they do it and i guess i just  missed it the previous go-rounds but they certainly did this i mean they they set the stage what  normally is b level supplemental material on what are the specifics of you could do with particle  physics what titles uh what what creators are on board for all this stuff the stuff that you care  about less than the big info they gave they essentially gave us the director's commentary  track first and then we're going to get the feature at e3 and they certainly supercharged  interest in it so i assume that this is if this is a method that they love to repeat year after  or every time they release a new object then i guess is business as usual and they certainly  did a good job of stoking the fire well and they also stoked microsoft's competitive instincts

Transcript:  one thing that sony did not announce that his ps4 announcement is whether they would have a  blu-ray disc in there although now subsequently sony spokespeople have said yes we're going to  still be using optical discs for game delivery it did say which i thought was odd we'll we'll  pay attention to what games you like and download games ahead of time that you might be wanting to

Start time: 3483.10
End time: 3536.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  buy uh i think this is a great idea because keep in mind it doesn't cost you anything it's not  space that is that is earmarked or or prevents you from downloading other things basically  they know when there's a major release that they're going to purchase uh that there is a  an opportunity to get it pre-downloaded on you know millions of systems and then when somebody  makes that snap decision because how many times have you had that where there's a game you heard  about you're like i don't know if that's for me i don't know if it's that great or whatever and then  all of twitter explodes with like omg best game ever right and you're like okay i'm going to buy  it you go to buy it and it's like tomorrow morning you'll be able to play this game this is this is  just them making bets on this is the this is our bet on the kind of stuff we think you're going to  like uh and it downloads it in advance so that when you make that snap decision it's already  pre-downloaded and you're able to jump in right away i i think there's nothing but win in this

Transcript:  would get this thing done it also responds to a notorious problem with the playstation 4 which is  every time you put a game in you might as well have a cup of coffee because it's going to update

Start time: 3564.66
End time: 3621.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  constantly they also on the other side of that they made it so that when you power it down it  doesn't fully power down it goes into a sleep mode that sort of pauses it so that you're able  to click it and go instantly on already ready to play the game i think they're and power nap  yeah powered up they why don't they call it that that's a great idea i also think that they did a  smart thing with the most derided feature i think was the share button but i also think it's the  most savvy one because uh as leo and i were talking about during the live event the most  surprising trend to me has been the discovery of how many people like to watch other people playing  video games and to build it in at a base level of the console so that you can share your best kill  or or live stream your your playthrough or whatever i i think as silly as that sounds  to a generation that doesn't play game or even the generation that does play games there's an  audience for whom this is going to be an extraordinarily valuable feature the button is

Transcript:  sure but i think what what people want even more than that though and i haven't heard anybody  really announce this yet is i think people want to see their friends faces and watch tv socially  watch television movies whatever socially um i don't know if you guys are fans of japanese  game shows but japanese game shows do this when they when they show some crazy thing the guys  being humiliated or whatever on screen they show they have a panel of like celebrities or whatever  and their faces are there and the audience gets to watch the emotional reactions of these other  people that they care about and i can see that becoming a kind of twitter for television whereas  you watch a movie with somebody who's on the other side of the country and they can you can  see each other and so you can sort of react and kind of you're in the same room enjoying this  content this is great oh go ahead no no i'd really like to see something like that and i i'm almost  certain that something like that is they have to figure out how to make television not only  asynchronous and and separate from the whole live thing and the seasons and all that stuff but also

Transcript:  make it a form of social networking i was going to say that what i like about that observation is  that it taps into a a fundamental aspect of the way we perceive the world which is the importance  of social proof we base our opinions on things whether we like it or not on what other people  think of them and that's the reason we have laugh tracks on uh you know on big bang theory is the  reason that we value yelp it's the reason that we value amazon reviews and to build that in  fundamentally and the ability and in fact that's something that's underserved right now because i  think there exists a market for a class of media curators who decide to present content and give  commentary on it while it happens and the problem is with use team you stream and justin.tv we see  that their software instantly shutting down whenever it's copyrighted content but if we can  have a structure where everybody's bought the movie and you're experiencing it as a group  uh it's yet another way we can virtualize the movie night experience that we've all enjoyed

Transcript:  chat room because of course it's active during shows but when discovery uh landed on mars um  i'm sorry curiosity not discovery curiosity landed on mars people were in the chat room  participating there during the other kind of geek events the chat room is a community that exists  beyond just having twitch shows go on and there's clearly this desire to kind of experience these  things in a virtual space together i think i think it's no there's no doubt the xbox was  designed to get microsoft into the living room sony yes maybe missed a bet by not putting more  social into the playstation 3 they're not going to miss it this time uh they they understand that  they need to be a living room device although they said something interesting which really  surprised me that the number one way people watch netflix is in their playstation 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah this was as i mentioned this was something we talked about on frame rate and this is  at some point for all these devices that want to bring streaming to the living room uh this is  what's great about the positioning of both the ps3 and for the xbox is that they're already there and  by virtue of being overpowered for a simple streaming uh they they are able to provide a  super fast super smooth experience the number one way i watch content on netflix is now my xbox 360  in my living room and the only reason it's not a ps3 is because uh because i didn't have a ps3  until like last month um yeah i think this is great and i think it shows that these consoles  are becoming something more than a place to you know get headshots in the in the living room which  now that i said that sounds like something dirty and i'm tired i'm gonna stop talking it's very

Start time: 3851.46
End time: 3928.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  dirty but i i think that the bigger the bigger thing you're you're tapping into is this whole  it's not only just sort of you know these these game consoles are going to become home servers  they're essentially servers for your home that will control not only your entertainment system  but also your lights and your home automation and sprinkler system and maybe even the security  system and they'll all be tapped in on the internet with like siri or google now and you  know i think we're heading into a world where uh where where these living room systems are going  to be super super powerful i'm really really excited about the next xbox though because of  two technologies that seem to me to be really groundbreaking for gaming and probably some other  things one of them is is a eluma room which is microsoft's technology for projecting environment  of the game on the walls and ceilings and floor of your living room as you're playing it uh this  sounds like a really great idea to me it's really cool thing the other one is that the next version  of connect is supposed to be so refined that it can read lips and doing all these other things  and you know you can see that you have a facial tick and like decide your emotions and all this  kind of stuff so that could be really cool for a lot of things as well so one of the things  that's great about these consoles is they're really driving some pretty interesting technology

Transcript:  when you put it that way i definitely can see that sort of thing but that still requires a little  bit of a shift i love the fact that throughout most of this show we're talking about really  really great ideas that are technologically feasible we have the hardware tech capability  we have the software the networking capability what we really need is for people's perceptions  and their relationships to their technology and communications to shift just enough to allow them  to the to uh i to think about what if i just had a camera that was open all the time on my on my  living room so as i'm taking care of the kids as i'm feeding the dog as i'm playing a game  people that i select that i would like to share this part of my life would be able to see it  well isn't that your vision for google glass too right well that's that's it's more of a discrete  on-off sort of thing there there are a lot of times when i would love to there there are times  when you take you take a snapshot of something and you want to send to some and send it to somebody  because someone is getting into roller derby and they might want to know that there is a venue  opening up in about two months because you just passed by a construction site that's going to have  that as one of their opening night things and the ability to simply not have to stop and  explicitly take a thick picture but simply say oh okay okay glass take a picture now send it  tomorrow and and you're done you're continuing to walk or sharing an event where you are you're in  the third row at your daughter's recital and your your partner is someplace 300 miles away they  can't be there but they can actually see it via hangout the grandparents the friends can see it  via hangout that's a that's a total that's a different thing i mean but this this idea of  my room is next to your room you can see what's going on in my room you can hear what's going on  in my room there's there's a time when when the webcams not that not the naughty kinds of webcams  but the you know that's just the plain jane ones where someone wanted to see hey isn't it cool i've  got enough bandwidth that i can actually keep a webcam going you know because i i there was a time  when i would bookmark a couple of those things because it was kind of interesting being a  freelancer and and having an office of one person where i have this window open where i'm just seeing  another person's random activity day after day after day it was it was a lot like it gave me  sort of the experience of working in a cubicle farm where i don't know necessarily the life of  this other person but i look up say oh i see that mike got a haircut wow and i'm sure if i kind of  like when he had his hair longer okay well what am i working on right now so that's you know what

Transcript:  part is is we're going to put these ideas out there and we can all speculate on where it's going  to go and what the future is going to hold for us but it's really not even up to us it's like all  of us are too old to matter it's going to be my eight-year-old daughter her perception of the  google glass is she going to be more overwhelmed with how cool it is to have an always-on connection  or is she going to be more grossed out by having this you know board-like thing on your face and  it's them who are going to decide what what the future holds so it's like there's some part of me  that's like i mean it's like i dig it but you know let's just sit back and see what the world says

Transcript:  to eight-year-olds have you seen this no but i gotta get it because i've got an eight-year-old  no i don't this is this is but i never did learn algebra so so so the way the dragon box app starts

Start time: 4576.74
End time: 4663.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  off is that it's a game where you have cards and you have two boxes and they're and it deals out  a bunch of cards and your object is to get rid of all the cards on one box except for the dragon box  and uh there's rules for example each card has a light side and a night side and when you put a  night side card on top of a face up one it vanishes or becomes a vortex that you get rid of but  whatever you do on one side you have to do on the other side and and so you master that and then it  starts adding the idea like well some of these are stuck together and to get rid of those two you have  to draw a line and and put an underneath one and again whatever you do on the left side you have to  do the right side and then at some point after you're playing this game it uh it starts replacing  the cards instead of being pictures of dragons and and you know and teddy bears or whatever  they start throwing like fives and fours and then negative c's and then at some point they replace  the dragon box with the letter x and all of a sudden you realize that you're solving for x  and then finally it drops the two the two sides and instead starts expressing everything algebraically  using the proper form my eight-year-old daughter just finished the entire thing i promised her if  she could finish all hundred exercises and get three stars on each i would make her a plaque to  put on the wall saying that she learned algebras at eight years old she already got it man it's  amazing i i can't even put into words how much fun i went back and did it because i just wanted  to remember how this stuff is and the gamification of learning so this is one of the most advances

Start time: 4663.52

Transcript:  thing but in fact you're learning math yeah in fact here i'll go i i actually have here here we  go so this is this is one of the later levels here i don't know if you can actually see it on here  there we go says i just mastered the basics of algebra so let me go so they admitted they admit  it yes finally so if i play i'm going to jump forward to one of the early ones here and i guess  i'll go back near the beginning when you go back near the beginning the initial things are here i'll  just pick one of these at random so in this case you got a bunch of different cards some of them  are on top of each other and so you got to figure out how to oh i get it you get in the box on one  side yeah correct and then in fact and then later on let me see if i can actually go out to one of  the later ones where once you're actually solving for x in a real algebra setup here we go we'll do  this i'll do one of these last ones here you see by the end now all of a sudden it's a over a over  five plus x equals negative c and so you you know again you start figuring out what you need to do  so here we're going to get rid of the five on this we'll do this there we'll pop this over here and  this is stuff my eight-year-old did on the live stream there we go and then we'll do negative  you did the live stream yeah we did it we did just the other day it was fantastic i'm telling you  these guys are are shaping the future education because by gamifying it like she got it instantly  there you go and i solve for x and then i'm done it's it's amazing by 12 more denominators for only  one dollar 99 in that purchase it's a five dollar game you pay you take all my money if that's what

Transcript:  see it's a offers a certain amount of clarity for consumers because a company has to say  we're not going to simply make every phone imaginable we're telling you this is the best  phone you can have right now we believe it so much that we're actually putting all of our  resources behind this one device on the other hand it also means that when will one phone really make  so many people that happy i i think that samsung takes this to a ridiculous degree because now  they have is it now five different phone sizes everything from four inches to 12 inches or  but they certainly benefited from the fact that they had a rational size an iphone like phone  a 4.8 inch phone and then they were able to take a risk on something the size of the note 2  and then when everyone said wow we really love this note too they can say oh what about these  other phones we didn't actually build those see because we had this right all along it's it's it  is a gamble but if they guess right then that's going to pay off really big for them one thing

Transcript:  of view of of news footage yeah and people and they should be at least savvy enough to realize  that they're not going to be able to control this for more than about 10 seconds so they may as  well let it be posted i don't think anybody would doubt that the reason why they wanted to spike that  video is because it showed something horrific happening to this what's being promoted as a very  family-friendly fun american pie sort of event and without acknowledging that maybe sometimes the  carnage that happens in the in the field is going to actually sort of sneak up into the grandstands  but i mean how many how many times have we seen that phrase uh we want we uh we have no comment  because we wish to protect the privacy of the nine-year-old wheelchair brown cancer patient  whom we decided to strip search in public and our tsa line uh that's that's a that's a line that  really has to be banished from all pr pr handbooks from now on because nobody's buying it matthew
