Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  haven't seen them except I think maybe several years ago I may have seen them in a house I used  to own up by the the old compact headquarters but they you know they are mostly the south southwest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  part of town so like a haunted house up by the old compact place it is haunted now yeah they moved  out a few years back and people say it's haunted that's right the ghost of Eckerd Pfeiffer haunts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the house yeah no kidding so it's is it deserted the old compact place well actually it's got you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know it's owned by HP now there are HP signs out there instead of compact signs it's they moved  into about half of the buildings on the campus and they are leasing the others to other businesses  out there so there's definitely a reduced presence but you still go out there and it's still called  compact center drive for the old timers so it brings a tear to my eye well now that we're all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  assembled let me bring up there you know this is this is not a great time of year for tech news  almost everybody's out of town and taking it easy and nobody's nobody's doing anything except for  well one activist judge who decided that well Viacom deserves the IP address of every single  person who ever watched a Viacom video on YouTube YouTube just a Viacom videos or any video well  yeah oh that's a good question it was 12 terabytes of data maybe it's everything I think it's  everybody yeah holy cow that's even worse so what's the story here Viacom Tom air Viacom sues  YouTube for one billion dollars a very nice doctor evil number right and then as part of their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  discovery they want to show that pirated videos were popular on YouTube is they're trying to make  this inducement argument that YouTube is actually encouraging people to use pirated video and and  building their business on pirated video so they want to show that that this idea that people were  watching cats on skateboards or whatever is ludicrous and that you know that's not what  they're there for the video on YouTube was pirated and to do that they asked for Google to hand over  all of this data so they can so that they can comb through it and and show what people were  watching now as part of the court order only outside experts get access to the data Viacom  doesn't actually get direct access to the data and they can only use it to prove that one specific  fact if they try to use it for any other reason they'll be held in contempt of court which  disbar's their lawyers so there are some good effective restrictions on this but it's still  uncomfortable to think that every video that you watched on your IP address is going to be in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  box and somebody's going to have access to it and Google has asked that it only be allowed to present  the viewing data and not necessarily the IP's yeah what do you need the IP's for yeah right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh no there's a reason for the IP's I think probably the reason they want that is to see if  repeat offenders were allowed to just keep uploading stuff have their accounts disabled start a new  account so I think they want to see also if they did enough to sort of protect against it and also  they're probably gonna just sift through this and look for examples of YouTube doing any kind of  curation any type of that's what's important in this if that breaks your DMCA protection your safe  harbor goes away if YouTube has done anything right so that's why on YouTube there is only you  know the most commented on the most viewed the highest rated as opposed to here's a curated list  by a human if they were to make a list of here's our top 20 editors picks they would break the DMCA  because they would have been editing it same thing with Wikipedia if the staff of the Wikipedia  starts editing it they lose their DMCA protection same thing with dig if they start editing their  homepage they would lose their DMCA protection so all the copyright stuff that goes on on dig or  you know other services like that once you start editing it you you all of a sudden become liable

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  somebody made I think was on friend feed somebody made a very good point though doesn't Google keep  pornography very effectively keep pornography off YouTube with an algorithm so why can't they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that for copyright material exactly Viacom's point well aren't I was doing that for copyright

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  material now I think all they're doing right now is waiting for a takedown yeah I think they take

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  still doing that they're not doing no I don't have the hash and remember this is what we're gonna have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this hash for copyright material Google had indicated that they were indeed going to run  some kind of program that would watch for it and kind of bar it and in fact they talked quite a bit  that this was you know in the works and they were certain they could do it I haven't seen any

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  announcement that they have isn't that what killed Napster Napster never could come up with a way to  prevent pirated music from being shared on Napster from what I understand what Google's allowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people to do is if you become a partner with Google's YouTube is what I've heard from people  who are partners they will let the partners I don't think this has ever been come out but they will  let partners go and turn off videos of stuff themselves so like if Vi basically and that's  their way it's sort of a little heavy-handed it's like if you do a deal with us we'll let you take  it down if you don't do a deal with us you have to file DMCA stuff so it's it's a pretty clever  way to get people to sign up to be partners which is you want your South Park stuff taken down become  a partner let's put that here and you can go take it down yourself we're a partner with Google we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a Houston Chronicle yeah we have a director's account and we work you know we have worked with  them we've not been offered anything like that in fact in there have been some situations where we  have had videos we put up that have had background music that's copyrighted that they have taken  down because the back for us they don't ask us to they just do it because it has it has copyrighted

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well it seems like Google you know the EFF was very upset the Electronic Frontier Foundation about  this judge was it Stratton Stanton's willingness to give over this information but that sound like  it's pretty well protected Google kind of got itself into this mess by asserting in other areas  particularly when they're talking about AdSense that the IP address isn't personal information  you know because they log IP addresses when you when you use Google search and they're saying in  their AdSense pages oh well don't worry because that's not personal information that's not exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  personal I mean it's it's not it's like your phone number it's not your social security number it's  it's a phone number for a large house you live in yeah anybody could be at that IP address not  just you so I mean I think some ways either logic anyway yeah in some ways they kind of did this to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  themselves by asserting that the IP address wasn't private so now what's what's the judge  gonna do the judge is gonna say well okay if it's not personal information I guess we can hand it over

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well remember back in 2006 when the feds wanted some detailed search information as they were  trying to reopen right the the decency case right they had lost and they and Google wound up having  to turn it over but I don't they fought it though as I remember it fight they fought it tooth and nail

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and and other search engines did not right everybody else caved and Google fought and we at the time we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  were very complimentary of Google even though they lost yes they did end up losing but I don't know  exactly what they wound up giving them I don't think they necessarily had to give them everything  that the feds initially wanted in the form they wanted yeah it was a reduced request that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ended up agreeing to but you're right I don't remember exactly what it was well in this case

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's 12 terabytes of data and I think Google should just print it all out and hand over books  of this data so you want it here that's about the equivalent of the Library of Congress that have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  use take a couple of those those cartons that they use for the data centers that they want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  drop boxes the data so yeah just print out you know bind them just do it on fan fold that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  equivalent of paying a multi-million dollar judgment in pennies yeah you know you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  exactly I don't think you'll be held in contempt of court for that not to mention the trees that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  would that would go away Danny Sullivan of search engine land Danny's I think pretty good on this  subject said I hope this ruling serves as a flashpoint or a wake-up call to a variety of  people who can make a national privacy standard a reality he's using this as a call to Congress to  say look we've got to protect privacy these things are too easy to give out people are logging it  and look here's somebody who we came I mean I don't think it's gonna have that impact but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  could have easily had that impact I agree I think that's really the point here is is not that anybody  is in too much danger from this there's a lot of restrictions that are very serious restrictions  on what this data can be used for but it does give you pause especially when you consider that  those restrictions might not have been put in place by another judge and that you know data  has a way of finding its way out of restrictions that it's in so without any other regulation and  I'm not really in favor of regulation much but without any kind of guidance we know that judges  aren't always up to speed on these issues we kind of need some sort of standard like this this amount  of data is okay this amount of data is is questionable and this amount of data is not okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it reminds me of the when AOL handed over quote anonymized search results to researchers last  year and I don't remember what reporter it was found just went through the data and found the  woman one of the women and tracked her down and say are these either these years search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh yeah yeah that was some social engineering yeah that was that was the tip of the iceberg  I mean they also found like murder my wife you know like and then the other 20 searches that the  person did so it's like cyanide their wife's name then they do search how to murder they literally  found those kind of exactly and actually there's been a there's been a number of cases now where  they've gone and got people search logs from their computers their history their drop-down form  information and found them searching for cyanide or ways to you know kill people methods for killing  people yours your search logs tell you a lot about you oh yes I think what's gonna happen is a lot of  these companies are gonna come to the point where they go you know what the the cost of having this  stuff is greater than the benefit to the business and they'll do it what Wikipedia did but for a  different reason Wikipedia doesn't have log files because there's so much traffic that they don't  want burden of storing them so they turned it off and when I was at the hacking days like two years  ago a lot of the hackers you know who sort of work on the servers and stuff like that were like let's  not turn it back on right and it wasn't for technical reasons privacy basically it were privacy  and they were like let's just not have log files and it's sort of really cool libertarian concept

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  who's the first end search engine maybe you'll do this Jason is to step forward and say we're  not gonna keep logs of your searches because that that is a competitive advantage against Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah the only problem is I mean I think we would do that pretty easily the problem is if your  partners with Google and you have the AdSense on it you can't anyway there's they're doing it anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and the other way you could do it is just empower people to encrypt you know well or if you use a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  meta search like a dog pile or meta crawler of Uzi doesn't that does that know not a no it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no because they're what they're doing is they're in most of those cases they're just doing just  pass it along like there's passing along in some cases I think they might do the searches and then  serve it back to you so it would go through their IP but I mean a lot of what's gonna happen is a  lot of people gonna go to stuff like tour TOR yeah the onion router this is an anodizer yeah  tourproject.org and I tried it a couple times it really slows down your that's the problem surfing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's the messes it messes with your because it goes through a proxy if you're watching anything  that's US Hulu won't let you use it yeah you'll probably not be on a US proxy although you might  luck into being able to watch BBC content by accident it needs to be a tour that is run by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a professional company where I can pay 10 bucks or 50 bucks a year and just it goes fast and it  logs I mean there's got to be some of those anonymous services that Alcada are using and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all these kind of people why don't they have service leo that they used to be for pay that  we talked about on the screensavers all the time hotspot VPN it was anonymizer.com anonymizer and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they stopped doing it and then it was the freedom something yeah yeah and and that was no they're  gone they were using an interesting technique Patrick was really into this they use these little  tokens I never really was satisfied that it was completely anonymous you know who is running a  private tour server I think is a company out of Sweden although they're moving to the Bay Area  called Ubico we interviewed them on security now they make a single sign on USB key and they are  using it with a with a private you know tour server probably the private tour server is you know  it kind of defeats the idea the tour server whole idea of a tour server is your as your  traffic is routed through numerous anonymous servers in an anonymous locations and so very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  difficult to track it's no longer the onion router at that point it's the banana router

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one feeling you're in but but for something like video I mean doesn't that just render it almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  unwatchable well it does it's too slow and so I guess my question is ultimately it's also inconvenient  it all slows you down aren't people it wasn't was it Scott McNeely wasn't isn't he ultimately right  get over it privacy is dead people are just going to use Google they're going to just swallow it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say and and do what's convenient I think there's there'll be a certain group of people who are  always going to worry about their privacy down to the nth degree but yeah I think generally

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know do you think your readers even know about it no no I try to talk about it on the radio show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no they don't care you can get them a little hot it's also it's also a generational thing I think  younger web users care less about it than older ones do yeah younger people are just kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  said they're they're just you know living with it they're they're fatalistic about it they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know that's the way it is well and there and there may be some benefits to it there may be some  benefits oh yeah socially to not being worrying about google web history is great and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  when I signed up for who is he you know that site whoisi.com it's kind of a neat idea they use the  google social graph you log you log in with your google account all of a sudden they know everything  you've done and they can build this social graph with you try it right now whoisi.com do it it's  like a google search for your social networking and and but the but it works really well because  it just knows who is i who is i who is i who is he i hate these names who is he yeah well they're  running out of them that's why every all the good names are gone everybody watching the twit live  stream is going there i can't get to it it is you know what we just slammed it right  we used to have that problem on the screensavers you couldn't you couldn't mention a site

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  newsroom what about the dwight what do you did you read that uh there's a real thing going on  with it was it the miami herald where some intern said it's over let's we're giving up yeah that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at the tampa tribune tampa tribune yeah the tampa tribune a an intern by the name of  i think her name was jessica da silva was uh in the newsroom when the editor came in and did a  session with the staff in which she explained uh the layoffs and one by one went over each person  and said why that person was gone don't need you and then and then she said you know and then she  said um that uh and this was this was kind of the kicker was that they needed to quit thinking of  the newspaper's website as an adjunct that now the print edition was the adjunct to the website  yikes of course right and that's you know she essentially kind of said out loud what everybody  i think in the industry knows but you know none of the big execs are saying and and that's true i  mean we're at the chronicle we're we're starting to treat it like that we we do news for the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  first and then for the print edition jessica's actually now the superstar at the tampa tribune

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  she is although you know what happened is she um someone posted her a link to her um uh post on  romanesco which is the um which is the pointer site that has all the uh media gossip on it and  she was kind of savaged by a lot of the old the old timers who basically said yeah you know you  you don't get it you just wait till you're older and then you understand punks you never understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well what's it like at the at the chronicle i mean is it uh is the writing on the wall um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the writing has been on the wall for a while we are in a lot better shape because we're not a  public company we're owned by hearst right which is privately held and so we kind of don't have the  stockholder pressure that a lot of the others do hearst is also very progressive in in this  regard and has uh you know has been pushing its um its newspapers for some time to get more onto  the web uh and we're doing um you know in terms of blogging we're probably one of the most active  papers on the web doing it although it's you know even if you're aggressive with it you know the  san francisco chronicle is continues to struggle out there and uh you know it's it's very it's a  really hard environment to do to be a traditional newspaper what do you think about blogging for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  newspapers because we have this conversation on buzz out loud at cnet a lot about whether  you're some places just do blogging because they think it's cool and it ends up not doing them any  good and really blogging is just a content management system it's just a way to publish

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how do you guys use that i'm curious we well we've been doing it since about 2004 and um we  we use it essentially as another you're right we use it as a way to publish the news that the  benefit to it is is that we get conversations going about our uh our blog entries we also have  comments under every story now and so every story essentially becomes almost like a blog  and one of the things that it's happened i know i have a i have the technology blog at the chronicle  is that the kind of things i write about and the kind of things i think about have changed because  of the people i interact with almost instantly when i um uh when i post something it it's changed the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  way we think about the news definitely and all of us in new media have been aware of that for ages  i mean that's the way it is but it's got to be it's a it's a real challenge for old school reporters  and anchors on tv and uh and and hosts because they never had anybody talk back to them well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what's interesting is is that you get people who kind of were not into it didn't want to do it had  to be dragged to it and most journalists i think like hearing from their readers i mean most  journalists do not want to just write and not have any feedback and to get it instantly uh can be  quite a rush and we have people who were uh you know who were resistant to it who now are addicted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to it yeah i think that's what happens basically i i know like if you look at sol hansel from the  new york times really smart guy i've known him for over 10 years and i told him three years ago when  we were at um ces within gadget that he would be doing it and he was like no no way and now he's  doing it and he loves it but then you look at something like john markoff from the new york  times i saw him at the wall street journal d conference and i said i told you you'd be blogging  and he said only under duress you know which is funny because john's been covering technology  longer than anybody right but he likes the long form you know so it's basically you know you're  taking people who are marathon runners and saying okay now you're a sprinter and some people are  just like no sprinting is stupid just personality yep it's just a personality difference you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what what we do is we tell our writers to use their blogs to do their print job in other words  you know when i went to cover mac world this year the the blog posts that i did the twitter posts  became almost a notebook for what i would then take and do as a column or a print item  and if you if you take it and and integrate it into your into your workflow it works great you  know john hasn't gotten there yet sol has i think if if john kind of lets himself go what i tell  reporters who are resistant is that you can't hold back it's like a love affair you got to  throw yourself into it with wild abandon that's the only way that's good but it's okay i let  myself go years ago and it's been great yeah just yeah that's the that's the only way to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well i like that i like the way you put it is is that this is this is not sloppy journalism  because that's a lot of the attitude you get from right from the older crowd who's against blog  like oh it's it's not getting it's not checking your sources it's printing rumors it's it's not  paying attention it's it's that's not it at all i think you know jason kind of hit it on the it's  the sprinting it's like getting stuff out there and the responsible journalists are going to be  the better bloggers because they will be careful to say like you know this is alleged and this  isn't quite known yet but they're still getting that information out there and and the idea of  people being able to see journalism in the process and journalists like you say being able to get  that feedback instantly is is invaluable as we're seeing it's totally changing the game

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah and not but not all of them like it i mean a lot of them are like fought to not have comments  underneath their stories on the new york times right and a lot of find it extremely annoying  that they have to you know actually respond to people and if you think about their lives just  five or ten years ago it was like if you want to communicate with the new york times writer you can  call the switchboard leave a voicemail because none of them pick up their phone or you can write  a letter to the editor in which case in both cases you're a kook you're a loop you know like  oh you're one of those people who writes letters to newspapers and to journalists  yeah you're a main right it's a pejorative you're writing a comment is you're a concerned citizen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're interactive that's cool oh you're also a kook or a flame bait or a troll but it you can be  but it's accepted now just writing the comment itself doesn't make you that it's what you write

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kidding yeah you want to talk about people suffering there's a lot of rich people with jets who are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  suffering right now that oil cost went way up oh you thought it was a good idea you thought you were  rich till you just had to buy your own gas hand over the credit card you know actually don't you  pull up and you hand over the credit card at the pump even with a jet it's the same thing you give  them a credit card and they say how much will that be well i only have 50 000 on the card so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't fill it up just stop at 50 000 it's unbelievable the price i mean we we got a  serious well i don't want to bum everybody out but this is going to be a serious recession

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's what i think just the oil price alone i mean oil and there's a new website take a look  at this my gallons dot com somebody sent me a link to this where you can buy gas now at current  prices you're kind of again you're hedging that the prices are going to go up what do you call  selling short or long you go long on gas right uh no long long would mean that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  expected to hold the investment for a long time expected to go up short would be you think it's  going to go down so you it's basically a hedge it's a hedge you're locking in a price for some

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  period of time and then you get you're buying you buy 100 gallons uh at the current price whatever  that is or a thousand gallons and and then you get a credit card that you can use at a at the pump  it's an interesting idea i don't mean the current price in what area well i don't know i haven't  signed up southern missouri or san francisco there's a big difference isn't there it's going  to be five bucks in san francisco in a week or two it's getting real close every time i say this  though you know uh we have you know listeners all over the world our our european listeners say what  are you guys crazy we're paying the equivalent of 17 dollars a gallon yeah i think somebody on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  clerk was saying it was ten dollars a gallon in england right now yeah they buy the leader but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  whatever somewhat affordable yeah so is it is that because we're subsidizing gas or they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more taxes why is that they have huge tax this is the tax yeah i have a good idea though what's that  to solve this problem what's that i don't know i've been thinking let's take over kuwait no i got i  got a great idea um we should charge people ten thousand dollars to have a license plate that  allows you to go up to 100 miles an hour right because they already do this anyway there's says  mr tesla no no i'm serious this is this is how they do it other parts of the world so they should  offer people who want to drive faster the ability to buy these license plates right because there's  a thing here in california with the california highway patrol you can donate ten thousand dollars  and you get this license plate and basically if you get pulled over in your ferrari they let you  go it's an insider it's an insider where do you get that it's i'll find the url and i'll post it  but it's something about the california highway patrol and they're like benevolent fund for like  you know officers who are calling says it's the chp 1199 foundation that's in california only and  so a bunch of my friends that actually works it's yes i have friends who have lamborghinis and  ferraris that's criminal and you pay 10 grand it works or it worked before the show so anyway  good i want to stop right now that's criminal here's my idea leo make it so it's happening  anyway so anyway make it legal take the ten thousand dollars and all that money goes towards  solar power and electric car subsidies so basically you take the people who want to  spend that money and have them subsidize electric cars for people who you know can't afford them or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know whatever it's going to cost a lot more than ten thousand dollars a license plate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it could be ten yeah but it could be millions of dollars so you just give everybody who buys a  prius you know a thousand dollars back you give anybody who buys an electric car five thousand  dollars back i mean it's going to be an incentive um i mean speaking of the electric cars though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  here's the thing i hear every time the electric car thing comes up from from the from the debunkers  is that the the total cost of ownership argument the total total cost to the environment because  of the zinc and all the batteries and the battery disposal do you all know anything about that is  is that bunk is that true is that something to be worried about is it really jason because i thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the manufacturer of these batteries was so toxic and the chemicals you need the zinc you need is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so horrible no no the batteries are lasting for a long time now and they're just not that damaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i've read about this stuff i have that documentary what who killed the electric car i have it at home  i haven't watched it yet but supposedly that's the thing to watch yeah um i haven't seen either but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no that's that's all bunk and the cost of these things is going down dramatically and  i mean we have batteries all over the place they're just laptop batteries so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are those studies just overestimating the uh the cost of disposal then or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or are they just i've never seen any of these studies i just know that from talking i've heard  of them yeah i haven't seen them either that's just like that's like one of those right wing like oh  but then you have to dispose of the batteries like trust me building an engine and all that  other stuff that goes into a car that doesn't go into an electric car that's a lot bigger  of a footprint i mean these electric cars have very little in them you know they don't need a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  combustion engine well i want to have the full electrics like the tesla you're talking about  right yeah that doesn't need a combustion engine at all in five years you're going to have 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  different full electric choices and they're all going to be able to charge 100 miles plus  on one charge and you're going to be able to buy these things put solar panels on your roof and  be totally off the grid it's i think we're going to solve this problem uh really quickly since

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is the will by the people i wish we'd get uh i wish we'd get up to speed on the solar panels  it seems like it's so close to breaking through and becoming something but there's a a little bit  of a of a return problem they're still not quite turning around the amount of power that you'd like  to really put them over the top and there's a higher efficiency investments problem of getting  into it but man we're so close once once once they start returning a little more efficiency and once  they start uh either subsidizing or giving grants or something to get them on top of houses and  buildings i think it could be a huge benefit there's a company called solar city which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doing incredibly well that um they are doing the financial arbitrage so you can put solar panels  on your house for free reduce your electric bill and you basically just pay them back over 20 or  30 years for putting them up there plus interest so they make money on it yeah so it's basically  solar city is doing like the last mile they basically are an installation company they don't  make the yeah yeah panels but i met the ceo of the company and he said i've actually read about  them that's a neat idea yeah they're so backed up that they can't uh keep up with the amount  of people who want it so it's basically like solar leasing you lease the solar stuff your  electric bill goes down and then they're just doing the financial arbitrage but they got like some  hundreds of millions of dollars in a line of credit or something from some big institution

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  like morgan stanley if you were buying if you're investing right now would investing in these kinds  of green technologies be a good place to put your money they're not public it's the problem they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all private so uh if you watch the bcs they're all putting tons of money into this stuff but  um so i think it would be uh they think so apparently bcs yeah they're long uh let's talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  about voicemail because mike errington wrote an intro did you all read that article and mike  errington wrote it said voicemail is dead stop using it maybe i should ask it because you you  actually wrote a response to it dwight what what what why did why what does mike have against

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  voicemail well i think like all of us it's kind of an irritating form of communication i mean i'm  i actually to a certain extent agree with a lot of his post in which he talked about how inefficient  and and irritating it seems like it's efficient it's much more efficient than taking a call  well it depends it's more efficient than taking a call it's not more efficient than email or say  twitter or even instant message which can be intrusive but it i in terms of the time it takes  to get the information punching it in uh sitting and listening to the information coming back to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's uh it's inefficient but what about what about visual voicemail with the iphone that kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing doesn't that make it pretty usable it well it's it gives you more information but it doesn't  give you that what the whole message is and so um you're you still have to end up going back and  listening to it and and count what what um what mike errington said essentially was that tell  everybody to stop using it it's not it's not useful anymore in today's day and age but the  problem is is that mainstream um business america uses it they may it may be falling out of favor in  mike errington's crowd but i'll tell you what you know you couldn't do business in the oil and gas  industry here in houston without voicemail isn't it funny for a while people i remember old timers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saying i in fact a certain old timer named john c dvorak doesn't have voicemail i don't need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  voicemail i'll answer the phone or i won't but i don't need voicemail and uh and and i remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  very well a lot of people hating voicemail hating answering machines specifically and then it became  the thing if you didn't have an answering machine you really were a dottering old nutball  and now it's going the other way again well it's it's it's like anything else voicemail is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very good for certain things and it's very bad for others and people don't use it right they you know  sometimes people leave these long drawn out messages would be much better sent in an email  or sent as a text message uh but there are certain times when a quick voicemail that just says like  hey i called call me back that's exactly right because somebody's checking it you get it quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know okay i gotta call you i have to admit i don't listen to my voicemail so i probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i know who's in this like who hates voicemail they just get simul scribe have you heard of that  it's called phone tag now yeah and basically uh 30 bucks a month unlimited they'll transcribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there's spinvox does this too these are these are companies that just turn it into email basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they they do it in real time so my friend fred wilson the venture capitalist who does a vc  has it and i know he has it so i basically bust chops every time and i leave a message from like  do you do in a funny accent oh no i'm just making it hard to understand falling for my friend fred  wilson fred wilson is a very good friend of mine i like him very very very very very very very

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  much he's a total complete gentleman and then say and then say a word that is completely indecipherable

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but then he forwards them to me and it's so funny to read like 18 berries every person like in india

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who does this who how is doing this oh it's all like being outsourced to is it amazon is it amazon's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  mechanical turk or what i mean jot's the same thing jot has a human when i use jot all the time and  i'm always thinking who's writing this down they do it in like india philippines one time i said  hey jot person i just want to thank you for transcribing this message have a nice day and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  she wrote it down in the message of course say good night gracy that's good training all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i think you know the ultimate solution here is for that kind of service to to have voice recognition  catch up so it doesn't have to be done by a human and can be 90 reliable this is why they use humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  humans are cheaper than computers when it comes to stuff like right now they are yeah also think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the cost of an error you know like a human's like you know i you know they probably get pennies

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a message don't they pennies yeah i mean two cents there's two cents there's another two cents

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's another two cents there's something just as you look at cha-cha.com what they're doing with  sms text where like cha-cha is a human powered sort of search engine competitive with what i'm  doing a little bit you can text cha-cha any question and they pay people one group of people  like three cents to transcribe it and other people like seven cents to actually answer the  question it just shows how cheap humans are when you do it on a global basis there's an unlimited  supply of you know this what's clay shirky calls the cognitive surplus right and people who are  watching tv would rather just transcribe stuff and make 10 bucks an hour or five if our economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  continues to tank we may be doing it for indians soon you know i would like to leave a message for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my friend raji shabaradeep he is a very very very very very very nice man i can see myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're already trained up on the accent leo i'm ready for doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what would be nice would be if the if corporate voicemail services uh you know they're on site  and businesses had this translation capability built into them so it happened would be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as it was left yes well that's what you have the little pink slips for while you were out yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah that's called a secretary yeah let's tell you any any person who's in in public relations  out there who has my number somehow and calls and leaves voicemails if you don't stop talking  within about 10 seconds i do not hear the rest of your oh yeah hi you know you know that's that's  the big thing is brevity here it's voicemail nobody wants to sit there and listen to you go on and on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  just keep it short tom if you ever wondered how we're going to replace all the light bulbs we're  using in america today well we have a new solution here who wants to listen to that stuff but you  actually get those kinds of calls on voicemail yeah oh yeah i still get them i sent you an email

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and i haven't heard back from you so those are terrible shoot me now i get and you know what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  funny is when you talk i've like called them back and i said please don't do that please don't follow  up an email with a voicemail and what they tell me is the client wants us to do it they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they know better it's the clients want them to do it i i got sent a program i won't say the name i  got sent a program you know $50 program photoshop plug-in and i've received an email every two days  for the last three months have you looked at the program yet i sent one two months ago saying yeah  i looked at it well i'll talk about it at some point have you looked at the program yet it's  like it's like uh it's automatic fortunately they don't have my number well none of them really know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what i cover it you know they're all sending me pitches for for things that are you know  electronically internet connected vacuum cleaners or whatever google is has finally added a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  more google stories actually google's hot it's probably the only story this week is all google  they've added a privacy link at the bottom of the page no longer well that was why did they  resist that this was salt salt hansel wrote this story saying google's violating the california  online privacy protection act of 2003 by not putting a link on the front page on its privacy  policy and google resisted it i don't understand why they would they're like well our page is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  finely designed that we can't afford to put a privacy link oh did you read marissa's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  blog post it was like marissa mayer did a long blog post about how many words there are on the page  and how she was so proud of the fact that they added privacy but they took it used to say  copyright like 2008 google but then she realized that's implied that it's google's copyright  because you're on google.com so she was able to drop the google and add privacy and it's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  28 words because we know that for every additional word on the google page 53.4 kilowatts of power  are used actually that's not to be sneezed at i mean the the amount of power used by  that somebody was suggesting i think is a great idea that companies should publish  how much power they use we forget that this is every page you go to uses power well shouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you change the page black then isn't that better yeah apparently that's a that's a that's a canard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually those servers are running anyway so it's a fixed cost you know whether thousands of pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  are seen or no pages yeah but i mean it's like saying you know that you know 800 million cows  are going to die whether you eat a burger or not if people stop eating burgers they'll use fewer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  watts right okay if we stop leaving the house we'll probably leave all right everybody turn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your computers off after you listen to this week in tech the idea was that a black page somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  used fewer uh you know watts in your monitor but it turns out that's not true the monitor is always  because it still has to show something yeah there's a black well there's a backlight's always on it's  just whether the lcd is open or not doesn't matter well i thought yeah i knew it didn't matter for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lcd i didn't know if it actually well how many people use crts those are the energy hogs so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's the worst offenders are the people using this google apparently debunked that black screen  thing all right story number two this is a great new york time all these are new york time stories  google screws up its child care big time um did you read this story it's a very interesting story  apparently google had a contractor a third-party contractor everybody loved was very happy with  but then decided to do it themselves because of course google could do everything better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  than anybody else can because if you can organize the world's information you could certainly run

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  oh yeah and apparently can raise children yeah oh yeah they know oh we can do everything better  they have an algorithm for that so well there it's kind of a little bit of a little scandal here  because now you have to read the article but apparently susan wojcicki wojcicki who is  larry page's sister-in-law or i'm sorry uh sergi brin's sister-in-law he's kind of in charge of  this she she owned the garage that google was founded in and now she's the company's vice  president for product measurement but apparently she's also like the advocate for google's day  care efforts so they they fired the children's creative learning centers the cclc which a lot  electronic arts uses a lot of silicon valley companies use and they created their own kinder  plex based on the learning philosophies of reggio emilio which is apparently hugely expensive  so what exactly happened then they announced that they're going to raise the cost of well it turned  out they found out that they were subsidizing child care with this new expensive system  thirty seven thousand dollars a year per child and they decided to raise the cost of child care  tremendously at google uh 75 so the daycare bill would go from around  thirty three thousand dollars to fifty seven thousand dollars a year for google employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now you know you could hire somebody full time ridiculous to take care of your kids for but i

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  think the idea is well if it's if it's comparable to what it outside daycare would cost it'd be nice  to have the kid on campus is that comparable 33 000 might be that's expensive 33 is pretty high

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's 3000 a month that's high they said in san francisco it's like 12 000 dollars to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so yeah uh it's a mistake and then and then the problem is that the waiting list is so long  everybody wants this google daycare so they want to get the waiting list to zero so they kick people  off they charge you 100 bucks to be on the waiting list they kick people off  it's it and i guess the upset is that some people came to google and i remember this it was famous  for its child care so some people came to google for the child care and now they're having to now  they can't afford it or they can't get it yeah well it's just for the top level executives that's  really what it is it's for people who are millionaires you know there's a tremendous sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of entitlement that google has created amongst its you know rank and file because it was the  first place to have this food thing i think somebody did a calculation henry blodgett on  silicon alley insider that they were spending like 12 or 15 dollars per employee per day to feed them  i'm not surprised it's good food they give them good food yeah i've eaten there many times it's  great it's delicious and it's it's so beyond what's necessary because it's also like 20 different  stations it's not like oh yeah you know it's restaurants or options it's like there's like 17  campus restaurants or whatever restaurants what do you i mean people are going to get a mad sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of entitlement and well i think that's a fantastic idea and i think i hope the cbs executives are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  listening you know it's the silicon valley culture tom you need to do that because otherwise you just  go across the street and by the way it's good for team building you all get together you sit in the  cafeteria you don't go off campus you don't go to fud ruckers wired has a chef right yeah why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do it a little more reasonably than google lucas had a chef i think wired had a chef i think like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah they don't anymore i don't know if they're doing that now well they had i had a friend who

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was interning there as recently as a year ago and they still had it oh well maybe they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  good legacy isn't there a mahalo chef don't you have a mahalo chef we bring food in four days a  week monday tuesday wednesday so i mean yeah it's a big part of you know apple has a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  impressive cafeteria but you pay when you go there it's not free no it's not free but you know that  i mean it's you it's certainly uh a lot better than what you would expect in most i think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  reasonable to have a subsidized cafeteria at your place so you keep people together you'd like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not to go off campus wouldn't you it's good for team building it's a great perk great for keeping  people at the company right when you think about the total cost of it you know if somebody is  working five days a week right 50 weeks a year don't look at me like that colin 40 weeks a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you're talking about whatever colin wants me to have lunch now at the twit cottage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ain't gonna happen it's like two thousand dollars three thousand dollars it should be two or three  thousand dollars per employee it's not that much when you compare to their salary i think it's a  nice perk they're all talking about the product and how to make it better at lunch you know or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  half the cost even if you have don't you really want to do the things that are less expensive  employees are easily swayed it's not salary necessarily it's it's feeling like you're  appreciated and taken care of so yeah just a little the little things that i mean when i was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an employee that always made the difference i'll tell you what the the biggest perk has been  up hollow we put in a washer and dryer because we have showers there and there you go a little  mini gym the washer and so we had soap there and so then i started noticing the washer and  dryers were running constantly i was like what is going on they're doing their laundry people were  bringing their laundry in from work into work and doing it yeah because and i was like okay we're  buying all this detergent but then i realized oh they're not wasting five six hours on the weekend  doing their laundry they're doing it while they're working there you go they switch it okay there  makes their life better and on the weekends they're there on saturday and sunday doing their laundry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and work i'm like rock on and how much is that cost to you jason i mean it really you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nothing i mean i mean 500 a year in detergent google does dry cleaning you just drop off your

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  google story i like this one seth mcfarland the creator of the family guy yeah what's this about  i don't know what are they up to is experimenting with a new method of distributing original  material on the web google has hired him to unveil a carefully guarded new project called

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  seth mcfarland's cavalcade of cartoon comedy so the video adsense didn't work and what they've  done is they this is actually pretty brilliant i think is they've contracted the guy who did the  family guy to make video content for adsense and they're going to sell ads against it so there'll  either be a pre-roll there'll be a banner across the bottom and you'll have like up to two minute  episodes of of these this funny stuff that mcfarland does that that will not be ads themselves  that'll just be content the thing is i don't know if you can go get those episodes anywhere else or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  if you just have to stumble across them well this is a really interesting change in the way this  stuff works where the people like google commission content from content creators as a vehicle for  advertising is like frankly the uncle milty you know milton burl's chevy cavalcade or whatever it  was where the soap soap companies have come and say hey do a tv show we'll be the sponsors you  create the content it's purely a vehicle for advertising isn't it kind of like the old days

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well it's a matter of the old days because you don't have you know du pont they're saying well  i didn't really like that joke because it's different advertisers they don't care as long  as people watch you can say they didn't like the joke but the advertisers you know are going to be  sold by google so there's still a little bit of separation there this is major channel conflict

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  area for google because google wants studios to use their you know services and if google gets  into the distribution business and goes direct to creators to produce stuff you know if this works  then maybe jj abrams instead of doing his next show right abc will do it with google why is that  a channel conflict isn't that good uh no because google makes the majority of their money on having  ads on other people's sites non-google sites so that's why google will not go into the content  business that's why they won't buy a blog because they would undermine their channel yes so if if  they basically start running if they started hiring journalists from the new york times new  york times it's a hey unfair we're not going to run google adsense and so google gets to go to  everybody and say hey we're not competing with you we're just a platform company and with youtube  it's been getting really dicey because when they did the cnn youtube debates a lot of partners who  i talked to were like oh you're doing a debate so it's a youtube debate presidential debate isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that what we do here's the deal this is kind of interesting mcfarlane will receive a percentage  of the ad revenue he's created new characters to star in the series it'll be served up in 50  two-minute episodes the installments he described as animated versions of the one frame cartoons  you might see in the new yorker only edgy arrow i bet and then for a more substantial fee  mcfarlane is working with advertisers to animate original commercials for the advertisers you know  a brain tonic ad or whatever that will run on the cavalcade so they're going to do custom ads  that will look like content in addition to the content in addition to the content that's smart  that's smart i mean the two said these are the several deals among the largest ever landed by  adsense big bucks so how do you know the difference between the ads there you go the old time journalist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  weighs in exactly that's right that's right you know the thing is this is a natural progression  this is a natural progression what's going to happen is is that google is going to become  not only a content distributor but also it will commission more and more for these things and  and eventually it will become a major media company i mean in terms of the actual creation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i think this is just a start and i don't think it's bad you don't think that's a bit i mean this is  the first thing they've ever done like this and it could be reasonable to think this is a way of  priming the pump for other people to go create their own content and come in and strike an ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what about this our friend alex lindsey has has posited this for some time that a company like  say rei which makes camping equipment would do a camping video that has lots of content in it  but at any point as you're watching the video you could click on that tent and buy it click on those  jeans and buy it click on that backpack click on those shoes it's a future media the future is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to be that these people who are selling stuff the marketers are going to create their own  content which is what they they dip their toe of blogs now they're dipping their toe with video

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's definitely the future where does that leave content only creators like me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well advertorial already exists and it doesn't compete so much with with regular content i mean  you go to seen at tv.com and their advertorial videos created by the companies that advertise

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's such a slippery slope though as well as a separate area where all the regular content

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but isn't that what put pod tech out of business do they know the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah they do but well as long as you make them know the difference right as long as you don't  slip those advertorial videos in and mix them up with the content and try to trick the viewers you  say like you know what this is advertised it's paid for it's very clear over here and it's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  be nice it makes me i think you risk your reputation big time when you do that and your original

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  question is how does it affect you what's going to happen is me or tom or dwight the content guys  what's going to happen is there'll be a group of people who will do anything for advertisers  to get their money and then there'll be a group of old school folks who will try to hold the line  and it basically means the advertisers are going to come to you and say oh you're not willing to do  like a commercial for us and say you love the product we're going to move our money over here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and but will that happen with something like a lost and something i mean first of all that's  not going to go in the ad sense i mean that's that's a different there's stuff that's too yeah  there's long form yeah so does it do well they're already destroy the middle ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shows like lost are are already dealing with that you know just from just from the notion of  product placement i mean if you what was the what was some some movie i saw the other day  that was just outrageous the hulk the product placement in the hulk is just uh is just amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and was it a sony movie because sony they always have they all have you know sony gear what about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wally wally had like the ipod did it really do you think apple paid for that  well it's steve jones company they don't have to pay for it yeah yeah it didn't it didn't know  the boot up sound was the boot up sound of wally was the boot up sound from mac yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but that's fun the whole theater laughed at least yeah that's funny oh they laugh but that doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that doesn't destroy the the entertainment value of what you're watching or the artistic integrity  right right would i go to an an an rei uh website and watch an rei video and click on the tent  and trust rei to tell me objective information about that tent i would not do that but and  because of that because it's a competitive nature there will always be somebody who will come there  and give you the independence information it'll always be there and i think you will be able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  tell the difference i have toyed many a time and if i could do what i would with just firing all  the advertisers and saying this to me the cleanest thing when this was how we were going to start  twit this was our plan the cleanest thing would be to say we run this on for you your viewers  we'll run it on your donations and that's it and i would love to do that but it just doesn't  great like public well except public radio is basically full ads now they just you know let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say public radio say like like a pacifica pacifica still does not take they don't take any

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sponsorships they don't say brought to you by archer daniels midland grocer to the stars they  just say give us your money i i don't think i could make it that way you wouldn't make it  you could make it that way ever though i would like to i mean if i had if if i didn't have kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if it was just me i would consider it no it's fine to have the advertising advertising is fine  i like our advertisers we have good advertisers but it's just you get to pick a little litter i  mean for somebody who's got traffic and has audience this is a non-issue it's for the  marginal people who are going to have to do it you know the people who have audience are not going  to have to sell out the people were on the lower end it was like exactly like paper post right  paper post came out it wasn't like any notable bloggers did it it was all the sort of you know  french people yeah it was kind of like losers no offense to the losers doing it but i mean i  remember we just got to make a blog but they were sort of losers like no offense to the losers no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  offense to the losers you know who you are and you know who you are well that's what i that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i for pay propose so much because i was like oh let's not ruin blogging as a medium and make  nobody trust it you know but i'm fast i agree because blogging was something blogging is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  something precious let's not trash this thing of value don't disagree though that this idea of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you have the numbers you'll be fine because the problem is the way the ad agencies work and you  know this is is they don't necessarily care just about the numbers you got to play the game concept  by in there as well and and so that doesn't necessarily totally undermine your point but  even if you get the numbers if you're doing content that isn't fashionable or isn't seen as hot  i mean we ran into this at tech tv they won't buy it and then oftentimes they just don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it and oftentimes that's the most important stuff with the stuff the viewers are really looking for  or the niche that really needs to be filled or you know in general if you got the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the in the audience sure and it performs to the advertiser they'll do it you know the the  the uniqueness of the content is great you know if it's in parallel with their message but if  there's audience in the audience does perform by the ads that's why i like the idea of of of of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the viewers supporting stuff that maybe advertisers wouldn't support you know if if you want this  niche content maybe there's only 10 000 of you uh you know each of you throwing a buck that'll keep  it alive and that'll support it i wish there were some kind of more natural way for that to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah that's a re-education of users i mean it is you do not want to take their wallets out  no they're used to getting free content so i mean how could you i mean you look at the amount of  content that's available for free it's not gonna you have to make it work with average yeah well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah i think you're right i was a naive i was a naive innocent fool well it's not like we haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  worked this out i mean we went through the whole 50s things with the du pont show and then people  realized wow there can be undue influence and let's figure out the 32nd ads you know the the  same process we're just seeing happen again right because we don't have the 32nd ad for the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yet right no you're right hey speaking of the ads let's take a little break for your favorite  mr jason calacanis audible oh really audible oh really audible oh really i love audible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you wouldn't believe the book i'm listening to on audible what are you listening to  i i almost don't want to say because it's going to make me seem like a little bit of a loon  but i'm listening to a book called the purpose-driven church no i know no this this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this guy wrote the purpose-driven life too which i wanted to read for some time  tell us a little bit about i'm very interested in this well this book the purpose-driven church

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is by a guy who's been quite successful in building a church here in southern california and so  he basically goes through and i'm reading it because of its parallels to startup companies  also i'm thinking about starting a cult anyway it's a really interesting book because he talks  about the techniques they use to build a church and how you have to look at these churches not  as being you know you have to look at what your core purpose is and then everything followed from  there and it's really helps you for everything yeah so it really it had a really great line in  the book where he says you know if you're rowing the boat you really don't have time to rock it  and so it's really important at a startup company to really have everybody on the mission so we're  going to this new place and that's the direction and everybody is rowing because if you don't know  your direction it's not clear people stop rowing they start rocking the boat and it's all kind of  anecdotes about that kind of stuff so i try to read things that are outside of the technology  press because it's so repetitive in the tech business i think that's great i've wanted to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  read the purpose-driven life is it also rick warren um i don't know yeah i think it is and  i wanted to read that's a was a huge best seller um and i'm not i'll be honest i'm not particularly  religious but i think that this uh you know as you say this applies to many this applies to life

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah and it's good too that's one of the great things about audible is that there's such a range  of books on there that what i like to do is just take a chance and try something different you know  and just you know you'd be really surprised you can find stuff that you never thought  you would be appealing to you but you listen to it you listen to the first half hour and if you're  on the you know membership program it's nothing lost yeah exactly well i'll tell you what there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  no risk at all if you go to audible.com slash twit audible.com slash twit you can get this book  for free just sign up for audible if you decide you know audible is not for you no problem cancel  you get to keep the book but i have a feeling i gotta warn you you're gonna really like audible  it's not for everybody there's some people who do are not i think auditory learners but if you're  listening to a podcast chances are pretty good that you can absorb information through your ears  well and this audible is a boon 50 000 titles fiction non-fiction spirituality and erotica it's  all there audible.com you ever listen to any erotica there on on the audible uh jason hey you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what the great thing about audible is totally secure totally uh private and they're not going  to give your information over to viacom this is the upside to the drm see you do it legitimately  and you know if you've got seven or eight erotica books on your iphone nobody needs to know that's  between you and audible i almost so that would be a yes you know denial denial i try i have to admit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well and what we're finding out is once you'll get the at&t iphone data plan you're paying a lot  more for the iphone even than the first generation yeah yeah i find it so dishonest that he's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  holding it up saying it's 199 and 299 dollars because i was i want to buy one of these  well it works doesn't it give away and then i was like i told my assistant like can we buy 10 of  these like 199 ones and give them away like as a contest or something he's like number one you  can't buy them without the plan right then he finds out they're they're possibly going to let you buy  them with the plan but it's 599 and 699 it's hugely expensive if you don't get the plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  does that mean it went up in cost yeah well because the plan did the the plan is so much more  expensive at&t is making big bucks on the plan was the 8 gig edge iphone 599 originally yes it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was the bigger one the first one was 599 so the price hasn't gone up no it's the same is the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and then the 16 gig is 690 but basically you're i don't understand what you're getting you're  getting a 599 ipod right because if you don't activate what are you going to do you can activate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it just without a contract that's what you get you don't you you can you know but they aren't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to allow the go phone deal right and they're actually they're not going to sell  immediately the right you can't get it you can't get it friday you have to wait a little while  right but what's interesting i have a i have a samsung blackjack and with at&t and the cost of  the data plan is essentially the same as where the way it will be for an iphone and you know  initially steve job said oh well we're not only changing you know the way that um you know phones  are designed but we're changing the way they're sold and right and the way plans are done we're  simplifying it no and he that's just all gone out the window yeah it's completely gone out the window

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they need i think they really want to get that 10 million phone you know mark they want to hit that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mark and that's going to be making a lot more money off at this time aren't they will they

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because they lose the monthly they lose the monthly that they were getting from at&t  but they get the subsidy they they get more money up front so i'm not sure how it works out for  app i don't know if we'll ever know because they're not talking it's just ridiculous that  they had to tie this to one network so stupid that was my biggest complaint within day one is why  didn't they do like nokia does and other companies sell an unlocked gsm phone absolutely just make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  500 bucks and anybody can buy it and you put it on any do what you want with it and then they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not in bed with the evil at&t which i think has got to hurt them a little bit is that a symptom of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the the cell phone carrier client in the u.s though that they couldn't do this without getting into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that game i don't know it's a symptom of them wanting to increase their quarterly earnings so  desperately that they'll sell out the users i mean they they needed to have i mean when you have ipod  as your you know opening act you need to do something really big you know like everybody needs  an ipod everybody needs a phone they just they're desperate to get the revenue in on this thing so  you know they're sort of caught on this trap where they just have to make a lot of money  in order to impress the impressed wall street so they just they're going to squeeze every last  dime out of this thing but i think that it's it's too short-term thinking they should have gone for  the long-term thinking and made this thing like ubiquitous like the ipod is what do you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  jason what is that if they if the carrier system wasn't the way it is now it wasn't so locked down  they they could have made a lot of money doing it that way but they they don't think they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you can't do it with cdma but you could do it with gsm you got you got t-mobile t-mobile's 3g is

Transcript:  i use it as my backup phone i sometimes i carry both of me so i either bring blackberries primary  and then i take the at and chitchat and i either bring the nokia n95 if i wanted to streaming  video or i bring the iphone if i anticipate them but i need to put a lot of surfing up  well the reason the blackberry now with the opera browser is really dope for surfing the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well the reason that i really want one is i think you know the iphone is going to become just as the  mac os is a platform with the with that with the app store and i want to be able to write about  for my column and for my blog i want to cover these apps i'm going to use my touch for that  i'm going to use my touch for that yeah but i suspect there will be some that may interact  with the phone phone apps yeah yeah they're gps i i actually admit i am watching with great interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what they do with location-based applications in the gps and that could put me over the top if for  instance a twitter clone or a friend feed clone that automatically placed me using the gps i'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very interested in that i think just have a turn-by-turn directions that you you don't have to  get anything for your car you just set your iphone in there and you could do that with the instinct

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but they say they won't do that with the iphone well they'd say they won't do that with the iphone  really here's the here's the deal that was the deal with google maps the google maps doesn't give  you turn by turn it will give you directions but it won't say turn left here turn right there it's  just google maps but you could do that on an iphone they'll jailbreak iphone 3g and then we'll get  what they're saying and i think it's a battery issue is that the gps turns on gets a fix and turns  off and does that periodically to save battery life gotcha and so that eliminates that turn by  turn thing but so what you do is you ahead of time you say here's where i am here's where i want to  go and then google maps as as it would if you were on your browser at home generates a list of  directions which you can then you know press three three three three and go through or whatever it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i think that's that's real interesting like the original iphone the the real value in the iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  3g will be once it's jailbroken yeah interesting well this is the second application that if that's  the case if if the battery is the case where uh you know battery life has been crippled because  um by them not going to the state of the art type of technology you know they could have gone to 3g  on the first phone yeah didn't want to because of battery life they're not um they're not enabling

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  turn-by-turn gps because of battery worse than that their terms of their their sdk license says  you may not write a turn-by-turn program for the iphone right you can't do background processes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  either which pulls out a lot of the current apps that are on the jailbroken edge iphone right so  that's why i'm i'm looking forward to a jailbroken iphone 3g you're a brave man honestly my iphone edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  became three times as useful once i jailbroken yeah i agree i agree all right well we'll watch  with interest and i hope you guys will if you're in a line in an apple store or an at&t store  you'll call in and tell us what it's like and give us some background we want to see the scene  and we uh we will be giving away uh iphones so make sure you tune in starting at around noon to  1 p.m pacific time that's around three or four p.m eastern time 1700 utc on thursday july 10th  that's when the party begins uh it should be very interesting at twitlive.tv what would be cool is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  those are in the newer cars in the older cars which a lot of people still have you got to plug  in one of those stupid cassette adapters or you need to use the the weak fm transmitters in the  newer cars yeah but not everybody's got that newer car and i i really think you know houston has huge  commutes we have 30 or 40 minute commutes i just don't think i want everybody who's listening to
