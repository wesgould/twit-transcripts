End time: 221.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gotta gotta get it down. And Christina, congratulations on surviving the layoffs  at Mashable. I was so relieved when I saw that you're still there. But your  beat is really exactly what the new Mashable wants to do, right? Yeah, yeah. I

Start time: 221.20
End time: 232.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean, it's been an interesting couple of weeks. But yeah, that that's focusing on  tech and entertainment and culture is kind of the new. Yeah. I mean, that's you.

Start time: 233.20
End time: 251.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what you do. You are film girl. Although I was very jealous because when  Apple announced on Tuesday, a new MacBook, I thought, Oh, great, how quick  can we get it so we can review it? Well, immediately on the Twitter and everywhere  else. And of course, on Mashable benchmarks from Christina Warren. Nice.

Start time: 251.96
End time: 266.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a day and date. Yeah, yeah, basically had a meeting with them. They  announced it and I had a meeting with them a little bit later that morning. And  so it was one of those things where you know, we had like the news post up and I  had a meeting scheduled. How do they do that? Do they say Christina, we like you

Start time: 266.52
End time: 271.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so much. We've got a little something for you. And they pull it out. It sort of

Start time: 271.10
End time: 307.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  depends. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this was the case. You know, you set something up. You  know, they'd reschedule. It's a briefing. It's a briefing. Yeah. And so I went with  Lance Lance and I were both briefed and he received one in space gray and I  received one in rose gold. Oh, they gave you the pink one. That is so sexist. No,  it's not. It's not sexist because if anybody follows me on Twitter or Mashable  or Instagram or anywhere else, you know, I'm obsessed with rose gold. So it's not  sexist is actually just paying attention. It would be sexist. Exactly. It'd be  sexist if I haven't been on record like for months of being obsessed with

Start time: 307.26
End time: 316.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everything. Rose gold. That's true. And actually Renee Richie posted on Twitter  his complete collection. He has the full set. I saw that. I do as well. But I don't

Start time: 319.72
End time: 339.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the watch. I don't even know where it is because that's it. It was a review unit.  It's probably Mashable drawer someplace. So yeah, so I loved his whole collection,  but I was like, yep, that's, yep. Except in my case, I've bought most of, I mean,  other than the new MacBook, everything I own that's in rose gold, I've actually

Start time: 339.86
End time: 368.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  purchased. Well, you'll be happy to know that the one I bought for Lisa is rose  gold. Good man. And the reason is we have the gold MacBooks from last year. And it  was always a problem because our MacBooks are identical. So I want her to  have and I'm not going to get the new MacBook. I actually incurred the wrath  of a few Apple fans when I said I think I'm going to get the HP Spectre instead  and then compare them because this is the one that really is a clone of the  MacBook. Right?

Start time: 368.84
End time: 381.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Complete, complete clone. I mean, it's a little bit thinner, but it is heavier.  But it has three USB C ports and they're all Thunderbolt 3. So it's, I mean, it  looks great.

Start time: 382.80
End time: 401.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently it's made of liquid chocolate, at least from the video that they show  of melting chocolate or something. I guess that's the copper. It's a very  appley ad, but you know, they bested Apple in some respects. It has a lower  res screen, but it does have, it has this full Skylake processors, not the M  processors.

Start time: 402.40
End time: 408.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Skylake and yeah, I think the big thing obviously for me is that the  Thunderbolt 3 and the three USB C ports.

Start time: 408.74
End time: 425.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So funny thing is it's thinner on the edges. It's fatter in the middle. It's  just like Apple's stuff where it's bowed, you know, and the bulge in the  middle is points. I think point six. I don't know. Somebody put it up on the  chat room point. There it is. There's the melting, whatever that is.  It looks like chocolate.

Start time: 427.60
End time: 428.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's supposed to be copper.

Start time: 428.66
End time: 432.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And a honeycomb pattern.  Yeah.  Is there a honeycomb pattern on the laptop?

Start time: 433.10
End time: 436.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's not an Eames chair on the laptop either. It's just...  No.

Start time: 437.36
End time: 447.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Eames chair is just there for them to like see, see, look, look, look,  we care about this.  Design, design, design.  This has nothing to do with us at all.  We just want to look relevant in the design space.

Start time: 447.86
End time: 450.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're taking a page out of Apple's book. Let's face it.

Start time: 450.36
End time: 453.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, totally, totally.  And they're using that old HP logo that...

Start time: 453.84
End time: 455.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the new logo. That's old.

Start time: 456.22
End time: 480.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was originally part of, I think, like a 2011 brand redesign.  The Verge had an article about it, but I remember seeing it.  This was like five years ago.  Remember when they first picked HP Hubbub happened when, you know, they were like,  we're killing webOS and we're getting out of PC's and everybody was like,  Oh my God.  Like that same time they announced or it was leaked, a new identity thing.  And that's what this was. So I like it. I think it's actually a great, great logo.

Start time: 481.10
End time: 485.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have they split up now?  The HP has the split is done.

Start time: 486.26
End time: 486.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The split is done.

Start time: 488.18
End time: 491.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's the PC division.  Did the printer division go with the PC division?

Start time: 493.12
End time: 493.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty sure it did. Yes.

Start time: 494.90
End time: 507.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's the enterprise services, the hardware division.  Okay. Right.  That actually kind of makes sense.  You know, the merger with Compaq is famously referred to along with the AOL

Start time: 508.02
End time: 512.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Time Warner merger is one of the worst mergers of all time.  The worst mergers of all time. Thank you.

Start time: 512.20
End time: 514.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hopefully it was. It's always on those lists.

Start time: 514.46
End time: 528.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, when, when, when, when Carly Fiorino was trying to run for president,  it was one of those things where, you know, she's like, look at what I did at HP.  And we're all just, I mean, I was in high school and that happened.  And I was like, I was in high school and I'm going, you really don't want to run on that.  That's really nice.

Start time: 529.76
End time: 546.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's really not a good idea.  But then it was followed by a number of articles that many of which said, don't  mention this Carly. And a few said she wasn't all that bad.  You can't really blame her for what was happening to HP.  I mean, it has not, I mean, and certainly since she's departed,  HP is still struggling.

Start time: 547.20
End time: 565.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fairness to her, she was not the worst CEO they've ever had.  That would be the German guy, Leo Apotheker.  Because he literally spent 10 billion dollars on magic beans.  He bought a company called Autonomy that did nothing, that they had to write off  almost the entire purchase of it and was like, I'm betting the future of the company on this.  And it's like.

Start time: 566.16
End time: 567.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's what she inherited. You can't.

Start time: 568.02
End time: 568.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, she didn't inherit that.

Start time: 569.10
End time: 573.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Carly Fiorina inherited.  Now it's all confusing, wasn't it Carly Fiorina?

Start time: 574.12
End time: 591.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Meg Whitman inherited that.  Meg Whitman came in in 99, 2000.  She was the one who kind of got them into trouble to begin with, bought Compaq.  Then Mark Kerr took over.  And then he had his whole inappropriate scenario thing.  And now he's co-CEO of Oracle.  So he did fine for himself.  Yes, it was very famous.

Start time: 591.78
End time: 594.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry Ellison said, what are they crazy firing him?  He's the best ever. I'm hiring him.

Start time: 595.64
End time: 606.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Completely. And Larry Ellison is a smart guy.  And then the Leopold took over HP and 10 billion dollars in magic beans.  And then Meg Whitman was like, are you serious?  This is what I'm coming into.

Start time: 606.90
End time: 610.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crazy corporate governance.  I mean, where's the board when all of this is happening?

Start time: 610.38
End time: 630.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, the board that's famous was the most dysfunctional board  probably in modern corporate history, you know, Ray Lane, the whole thing.  They were spying on each other.  They were. Oh, yeah.  Well, remember when and this was, I think, under Carly Winnett,  they spy on the CNET reporters when they like hack their email.  Remember that? Crazy.  Just like this is anyway for a new company.

Start time: 630.26
End time: 661.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a new company. And, you know, I had sworn for years  I'll never buy an HP computer because they used to be really junked up  with every possible form of trialware.  But I thought this is a pretty computer.  So I'll give them I'll give them one more chance.  And it is in a way it's a it's a new company, isn't it?  Oh, totally. Of course, I'm going to immediately put Linux on it  because I know I can't bear wearing running windows with Distro.  Oh, now you're asking the geeky question, huh?  Hmm. Now, whatever distro, whatever distro will work, actually,

Start time: 661.76
End time: 663.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because it's a good call, like whatever will.

Start time: 663.42
End time: 667.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because I it's probably all highly proprietary hardware  that nothing supports.

Start time: 668.10
End time: 669.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the question.

Start time: 669.20
End time: 675.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have to say it for a long time.  Pardon us while we talk, you guys, just to leap in any time you want to.

Start time: 675.18
End time: 676.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any time. Sorry, guys.

Start time: 676.32
End time: 679.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Christine, I don't get to talk nerds, nerds, nerds.

Start time: 680.08
End time: 682.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've been joining the Linux talk.  I haven't heard Linux talk.

Start time: 682.44
End time: 686.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why.  This year is a desktop Linux.

Start time: 687.86
End time: 688.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 689.30
End time: 692.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can't even finish that sentence.  I can't even think of the straight face.

Start time: 693.32
End time: 750.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we all are using it all the time on Android.  Now, we all a few of you refuse.  But Chrome OS is Linux.  But but the reason a couple of things, first of all,  I can't what Microsoft has done with Windows 10.  I find so offensive that on principle, I think it's a fine operating system.  By the way, I'm not complaining about it, but on principle,  because of them forcing it on people, which they continue to do unrepentantly.  People call me all the time.  Somebody today on the radio show woke up Windows 10s on his computer.  He didn't ask for it.  But they're doing that.  They said they would do it and they're doing it.  And I think that's so unacceptable that just as a protest,  you know, and I do have a Microsoft Surface Book, I guess I'll leave that with Windows.  But I just don't I don't want to buy another Windows PC.  On the other hand, this is beautiful hardware.  If I could put Mac OS, I would.  By the way, that's the new name, by the way, isn't it Mac OS?  We decided it's not going to be OS 10. Mac OS.

Start time: 750.28
End time: 752.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mac OS, it was just so funny.

Start time: 752.90
End time: 758.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of generic.  You can't keep saying something 10.10 point.  Yeah. Yeah.  Eventually, 10.11.

Start time: 761.22
End time: 762.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it was 10.12.  It's weird.

Start time: 763.22
End time: 797.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little weird.  10.11, 10.12. Yeah, that is a little weird.  And everybody still still calls it Mac OS X.  Although that's oh, they've never gone over that.  That's a useful thing for distinguishing the true nerd from the pretender.  Anybody says X, you're like, I listen to an audible book.  It was actually the really good book about Steve Jobs called Becoming Steve Jobs.  Bill Atkinson said that was his favorite of all the jobs books.  And of course, he knew jobs pretty well.  And the reader unaccountably called it OS X the whole time.  And it was crazy.

Start time: 798.68
End time: 802.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think someone would have corrected them.  That's what I ask. Where is the producer?

Start time: 802.48
End time: 805.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't expect the reader to know that, but the producer, that's the producer's job.

Start time: 806.36
End time: 808.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Mac OS, capital X.

Start time: 810.16
End time: 814.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mac OS. Anyway, Mac OS is easier, right?  But somebody...

Start time: 814.72
End time: 815.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a nice throwback.

Start time: 816.30
End time: 818.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody call it Macoss.  Somebody will.

Start time: 818.94
End time: 823.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to be system 11.  That's what I want.  System 11.  System 11.

Start time: 824.40
End time: 839.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been waiting for OS 11.  I've been waiting for that.  I figured that would be the fusion of iOS and OS X, where we would finally get an OS 11.  But no, we're just going to get Mac OS and TV OS and watch OS and iOS.  And your OS and my OS.

Start time: 839.54
End time: 849.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Streamlining the whole thing.  They don't even have names for their stuff.  It's the iPad Pro.  Just the Pro. It's all you need to know.  You pick a size.  This is the new... The MacBook.  The MacBook. It's just all...

Start time: 849.82
End time: 856.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's been Apple's laptops and desktops for a long time.  It's always the new iMac.  The iMac with Retina display.  The new MacBook Pro.

Start time: 857.06
End time: 866.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That only bothers us because we write about it, we talk about it,  and we need a way to distinguish it.  I guess that makes sense.  You don't say the new Saturn.

Start time: 867.76
End time: 885.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, you don't say the 2015 Saturn,  unless you're the person like buying that specific model.  Or when people ask you like, oh, you have a Toyota Prius.  Cool. What does your Toyota Prius have?  Oh, well, it has the climate control and...  You don't say the Prius 6.4.

Start time: 887.98
End time: 903.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only in the computer industry do we do that.  But for those of us who talk about it and write about it,  you need precision is kind of important to distinguish,  for instance, the 2015 MacBook from the 2014 MacBook.  So back to that subject, Christina, you liked it.  It's the Core M still, right?

Start time: 904.38
End time: 931.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's still the Core M. Skylight.  Yeah, which has made a big difference in performance.  It has, OK.  It has.  I mean, so...  And I noted this in my review.  The one that I tested last year was, I guess,  what would now be like, right, kind of as the Core M3,  but last year they were just calling it the Core M,  and that was the 1.1 GHz.  I reviewed, and I think all the review units they seeded  were the 1.2 GHz model.  And so, M5.  And so...

Start time: 931.82
End time: 934.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's nominally slower clock speed.

Start time: 935.28
End time: 978.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's faster than last year's.  And so my results, my Geekbench results,  were about 25% to 30% better than last year's,  but that wasn't really apples to apples.  Based on other Geekbench results,  you saw about a 15% to 20% increase in raw CPU speed  and then a 25% increase in GPU.  Wow, that's significant.  It is, and I think that's all coming from Skylake.  I think, A, it's two things.  One, Skylake finally is here.  There were a lot of improvements on that end,  and I think the secondary thing is that  this is now their second iteration with Core M,  so they've been able to do more with it.  So I think you're still gonna hit those roadblocks,  and for me, I don't think I could make it  a daily driver for me.  It's so close, which is what's the annoying thing.

Start time: 978.84
End time: 982.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because it's not fast enough,  or is it the keyboard and other issues?

Start time: 982.20
End time: 1002.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a couple other things,  but I think for me, mostly, honestly,  would be some of the GPU stuff.  I convinced my best friend to buy one of these last year,  and she will yell at me every time her Mac  does not perform correctly.  She screams at me when Chrome and Tweetdeck and other things.  It is my fault, well,  because I was the one who told her to buy it,  and I said, it'll be great for you, Ali,  it'll be just fine.

Transcript:  Well, she was asking, should I get this  or should I get it souped up, you know, MacBook Air?  And I was like, I think the new MacBook,  I think it'll be perfect for what you use it for.  And then it turns out that Tweetdeck and Chrome  are kind of memory hogs,  and if she doesn't restart it every day,  it kind of slows down.  So I think the new model will alleviate  a lot of those concerns, but I think for what I do,  just with having so many things open,  I would be concerned about making it a daily driver,  but it's getting so close.  I do, my big, I guess, complaint with it, two things.  One, I mean, I love the design still,  and I'm not even upset that they didn't update the design.  I still do wish that there was a second USB-C port.

Start time: 1072.88
End time: 1076.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1077.06
End time: 1088.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think-  Maybe they can't.  I mean, maybe there's no room.  Maybe they can't.  There could be room, but I think it would probably  require a big update to the chassis design,  and I understand if they don't want to do that  for marketing.

Transcript:  Because Johnny's on vacation.  What is less, I guess, okay with me is the idea  that they did not go ahead and update  that USB-C to Thunderbolt 3.  Because that's built into the chipset.

Start time: 1101.84
End time: 1104.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's built in.  It is an odd admission, isn't it?

Start time: 1105.64
End time: 1175.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so to me, even with one port,  if we were Thunderbolt 3, then you could,  without any question at all, you would be in dongle hell,  but you're gonna be in dongle hell regardless.  You could have a million things connected to it  and be confident in the throughput of that port.  So I feel like it would be more future-proof that way.  My secondary concern, and I was completely fine  with the price last year.  I felt like the price was where it is  for the type of device that it is.  This year, I wish that they'd come in $100 less.  I feel like it would be an easier thing to recommend  if it were $100 less expensive.  Just because even though it is faster  on both the SSD and the processor GPU,  it looks the same.  And because it still has the one port  and it still has the non-Thunderbolt 3 port,  I really feel like if they've been able to come in  at $100 less, it would be that much more compelling.  Because at this point, as you pointed out,  Serenity and on iMore,  it's not just competing against other Ultrabooks.  It's also now competing against things like the iPad Pro.  And so I feel like the ecosystem of when you're buying  an Ultraportable in 2016,  you have a lot more things to consider.

Transcript:  But I mean, the Air brought both the price down  and they managed to position it as a sweet spot for,  this is not the laptop for power users,  this is the laptop for people who want a small machine,  who want to travel.  And I think that the MacBook will eventually  get to that position.  But it's never gonna compete against a pro laptop.  The pro laptops are gonna eventually borrow  some of its design.  But I mean, if you want more ports on your Mac,  you're gonna wanna go for a MacBook Pro.

Transcript:  Apple knows its audience.  However, they might wanna stop lying to the audience.  The Apple press release claiming all sorts  of wonderful things from recycling.  According to motherboard, Jason Kobler says,  almost nothing about the Apple harvests gold  from iPhone's story is true.  Apple put out the word that they've got $40 million  worth of recycled gold.  Now I don't know if Apple said that  or if it was just the headline writers  in all the articles I read like CNN and Fox  and Huffington Post.  But apparently that is not a realistic number.  Somebody else pointed out that all of Apple's  recycling numbers, when you change them to metric tons  are perfectly round, like five zeros round.  But they released them as US pounds,  which made it look like very interestingly precise numbers.  I don't blame Apple for trying to promote the fact  that they're recycling and this is a big issue.  But read it with a grain of salt.

Someone's like, oh, this thing just popped up.  Can someone bust this out really quick?  You write it in 10, 15 minutes,  you move on to the next article.  But unfortunately, you get caught a lot of times  with that sort of stuff.  It's tough when you're, like I said,  those little 15 minute hits,  trying to get them up on the site.  Well, you get, and you know what?  It worked.  It would be better if we double checked everything we did.  It worked, right.  A triple check, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They played the media perfectly  because everybody picked up the headline, ran the headline.  Any consumer that saw the headline remembers that.  Nobody's gonna see this motherboard article saying,  well, it's not quite true.  They quote Kyle Weins, good friend of the network,  he's the CEO of iFixit.  He says, really what's going on is like carbon offsets.  They cut recyclers a check and then say,  give us credit for recycling a million pounds.  The percentage Apple is actually recycling  is a tiny, tiny fraction.  According to Kyle, almost all of the e-waste in the US  is collected by folks like Goodwill,  municipal recycling programs,  or specific electronics recyclers.  Even though Apple has the stores and the mail back program,  they don't recycle a whole lot of stuff.  And that poor robot, Liam, probably is not very busy.

Start time: 1479.00
End time: 1516.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, he's new.  And honestly, the thing that frustrates me  about these stories is if you actually look at Apple's  environmental responsibility report,  nowhere in that report do they say-  Do they say 40 million?  Yeah, the specific words they use were,  amount of material recovered for reuse  through take back initiatives in 2015.  Not even through our take back initiatives,  just through take back initiatives,  then it's just citing the amount of pounds of gold  that they recycled.  And then people spun that off as,  oh, that's a lot of gold.  That means that Apple's making bank.

Start time: 1517.04
End time: 1539.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, iPhones do not represent  a significant portion of recycling.  In Washington state, Apple products are 1.78%  of the total amount of e-waste, not even just waste,  but e-waste recycled, in Oregon 1.65%.  So e-waste is an issue,  because it has to be recycled specially.  There's Liam the robot, the iPhone disassembling robot.

Start time: 1540.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, and that's why they created Liam.  And I think that he's one of those things.  I mean, it's a new initiative.  And Samantha Murphy Kelly at Mashable got to look at him  and wrote a whole thing about that.  Oh, did she? Oh, neat.  Yeah, and got to wrote a really in-depth report  about how it works.  But that's a new thing.  And I think it right now only works for one model of phone,  but it'll obviously be able to be expanded in the future.  So I think that this is something  that they're looking towards the future  of being able to do more of that sort of disassembly.  We'll see.  But Serena makes an excellent point.  If you read their report, the language they use,  they're very clear about saying,  and we're not saying it's us doing this,  it's just all of these things.  But they recognize, I think,  both for the good of the environment  and probably fiscally too,  it makes sense to be able to have ways to disassemble  and reuse these materials.

This is a man who is, as a musician, as an artist,  as someone who's able to control his art  and control, you know, who he is in the media.

And of course, that's the last time.  He had a very, the reason I'm bringing this up,  well, first of all, to commemorate a genius,  artistic genius.  They had a very challenging relationship  with the internet, didn't they?

Start time: 1854.82
End time: 1870.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, he was the first person,  he was like, hey, here's a streaming service  before anyone else thought that was a good idea.

Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, if you, well, that's kind of a part  of what happens with the law.  If you don't protect, if you're not actively protecting  you have to, yeah.  But you know, he wanted to control his music,  which, you know, as someone who's an artist,  I give them props for that.  You know, some people, you know,  you want the streaming stuff, he didn't want it.  He wanted people to buy his music.  He was angry at the music industry,

Start time: 1897.82
End time: 1923.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and very famously, that's why he changed his name  to an artist formerly known as Prince, used a symbol.  He even had the slave written on his cheek.  And that was, I think, reasonably directed  against the music industry, a music industry  that even to this day rips off artists.  Why didn't he see the internet as the savior,  as the alternative to that?  He saw it really as a way the music industry  was using to continue to rip off artists.

Start time: 1924.94
End time: 1958.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he just saw that suddenly people were able  to listen to his music without paying for it.  You know, he put a value on his art,  and when people aren't, you know,  they're not paying for that value,  then what's, you know, you're, you know,  I work hard for this, why aren't I getting money for this?  You know, and if you're a writer, that's the same thing.  If you're any sort of artist, if you create something,  I feel like you should get some compensation for that.  And when, you know, I can just hop onto YouTube  and listen to almost any band I want  without paying, without a streaming service, that's.  That's tough. I understand that emotionally.

You know, obviously his approach would not work  for any new artist, but he'd been around long enough  that he could kind of do that sort of thing.  You know, he owned all of his own masters, for instance,  which I think also put him in a little bit  of a different situation, especially when it comes  to streaming services and to the internet  than other artists, because a lot of times,  you know, as Roberto was saying, you know,  he put a value on his music, but that value is different,  I think, when you own your own masters  and when you really kind of own your own destiny  than when a label owns it  and you're only getting a small piece anyway.

Prince could have said in his will, he's like,  I don't want anyone to ever see these.  Or he could have said, you know what, I have,  I'm gonna give you the opportunity to release these  either as physical media or you can only sell it.  I mean, I don't think he's, you know,  he probably made stipulations not to allow streaming.  Right.  If I were Prince and that was my mindset,  I would say, no, but you have to buy a record.

And then the next day, the interview was pulled  and a very like bifurcated version is up.  And apparently Prince claimed,  and the author disputes this,  that things were off the record.  So it was this very weird scenario  where even like Billboard,  who aggregated the interview to begin with,  even their aggregated copy was pulled.  So this is very weird thing.  And that's what's interesting, I think, about this too,  is that he was such a, he has so much control,  not just over his art,  but over what interviews he did and his image.  And it'll be interesting to see  not just how his estate, I think, handles things  like all these unreleased vaults of music,  but also how other interviews and other projects  and other things that he did over the years,  how that will be preserved and released,  or will it be released?  That'll be interesting.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, and I totally respect his desire to keep control  and it's because he did that he owns the masters  and things like that.  And that was the right, really the right thing to do  for him as an artist.  At this point though, I wonder what happens  to all of that material.  It's hard to know what he would want.  It's interesting that just days before he passed,  he finally said,  "'Okay, you can let that Coachella performance of Creep  go on YouTube.'"  That was just a few days ago.  Yeah, it was just recently.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, that was what made it interesting  that the way the internet covered his past.  I mean, first we got over the shock  and then the first thing you wanna do is you wanna listen  to music. You go online.  And he's not on YouTube, and he's not on Spotify.  He's on Tidal, but nobody subscribes to Tidal.  Well, except for me because of Beyonce.  Prince was honestly one of those things I was like,  "'Honestly, I'll get a side thing  of Prince's whole catalog too.'"  So it was this weird thing where you're trying to find a way  to mourn his fans and listen to his music.  And we're all relegated to buying iTunes.  It's very retro because literally the way  that you normally would when David Bowie passed,  you would just go on YouTube,  go on all these other services.  Go on streaming.  And it's like with Prince, nope, can't do that  because he was extremely good  at getting all those things taken down.

Transcript:  I will say, Apple Music did something really interesting  where of course Prince's catalog is not on Apple Music.  However, Beats One has a broadcast license.  They have a radio license, which covers Prince's catalog.  So for the pretty much starting with his passing,  Zane Lowe did an extra hour on his show,  played nothing but Prince.  Julien Anuga played nothing but Prince for an hour  and then played songs inspired by Prince for two hours.  And then this entire weekend  have been basically Prince lovefests.  And that's one of the really compelling things to Beats One  is, oh, Apple Music doesn't have this music  on their streaming service.

That is where having a broadcast license  actually is really compelling  because you could turn into Beats One.  You could turn into Sirius if you subscribe to that  and hear the music, which feels so retro to have to do that.  It really does.  Yeah.  But there's something really-

Transcript:  The Minneapolis local radio station in Minneapolis  was playing Prince nonstop.  And it wasn't just playing Prince  because he was so part of that city.  They were interviewing people who knew Prince.  Interviewing people from the band.  They're interviewing local reporters.  And so it was, I mean, it's great for them,  but now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have to wonder what the right strategy is for an artist.  It's just unclear.  There's no roadmap.  It's all new and all different.  But it's certainly true that,  so I found out about it on Twitter, right?  Of course, that's where you find out about these things.  And it's funny because I had been on,  I actually was on Gnu Social,  which is kind of the open source alternative to Twitter.  And it's very small.  I mean, there's a bunch of them.  There's quitter.no and so forth.  That's the one I'm on.  And it's very geeky.  Corey Doctorow posts there a lot, stuff like that.  But I noticed there's not a lot of news,  not a lot going on.  And so just to add a chance,  I switched over to Twitter just to compare the two.  And there, it was literally,  I think the first tweet I saw was,  Princess died and I was shocked, of course.  And then of course, what's the first thing you do?  You stay there, you look,  you wanna verify it, of course, and you do that.  I didn't run to the radio.  I didn't run to CNN.  You stay online.  You start watching videos.  You start watching tributes.  This is what we do now.  And I think anybody who's an artist or in the public  has to think about, well, what does that mean going forward?  Does it even make any sense to hold on to stuff?  The problem is you hold on to it, it's gonna get out  and you won't have control of how it gets out.  So you need to have a strategy for how it's gonna get out.  Except the stuff in the vaults.  We may lose that forever,  which is probably not what he would have wanted either,  but who knows?  All right, sad, but I wanted to acknowledge it.  And obviously, Roberto, you're a fan  and you were very fortunate.  You saw him twice in the last couple of months.

That was a weird thing  because I want to watch Purple Rain that night  and I went to several sources,  all of which had an error message  when I tried to play Purple Rain and I was wondering,  I wonder if they've been pulling this.  I finally ended up buying it on one place  I was able to buy it and we were able to watch it.  But I thought that was odd.  And of course AMC is re-releasing it this weekend.

So how do you cash that without bringing down  the rest of all the Wikimedia server run stuff  and how do you serve the cash versions  and then how do you handle edits and all those other things?

Transcript:  This is an article from Ed Erhart  who was with the Wikimedia Foundation.  Here's the graph of traffic, the sudden spike  and in 24 hours, 10 million views of the Prince webpage.  It's another place people go, I think,  to find out how old was he, at the very least,  find out how old was he and other information.  Yeah.  Again, another thing to thank goodness for,  we have Wikipedia, what a resource that is.  People were trying to edit the article  in addition to the high traffic levels.  So many people were trying to update  the English language article  that the rate of edit conflicts spiked at 15 per minute.  That's five times the normal average.  Wow.  I'm not sure if that's because people wanted to  put the end date on there  or because they wanted to correct stuff.  Really interesting how Wikipedia handles this.  And of course they were prepared  because the same thing happened when Michael Jackson passed.  Sad to say they've had some opportunities to do this.

I don't know if you guys remember this,  but when Michael Jackson died,  Facebook briefly went down.  Wow.  In 2009.  And so Facebook's server organization isn't what it is now,  but that I think was such a shocking,  I'll never forget my older sister calling me,  MJ is dead, Facebook is down, call me.  Wow.  You know, those things.  And I was like, I'm aware, I'm on the internet.  I see the TMZ article, I see the whole thing.  I'm sitting in shock.  And literally like Facebook went down  for probably 15 minutes  because so many people just instantly wanted to get on  and talk about it.

And there's the New Yorker cover, which is just-  Beautiful.  Purple and rain.  And they had that up within a few hours of his passing.  Ah, sad.  All right, we'll continue on.  Lots more to talk about.  Great panel to do it with.  Roberto Baldwin is here from Engadget.  He's a senior editor.  Hello.  There, hello.  Also joining us from Mashable.com, Christina Warren.  Great to see you, film girl, once again.  And all the way from Bastin, Serenity Caldwell,  and Imor.com.  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  When it's time to get a new phone,  well, there's two reasons to go to Gazelle now.  Of course, to sell the old phone,  if you go there right now, gazelle.com,  you'll get a quote that's good for 30 days.  Locks them in, not you, but it gives you the chance to,  first of all, get the top dollar,  because nothing gains in value these days.  All these gadgets are going down every single day,  so get the top price.  But it also gives you 30 days to decide to get the new phone,  transfer your data over, and then send it to gazelle.com.  They pay top dollar for all kinds of devices,  even broken iPads and iPhones.  They have value too.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.  At least get the quote.  At least know what that old stuff,  don't throw it in a drawer.  You wouldn't throw a $100 bill in the drawer.  Don't throw your old stuff in the drawers.  Go to gazelle.com, find out what you're missing.  When you're ready to sell it, they ship it for you for free.  They'll send you a box, and then they'll turn it around fast.  If you forget to wipe the data or you can't,  they will do that for you.  And they often adjust the value of their quote upwards.  They guaranteed minimum, but not guaranteed maximum.  And twice I've used gazelle.  They've upped the value, they pay for something.  That's nice, they don't have to do that.  But they do, and I really appreciate that.  Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.  They'll send you a check, PayPal credit,  or if you wanna get a little extra,  get that Amazon gift card, it'll bump it up by 5%.  They also, there's another reason to go to gazelle  when it's time for a new phone.  They sell certified pre-owned devices.  Only the creme de la creme.  They have a variety of iPhones, including the 6S  and the 6S Plus, the latest iPhones.  They have iPads, they have Samsung Galaxy phones.  Whenever a new phone or pad comes out,  that's the time to go to gazelle  because that means they're gonna get a flood of new stuff.  And the very best stuff, they inspect,  they put it through their 30 point inspection,  make sure it's not only fully functional, but in great shape.  And they will sell it in a variety of qualities.  So you can choose, do you want it to be perfect,  or you wanna save a little more money  and have it slightly gently used, you get the choice.  And of course, everything you buy at gazelle  is backed by a 30 day return policy  and sold without carrier contract.  Gazelle, G-E-Z-E-L-L-E.com.  You can get financing from a firm now.  That's an easy checkbox right there at checkout.  You'll be approved instantly.  They also offer warranties for cell phones and iPads  powered by Assurance Solutions.  That covers not just defects,  but water damage and cracked screens too.  Gazelle is a great place to go to sell and to buy.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E gazelle.com.  Google in trouble with the EU.  It's been a year in the making,  but the EU has decided to lodge a formal antitrust charge  against Google saying that they use their 90% market share  to promote the Android operating system,  to force carriers to put Google software on Android.  You don't have to, by the way.  Anybody like Amazon could use Android's software,  but if you wanna put the Google Play Store on there,  Google Maps, then Google Search,  then you need to go to Google  and you need to make an arrangement.  And they feel like the EU feels like this is wrong.  They had potential fines up to $7 billion.  I don't think we'll see fines that hard.  Google has 12 weeks to respond.  Problem with all of this, in my opinion,  is it's moving so fast.  You remember this is similar to what the Department  of Justice said to Microsoft in 1998.  They said you're using your market share on desktops  to enter the new internet market,  to force people to use Internet Explorer.  In the EU, the end result was that was completely stupid.  It was a ballot.  When you install Windows on a computer  or first boot it up on a computer in the EU,  but until very recently, you'd get a ballot  in which you get to choose which browser  you wanted to install on Windows.  That was the answer the EU came up with.  I feel like it's very difficult.  And of course, the 1998 Justice Department  went on and on, cost a lot of money,  and I don't know if it accomplished anything at all.  Microsoft managed to become less of a monopoly  all on its own.  Any thoughts on what the EU is up to?

And then you're like, oh, well, it has Google Play.  You're like, oh, well, let's put a third party,  you know, let's give the third parties an opportunity  to put their store on there.  And I'm like, I don't think that's a good idea.  No.  Beyond the Amazon app store,  my concern is, you know, rando third parties  with their app stores and malware, that's it.  You've introduced more malware into the EU.  Good job, guys.

Transcript:  This is what they object to, requiring manufacturers  to pre-install Google search and Google's Chrome browser.  You're not required to do that.  Again, it's open source software, you don't have to,  but if you're going to put Google services on there,  you have to at least do search and browser,  requiring them to set Google search as the default service.  That's how you get the other apps,  preventing manufacturers from selling  other operating systems based on the open source code.  Once you're part of this consortium  running official Google Android,  you can't do an AOSP version.  And giving financial incentives to manufacturers  and mobile network operators on condition  that they exclusively install Google search  and then devices.  Ironically, this whole complaint really started  because Microsoft and others, other Google competitors,  including the French search engine,  which no one can remember or use,  complained, you know, their competitors, they didn't like it.  Yeah.  Now Microsoft is, by the way, Microsoft and Google  have agreed to bury the hatchet.  They're going to stop complaining about each other.

Start time: 3219.72
End time: 3313.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, I mean, and Amazon, you know,  their issue is a little bit more deep rooted.  They may even make it so that if you want to install  the Amazon App Store or Amazon video apps  on your Android devices, you can't get them from Google Play.  You have to go to amazon.com and sideload them  and install them that way.  So they have, I feel like their issues are deeper  and have more at stake than some of these AOSP complaints  that the EU might be talking about.  But yeah, I mean, I feel like it's one of those things.  I mean, this is what you get for making an agreement  with Google, if you want to get all the benefits  of Android, proper Android, Google Android,  then you've got to have their search there.  I mean, that was something that when we first saw Android  come to market that we saw from the carriers,  you know, I think it was Verizon who had to deal with Bing  so that you would get like a moto droid,  you'd get a droid and it wouldn't have Google search on it.  You know, that was like the flagship Android phone  and it had these other things on it.  And Google very quickly kind of realized,  oh, wait, wait, wait, if we don't put these provisions  in place, then the big things that we are creating  this operating system for and giving it away for free for,  you know, to be able to get more information  and more data from users and be able to more, you know,  heuristically build models about how, you know,  predictive stuff works and get this information  and target users with their advertising won't exist anymore.  So it's kind of a push pull, but I kind of wonder,  I mean, it's interesting that this is happening now.  It's like, where have you guys been for the last,  you know, eight, nine years?  Because this has always been part of the,  it's always been part of the trade-off.

Start time: 3313.64
End time: 3330.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's kind of a bitter irony in this though,  because if Google hadn't offered a free version of Android,  hadn't made Android open source, hadn't created AOSP,  they wouldn't, I mean, Apple doesn't do any of that  and is not being challenged because an iPhone has,  you know, an iPhone is an iPhone.  And so Apple is a-

Start time: 3332.00
End time: 3336.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but they're the only one who makes an iPhone.  It would probably be different if you had other companies  who would make iPhones.

Start time: 3337.16
End time: 3347.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they got hoisted by being more open and more,  and Apple doesn't have to worry because they just,  of course, Apple does not have the market dominance.  Yeah, they don't have 80% of the market.  Right.

Start time: 3348.26
End time: 3350.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3351.44
End time: 3390.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's partially market share, but it's also,  you know, it's the collaboration of hardware and software.  And if you are working with other companies,  it becomes dicey under EU legislation  to say to other companies,  no, you're only allowed to use our software  or our specific things or else you, you know, you miss out.  Like that's a dangerous precedent to set.  And it's, I mean, as we've talked about with Microsoft,  it's something that's come up before.  Apple skirts around it not only  because they don't necessarily have the market share,  but even if Apple had 80% of the market share,  I don't think the EU is gonna come place the hammer down  on Apple because their hardware that they make  runs their software that they make.

I could see that as an option.  I could see someone like coming out of the woodwork  and saying, you know what,  you need to make iOS available for Samsung for other people.  No.  So maybe not having 80% of the market share is pretty good.

End time: 3536.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was a shocker to me  that Apple was willing to do that.  I'd love to see USB-C everywhere,  although apparently the quick charge devices,  HTC 10 and the LG 5, which use USB-C  and Qualcomm's quick charge are out of compliance with USB-C.  They're over voltage.  You can only go so high.  And Qualcomm says, well, we don't tell them that they,  it's up to them how much voltage they want to use.  And people like Benson Leung,  who has been the staunch defender of the USB-C spec  to make sure that it doesn't burn out  things like your MacBook,  point out this is not in compliance.  So you could plug in an HTC 10 to your MacBook  and would draw too much power.  Could hurt your MacBook.

Start time: 3537.56
End time: 3558.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it's not a good situation.  And even, I suspect Apple has some precautions built in  there to the charging point to just to prevent-  I would hope so.  Yeah. Well, I mean, it's Apple.  They think about these things,  but some other laptop manufacturers, not so much.  And we've heard a lot about USB-C's relative flakiness  when it comes to chargers.

Transcript:  But are your legs red?  No.  Amazon, I saw this article, I thought,  wow, this is really interesting.  Anne Christie, who is a Navy commander by day  and writes romances at night,  wrote an interesting article about scammers  on the Kindle Unlimited.  So Kindle Unlimited is your subscription,  you know, your Netflix for books.  I keep getting tempted, I haven't yet done it.  Did anybody use Kindle Unlimited?

Start time: 4195.60
End time: 4213.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, and then I forgot.  I subscribed for a number of months  and then I unsubscribed, it was fine.  Because you never used it.  I never used it, because the problem is  they've got some good books, but a lot of the,  but the selection is kind of like what Netflix was  in its early years, you know, where like,  you have some limited, it's pretty, fairly big.

Start time: 4213.30
End time: 4317.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there's an author, if there's like, you know,  if Anne Christie, you know, and you're a big Anne Christie  fan and you can read all of her books,  then that would be worth it, right?  It's a monthly fee, unlimited.  So what's interesting is how authors get paid  and until Christie wrote about it, I had no idea.  So the theory is that all the money that goes into  Kindle Unlimited goes into a communal pot,  which is divided up, not based on the price of the book,  but the number of pages.  This seems very equitable, right?  If you write a great page turner of 500 pages,  you get more than if somebody writes a book  and only 20 pages are read, right?  You get paid per page in effect.  But there are scammers and apparently there are thousands  of books on Kindle Unlimited where the book is  win an iPod, right?  And what happens is you, on the first page it says,  okay, jump to page 3000 and it turns out the way  the pages are counted is not sequentially,  but just the farthest page anybody got to in the book.  So these scammers, you go, oh, I'm on page one,  okay, jump to 3000 to win my iPod,  which of course nobody ever wins.  Now Amazon says, oh wow, they read 3000 pages  and that scammer gets that much more of the pot per page.  It comes into about, according to Christie,  a buck 57 for a 350 page book.  That means like $15 for a 3000 page book.  That's a big chunk of change.  What a huge scam.  I did not know about this.

Transcript:  A, it's a scam.  B, I wanna write a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  I know, it's tempting now.

But you would think that, I mean,  you could sort of understand how that happened  in the early days of online ads and how people could  scam the system that way, but you would think that Amazon,  if you're gonna have a system like this,  that you would have provisions in place  that would prevent this from happening.  Like this just seems so obvious.  It's disappointing that they didn't foresee  that obviously this would be the sort of thing that happened.

I see we can go to San Jose end of the May.  The kids today, they'll do anything.  Anyway, where was I?  Oh.  Oh, I just learned, today I learned  Uber drivers don't get tips.  Yeah.  Didn't they imply that part of the deal on Uber  was the tips built in?

Start time: 4556.60
End time: 4585.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so they did like five years ago  and then they stopped implying that once it was apparent.  They're like, oh no, actually.  What they used to do is in the early days of Uber  as I recall, some of the language kind of implied  that the money, that you didn't need to tip your driver  because the payment you gave included some sort of-  Yes.  But they got rid of that language probably four years ago.  Lyft does let you tip if you're done,  but yeah, you're right.  That was something I think for early Uber users  that we were kind of bought into.

Start time: 4586.26
End time: 4593.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so now I feel like a total jerk  because I've been getting out of the car going,  thanks, see you later.  Never tipping anybody.

Start time: 4595.06

Start time: 4600.42
End time: 4605.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, which I'm going to be honest with you,  part of the reason I use Uber is because I don't carry cash.  So that's sort of a problem.

Start time: 4606.14
End time: 4607.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And a lot of times the drivers won't take them either.

Start time: 4608.22
End time: 4620.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they will now because apparently, get ready,  they're going to put signs in the Ubers saying,  I don't receive tips, please tip me.  And this is part of the settlement that Uber just made.

Start time: 4620.62
End time: 4622.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The settlement of 100 million dollars.  Yeah.

Start time: 4623.48
End time: 4631.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they can't, Uber can't yell at the driver for doing that.  Lyft has it in the app, right?  Yeah, and Uber.

Start time: 4631.74
End time: 4658.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is smart.  Yeah.  Because you don't have to tip a ton.  I mean, you can just give a dollar or two,  because they're still getting whatever their cut is  from the thing and then you feel good about that.  I always just feel weird because with a cab,  like 20%, I can just get 20%.  I always give them 20%, yeah.  Same, same.  But if I'm being totally honest,  and this is where I feel like a terrible person,  but I'm admitting this on the internet,  so this is going to haunt me,  I don't know if I would always want to tip 20%.

Start time: 4669.48
End time: 4674.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to tip 20% in the Lyft or Uber  because then it would be more expensive than a cab  and that defeats the purpose.

Start time: 4675.24
End time: 4680.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly why Uber refuses to update their software  to include a tip button.

Start time: 4681.06
End time: 4685.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I would give a few dollars, I would do that.  I'm just not saying that I would always give like 20%.

Start time: 4686.14
End time: 4719.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, there's a place at my local cafe,  they have like a pseudo square  that I think is run on Samsung,  and it flips over and it says,  what would you like to tip?  Five, 10, 15, or 20%.  And then it shows it on those various things.  And granted, I think that's a way to guilt yourself  into paying 20%.  Totally.  Yeah, because you're like, oh, five dollars.  Yeah, I don't want to be a super stingy person,  but that might be a good way of just like,  Uber, how or tie tipping to rating, maybe?  I feel like that would get messy fast.

Start time: 4720.50
End time: 4737.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And don't look back,  because there's some situations where it's like,  and here's the thing,  for a shorter trip, I might tip more.  You know what I mean?  Like if it's like a $5 ride, I might be like,  here's three dollars.  Because that's usually what I do in a cab.  But if it's like a $50 ride, I don't necessarily want to.  You don't want to pay 20% on a $50 ride, yeah.

Start time: 4740.64
End time: 4749.74

And while I have lots of mixed feelings  about the service economy,  it's still, if I'm hiring somebody  who is putting themselves out there for a service,  and the service that I am hiring them for  is a service that I would normally get from a taxi,  I am going to treat it like a taxi service.  I'm not going to be like,  oh, just because it's $3 cheaper,  I'm going to sit up front  and we're going to gossip about our days.  Like, unless it's somebody I know who's also a Lyft driver.

I mean, now if there are like four of us traveling  in the car and somebody's got to sit up front,  that's totally cool.  But otherwise, it is a driving mistake situation.

So did you know that in April Fool's Day  in LA, New York, and San Francisco,  you could arrange a prank  and there'd be weird practical jokes.  There's prank mode.  Like for instance,  let me see here.  This is the article about my cousin,  the guy who came up.  So an actor in burned clothing,  covered in soot and ashes and chicken feathers  gets in the car carrying a live chicken in a cage  ranting about explosions at chickens.  And then, so you're in this car with this person  and then of course your friend gets to say,  hi, you should have seen your face when the,  and apparently this happened to Andrea Guadala  who's this Golden State Warrior,  oh no, Festus Zelli,  his Lyft driver turned on the radio  and a fake talk show began reporting the news  that he'd been cut from the team.  Oh my God.  Meanwhile, his teammates were in on the gag,  began texting him their condolences,  but then there was cake and balloons,  so everybody was okay.  I guess.  Oh boy.

Although an anonymous on Facebook,  Facebook knows who you are.  They know everything.  They know what kind of underwear you're wearing.  So, or if you are wearing.

Transcript:  That's my agreement.  Word.  No, I mean, if you're in a country  with oppressive internet or, you know,  you still want to be able to tell,  talk to family who have gotten out of that country.  Facebook's a great way to tell them what's going on.  I, you know, I'm still concerned about Facebook's,  you know, requirement.  You have a real name,  especially for people who are in these countries  who are using Tor.  It's sort of-  True, true.  Very much.  Yeah, sort of this weird thing.  But, you know, the fact that it's there is nice.  And sometimes I get, you know,  extra paranoid about stuff and I'll use Tor.  So, if I wanted one on Facebook.

Transcript:  Some of them were creepy.  Yeah.  But no, but Poncho is the other bot.  And I really like it,  except it comes sometimes at like inopportune times.  Like you can tell they're servers  or sometimes hit with things  because I'll get like a jillion Poncho notifications  at once.  And the one annoying thing I do have to say  is that you'll get your Facebook bot notification  on all of your devices.  So if I'm like at home, it'll hit my iPhone, my iPad,  my computer, like my other iPhone.  And I'm like, really?  Really?  I don't need it on all of these things,  like right this second.

Start time: 5431.18
End time: 5457.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh crap, I clicked on it.  Now he's back.  So the thing about Poncho that's really annoying  is you can't cancel it.  I type stop.  I type cancel.  I type go away.  Stop bothering me.  And all he comes back with is nonsensical stuff.  And the weather forecasts are even kind of nonsensical,  like weird weather forecasts and stuff.  So finally I figured out  that you can actually block him like a stalker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you shouldn't.  Because the one thing I did like about it  is that there were like pollen notifications built into it,  which actually for this time of year in New York  is actually helpful.  And that's actually more helpful  than what you would get from some of the  just typical weather things where I can be like,  your pollen situation today is pretty terrible.  It's like, okay, well, good to know.  Can't really do anything about it,  but now I can maybe plan my walking route better.

Transcript:  Oh my God.  Our show today brought you by something  that will relax you.  Headspace.  Have you ever meditated?  Meditating is so cool.  I think sometimes people go,  I don't want to do that thing where you go,  they get the bell and you.  While meditation, of course,  has thousands of years of tradition,  Headspace is very modern, not airy-fairy at all.  In fact, you're going to love it.  Andy Puddicombe is the guy who created it.  He was a monk for many years,  but he's very straightforward and this is so great.  It's a free app you put on your iPhone  or your Android phone.  You get 10 free meditation sessions.  That's really all you need to know  what this can do for you.  Meditation focuses you.  It reduces fear and anger and stress and anxiety.  You'll fear your relationships get better.  Your life will get better just from 10 minutes  of Andy's voice.  We should play some of Andy's voice on this  because he's so, he's so.  You can actually listen to his TED Talk  if you want to do that before you join Headspace.  It's free right now though, why not?  You can go on the web.  You can do it on your phone.  You can, and it's nice on your phone.  I will either listen on headphones  so it's kind of more private  or you can also put it on speakers.  It's very relaxing and you feel very good afterwards,  but don't do it while you're driving a car.  Headspace.com slash twit.  Andy Puddicombe, if you search for his TED Talk,  it's all about meditation and stuff here.  Let me play a little session.

Maybe they have an idea it's about stopping thoughts  or eliminating feelings,  but the reality is a bit different.  An easy way to think of it is to imagine yourself sitting  by the side of a busy road.  The passing cars representing the thoughts and the feelings.  I just love it, Headspace.

I feel better.  The internet is broken, says Edward Snowden.  He says why, this is a long, actually really a long piece.  I'm not even gonna try to recreate it.  It's in popular science and it's worth reading.  Put this in your pocket or your Instapaper  and your readability and spend some time with it.  Because it's more of an article by Edward  than a conversation.  But he says really the way we're doing this  is instead of going after individual criminals and terrorists,  we're going after everybody.  And we can't get our privacy.

End time: 5892.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so 60 Minutes, I didn't know this,  but I learned it from the Violet article.  60 Minutes took a piece that they had done in Australia  a year ago about the SS7 hack,  which we've known about since 2007, by the way.  And that is a genuine hack.  That is a flaw in the baseband radio in every single phone.  And it's been known for nine years,  and nobody's paying any attention to it.  So that was legitimate.  But then they took that and they mushed in some stuff  from Defcon.  From Defcon last year, last year.  A year old Defcon.

And of course they use somebody from Lookout,  or Lookout, I'm sorry, somebody selling security software  as an expert saying, oh, you need some security software.  Well, yeah.  Anyway, Violet does a good take down on it.  What she points out is while the SS7 hack is real,  it is a difficult thing to do  and probably would have to be a nation state  or a big actor, wouldn't just be some guy going after you  in a coffee shop.  Also we should point out that you don't have to really  run out and buy Lookout security for your Android or iPhone.  But good piece.  Yeah.

Start time: 5951.81
End time: 5965.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's basically, they make it sound like everybody's  going to be hacked like this and it's not.  It's going, if you're the president of a large company  or the CEO or you're dealing, if you're a huge target,  then maybe you should be concerned about this,  but 99.9% of us are just like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They really dramatize it.  They had everything, they had the hackers sitting around  in a dark room and they gave, talk about histrionics.  They had an iPhone and they gave it to a congressman  and then they gave the phone number to the bad guys  to use SS7 and the bad guys start playing  the congressman's phone calls and text messages.  And it's like, oh, that's dramatic.  But so this is a little bit of a,  this is how Violet wraps it up.  Don't get me wrong.  SS7 surveillance, network spoofing, fishing  and Spuria's product placement are all very real issues  that consumers need to be on top of.  But 60 Minutes got it all backward in the name of drama.  The show may as well have told people  to soak their phones in bleach before burning them  after their next sext for all the uselessness  and flat out fakeity fake hysteria in hacking your phone.  There are a million great, truly chilling  and unbelievably urgent hacking stories to be told.  Ones that desperately need to be addressed  by the FCC and congressional investigations.  Stories that can be all of those things only  but when they're told accurately.  After this, I don't believe we'll see any of them  on 60 Minutes.  So just a little takeaway.  We talked about it on security now a little bit.  We had covered the Chaos Computing Club's revelations  about SS7 two or three years ago.  But as I didn't know this, but Violet points out  that we've known about this since 2007.  This is not new.  Yeah.

But this is just, I think shows how silly  and short-sighted and frankly dangerous those bills are  because they're saying is they're basically  penalizing American companies  for trying to make products secure  when what will happen is that companies  that operate in other places.  And Viber was formed by a place in Israel  and then was bought by the, what is it, Rakuten?  Rakuten, yeah.  The Japanese e-commerce giant bought them.  All that stuff will just move to foreign companies.  And those companies will continue to sell apps  or offer apps that people can download and use.  So all you're really doing is just moving  the way you communicate to other services  and hurting American companies  from even offering a secure solution.

Transcript:  There may be a reason why Congress is so clueless.  Good article in The Wired, Kim Zetter writing  that they fired the Office of Technology Assessment  more than 10 years ago.  Actually almost two decades ago in a round of budget cuts.  This was a body of independent technical  and scientific experts who were there  to advise Congress on technology.  It was so good, it became the model for other countries  to create their own offices of technology assessment.  But part of the contract with America  that Newt Gingrich put forth in the 90s, defunded it.  And that was that.  And now only about four members of Congress  have any technical expertise, any technical expertise.  4% of federal lawmakers have a technical background  of any kind and the rest have no one to ask  when it comes to things like encryption  and metadata and email and SS7.  Of course, they know they're sad, sad state of affairs.  We had, the budget was not huge, $20 million a year.  There were 140 permanent staffers  and then they would supplement them  with subject matter experts from the outside.  They were known for their rigor, their quality  and they were, according to the Washington Times,  the voice of authority in a city inundated with statistics  and technical gobbledygook.  Well, now all we have is the technical gobbledygook.  It was bipartisan, crazy.  It explains a lot though.

Transcript:  Did you read the expose of the...  Well, so Kevin Kelly, who I really like,  wrote a very nice piece,  working on a long time about Magic Leap,  kind of promoting this technology  without really revealing in any way how it worked.  Neelai Patel did a great job, I thought, in The Verge,  saying, here's five questions that remain unanswered.  What the hell is it?  And here's the picture from Wired  of a Magic Leap engineer in a photonics lab  doing what Neelai calls,  appears to be cool engineer stuff.  But what is it?  And what's it running on?  He says, is there a giant fridge-sized supercomputer  under the table?  Is there a new Magic Leap operating system?  What is going on here?  And then he said, of course, there's this video  that is billed as as shot through Magic Leap technology.  Neelai writes, so, you know, how does that work?  What did the camera rig look like?  Did they really just mount the glasses  on the front of the DSLR?  Why can't you see the frames of the glasses  or any pixels at all?  How did the camera know what to focus on?  Is the content we're seeing live?  Is it pre-rendered?  Wait a minute, is that the Google Hangouts icon?  Is there a Google Hangouts app or integration?  Does Magic Leap know how to parse the contents  of that message and then pull related data?  Now, I love Kevin.  I think Kevin's a great guy and he's a knowledgeable guy,  but it does feel like he may be,  this was not the most thorough investigation  of what Magic Leap is up to.  Have any of you played with it or seen it  or all we've all seen is these demo videos?

Start time: 6768.36
End time: 6812.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I enjoyed it.  Well, I mean, you know,  the one critique I will make about the book,  because I thought it was actually really good to know more,  and he made some really interesting observations  about anybody who's worked at a startup,  I think, could relate.  I would be a little bit remiss to try to extrapolate  his experience at HubSpot,  a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Silicon Valley,  because I don't think that those are really the same.  But it was a really interesting read.  I thought it was good.  A lot of the observations are things that,  I think, as I said,  anybody who's worked in a startup environment,  which is employed by a lot of people  who it's their first jobs,  or they're just starting to kind of build a business.  It was interesting.  It was very funny.  I thought it was a really good read.  I read it two weeks ago.  I'm gonna enjoy it.

Wrote for Newsweek.  And then lost his job.  And middle-aged guy,  good luck finding a job in journalism in 19,  or I'm sorry, 2010.  So he took a job at a startup, HubSpot.  And I even, I talked to him around about that,  and I thought, well, what are you,  you're a journalist, what are you doing at HubSpot?  And he couldn't really explain it.  I guess now what I know what he was doing,  he was gathering material for a book.  HubSpot very famously went through all sorts  of skullduggery to try to get copies of the book  and stop it.

Start time: 6855.04
End time: 6947.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the best part.  That's the funniest part is that the epilogue,  he'd spent a lot of time kind of using code names  for some of the people in the book,  and most of the people in the book have kind of code names.  And then he was able to kind of reveal  who at least three of those people were,  because they were all implicated by,  you know, the weirdness where they tried  to get a hold of the book beforehand.  And there was, I think, like an FBI investigation  and a ridiculous thing.  And then the stupid thing is, is PropSwat,  this was idiotic because again,  I mean, it's not the best portrait of the company.  The company doesn't come out looking great,  but it's not like they were running a Ponzi scheme  or anything.  They're just for kind of a, you know.  They're just bros, man.  They're just bros.  Exactly, totally.  A bro-ish company in Boston, like, okay.  Like it's, your company doesn't look fantastic,  but they don't look terrible.  And I think a lot, enough people would probably write off  the negative kind of portrayal as somebody  who just didn't fit in by his own admission  for a lot of reasons.  And they ended up doing themselves a tremendous disservice  and giving the book a tremendous amount of publicity  and a really great coda by being, you know,  so terrible and trying to get a copy of the manuscript  before it was done.  When that story broke last year,  I couldn't stop laughing because I was thinking,  oh my God, I mean, I'm sure that for Dan,  it was probably terrible to think that some people  might be spying on you and you don't know, you know,  how far the information about you and that genuinely,  I think would probably be a really unnerving experience.  But at the same time, I was just, I'm thinking,  if you're him, you're just so excited  because it's the best publicity you could ever have.

He's got an app which I love called PhotoCard for iOS.  It lets you make beautiful printed postcards,  which he then mails.  And incidentally, he may kind of just,  he's a very, very good photographer.  If he sees, he could help that photo  by a little bit of, a little nudge here and there  on the slider.  He's gonna do that before he prints it out for you.  Anyway, it's really cool.  He's gonna give us, he said,  look, what I really need is a video of how to use this.  I said, come up.  We'll do this, we'll make it for you.  You can use it in any way you want.  So that's what we're gonna do tomorrow  if you wanna watch in.  We'll do that.  There it is, PhotoCard by Bill Atkinson.

Kind of a cool story.  Coming out of UC Irvine,  a doctoral student, Maya Lee Tai,  was messing around with lithium ion batteries.  The problem, I did not know this.  We all know that lithium ion batteries  have a limited life cycle, right?  Typically, they can be charged and discharged 500 times.  Maybe a little more, maybe a little less.  And that's why after a couple of years,  you can't charge your iPhone or your laptop.  It just won't take a charge.  What I didn't know is the reason is  they're using really fine nanowire conductors.  And these conductors get brittle and break  after 500 cycles.  They just wear out.  So she was messing around.  I'm not sure what the context was,  but she said it was totally serendipitous.  She wasn't trying to do anything.  She sprayed the wires with a gel,  which polymerized on the wires as they heated up  and protected them and gives them virtually infinite life.  Lithium ion batteries that don't wear out.  And this is in the American Chemical Society's  energy letters.  It's been verified.  It is pretty amazing.  And the only question in my mind is  when is this gonna happen?  All nanowire capacitors can be extended  from 2,000 to 8,000 cycles to more than 100,000 cycles  simply by replacing the liquid electrolyte  with a gel electrolyte.  Bada bing, bada boom.  Cool.

Transcript:  So much stuff is serendipitous.  The famous story of the discovery  of the sticky note adhesive.  Guy was trying to make, at 3M,  was trying to make ladder treads,  step ladder treads that would keep you from slipping off.  And so he was trying all these different things  and he found an adhesive that kind of was easy to remove,  didn't leave a residue behind.  And I guess somebody said,  you know, if you put that on paper,  you can make a sticky note.  It's just weird.  Anything else you guys wanna talk about  before we wrap it up?  I think we're ready to go watch some TV.

But I just don't want to stop talking  when we get such a great panel.  Thanks to our studio audience.  Nice to have you all here.  You can be in the studio audience.  We're still in the brick house for a few more months.  If you want to see your brick and join us in the studio,  please email tickets at twit.tv.  We'll make some room for you.  We don't, I think we'll be moving end of summer,  although, so we've leased a space, interestingly enough,  owned by Broadcom.  And they keep saying they're going to leave,  but they won't.  So I don't know when we're going to get in there.  It may not be August at this point,  but we do have to move eventually  because where I'm sitting right now  will be a giant barrel of mash of hops  because it's going to be a brewery in about a year.  You can also watch the show live.  We stream it live as we do with all our shows  on twit.tv slash live or live.twit.tv.  We have the two pages because it turns out  if you're a government worker,  twit.tv slash live doesn't work  because the player we use,  JW player is widely used by porn sites.  Who knew?  So we have another page that doesn't use the JW player  that is live.twit.tv.  Pick one, it's the same show on both pages.  You can also get the show after the fact on demand.  Is it really?  Yes.  Is it really?  Well, it's a little more adult on JW player.  I'm losing up my shirt.
