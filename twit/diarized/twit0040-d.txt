Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is twit, this week in tech, episode 40 for January 29th 2006.  Yellow lasers.  Hey Steve. Hey, here I am. I can't believe it. Yay, Steve Wozniak in Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I'm outside of a Starbucks sitting at a table because the check in line at my hotel was way too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect. What better thing to do when you gotta, you know, just hang out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And guess who walks by? A Las Vegas friend that I never call when I'm in town.  Never! Kevin Mitnick.  You're kidding.  He comes by the same Starbucks having no idea I'm here.  So can use my computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got Mitnick with you? That's great.  I heard Mitnick was just on art, you were just on Art Bell, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He can't hear you right now. I've split my earphone connection but with another friend. Hang on, he's putting an earphone on me.  How many people you got with you there?  Well my friend Alex is here with me. He's a good one for jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey Kevin, how you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright, you won't believe this. I'm running into Starbucks because I was going to do some work here and get a latte.  And sitting outside here at the table is Wozniak, my friend Alex.  That's hysterical.  And they go, oh my god. Yeah, that's just hysterical because they didn't even tell me they were in town.  So I'm kind of angry right now.  Well the FBI, you know.  Well now you know my location.  We're using Moa GoGo right now to track Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have no idea where he is. We've narrowed it down. He's in a Starbucks.  Well Starbucks in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That only leaves 4,000 other places to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like 40 of them in the strip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So John C. Dvorak is on the line with us. Patrick Norton is there.  And by the way, Woz, Patrick is fixing his car while he's doing this twit.  So this is the weirdest twit we've ever done. He's actually under his car.  What are you doing? Your brake fluid, Patrick?  Ailey, are you bleeding my brakes?  It's probably because we have so many people on here, John, but I sound fine to me and that's all that really matters.  No, because I'm recording it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not doubting it. It's just always a funny line to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm recording it. So Kevin, you were just on Art Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was on Art Bell last night. Is that Patrick Norton?  Yeah.  Hey man.  Hey!  They say these type quotes aren't that cool.  I must be dreaming. This is really weird.  Bumping into Woz at a Starbucks and then ending up on your show, I guess, with Leigh and Leo.  Yeah, this is twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Before we go further, how did you? You just came to the Starbucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh my God.  I had no idea you were in town.  I put it in my bag.  And you changed your cell phone number. I tried calling you the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy.  We'll talk about that later.  You two can fight this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe we should get him a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome to the Kevin Mitnick Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a furniture convention in town. It was the longest taxi line, the longest ridgeline, and the longest bus.  The longest registration line I've ever seen here. And I've seen some long ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What brings you to Vegas, Woz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, believe it or not, for the first time in my life, I am doing, I'm actually a paid-for speaker for another technology company.  This is so strange. For Division of Sharp.  And they have a dealers meeting here, and I'm going to get up there and, you know, and film with my best jokes.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you going to tell them quid quid latine dictum sit altum viditur?  I don't know that one.  Yes, you do. You signed your emails with it. You used to sign your emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, I remember that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whatever it means, whatever is said in Latin sounds profound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, as I got off the airplane, I thought of a joke, which is, I was going to bring my printer, but they wouldn't allow any sharp objects on the plane.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good. You know, that's a good business, you know, doing the comedy bits in front of corporate audiences.  I know a lot of comics have turned to that as a way to make a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, this is so serious. They're updating me on their new products.  They want me to talk about them and be hospitable and be in business dress.  Well, for me, business dress is a soft sweater over a t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've never seen you in its eye in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I bought a lot of suits for a road show we're doing to raise money from investors, mostly on the East Coast.  I bought a whole bunch of suits, suits real expensive.  And then they told me, oh, you can come as you are.  And I haven't worn them.  I'm going to save those for the high school robot competitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, where suits to those?  I wanted to ask you about that.  The last time we did Twitter, you were unavailable because you were rehearsing for the road show.  Is this to raise money for Wheels of Zeus or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is actually a whole new startup that's filed with the SEC.  And we're basically going public in a couple of weeks.  Do you want to talk about it or is it quiet period, I guess?  No, you know, there's all sorts of SEC.  You can get in trouble by talking publicly about these sort of things.  Right.  There's sort of an SEC quiet periods and whatnot.  And I don't know what really gets you in trouble or just gets your hand slapped.  And so it's like private.  It's private for now only to the right investors.  Now, if you are one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I feel somebody's starting the car.  I love this.  This is great.  I love this.  I have to say everybody.  This could be the Twitter meeting of investors in was his new startup right here.  This is all the all the investors.  They've been very generous with that.  They've been very generous with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, one thing I one thing I didn't tell you, Leo, is it's what's called a SPAC, an acquisition corporation,  special purpose acquisition corporation.  So we are not allowed to know what we're going to do.  We're not allowed to have any pre-existing knowledge of any company or investigation of a specific company  or even allowed to talk about a specific company that we might acquire.  Once we get the money, we have 18 months to acquire a company.  The clock starts ticking and it's very strange.  So it's a long, long time.  We don't even get to get paid a salary either.  Until if we ever if we ever acquire a company, maybe then we go into management and get a salary.  So it's a long, long process, a big, big sacrifice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever heard of such a thing, John?  Does this is Hello, John, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry, I was over there cleaning up.  I was listening to that.  I never heard of this.  Anything like this.  That's it.  I think it'd be worth writing about.  I should probably talk to was about a SPAC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, special purpose acquisition corporation.  You can look it up and learn.  There have been a lot of them.  And basically they tend to make it if they find an acquisition.  But you've got to get 80 percent shareholder approval.  So you've got to spend 80 percent of your money on one acquisition.  It's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the point?  Well, what's the reason for doing that?  Said you're just going out and buying a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm not a financial person, so I would have no idea.  They got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is starting to sound like a money python skit.  Very low risk.  I know why, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, the answer is a low risk for the investors because 95 percent of the money over 95 percent of the money is held in trust.  And if we don't ever accomplish skidly squat, they get their money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, pretty low downside.  And if we find a company, we're bringing a bunch of a lot of experience and management talent and success to the table.  We would probably run it.  We're the strongest team they've ever seen of that sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who do you mean that they've ever seen?  Who's they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The investors in SPAC.  There's certain people at investors.  And who's your team?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you talk about it?  We managed to get you into trouble here with the SEC.  I hope we're not asking for too much.  Are you taping this now?  Actually, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course we're on the air.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  Hi folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it was filed, there were websites that had our team.  It's myself, a former Apple CEO, Gil Amelio, and Ellen Hancock.  And Gil called us up as good friends that he trusts and feels are very bright.  And the three of us bring a lot of different, you know, pieces of the company to the table.  That's an interesting team.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you get along pretty well with Gil and Eileen when they were running Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  But, you know, especially Gil.  I mean, I see him.  I see him.  He laughs at jokes.  And he really loves the technology working well.  He loves it when it's great.  He doesn't, he's not one of these people who's just a staid manager and he'll do the right  steps to plug the holes and this and that.  No, he loves the technology too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a pretty prestigious group of people.  Eileen, when she left Apple, did she go to HP?  Where did she end up working?  I'm trying to remember.  She went to work for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, she worked for IBM.  IBM, that's right.  This is Ellen Hancock.  Yeah, she ran the big server farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm ten years Exodus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exodus, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exodus.  Matter of fact, my friend Alex is sitting right next to me.  He really ran it and then she just sort of sat on his coattails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never said that.  And Kevin hacked it, right?  That was the deal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't hack anymore, Leo.  He doesn't hack.  No, he's a security.  Alex does it for me.  He's a security professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got so many gifts for Christmas, he's a good boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I have to say.  In fact, all three of us are in Vegas right now just with the furniture convention.  I only hack when Patrick leaves a cell phone in the rental car.  Remember that, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know intimately.  What happened?  I never heard about that.  What happened?  I never quite recovered with that cell phone.  What did he do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did he reprogram it?  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  He left his cell phone in the cab and I recovered it for him.  Then I had a joyous moment handing it back to him.  Say, you have a very interesting cell phone there, Patrick.  And that's all he had to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  He probably had to go back to the manufacturer and have the ROM flashed.  Kevin's a master of that, social engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like to still posting all his chats for the well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I trust Kevin, but every time I get a crank call, I just scream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the heavy breathing that gets him away every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Leo.  Well, Leo, I'm going to interrupt for a second.  I think we've got this news piled up.  I think you guys being on the line here might contribute to it.  Leo, you want to start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should we take a look at some of the top stories in the week's technology news?  And Alex and Kevin and Waz, I just hope you'll jump right in  and give us your nickels worth.  I should as well say who's online.  Robert Heron is also with us from DLTV.  Of course, Patrick is working on his car.  Patrick, continue on, please.  Don't stop.  Bleed those brakes.  John C. Dvorak.  You know, what's funny was that you should run into Kevin in Las Vegas,  because I don't think Kevin's ever in Las Vegas.  It's just a weird confluence here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.  He's only in Las Vegas when I'm here.  And of course, I never call him.  You never call him, as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he doesn't know I'm using GPS technology to track him.  That's one way to avoid it.  Last I heard, Kevin was still living in Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One way to avoid it.  One more thing before we get to the news.  I want to ask, because I mentioned that Waz has this signature that he used,  the Latin signature, but now you have this new signature in your email.  TV is wakeboard.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TV is wake zone is an anagram of my name.  Take the letters of Steve Wozniak and rearrange them.  Get TV is wake zone or OK, a new size TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's just puzzling people, but it's really just your name twisted up.  Yeah, it's not super clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not super good.  But at least it's something that doesn't, you don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It got me thinking.  I was trying to, what is TV is wake zone?  We know what it is now.  Now we know.  You're going to have to get a new one, Waz.  So the big story of the week, of course, Google,  Google deciding to go into China and do what the Chinese government asked,  censor news sites.  Interesting reaction to this.  One group of bloggers says they're going to pull AdSense ads.  They're not going to run Google ads anymore, biting the hand that feeds them,  because that's the main source of revenue for most blogs.  Another blogger, a very well-known blogger, Jason Kalakannis,  said Google did the right thing and he would do the same thing.  So which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google did the right thing, in my opinion,  because I grew up with a concept of the United States, America,  our Constitution, what it all means.  And I'm still very true to that, even though it's being clobbered all over the place.  But one of the key elements was that my dad taught me about right to privacy,  that your home is secure, people don't come in and disturb it.  And also one country doesn't go in and change another country.  We all have different cultures.  We're different kinds of people.  Let them be their way.  Let us be our way.  Don't say there's one right way.  You have to be our way.  So you say this, it's being risk...  It's a sharing.  It's actually a sharing approach to say that they can have their way.  Interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's respectful, you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And they will respect us the same, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, is it respectful if you were going along with the program  with Adolf Hitler, you know, to bring up an old bromide?  Well, we're talking about within a country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking about within their country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  But on the other hand, we invaded Iraq because we didn't like who was running Iraq.  So we certainly don't have a tradition in this country of respect  to other foreign nations' sovereignty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we don't.  Not about ever, but we should.  And sovereignty is important.  And it's just as important from a country to a country  the same way as you would think of your neighbor.  You know, your neighbor's doing something you don't like in his house.  What, you have a right to go in and kill him  and then clean up the house and say we painted it a nice pretty blue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Waz, maybe Google should just as have said  we're not going to do business in a country where their human rights are ignored  and they want us to censor the information that their citizens can get.  We just don't want to do business in this country.  I'm not saying that they should not agree to, you know, go along with the Chinese.  They should just take the high road and say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, before Waz comes in on that, let me make a comment here  because I got into a debate with a couple of the people that go on my blog a lot.  And after arguing back and forth and back and forth,  because I'm actually kind of on Waz's side with this, I don't think it's really, you know,  I think it's a business decision and that's just the way it is.  But the guy made this final point, which I think has to be considered,  which is Google made such an arrogant statement about we shall do no evil  that that's why these guys are jumping all over him.  Because if you're going to make these kinds of comments, you know, like you're above it all,  you better, you know, stick to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're not doing it to us.  And what they're doing over there isn't considered evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said they will do no evil.  And according to the way we see things, censorship is evil by definition.  And so people are jumping all over Google on this.  That's why I think that there's a big controversy.  If Google had never made such a stink about that particular comment,  because nobody cares that Yahoo and MSN and these other guys are, you know,  going along with the program. It's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although actually, John, there's some reports that some of Google's primary competitors  are not going along with requests of the Chinese government.  So what's the story on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, is that true? Because the Yahoo guys, I would be shocked if they were going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft's going in, Yahoo's going in, IBM is going in,  and all of them are agreeing to the Chinese rules.  Here's my point of view on this. Google, it's, you know, I'm not saying evil, not evil.  The issue is, should Google, a search engine, be an editor of content?  He's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, somebody said that censorship is evil.  Censorship is bad. It is bad here in the United States.  But it is not necessarily bad somewhere else.  And we have to respect that concept, or we're going to say,  everyone who's not like us, we'll take them down. That's a religious view.  My religion is the way we live in this country.  Well, yeah, but doesn't that undermine the entire hacker ethos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we say freedom of information is bad,  is that not undermining the entire hacker ethos that we've been promoting?  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and we have a voice that we can present. We can't present a vote in China, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever seen your parents having sex? That was censored for a good cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not against censorship.  I think, though, that Google is not, should not be in the position of censoring.  Google is not an editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I am against censorship for anyone who wants to know.  Do you want to see your parents having...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read my sound sensors anyway.  How about you, Kevin Mitnick? You have an opinion on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just get around it. Remember a Safe Web and Triangle Boy?  I wonder if that's still working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. There are a number of technological ways for the Chinese citizens  to get around Google. I think this obviously isn't the way to prevent it permanently.  It just makes it a little more difficult for the non-sophisticated Chinese web user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but politically, I don't believe in censorship, but that's just my own personal view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand what you're saying, Steve. It's certainly not the US government's role  or any business's role to tell the Chinese government how to run their country.  But we don't have to do business with them if they're violating human rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I think it was wrong to go into Iraq and tell them that the way you run your country  isn't satisfactory to us, so we're going to enter.  It's wrong to do the same thing to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we could have completely removed Iraq from the Googlebot index,  there would be no problems in that country.  Removing Saddam Hussein from the Googlebot could have saved the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've been boycotting Cuba for 40 years because they're a communist country,  causing untold hardship in that nation.  So I agree that there are times when it probably isn't a good idea.  Maybe Google's making the best choice, the best, better, or two evils  by at least having some search engine capability in there.  In fact, if you look at what they're blocking out, it's not a kind of uniform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's how we make the positive steps.  We show the world how good it is not to have the censorship,  how it works here, and it's beautiful.  Gem in the sky of countries, and then they'll come our way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think you're right, John.  I think that this wouldn't be happening if Google hadn't kind of proclaimed  that they were somehow superior to everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's one more thing we need to observe here.  This is an awful lot of publicity for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the stock doing? Is it still going down?  Has anybody checked?  Actually, I haven't looked at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't talk about any declines in Google's stock price.  It violates our contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The stock price has more to do with what the U.S. government may do.  It really has nothing to do with Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would agree with that.  Or, and Google not living up to Wall Street's expectation,  that might be another...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's never going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Wall Street changing its mind.  So Dateline, who put this story in here?  NBC News Dateline did a story on MySpace  and scaring every parent in the world about MySpace  and how there are little kids in there and there's all sorts of sexy stuff.  Did anybody see this story?  Hey, I've been looking for this stuff on MySpace.  Alex, get out of MySpace.  Is he in MySpace?  Get out of MySpace, Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to know I'm a 13-year-old girl, okay?  Don't mess with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in the last month, according to Dateline,  authorities have charged at least three men with sexually assaulting teenagers  that they met at MySpace.com.  And just this week, police found a missing 15-year-old girl  who investigators say was sexually assaulted by a 26-year-old man  she met on MySpace.  So clearly, there are hazards,  but is MySpace any worse than the rest of the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with that.  You know what? You've got to look at it this way.  If you're going to do that to a 16-year-old girl,  you should be a 16-year-old boy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this any worse than LiveJournal, by the way?  What happened to LiveJournal as the nexus of this sort of thing?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LiveJournal was the bad guy for a while, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just find it...  I think there's a generational thing with MySpace,  because the LiveJournal people, I think, are slightly older.  I think there's... there'll probably be another one come along.  It's almost like these... it's like a club. It's weird.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing more to say on this one, I guess.  Robert, do you have any thoughts?  How's your site doing there, Leo, on MySpace?  I don't know. I haven't been there in a while.  Robert's the youngest guy here. Are you on MySpace?  Actually, he's not.  Patrick, you're younger than Robert?  Yeah. I just looked older.  You're the kid?  I'm the kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Who would have thought that?  Patrick just looks older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he's had a hard life.  It's been a hard 35 years.  I don't know.  Do you guys know... I mean, have you guys actually spent time on MySpace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As little as possible.  It's really designed for younger minds and eyes, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it wasn't designed for younger minds.  It's been taken over by younger minds.  It was designed to promote indie bands.  And it kind of got adopted by high schoolers in an insane way,  because it's like the best way ever to meet people and hook up with them.  That's fundamentally what it's a tool for.  And there's an amazing number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you think about it, if you're a predator, you're going to go where the kids are.  So it's not MySpace's fault.  It's any successful site that draws young people is going to draw the predators, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the mall.  Like the mall.  And you're asking Alex for opinions on this, sexual predators in MySpace?  Alex Fielding?  How old are you, Alex?  You know, silence of the lambs when he goes up to the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told you, I am a 13-year-old girl, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With just a very deep voice. A little hormonal issue, that's all.  Do we have enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how many people are on MySpace?  How many people are on MySpace? Does anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somewhere between 5 and 15 million.  It's a huge number.  Wow.  Irony is...  It was f***ing up at Duke's Court of Props.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Rupert Murdoch owns it.  F***ing $1 on him.  That's the amazing thing.  Speaking of dropping money, did you see the rumor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a 13-year-old girl also.  Rupert Murdoch?  Yes. Should see him with pigtails.  You know, do you think Rupert Murdoch has a MySpace profile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got to find out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He really does. He and Sergey Bremen have been using this for years.  To hang out? Together?  Of course. Well, to hook up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As you wanted to find it.  I'm doing a search right now. I've got to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch's MySpace page.  Let's see, real quickly.  Rupert, MyProfile. Oh yeah, yeah, he's in here.  He says he's a 75-year-old man, though. I don't know.  Are you lying?  It says, about me, I just bought MySpace.  Soon I will own the rest of the Internet.  I aspire to become the most powerful man in the world.  Well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the many pages on MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that ironic that the new owner of MySpace has a faux MySpace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch's interests.  General global domination and the conjunction of church and state.  Censorship of private or private property.  Censorship of private or liberal interest groups.  Censorship of MySpace pages that do not agree with my views.  Favorite quote. These dictatorships are fun as long as I'm in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put even money on the fact that Murdoch has never been on MySpace and can't use a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guarantee you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's not forget who the largest private owner in news corps is outside of the United States, right?  Whatever happened to Prince Albuwik until now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is he really a big partner in news corps?  Interesting.  It's all a conspiracy.  Interesting. By the way, Rupert Murdoch's sign is Virgo.  Just in case you're interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great. I'm in good company.  One less thing to keep me awake tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, were you following the...I was following with great interest the rumors flying around the blogosphere  that Kevin Rose, our good friend and erstwhile twit,  was going to sell Dig to Yahoo for $30 million this week.  Kevin got online and denied the whole thing, but I was very disappointed.  At any point, did any of you feel any jealousy at any point when you heard that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Not at all.  I could have never felt any jealousy, but I'll tell you this. He's buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. Next time he's buying.  Well, we'll see if that actually happens.  But he claims we're not even talking to Yahoo, which I don't know.  I tried to get Kevin on the show today, but he's not even talking to us.  So, who knows?  So, what else is...there aren't a lot of big stories this week.  Anybody else have any issues? Did you see the DS life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did everybody...wait a minute. Did everybody miss Mickey Mouse changing his last name to Jobs this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or was that just me that saw that in the news?  Oh, I'm sorry. That was a big story.  Steve Jobs is now the biggest stockholder, the biggest shareholder in Disney.  He doubled his personal fortune with $3.7 billion when Disney bought Pixar Corporation.  So, the first thing that happens is John Lasseter gets to say there's not going to be a Toy Story 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. That's right. Now there's going to be Toy Story 2.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting that there was an ongoing conflict beforehand, kind of like Jobs decided and went out on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did anybody hear that? Steve was standing five feet away from the microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I did hear that. So, what's the inside story on that was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know the inside of the story.  I know it's the same as you.  Tell them. Tell them, Steve.  I can't. It wouldn't be ethical.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, there is a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently, we now know there's a story. There's a deeper story here.  What I didn't know is, well, didn't Pixar say they were going to cut the cord with Disney and stop making movies for Disney?  Maybe that's what you're referring to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their contract was up, so they were going to have to find distribution.  Disney was going to have to find somebody other than people who write about llamas to write movies that don't suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I read, though, was that Disney had a ton of people working for Toy Story 3 already, like 100 people working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even though John Lasseter didn't want to do Toy Story 3, he thought it would cheapen the franchise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if that was in the past, but you sure got the feeling that Pixar didn't want to do any more Toy Stories 3 and 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yet, it's Disney buying Pixar. It just shows you the balance of power is not completely clear.  Even though Disney buys Pixar, you'd think that means that Disney would get to tell Pixar, yes, you are doing Toy Story 3.  In fact, it's quite the opposite. Of course, Steve Jobs is now on the board and is the largest shareholder of Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't look at it in terms of business here, business now. What did Disney start with? Animated cartoons.  Maybe they're trying to go back a little bit and find their roots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to see Steve Jobs take over Disney and run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he might well. You think he will start to exert influence over the Disney empire?  If he wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's got to be a nightmarish bureaucracy to try to turn in any direction now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That'd be fun to watch.  I'm not saying it would be fun to watch, but I've got another story that we should probably discuss.  Sure.  Probably more important than anything we've discussed so far.  Good, I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The writer that ran aground at Ensenada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Old booth babes at E3 Expo.  Old booth babes?  No booth babes. The woman running or one of the women there decided to ban all the girls that are usually at E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, unless this has gone a step farther, they've just decided they want them to actually have a moniker of clothing on this year.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the last trade show that really did feature scantily clad women prominently in the booths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need to spend more time in the darker corners of CES and at some of the automotive and surfing trade shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should say the last tech trade show.  I thought CES was pretty tame.  Oh, I would say it was boring.  Well, I wasn't there.  So boring I stayed home.  Neither you nor I saw any quote.  I hate even saying the phrase booth babes.  Which is it? They're going to have no women?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What Patrick says is true, but in fact this is going to really kill things because they're going to have a $5,000 fine on the spot for anyone if it's determined to be semi clad.  Wow.  And who's going to make this determination? It's obviously some stiff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to have some nun with a ruler measuring the length of the skirt above the knee.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys, you guys got to relax.  You guys need to go to New York City and you need to go to a nice orthodox temple on Saturday.  Because what you'll find out is you can have an ankle like skirt that will leave nothing to the imagination and will just terrify people and it'll completely follow.  You know, it's not just about the leg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is this is Patrick and I'm trying to figure out where he goes to the god figure what this is coming from.  Patrick is what is Jewish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick has a life that goes well beyond anything you or I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing I know what I'm saying is it's not you know.  Great. So, OK, they're going to get thongs off the floor.  They're going to get bathing suits off the floor.  You know, it's not like, you know, people aren't going to be wearing hot pants or short skirts or schoolgirl outfits or any of the other crap that makes, you know, game editors and vendors and buyers go berserk.  I haven't been to E3 since.  Go berserk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't been to E3 since it started, but I have heard and maybe you guys can confirm this.  Some some really nasty stories about stuff that goes on behind closed doors at E3 at hospitality suites at E3.  It sounds like it was a very out of control conference.  Is that true or is that just, you know, hype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are we talking about this instead of someplace that doesn't let you bring cameras or cell phones into a concert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's that?  Everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's more of a concern to us, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as far as I know, the rules that they're going to be enforcing are the same rules they've had for a few years, but they just simply they weren't enforcing them.  They're kind of letting it all slide by.  But the fine, though, is pretty crazy.  And well, it'll just be interesting to see if anybody actually gets nailed for it this year around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Waz, can you bring a camera into the concerts at Shoreline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't use it?  I mean, you see so many people holding up cell phones now taking movies of shows.  So what? Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't that promote the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would they not?  Of course it does. Of course it does.  What I'm saying is, you know, you're talking about people restricting, you know, certain kinds of of nude behavior or something somewhere.  And we should be talking about where we can't aren't allowed to use certain of our devices that would really help us.  Something that really matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Censorship in America is what it wants.  Something that really matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, all right.  Legal censorship.  I'm up for that.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  So what are you guys drinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Woo.  Starbucks apple cider.  Oh, the hot apple cider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Correct.  All right. And Kevin, what are you having there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't have an opportunity to go get a latte yet, but I will in a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. And Alex, are you having anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I just...  Gee, Leo, is this what the show has come to?  I've been to the Organic Chai with six pumps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think people are interested in what big celebrities like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're having a glass of 82 Mouton for anyone wanting to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody cares about you.  I just want to know what the celebrities are drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talking about celebrities, we should get Amber on.  Looks like there's a spot over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Let me see if I can get Amber in here.  I think Patrick has dropped off, so we'll call Amber back in.  So Amber, you're there?  I'm here.  So I don't know, Waz, if you know Amber MacArthur.  She's my co-host up in Canada on Call for Help.  Steve Wozniak, also with Steve in Las Vegas.  Kevin Mitnick, old friend of the Screen Savers.  And Alex... I don't even know Alex's last name.  Oh, thank God.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fielding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fielding.  Too late. You're anonymity.  I'll give you the scoop later. Oh, Jesus.  Alex Fielding. All right. Thank you, Kevin.  And they're all hanging out at the Starbucks.  Amber is up in Toronto, and of course, John C. Dvorak and Robert Heron.  So that's everybody in here.  Have you guys picked up Adventures of Superman issue 648 yet?  The March issue?  Is that where Christopher Reed dies in the strip club?  No, not that one.  It's horrible.  On the page?  Horrible.  It's devastating, isn't it?  I actually don't have page numbers on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a little dollar bill in his mouth, too. It was just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But whoever works at DC Comics doing the illustration of this must be a podcast fan,  because there's a scene where three hoods are looting a television store, old-styled CRT TVs,  and they're wearing a Command-N t-shirt, a Hack 5 hat, and a Twit hoodie.  So, now the good news is even though these guys are looters,  Superman comes along and he says all people really need to know is that they are valued.  Sometimes they just need a little direction, and he turns them to the good side,  and they end up helping people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like us. We were hoods.  So isn't that great? So Twit and Command-N and Hack 5 have now made it to the mainstream.  I'd like a Twit hoodie.  You don't have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think I gave one to my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright, I'll get you another one. Amber has a whole bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's cool about the little one my daughter wears is that when she walks around it says,  WIT. She has to actually lift her arm before it says Twit.  Leo, there's a couple boxes full up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, poor Amber's stuck with a bunch of Twit hoodies.  That's alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Dom, we'll make sure that we send you one now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, thank you.  Hey, Leo.  Yes, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, remember when I was on the screensavers and I demonstrated the color ID spoofing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that hack. You called my phone from the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, well check this out. A dear friend of mine, she called me from Vegas.  She was visiting from Miami yesterday, and the number that was calling me was my own cell phone number.  So of course I pick up the phone. I said, hey, very funny. Thanks for spoofing my number.  It sounded like this guy with a raspy voice. I basically hung up on the guy.  And then she called back 30 seconds later and said, hey, that was me.  And apparently there's this new service that not only lets you spoof color ID,  but lets you change your voice to a woman or to a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God, do you know the URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's spoofcard.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spoofcard.com.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it lets you change your voice, which is kind of funny.  I thought that might be interesting to you because spoofing color ID is cool,  but actually adding voice changes, you can imagine.  I'm sure that the master pranksterism sitting next to me, Steve Wozniak,  could figure some good pranks to pull with that.  We're using that on MySpace later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could sound like a little girl, Alex.  It says spoofcard, the next generation.  Yeah, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, it's going on to dvorak.org slash blog immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next generation of phone spoofing.  It offers the ability to change what someone sees on the caller ID.  But you have to pay for this, don't you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like you could buy a calling card.  It looks like 10, 20, probably 40 bucks.  But what was cool is I never saw a service that had a voice changer as well.  So it's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, is this a hole, a security hole in the way the cell system works?  I mean, I'm surprised that now that it's so well known,  in fact there are services that allow you to do changes, caller ID,  that somebody hasn't fixed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a feature.  Yes, it's exactly. It's a feature.  It's like if you're Microsoft and whenever an employee makes an outgoing call from the company,  you want the main telephone number to appear, not their extension,  or their telephone number so you can program your CPN,  the calling party number into your switch.  So now with the asterisk and voiceover IP,  you can basically set your own number by writing a script.  So you can touch tone in the number you're calling,  the number you're calling from, and it will spoof it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you using asterisks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like corruption. This is the problem with the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you can be Bill Gates and sound like a little girl using the new system.  And still look like you're calling from Microsoft.  Hey, but what's scary is with some of the cellular companies like T-Mobile,  if you spoof a target's number to the voicemail,  to the voicemail access number, and they use the default setting,  you can't go right into the voicemail without a password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, somebody that uses the spoofing technologies in the New York Times.  The New York Times, if you get a call from the New York offices,  it comes in as 11111111.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember the days when Markov used to check Kevin's voicemail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't bring that guy into this.  We don't want to get into a fight.  So the reason I understand that they do that is because when they're calling  from confidential sources,  they don't want it necessarily tracked back to the New York Times by their employer.  It's pretty obvious. It's 111111111111.  Who else would it be, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, when I was in Moscow in February, whenever you get a call from the US,  the caller ID was changed to all ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, the New York Times was basically the only people who were called Moscow.  So they just figured what the hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make it all be.  It happens.  You're number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, 11111111 was used to be a number that you could enter in as the serial number.  It was a back door to Microsoft's Windows.  It was a serial number you could enter in, and it would work on many copies of Windows.  Of course, they fixed that.  Yeah, these are all zeros, too. That would work.  Their authentication fixed that, but that was a well-known feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, they wouldn't let me use my PowerBook on the plane flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a Windows seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we have any more news stories?  We're going to be listening to these jokes all day.  Leo, Leo and Patrick, I got a new laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And John, I got more new lasers.  I got my first yellow laser, and it's gorgeous.  Wow, yellow.  Yes, it's sort of a yellow, slightly orangish, but it's just a beautiful color.  I got more powerful green ones, and I was doing this trick the other night where I shine a green one in one ear,  and a friend shines a blue one up on the ceiling after I've explained why it changes color.  And my ears started feeling like there was a candle on the table.  And I looked down, and there's no candle. It's just getting warmer.  We got one green that uses C cells, and it actually smoked some bread into toast the other night at the Outback.  No, no, you start matches with it and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's pretty hot.  Hey, was? Was?  Yeah, it was on the waiter's table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the element that's used to make yellow green or that yellowish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That one I do not know, but they're fairly expensive, like in the neighborhood of $400 to $500.  And they have some blue lasers. I got my first blue laser.  I had some blue ones for free that were made for me, and they kind of come out purple.  These come out pure blue, and I guess the materials are made by Sony.  And the 10-milliwatt one I got cost, you're going to die, $1,500.  They sell it 20-milliwatt for $2,500, 30-milliwatts for $3,000, and 40-milliwatts for $3,500 for one laser pointer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we could go to the casinos and bet on black. Maybe we could make some extra money to buy some more lasers.  Yeah, I'm going to make my new plan is to make a black laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A black laser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to sell it. Yeah, I'm going to sell it with, if I can get a heat sink to help cool it, I can get more power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the speed of dark is much faster than the speed of light.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody knows that.  I get it.  Are you let into the casinos at all, Kevin Mitnick, or do they see you coming and make you go the other way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm allowed in. I'm not a threat to the casinos.  They make him take his shoes off, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think Kevin knows any casino games. I think I've been in there with him, and he doesn't know what he's doing anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. I can't play such complicated games like roulette or blackjack.  Well, it didn't confuse me with the Texas Hold'em where he yelled 21.  But I'm really good at the computer games like video poker.  Those ones, oh my God. I couldn't believe it. You got it down to just right. Ten more tries to jackpot. I couldn't believe it.  Real flush. Boom. He called it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did he really? That's actually a famous hack, isn't it? They found out they were using a pseudo random number generator in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Word. This was today. I cannot confirm or deny you.  They found out one of the guys who designed it knew his system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's a pseudo random number generator, so it repeats after a certain number. So once you start seeing the repeats, then you know what's coming up.  But you would have to know... you'd have to know it pretty well or spend a long time watching it.  I thought they'd fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they did. They now use three pseudo random number generators.  It's a lot harder to get it.  It's a lot harder, so the time to derive the pattern, it's not feasible.  Kevin was up all night.  That's my new job, Leo, playing video poker.  A lot of kids from MIT around him, too. I don't know what that was about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, those guys, is that group still around the MIT card counting group? Would they still do that?  Bringing Down the House.  Bringing Down the House. That wonderful book, Bringing Down the House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they have a second book out. I think I saw it in an airport bookstore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they still do that, or is that all done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably. There's a detective agency out here called Griffins. Their photos are probably all in their books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it would have to be somebody new, obviously, but that's what they were doing. They were recruiting new kids.  They could train them.  Yeah, they were training them. That's exactly what... great book. If you've never read it, Bringing Down the House, they talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they only go to Indian casinos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of the new shoes on blackjack tables, they never shuffle the cards. It's just a shoe that automatically shuffles the cards so you can never really keep an accurate count.  An endless shoe?  An endless shoe in some of the casinos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That seems like that's cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like Bottomless Drinks.  Same concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not at E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Oh, please.  No Bottomless anything.  That's right.  You gotta go over to Crazy Horse for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I have this great watch that gets me caught going through airport security every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That looks like a bomb.  It's like the biggest watch you've ever saw. It's got a couple of Nixie tubes, vacuum tubes in it, along with a battery through a clear see-through top.  The watch has tubes?  Yes, and if you turn it to the right angle, which I can program, I programmed it for 45 degrees, it displays the time. Hours, then minutes, then seconds.  Wow.  Oh, now Kevin wants to see it.  Are you bringing this?  And I'll tell you, they don't know what it is and sometimes they tell me, you shouldn't bring this through airports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I can't down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do have hundreds of seconds on this big round display that's clear and a thing inside with a couple of big batteries and who knows what circuitry.  It starts counting seconds, you know, 45, 46.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can find this at al-kinda.com.  Wait a second, wait a second. About a year ago, Steve was showing me that he can carry knives on aircraft that a metal detector wouldn't detect. What were those, those plastics?  Ceramic knives?  Ceramic, yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used them on history, including pictures, a lot of stories about doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, Cory Doctorow and the EFF printed up the Bill of Rights on a piece of metal and the whole idea was you're supposed to carry it through the metal detectors and when they stop you say, oh yeah, it's the Bill of Rights, I guess that's a problem here, isn't it?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess if you want to get harassed by T.S.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do it for humor, not serious.  Yeah, I don't want to do it that seriously.  I used to get on board and complain about their knives and I hoped that the meat was tender and then I'd pull out my nice ceramic knife with a six inch long blade and the other passengers got more upset and the sorties didn't know what to do. They'd say, whoa, a plastic knife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It didn't help that you were wearing a turban.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, please. You don't do that anymore, right, Steve? I mean, that really, nowadays I think they're very sensitive about that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't done that since 9-11 yet because it would not...  Yeah, it doesn't go over well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't want to hear about you getting arrested or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They aren't worried about weapons anymore though.  For example, they let me take on a big screwdriver with an eight inch blade, a big screwdriver, let me take it right on Boston said, that's fine.  They let me take on two huge batteries the size of shoeboxes that they've never gone through X-ray or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they've changed the rules and the flight attendants were actually very upset about the fact that the rules were changed and that some of these devices, things like screwdrivers are now illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're very about explosives because I think they've protected the pilots from access well enough with steel doors.  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why the flight attendants are upset because they're basically the sacrificial lambs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but every time I fly, like you fly internationally, they give you real silverware, a fork, a real butter knife and a spoon.  Internationally.  Butter knives are allowed in civilized countries.  Internationally, not in the US. In the US you fly first class, you get a plastic knife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also international flights are allowed to, you're allowed to take lithium segway batteries, not domestic flights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, a friend, one of the researchers who works on Call for Help had a bunch of equipment that he was flying to, I think he was flying to CES and he got, he thought he was on Delta, but a Delta is a partner with El Al.  And it turned out it was an El Al flight.  And that must have been fun.  Quite different. The rules are quite different.  They took all of his battery packs, all of his powers and took them.  They said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four hours. You're supposed to get there four hours before departure when you're flying El Al.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just took them and they said, sorry, you cannot take that on the plane, we'll ship it to you.  And of course he never got them back. They're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was flying from where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was flying, I think from Toronto to Vegas.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From Baghdad to Tel Aviv.  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a bad flight.  Do you remember what flight that was, Sean, was on, Amber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, did he fly to Vegas or maybe to LAX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it was LAX, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he flew to LAX.  I can see the extra security required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there is a rule that if you have, you can carry lithium batteries on cell phones and computers,  but if you have a package of 24 or more, they could not ship on any flight in any capacity that people are on the plane.  Because you can make a bomb out of them.  No, it's the United States rule.  No, the extinguisher systems in cargo can't put out that size fire.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if they're short out...  It's really a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They kind of came up with a number, 24 cells in a package,  but at least they did some thinking about there's a number that you've got to cut it off at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's completely reasonable.  Somebody who flies a lot.  So, Wise, do you have a MacBook Pro yet or are you waiting in line like the rest of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for it to be delivered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to get a 17-inch MacBook Pro.  When are those coming out?  Yeah, I want that too.  Give me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I'm actually waiting for is this...  I hope, and of course the big rumor that's been circulating, probably worthless,  is that next will be the iBook, the 13-inch iBook with the Yona single core Intel chip.  But I'm looking for, and I hope Apple does this, a very thin, lightweight, you know, a Sony 505 style notebook.  Just a really thin one.  I think that would compete very well.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just bought one of the Dell Inspiron lightweight laptops because I'm tired of dealing with my 17-inch notebook on the plane.  Exactly. Yeah, I'm a fan of the little ones, especially for travel.  By the way, you should always turn off your wireless interface when you're flying.  Why?  Because, you know, well, what happens, how Windows works, is when your interface is on,  what Windows does, it goes through your active...  well, what networks it sees.  And then it compares them to your preferred networks list.  If it doesn't find it, then what happens is it looks for any ad hoc networks.  And if you ever had a preferred network as ad hoc, you become that ad hoc network.  So all you have to do is set the link layer IP address.  It's called automatic IP.  It's in the 169.254.x.x.  And what you could do is then you could trick anyone on the airplane that has a wireless card into associating with your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you could log into their system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're on your network, so now you could use the normal hacking tools to enumerate information and compromise their machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very interesting. So just by leaving on your airport or your Wi-Fi card, you actually could be opening yourself up to get hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine the fun you could have with playing certain types of MP3s through their computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you shared iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I do. Whenever I get on a plane, whenever I get on a plane, well, not whenever, but a lot of times I just turn on my Wi-Fi sharing, which is I shouldn't because it's a transmitter.  And I set up a network and I usually name it United Free Wi-Fi.  Just look around me to see if anyone spots it. I haven't succeeded yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should name it like, you know, Cockpit Control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll leave it on United, put a phone call to the Internet and share it through the plane with Wi-Fi just to see if somebody, you know, says, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put a little remote control program up and let them fly the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to switch microphones now to my.  I have the wrong one on. Do you still hear me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's much better, in fact. Which mic is this now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, Kevin, though.  Can you hear me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds great. What are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The eyesight camera has its own built-in mic. It's better quality.  And I forgot to switch to it this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's much better quality than the laptop was.  You know, I just got Apple just sent me this new Snowball Latvian Snowball mic by Blue.  And I'm looking forward to trying. That's a USB mic.  There's a lot of USB mics out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when I travel internationally, because I got nailed with my cell phone when I was in Moscow, I didn't realize it was $4.99 a minute to Rome.  And I got hit with a huge bill.  So now you Skype overseas for this contact to the US.  No, I was in it. I was in Moscow. That's Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had his cell phone set to Roman.  I figured. Sorry.  Any other any other any other big hacks or security issues, Kevin, that are on that are going on right now?  People ought to know about any anything going on. That's a I like that airport one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the white thought is really interesting because it's where people think about, oh, we got to protect our access points.  You know, if you're running a business, but now the clients could be hacked by tricking the client to associating with you.  And you heard about that guy that just got busted for for running a selling a botnet service to do distributed denial service attacks and sending spam in L.A.  Do you hear about that case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he was using ad hoc networks to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. What he was doing is he was setting up botnets, right?  He was, you know, sending a worm or a virus or whatever, right?  Compromising, you know, an army of machines, right?  And then selling a service to use those army of machines to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was renting out other people's machines, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. So distributed spam, distributed denial service attacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'll tell you what, if I in airports, Alex really busted a guy in San Jose one night.  He showed me on the screen he had this program that sniffs the air and prints any pictures that are going by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here comes a picture of women's pants.  So I go downstairs to a vending machine at one point and I look back on a guy's computer and he's looking at one of those pairs of pants.  It was a guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was shopping for his wife.  Now, come on, there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, any of you guys use BlackBerrys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I use a Nokia 9300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I live on a BlackBerry Road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you, are you, BlackBerrys?  Are you worried about losing your BlackBerry service, Was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I live on a BlackBerry Road. That's the name of the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's the name of your road. Oh, geez. All right.  Nobody uses it, Leo.  How do you like that 9300? That's the smartphone that opens up and it's got a full keyboard or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very cool, except I don't like GPRS.  Sorry, GPRS. I guess Verizon has the fastest service on EVDO.  Yeah.  But in Europe it works great because then I could get a prepaid SIM card and use their UMTS service.  But Nokia is releasing this quarter a 9300i, which now with the same device, with the same size, you could, you know, you have 802.11 built in.  So that's kind of cool.  I'm going to buy that as soon as it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was, you think the line at the hotel is shortened now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm hoping so. I have a six o'clock dinner, so I'll either check in before the dinner or after the dinner, one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You would think don't they have a VIP line for you or something that you just jump right in?  Yeah, you know, you got to get connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell them you're tech support and wear an Apple shirt. Once in a while that's happened.  I hope I have a room. That's all I'm hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, you got to set up a was with your buddy Steve Wynn. You get him in a decent room here. Get him some treatment.  Where's he staying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Hard Rock Casino.  The Hard Rock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't have a choice where I'm staying. I'm staying at Caesar's Palace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because it's a nice place.  Mirrors on the ceiling.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have been to Los Angeles so many times in my life that I prefer to go to just different places.  Like I've burned out of it and I'll go to the quiet little town 40 minutes down the road, Priam, where it's a little casual.  Or I'll go off the strip to the Alexis Park Resort, which isn't a casino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not going to Pahrump, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course I can always say I have friends to stay with here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pahrump, of course, is where Art Bell and his trailer are. Unless they've moved, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hate to mistakenly walk into Art Bell's trailer looking for something else in Pahrump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pahrump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Pahrump, yeah.  That's probably the only setting in the stick. We can rent an automatic weapon, go to a brothel and buy fireworks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What fun, huh?  We were here and bought a ton of great fireworks.  No wonder Art Bell was here.  We went through the border in three different places in three different cars going back to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was horrible. That was great, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever done the shooting ranges there, the automatic weapons of the shooting ranges?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope.  I kind of can't do that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right. They kind of discourage that, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to my blog, I've got a link to that shooting range, that thing they do every year in Oklahoma where people bring all the machine guns and bombs and grenade throwers. It's quite an interesting video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's your problem, Kevin? Do they have a payphone there or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, with a touchtone. And I can whistle. As long as I can whistle, you know there's a serious problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, you blogged an interesting story that I don't know what to make of.  An Australian security company says that OS X, because it has all this old Unix stuff in it, is actually more vulnerable than Windows or Linux.  They haven't done the proper job in securing these old programs. Linux, they're secure, but not on OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. But that's been talked about for a number of years.  I mean, the fact is that Apple never gets a tower, that OS X never gets attacked, so they never go and say, oh my God, look what happened.  I mean, Microsoft is getting pretty robust, more or less, because they're always being attacked.  And I think if the OS X ever became popular, it would be under attack and it would probably start falling apart quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's been identified vulnerabilities in OS X that have been critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely, although Apple seems to patch them as soon as they're identified. I'm wondering what this guy is talking about.  Unless they call it a feature.  Right. The guy is Neil Archibald. He's with SureSec.  And he says the problem is it's not so much in the well-known flaws that are getting patched,  but in a lot of this older stuff that is just sitting on OS X and nobody's paying any attention to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what's it under the hood? It's really free BSD, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, yeah. And there's a lot of free BSD in there.  So on the other hand, it's easy to say that he doesn't talk very much about any specifics.  In fact, the one thing he mentions was patched by Apple as soon as it was discovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of systems getting hacked, I checked my domain registrar the last couple of days, bulkregister.com.  They got a message that comes up saying, due to unscheduled maintenance, we're shut down.  Unscheduled maintenance?  Yeah, to return some database. And it mentions database restoration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a euphemism for a crash, right? Unscheduled maintenance?  Well, or something. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just trying to hijack was.org like they did sex.com or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. Well, I'm going to let you guys in Vegas go. I appreciate your joining us.  It's great to have Kevin. You know, it's funny, I've been wanting to get Kevin on the show for a long time.  Next time you're in town, please come by, Kevin, and join us in the studio.  Where are you?  We're in San Francisco. Actually, we do it in Marin County in San Francisco,  but you can always join us via Skype too, and it's great to have you on.  Great to talk to you again, Leo.  Where are you heading out to next? Are you going to be home for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to Tel Aviv on the 15th to speak at IDC,  and then I have to come back here to speak at the University in Utah,  then I go to South Africa.  Wow.  And then in June, actually, Woz and I are keynoting Interop in Moscow.  In Moscow.  So we're doing it actually together. Yeah.  That'll be fun.  So we get to go to Moscow together, Steve. How about that?  Red Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to send a camera crew along on that one. That should be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I'm going to Hayward next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what, Kevin, let's figure out a time,  and I'd love to get you on Twitter on a regular basis.  And of course, Woz, I'm going to see you shipboard in about five days.  We're going on the Mach Mania 4 down to Mexico.  That is right.  That's going to be a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is right. Yep. I get home from my road show for like one night,  and then I'm off to the gig cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bring your yellow lasers, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes, I will. Absolutely.  Good.  When you see my yellow, my purple, my blue, my red, and my green all going at once,  it's a beautiful sight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the Jamaican flag, I think.  All right, guys. It's great to talk to you. Nice to meet you, Alex.  Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate it.  Nice to meet you, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Nitro, Zack, and Snaggy send their love.  They have nothing but great things to say about you.  I adore them. So you know them, huh?  Yeah, they're wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good people. The joy of tech.  And actually, I think we've all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they were sitting right next to me the last time I was on Twitter,  and I didn't think to bring them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we should have had them in.  And you know, it's funny, of course, that they're the ones who did  the very famous Kevin Mitnick cartoon,  Kevin Mitnick's first day back on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I remember that Leo like it was yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was on the screensavers. Waz was there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a long time waiting to get back on the Internet.  Let me remind you, these two people actually came down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and taught in my class once back when I did Class District.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they're great. They're really fun, yeah.  Well, it's nice to meet you all. Have a great day,  and I hope you can get into your hotel, Waz.  Thanks, Leo. Thanks, Leo.  We'll make a call down to Steve Wynn.  Maybe we can get him to let them in.  Can you believe Waz has to sit out at a Starbucks  because their line is too long at the Caesars Palace?  Seems like there should be something we could do about that, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you have Vegas Connections?  That's a good place. You know, Caesars is a great place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever stayed there, Robert? I know you're a Vegas fanatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not at Caesars, no. I did have a chance to go into the new Wynn Casino, though.  How is that? Is that nice?  It's the newest thing there. It is beautiful.  And they have what is it, like a 200-foot waterfall right out front?  Always eye-catching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A 200-foot, you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like a 150-200-foot high waterfall right out in front.  That's really cool.  It's a man-made mountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amber, I'm sorry we didn't get you in at the beginning,  but we're glad we could have you join us.  Any stories that were on your mind?  We talked about the Google story.  There wasn't a lot of news this week, I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just added one a while ago about the SMS messaging world records match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about that. I was wondering who added that.  So there's a world record for SMS messengers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. I couldn't believe it either.  Yeah, I just read somewhere today that there was a contest held in Singapore  and the record holder walked away with $10,000 US  and I guess they typed in 26 words into a cell phone's text message in 43 seconds.  26 words, 43 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not exactly world-beating typing speed, but it sounds pretty numbing  if you're using, they're not using T9 or anything either.  That's letter by letter, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's triple. I just can't believe that such a contest even exists to tell you the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you use SMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. I use it all the time. I find I use it more than probably talking on the phone.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  How about you, Robert? Do you ever use it?  I receive a lot of SMS from other people, but personally I rarely use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too hard for me to type anything.  That too. I'm wondering, wouldn't like a Morse code set up be faster than doing the T9 text input anyway?  Yeah, if you knew Morse code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. Of course.  That might be a problem for some people.  Who's going to learn Morse code?  Who's going to learn Morse code? Do your kids, John, use SMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think Americans in general use SMS as much as Europeans and Japanese.  And Canadians, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at least a few.  At least Amber. A lot of your friends in Canada use SMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I went out with some friends for dinner last night and everybody had their phones  and they were all sending SMS messages and just saying, we'll meet you here at this time,  this is where we are, we're on our way, and no one's talking on the phones.  It's a polite way to be able to talk to people without actually talking on your cell phone.  It tends to be really popular here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not interesting. I don't know.  I've heard people complain that they can't figure out how to use it.  Well, yeah, exactly.  On some phones it's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it's Americans just don't get it. I don't understand it because it is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no common interface. I mean, one phone does it one way,  another one's buried in a menu someplace. These phones that we use suck.  Maybe that's it.  I agree with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of the problem, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a terrible fall.  Although they have the same phones in Canada pretty much. I don't think it's any different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the longest time, every SMS message I was receiving didn't have the person's name attached to it.  So I'd kind of have to read the message and see what it was.  And then I finally contacted the phone company and they were saying,  oh, you have to enable another service so you can actually see who it is that's sending you these messages.  I'm like, that's brilliant, guys. That's an absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this kind of enabling that is one of the problems we have in this country generally.  Trying to use these phones, these GSM phones that supposedly work overseas,  and you go over there, you can't make a call because something has some trigger,  some mechanism has to be turned on over here in advance and nobody knows about it in advance.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting. One thing I do find that's different here just from my past travels to the US is that  I find in Canada, at least in Toronto, that people are less likely to be in restaurants talking on their cell phones.  So that's where SMS kind of comes into play a lot of times.  Whereas when I go to San Francisco or other cities, I find it's kind of more common for people to just be in restaurants  and talking on the phones. And it's not a big deal. It's just kind of part of your life.  But here it seems that you don't see it as much. But you see people, the Canadians, kind of hiding under the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Canadians are much more polite, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, at least among my friends, it's considered rude to be sitting at the table talking.  Oh, it's awful. It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I agree that I think people, you see it, you go to a restaurant, people are doing it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's worse is the guy with the obnoxious ring and he takes five or six calls during dinner time. It's unbelievable.  Ringtones have got to die. Terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The worst thing is when you're sitting on the plane and you're about to take off and someone's still got to squeeze that last second on their cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Inevitably, I'm sitting next to the guy. I mean, I couldn't care. You listen to their business. It's always a sales.  Some guy's doing sales. We're going to get them. Oh, it's just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you, those in-ear headphones I bought are the best thing for flying. It just drowns it all right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Silence. Canadians make you take your headphones off during takeoff and landing. So you have to hear these guys.  That drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, there's no reason to do that because they end up playing the announcements through the headphones anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you can keep those on. It's the ones hooked up to your iPod.  Yeah. If you try to hide them under your jacket, they still come up and find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? You've tried to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've tried to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. They definitely will find them. They'll come up to you and say,  can you please take them from around your neck and set them down in your lap or put them away?  Oh, they're mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please.  They're very strict about it.  That's a little bizarre.  Well, that's so that if they say, the plane's going downward, ditching, jump, you'll hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I typically plug into the armrest.  All the time you'll be bopping out to some music and not really notice them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. You look up, there's no one on the plane. Where'd they all go?  Such a good song.  And why are we pointed down?  All right. Well, I think we're going to call it a wrap on this one because I'm going to have to do some cleaning up.  It was a little bit noisy in Vegas, but it was just an amazing thing that not only did we get Woz at a Starbucks, but who wanders by but Kevin Mitnick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does anybody but me find that a little weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's very weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the strangest thing ever.  And it's the this must be the weirdest episode of Twitter ever.  We're going to do this again via Skype for the next couple of weeks.  And then we're going to do a live one at the Apple Store.  We'll give you the details on that.  And we have our new studio in Cordo Madero, which is a really nice place to do video.  It's a full TV studio at Golden Gate Studios there.  That's a really nice place.  We thank the folks at America Online.  I think we've you know, every time I've mentioned this, it's always been at the end of the podcast.  But I think we have licked this Akamai issue.  America Online switched to Akamai servers a couple of weeks ago and we were having trouble with truncated podcasts.  But I think we figured out what's going on.  I'm hoping now you'll get this entire podcast.  What's going on?  For some, well, for some reason, I think I'm not sure exactly the details.  I think I figured out how to get around it.  Some of the Akamai, you know how Akamai works.  It's a bunch of servers that keep copies of the content.  So when you try to download our podcast, you're not really getting it from AOL anymore,  which is a good thing because we've been drawing a terabyte a day from AOL.  You're actually getting it from a local server, an Akamai server.  So it's faster and the burden is spread out over hundreds of servers.  It seems that a couple of the Akamai servers had partial copies of the podcast, not the full copy.  So I got about 500 or 600 people complaining.  Now, this is out of a quarter of a million, but about 500 or 600 people complaining that they only got 10 minutes of the podcast.  And it happened not only to this podcast, but security now.  What I did this week, and I don't know if it's the Akamai engineers fixing something or this,  but what I did this week is I uploaded it ahead of time and waited before I posted the announcement about it,  about an hour or two just to allow it to percolate out through the Akamai network.  And that seems to have solved that problem.  So we'll do that from now on.  I want everybody to go to the website, press the buttons, support Twit with your donations,  because this is all pie in the sky.  What we really count on is the support of our listeners.  And you guys have been generous, but we still have lots of expenses, including big bandwidth bills.  So that's it. Thanks, everybody. I really appreciate you being here.
