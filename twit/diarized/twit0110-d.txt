Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you laughing at? He's like a laughing maniac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's happy. He doesn't have to work anymore. He just sits around and collects the money.  I'm retired now. I'm making my living off of AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I give that two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it? You just, you saw a story that, that Seth McFarlane, two days.  You will, you, you come on the show anytime you want to announce you're coming out of retirement,  Patrick. You can be like Sinatra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can come out of retirement whenever you feel like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you know, let's, you know, what, something we should mention here is, you know,  we're doing this over Skype and Skype of course has been down for the last couple of days,  but it still has some flakiness because right now I'm getting a message from Skype.  I thought I'd mention it that says Skype cannot hear you talking.  Click here to select correct microphone and speaker.  Skype can hear me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear you. I don't, that's bizarre.  So I don't know if that's related, but that was,  that's probably the big story of the week and it sure put a scare into me.  In fact, we had to kill a couple of podcasts that we had scheduled for recording cause I,  I rely on Skype. Now somebody's going to come along and say, oh, well,  what about Gizmo or other SIP products?  I mean, there's plenty of other voiceover internet products we could have used,  but we're just so dependent on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I, maybe it's just the implementations I've used like Gizmo.  Gizmo is one of the most miserable experiences I've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause that's what I was preparing to do.  I was preparing to move everybody to Gizmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, and I think, I think it may just,  I think I may have had an ugly experiments experience with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I remember that Dvorak also, you had problems as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I hate to say this cause Mike Robertson is a friend of mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And formerly of mp3.com and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Lin and Lindos and I was like his main testifying person for his Lindos.  I testify. I testified anyway. So,  and he got like millions out of the deal. So,  but the thing is I agree with Patrick a hundred percent. It, it,  it works kind of for a while, but it's like, it takes, so it's like a virus.  You can't get it off your system. It boots when you don't want it to.  It's just very painful. I just got rid of it. I didn't,  I just don't want to deal with it.  And I know a lot of people who are really into this stuff to an extreme and they  all say SIP stinks.  Well, that's too bad. SIP is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it when you go to the download webpage of a website and it automatically  starts opening the installer for their software.  Oh yeah. That happened to me. SIP is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SIP is the signaling protocol for voiceover the internet.  And it's a standard. I mean, there's nothing,  I mean there's nothing inherently wrong with SIP.  There's different implementations, asterisk supports SIP.  A lot of PBXs support SIP,  but the thing is Skype just works so well. I mean,  and then there are people like Alex Lindsay who complain about Skype,  but it works better than anything else out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What are they complaining about? What's all that?  We haven't heard a lot of weird noise by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick's like, I think Patrick's making license plates. Is that your new job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was opening up,  I was opening up a Gizmo window on a PC to see if it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could move the keyboard away from your microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway. It sounded like license plate stamping. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microphone 1A. So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that John's got the big setup, he's like the sound guy.  I got a rig. He's got a rig. Yeah. He's got, he's got,  he's got his own compressor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they send you? I have it bypassed for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they send you an Apex? What do they send you? No, you can use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have an Apex. I haven't hooked that up yet. I'm using some Presona stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apex is going to send me a 230. I'm going to try it. And it might sound,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it might be great. Well, you know, I, I,  What are you doing, Patrick? It sounds like you got, you got,  You're chopping up a body. You got ferrets in there. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No wonder, guys, guys, guys, I had my microphone  turned off and on mute. That's not me making the noise.  Might be my network connection, might be Skype, but it's not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know what it is. You think that you're on your headset and you're not.  You're on your laptop, Mike. That's Mike.  Cause it, it wasn't muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what it is? Stupid Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Blame the computer. Blame the, it is, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, with all due respect to, to the joyous and wondrous OS X  experience, the way it handles audio is stupid. Really? I'm sorry. Really?  Well, if, if a Windows, if every Windows PC I've ever used will automatically  turn off the internal mic,  it's not like it's that hard when you plug in something externally.  It may also be the way you have to manually go in and change the line in port  up here now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you're still on your mic on your laptop, Mike.  That's why it was so noisy. Cause yeah, you're typing away. Yeah.  You need to select it.  I think you need to do both in the sound preference pane. I just,  I just did change it over and Skype still did tap the tap the laptop mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it sounds good. He does not leave. You can't hear him typing now. Okay.  Maybe we fixed it then. The microphone sounds like a piece of crap,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that's another story. We won't. Mr. Von Neumann.  Are you using a Neumann or an Audio Technica? Me? Yeah. I'm using an AKG.  Oh, sorry. What does AKG stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All cool graphite. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, Skype, we love Skype.  We're dependent on it on this network and it scared the willies out of me when it  was down. Is this bad for Skype or is this just the normal, you know, Hey,  Skype has been very reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, this reminds me of about,  if you remember about 10 or 15 years ago when AOL did a big upgrade and they  threw it online and they went down for days. And did it hurt AOL?  Sometimes these things, you know,  they didn't upgrade at Skype and sometimes these things don't work out in  the real world.  It looked good in the lab and looked good in simulation and they threw this  thing into the real world and bam, down it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think down harder than anybody expected. They kept saying, Oh,  we'll be back in 12 to 24 hours.  It was well more than 24 hours before it came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to be in one of those meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine the table pounding that was going on? Patrick, are you there?  We've lost Patrick, but he's still online.  Maybe Skype's back down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Patrick must be having trouble with his sound control panel.  We'll move on.  It says that he's online here.  Yeah, I know. I see him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I think he's using a Macintosh.  This is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you guys want to just bash Mac all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's wrong with you?  I use a Macintosh and I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right.  You're just limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has a lot of things that,  so I'm sitting last night with a designer who is going to help me do something.  Do some design work.  And he brought up this interesting point that you start using that iPhone for a while  and that crazy interface so we can flip things around and go through photos.  You get spoiled.  Spinning and you go back to your computer and you hate it.  Yeah, you want to do all that stuff.  Is this happening to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I have to say I'm looking forward to a computer that uses this touch interface.  I think that's a great interface and it really is a great way to work.  I guess if you work with graphics a lot, as he obviously does,  you kind of want to do that touching the screen, sizing, moving stuff around.  I don't know.  You know, the drawback to it is you get fingerprints on grease all over your screen.  You're constantly cleaning the darn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can do it with the Google Hand.  I mean, if you, you know, the little hand.  What's the Google Hand?  Oh, I see.  You know, you can just grab something.  Drag stuff around.  If you have a Wii from Nintendo and you go to the weather report,  because Wiis have a built-in Wi-Fi, so they usually go online for you.  Right.  And so you're going and they have, if you zoom out on the globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you use the Wiimote to do that?  Like throw it around?  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, what you can do is you can grab the, like you can zoom out on the globe.  You know, for like, if you're looking for new storage, you zoom out  and there's a big globe and you can grab it and spin it.  Wow.  And it's pretty much like the effect you get with the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, you know, Apple has not patented this.  They don't own it.  It's, you know, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I thought they had 220 patents or something like that on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they may, but you know, the Microsoft Surface Table uses the same pinch.  I understand that that pinch technology is not owned by Apple  and can be used by anybody.  So I expect you're going to see a lot of devices.  Let's get Patrick back on the line here.  His Skype crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back then when...  Go ahead.  I was watching, I was watching, for example, John Markoff has one of these phones  and he was looking for a photo and I guess, and I, you know,  I only play with the phones.  I didn't notice it, but he's very dependent on, he has like all these photos.  And then he just takes a stomach, you scroll,  you just throw the photos around.  You just make them into little thumbnails and you just spin, spin, spin.  And then they roll up the screen and you find what you're looking for pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The touch interface is great.  And I do think that, and not particularly the iPhone touch interface,  but just touch is a nice way to work.  I don't know if it's the right way to work on a desktop computer,  but sure is a great way on a handheld device.  It works very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I think still, I'm still thinking of the Google Hand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess you could do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that little hand comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you kind of use, you still use your mouse,  but you just be moving around.  With a hand.  With a hand.  You don't have an iPhone yet, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to wait to the next generation or you're not going to get one ever?  I'm not going to wait for Gen 3.  That's what my daughter said.  She must know something.  I think young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I skew young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the iPhone, the 300 page iPhone bill?  Poor Justine and Zerrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and now there was another article, the follow up article,  that 300 page, for anyone out there who wants to check this out,  you go to Google and look up 300 page bill or AT&T bill.  It'll come up to the top, but anyway, some woman came out with a little movie  and she showed this bill.  It came in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Justine.  She's been on the show many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, one of the things that started to show up now,  I ran into an Australian blog where they were having this problem there too.  It's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge bills.  AT&T, David Pogue was the first to mention this about a month ago.  AT&T, for some reason, itemizes every data transaction.  And Justine is a younger generation.  She only had about 200 minutes on the phone, but she had,  she told us on the Mac Break Weekly, I think it was 30,000 text messages that month.  Every one of them is itemized.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's crazy.  Every bite that you send.  That's really stupid.  But, you know, that's because you're talking about new generation,  old generation thinking.  They don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should know better.  They don't get it.  And, you know, I didn't get a bill in the box because I immediately  went to paperless billing anyway.  But I guess if you, you know, there are people, she's an outlier.  I mean, most people get 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but then again, Leo, don't you think having a big box full of a giant bill as a  collectible?  Bill in the box.  I mean, something you put away and then auction off, you know, or have your grandkids auction  it off.  Look at this.  This is the way it used to be back in 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cost them seven bucks to mail her the bill.  I love that.  I think we should all just put AT&T out of its misery.  Ask for paper bills fully itemized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, get off that electronic thing.  Get at paper bills.  Make them grind these things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long do you think it would last before they change their policies?  Customs officials say that, remember, we talked last week about the downtime at Los Angeles  International Airport.  Patrick, if we can get some audio out of Patrick, I think he's still having audio problems.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we hear you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's great.  You know, for some reason, and I've run into several people that have had this, sometimes  Skype won't work with the line input.  Interesting.  On MacBooks or MacBook Pros without restarting the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We tell everybody to use a USB device for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time I use a USB device, you spend the first five minutes of the podcasting telling  me how crappy it is and that I should be using a USB device, so I just gave up using them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never mind.  Forget it.  You sound good.  We're hearing you.  That's all I care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one microphone you actually do like is the one that's the fake phone with the...  Plastic handset.  With the plastic handset that costs like $8.  I know.  And every time I use that, you're like, hey, I've been using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds good.  That sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, there's actually a rationale for that and I'm going to explain it because I have  a Kodak 630, one of these little dual lens cameras that has the most amazing microphone  in it for making little videos.  So I talked to a friend of mine who's an audio engineer and he knows about this.  He says these microphones, and probably that eight buck microphone is one of them, are  these buck 50 microphones that people get from China that aren't calibrated and it's  a complete crap shoot.  The quality can be astonishing or crap and there are apparently just as a fluke, you  get astonishing quality out of a few of them and you probably have one of them.  Save that handset.  Yeah.  Don't get rid of that mic.  Don't let Aaron keep it at DLTV.  What he told me was that these things are so cheap that you could calibrate them and  make them really high quality.  You could quality control them, but then the micro would cost you 25 bucks to calibrate  them so nobody does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it turns out that the whole computer system, remember we talked about this last week, Customs  was down at LAX.  They were routing people, 17,000 passengers were stranded.  Turns out it was one computer with a bad network interface card.  It was the one that broke the whole system down for nine hours.  One bad NIC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shows you they're a little bit maybe vulnerable.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they talk about, is there something where if one of the NICs in the network is a secure  network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was probably broadcasting or something, right?  I mean it was doing something weird.  In any event, between this and the Skype outage, it just really reminds me how reliant we are  in this technology and really frankly how non-bulletproof it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I think that the whole thing should be shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five years, that's all Elton John asks.  Five years without the internet.  I'm on his side now.  Sir Elton John and John C. Dvorak together at last.  Do you believe the experts who say that they broke the speed of light, is that possible?  Is Einstein wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read that article three times and I still don't grock the whole like, you know, we create  a wormhole inside of a molecule and it's faster than light.  And then my head goes pop and I go back to reading Walt Whitman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's funny is that's exactly, leaves of grass.  What's funny is that this is exactly how sci-fi has said for years you'd be able to transcend  the speed of light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I'm very skeptical but at the same time I have, you know somebody once pointed  out to me that Einstein based his speed of light theses or at least some of his formulation  on Edwin Mock who had a bunch of theories about how you can't, you know, that large  objects can't go faster than the speed of sound.  And that's why you got Mock 1.  That's interesting.  So I don't know, I've never been fully convinced that there's something that doesn't make sense  about the fact that there's a limit to the speed something can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I don't pretend to understand any of it but according to two German physicists  they have forced light to overcome its own speed limit using quantum tunneling.  In an experiment microwave photons, which are energetic packets of light, appeared,  and this might be the key word, appeared to travel instantaneously between two prisms  forming the halves of a cube placed a meter apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, appeared.  You're right.  That's why I'm skeptical about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know that meme, the LOL cats, where I can has cheeseburger, you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were talking about this I has your power.  Last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so somebody sent me the link to Schrödinger's LOL cat.  Remember the Schrödinger thought experiment where you'd have a cat in a box and depending  on whether you're observing or not whether the cat would be dead.  There's a great, I'll have to put this on Boing Boing, I'll have to put a link.  In your quantum, I'm in your quantum box.  Maybe.  It's actually the first LOL cat I've ever laughed at.  So I just want to thank I don't have the name of the person who sent that to me, but thank  you.  Bless you for sending that that link to me that that redeemed the meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a pretty awesome t shirt too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, wouldn't that be good?  I'm in your quantum box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a yeah, there's a cafe press is there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  That's what happens.  So you were talking about this before we started.  This is called Wikipedia scanner.  Guy at Caltech.  He's a graduate student in computation and neural systems means he's probably pretty  smart is offering users a searchable database.  Now you can always on Wikipedia look at the history and see who's edited it, but it's  hard to go through it.  You have to go page by page.  This database ties millions of anonymous Wikipedia edits to organizations from which those edits  apparently originated cross referencing them.  Come up with some interesting stuff, hasn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's interesting that he's resolving IP addresses.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you can do that with Rufik.  That's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's basically he's created the Wikipedia scanner, which is a user searchable database  that works across basically looks at anonymous Wikipedia edits and to the organizations,  I assume by the IP range for where the changes.  They'll get the block of IP addresses that are associated with a particular IP address  that's posted a change on Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wikiscanner.virgil.gr.  And then he has editors picks.  So you could see the Senate or DeBold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DeBold eliminating long paragraphs describing the technical problems of security in their  system.  Oh, busted.  You know, information.  But yeah, it's.  I think this is a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is a good example of the kinds of things that computers do so well.  Walmart changing articles about Walmart.  Let's just pick a few here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is like Wired did a pretty good article about this and they  They pointed out that Walmart didn't really delete the criticisms, but, you know, added  a few nice things to their entry.  Well, that's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they spun it.  They spun it.  They spun it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Walmart.  It's the shark of retail.  It's like the most highly evolved shark in retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, by the way, Virgil was hired by the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation.  This is the number one Wired pick, modified the story so that you don't know that he was  hired by them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I miss that one.  That's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft White Watches controversy, cost of ownership, Linux comparison, Halliburton  and war crimes, CIA vandalism.  This is an odd one.  The CIA, somebody at the CIA vandalized Pope Benedict's entry at Wikipedia to say he's  the Fonz.  Now, that's got to be an error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do they got?  A bunch of old TV.  What is the CIA doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, well, it's kind of funny as you look at like there's a whole link of editors picks  on the side of the Wikiscaner.  So DARPA.mil, you know, it's like, you know, Saturn disambiguation.  It's still a GM automobile brand at Virginia Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking there's somebody, you know, there's a bunch of jokers at the CIA with nothing  better to do.  They don't think anybody is obviously not tracking them because they're the CIA for  God's sake.  And these clowns are like are doing these joke entries as, you know, as some way to  kill time in the office.  I think it's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody at Greenpeace is modifying Ted Nugent's entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a shock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Philip Morris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just this is you got to read this.  This is the if you go to the Wired article, they've they've done a ton of them.  And I guess there's more coming all the time.  So but, you know, it just shows you, you know, not everything is alive on the net.  And when you post, I think people forget your Internet address is right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what Tor was invented for.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the CIA should learn something about Tor, perhaps.  I don't know. Just the thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then again, it may be that the CIA is doing these posts to make it look as though  they can be tracked when, in fact, the real posts that they're doing are done through  some system that is completely untraceable.  It's wheels.  Let's name that system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it named?  Could be how about maybe the quantum system?  Could be Walmart.  Could be.  It's all you know, Walmart runs everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Walmart owns the CIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's another disclosure.  Former Redmond, Microsoft, has hired two veteran lobbyists, Thomas Boggs and Kathleen Ireland,  not Cathy Ireland, Kathleen Ireland, along with Antitrust Modernization Commission Vice  Chairman Clinton White.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's not his name.  Former Clinton White.  This is what happens when you cut off a sentence.  What is this story?  Former Clinton White House attorney Jonathan Yarrowski to kind of lobby against Google  buying DoubleClick.  Microsoft doesn't like that idea.  Yarrowski removed last year.  Doesn't like that idea.  Maybe Microsoft doesn't want Google to buy DoubleClick.  I wonder why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft's finally learning the ropes about how to do things kind of through  the back door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has a pretty active lobbying arm, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every company that has a valuation in the building, as an active lobbying.  It's everybody lobbies.  Everybody who's a big player in the industry has lobbyists.  Just a question of how effective they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and heaven forbid that our legislatures actually work on behalf of the public.  Oh, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John.  I'm just going to step back.  I'm going to step back.  Don't make me start weeping.  Take the bait.  John, by the way, is this stock market crash?  Just as long as we're talking about finance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because everyone knows I've got this theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this stock market crash the crash you've been talking about?  The bus burst?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  See, my belief is that there needed to be a huge correction anyway so when you have  the real big run up, what's going to happen?  Now, people like to point out that, you know, you have this mortgage situation that triggered  this whole thing.  And I, since my cycle is 80 years, I said, look, what happened 80 years ago?  You had the Florida land crash almost to the, well, actually a little earlier.  Oh, is this like the Florida land crash?  So there's the Florida land crash, which caused the market to correct and then you had your  big run up, which will begin somewhere around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, my ancestors were involved in the Florida land crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Buying or selling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they got stuck with a large community that rapidly became worthless.  And it sank into the bog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you know, long term, if they'd have held on to that property, they probably would have  been better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  It's good now.  It's good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Long term investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calacanis says this could be a bad quarter for Web 2.0 companies for four reasons.  The stock market correction will affect online advertising.  Probably.  Probably.  Which would affect us.  One, most of them don't have a revenue stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two, most of them that do have a revenue stream is going to be impacted by low advertising  investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google and Apple stocks are going away, right?  They're dying.  And so that's some, I don't know how that affects Web 2.0.  Tecna Ratty laid off eight people.  I don't know why that means anything.  Including, by the way, the CEO is gone at Tecna Ratty.  I don't know what's going on over there.  Didn't Sifri, he stepped down, but it was kind of sudden.  The resignation effective immediately.  He'll remain chairman of Tecna Ratty's board.  So maybe Tecna Ratty is the canary in the mind, the first Web 2.0 company to kind of disappear.  Oh, there's Bill McCrone.  Let's add Bill McCrone to the.  Hey Bill.  Hello.  Welcome.  We haven't had John Twitton a long time.  Glad to get you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has been a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me add.  John's for some reason dropped off.  I'm going to add him back on and we'll get back to work here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Apple stocks looking pretty good if you take a look at it in like six months or a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they've taken a dive in the last few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, sure.  But they were up to one hundred and forty five.  They're still one hundred and twenty in a year ago.  They were they were under one hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was going to go to one seventy and then crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Google's down below five hundred again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not going to last forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's a long term hold on the Dvorak portfolio.  The imaginary.  I should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I should have.  You shouldn't even be writing about any of this stuff.  I should just bought the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought the Google.  So, Bill, how you doing?  Haven't talked to you in ages.  How you what you up to these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm doing just fine.  I'm still writing like a darn fool and sounds like you're typing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not me.  That's Pat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not typing.  There is no typing going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  License plates again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  There is a mystery typer on the line who is just trying to fill our heads with keyboard  sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  That's it.  Moving along.  Well, we talked about Skype's outage and we actually have done a few stories already,  but I'm glad you could join in.  We're talking right now about the notion that the stock market correction that's going on  might be an indicator that bad times are ahead, especially for Web 2.0 companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm a naysayer.  I think it's just a blip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, unless the Web 2.0 companies have a lot of real estate holdings, I really don't  see the connection.  Exactly.  I don't either.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear, as a kind of a Web 2.0 company, I'm glad to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you want to identify with Web 2.0, Leo?  Because I didn't want to be 1.0.  Is that the Ajax on your site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As far as I'm concerned, you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no Ajax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the deciding line?  There's no Ajax.  It is for me.  If you've got no Ajax, you're not 2.0.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am stealth 2.0 because all the Ajax is behind the scenes in the administration page.  There is, in fact, Ajax, a lot of it on my site, but you can't see it.  How do you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about Ajax.  I'm really disappointed in the fact that Ajax is being promoted to such an extreme because  I find on a lot of pages, and besides the fact that it screws up everybody's numbers,  I find on a lot of pages that half the time Ajax, if it's not perfectly implemented, that  you get these menus and then you go to select something and the menu goes away or it moves  over to the left.  You're chasing it around the screen to try to click on something.  It doesn't highlight right away.  I mean, I think it's just a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have to say if it's done poorly, it's the worst thing in the world and it does take  a lot of work.  You know what?  Maybe it's a way to ensure work for those who can figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not supposed to be difficult.  It's supposed to just be standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's tough though, and partly because that no browser really adheres to the standards.  So, you're doing versions for Explorer, for Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the Opera people would take tremendous offense because they work very hard to conform  to the standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many pages does Opera work well with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the cruel irony.  What about Safari for Windows?  I would recommend people load Safari for Windows and then go to the KQED site in San Francisco,  Channel 9, and take a look at the TV schedules with Safari and see what you end up with.  Unreadable, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't use Google Spreadsheet with Safari.  So, this is the problem is that a lot of Ajax breaks, not because it's not standard, but  because the browsers are implementing it all over the place.  Apple and Dell have slipped in customer satisfaction rankings.  In fact, overall, the PC industry slightly fell in the second quarter of the year, mostly,  I think, because of problems at Apple and Dell.  This is the University of Michigan citing the American Customer Satisfaction Index data,  saying that each Apple and Dell dropped five percentage points in customer satisfaction.  Still Apple number one, but only a measly 79% customer satisfaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Dell's got other problems.  They're having to restate all their earnings for the last four years.  Oh, let's talk about that.  That's kind of interesting.  I mean, I don't see that as that far away from having some sort of a federal investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the same variation on the theme that Apple's been having the troubles with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not an options thing.  It's not an options part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is just statements, statements of earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In order to appear more successful, and Dell's internal audit discovered this, and they admitted,  I mean, they stepped forward, which I imagine helps a little bit in dodging prosecution.  But still Dell concluded Thursday that this is my favorite.  Some employees had misled its auditors, like what?  The guy who makes the machine and manipulated results to meet performance goals for more than four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some guy on the assembly line.  Some employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me think, CFO.  I don't know.  Dell said the net income is about 50 to 150 million dollars lower.  That's two to seven cents per share lower than stated.  Now, it's a 55 billion dollar company, but still two to seven cents a share is not insignificant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, to the SEC, it's not.  This story is not going away anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, they just announced it.  Federal regulators have not said anything yet, but I expect we'll hear a lot more about this soon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if a guy can't restate his earnings anymore without going to jail, I think it's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the question is why the earnings were lower in the first place.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, you got to please the investors.  You got to get those quarterly numbers in there and you got to ship product.  And so you need to restate things once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a little easier to do before Sarbanes-Oxley, I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting a lot of mail, John, because John is on a campaign against Sox.  And by the way, most of the mail is from auditors saying, no, Sox is a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These guys are cleaning up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These auditors are cleaning up on this scam.  All right. Let me quote Matthew Johnson.  Subject line, misunderstandings of Sarbanes-Oxley.  In recent episodes, John seems to be confused about what Sox is all about.  I'm a CPA.  No, no, wait a minute.  Who's an IT auditor and I've been performing internal and external Sox audits since companies were required to be compliant in 2004.  He works for a big four accounting firm.  So I think I have a pretty good perspective on the process.  First, I'll agree with the statement that the rules imposed under Sox about what types of services audit firms can sell to their audit clients is something the Anderson auditors at Enron should have followed.  A law was not necessary for that, though.  Blah, blah, blah.  John's dispute about Sox is the part of the law called Section 404, which roughly states that management must maintain internal controls over their financial reporting process.  This is for all the back office business processes and IT controls.  This has been desperately needed because auditors have for years been begging companies to adopt these strong internal controls.  That's easier.  Makes it easier to audit a company.  The strong controls and auditor can rely more on the controls and have to test less of the individual transactions.  Sox is helping to fix these issues.  He says it's just growing pains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not an issue.  This is like a guy typically saying, you know, this makes my job a lot easier.  So John's full of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the real joke is when you go out and you look at all of the enterprise software and it all advertises itself as Sox compliant and there is no there's nothing for it to be compliant to.  It's a complete scam.  You know, it's you guys remember 10, 15 years ago when everything was new now with AI added and Sox compliance is just the latest scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I'm putting Sox compliant on my blog.  What Sox compliant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have internal audits in place?  Internal controls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's just me.  No, I don't need to because I'm not a public corporation.  But that thus I'm Sox compliant.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also says because this is one of your contentions, John, is that there are no IPOs because of Sox.  He says it's due to risks of litigation, not Sox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha ha.  I say there's always been risks risks of litigation.  What's changed?  What is changed in the scheme of things?  It's Sox.  It's the only new variable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He sent us a link and I'll send it to you to an op-ed piece.  I got the letter from the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got like 10 letters just probably from all from the same guy and he probably works at some big eight accounting firm and that's the end of it.  Big four, he says.  I'm sorry.  What am I thinking?  Even better.  Yeah, that's right.  There's only four left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to be eight.  Let's see.  Moving along to yet another controversial story.  Boing Boing says the reporters with the Associated Press and CNET, and I might ask you about Markov as well, are suing Hewlett-Packard and former HP executives, including chairwoman, former chairwoman Patricia Dunn and former ethics chief Kevin Hunsaker over the spying that HP did on these journalists.  Remember, HP kind of got off.  They got let off the hook on this.  But now they're civil suits.  They're seeking damages for illegal and reprehensible conduct and an invasion of privacy.  Oh, did.  Now Markov was one of the guys who was pretexted and spied upon.  Is he a part of this suit?  Does he know he was pretty upset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember I've talked to him about this and you know, apparently the New York Times has looked into whether they should or whether he should sue.  I think there's something going on.  He hasn't made a decision to sue.  And the way it looks is probably I'm not thinking he's going to.  But if these other four guys, you know, the way you want to do a suit like this is let these other four guys go in, you know, and throw their money away.  If they win, hey, it's a walk away.  You just walk in and you just tell them to give you a check.  Me too, Your Honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The charges against Dunn were dropped.  She had to resign, but they were dropped and the rest were reduced to community service.  So they really got let off on this one.  And HP paid 13 and a half million dollars to California to establish a fund for law enforcement activities related to privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  There's at least one or two reporters.  One works for Forbes.  Everybody over there knows who he is that apparently was just steaming and livid over the fact that he wasn't pretexted.  They were looking at me.  A Hunter S. Thompson rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why did they leave me out?  Just for those who didn't follow the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, this was this was all about leaks from the HP boardroom that HP was trying to track down.  And not only did they tap their own board member, more members, but they were tapping and pretexting reporters at the same time.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I just do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of.  I don't know.  I mean, it'd be interesting to see how it comes out.  I think it's a wheel spinning.  I mean, the thing is, what did these guys find out that was so damaging against any one person?  I mean, it's like, well, this guy sure dull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, are they are they doing it because they want to make sure other companies are more highly motivated in not doing it?  Or are they doing it for a payday?  Or does it really matter?  What do you think?  A payday, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why else would you sue?  Absolutely.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To make the world better, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember, remember you were being all hopeful.  You were being all hopeful.  What planet are you from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frankly, this is the most depressing tweet we've ever done.  It's like the world is sucks.  Everybody's corrupt and socks is ruining everything.  Which is a great segue into creative and their drivers.  All right, go ahead.  Patrick's been dying to slam creative about the drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a company with worse driver support than creative?  Creative who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ATI?  Creative Labs.  Creative Labs to get those sound car people?  Yeah.  What do you use?  Are they still in business?  Sure, lots of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well I had a card.  I got an older system I use for writing and web browsing and stuff.  And I wanted to reinstall the audio card in it.  And of course the audio card is no longer supported.  But you can still search their website for drivers.  All of the drivers and all of the related content to that has been deleted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this really bothers you?  I mean, what was the card?  A $15 card or a $17 card?  It was like a $125 card when I bought it.  In its day?  Well, it's worth three bucks now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, it's just I'm sorry.  I come from the terrible like I bought it.  It still works.  I shouldn't need to replace it kind of camp.  I know that makes me terribly old fashioned.  It's weird.  It's just sad that they can't even be bothered.  I mean, they've obviously had miserable problems with driver support with Vista and other things.  But it's just kind of like, couldn't you at least keep the old drivers around on your website or?  Oh, yeah, I agree with that.  What's the off?  Well, maybe it was.  Well, they want to drive people into you know, this is also the company that used to never allow you to download drivers if you lost your installation disc for audio cards for a bunch of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what, Patrick?  People should just shouldn't buy those products from companies like that.  True.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turtle Beach it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sound Blaster isn't even a standard anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not, is it?  They said that on motherboard audio is completely taken over everywhere.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a lot of people using a lot of people like the X-Fy cards.  Who?  X-Fy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't heard.  I have one on one of my machines, but you know, I've got that X-Fy Extreme with the whole external thing and it sure is swell.  But frankly, I never use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just it's just a sound card.  But X-Fy is a term it's swell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just love my folksy terms, John.  I know you've been at it for two decades.  I'm going to get McCrone and Pornell on together on one podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But on a show.  Hey, the X-Fy.  Go ahead.  X-Fy.  X-Fy is a creative product though, right?  It's a Sound Blaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it has it has one neat feature, John.  It's really swell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, my version of that is Nifty.  I love it.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nifty is O'Karrant.  This is swell.  And that's the 24 bit crystallizer.  What's that do?  24 bit crystallizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that let you travel in time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Travel and quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It actually kind of does because it takes games and upgrades them to extreme fidelity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.  It takes CD quality audio and adds another four bits of quality to it.  And it's a decompressor.  How could that work though, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds boss.  If the data is not there, what he adds four bits.  What does the four bit come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, decompression is a well-known art and there's lots of compression on especially on CD music.  Really? It's compressed?  Yeah, because you only have 16 bits of range and that's not enough.  You had more on a well-engineered vinyl record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're going to get, by the way, to an anniversary this week of the CD in a second.  25 years.  All right. But don't rush it because I have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Overall, you like the effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the crystallizer is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it like an expander? What is it doing? I don't understand how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it expands the high end.  It increases the dynamic range and it just makes the music sound better.  There's an analog product that lots of studio musicians and even live musicians use called the BBE Sonic Maximizer.  And you just find these in every recording studio and in most stage things.  And it just takes what's coming out of the microphones and the console and maximizes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I want one. I want to be maximized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuff like this usually cruds up the audio more than it helps it.  It's kind of nice to hear something that actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and I trust Bill because Bill really knows about audio.  So if you say so, I believe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really does work. It really does sound spectacular.  So you can re-record your music maximized.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the thing called the crystallizer and it comes with what piece of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it comes on a couple of models of the Creative X-FY.  Creative X-FY and I just happen to have the...  I guess it's the Xtreme, the one with the external console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Xtreme Music, it says. Yeah.  Patrick, is this what you're trying to get a creative driver for? Is this particular unit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's trying to get it for some clunker.  They ran on CPM apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got your X-FY Elite Pro, your X-FY Platinum Fatality Champion Series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, with all due respect to the crystallizer, and I am curious now,  why would I go out and spend another $100 on a sound card when I have a perfectly good AWE64  that's been serving me for all these years?  The AWE64.  Aw, 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aw.  Aw. Now that's neat. And boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got my old Nash Ambassador and it still runs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you have the breakout box, you must have the Platinum version.  It looks like that's the one with the breakout box and a remote control.  That's right. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. And how much is that?  No idea.  A lot.  No idea. $159?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works with Vista. There's the good news.  All right. We're going to celebrate a couple of birthdays.  As you said, the CD is celebrating its 25th.  But you know, this is the anniversary of the day of Elvis's death, or was this week.  Anyway. Yes.  And actually a little old lady was camping at Graceland and passed away this week.  Yeah. That's kind of sad.  But it made me think there must be a great book on audible.com.  About camping at Graceland?  About Elvis. And there is Jerry Schilling who played college ball.  Or no, I'm sorry, high school football with Elvis.  And stayed his friend, his bodyguard, his photo double, and even a co-executive producer on a karate film.  Elvis is confidant. It's hard not to laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on a second, let me write this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called Me and a Guy Named Elvis, My Lifelong Friendship with Elvis Presley.  Jerry Schilling, you want to hear a little bit of it?  Because you're going to like this.  I'm in.  This is good. Yes, you're going to hear it.  X5 version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This explains why all the Elvis movies have been playing nonstop on classic movie channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the story of him meeting Elvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is before Twitter, of course.  And what he does is he starts a touch football game and Elvis is the quarterback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, that's our audible pick.  I just figured we should do something topical.  That was very topical. Very good.  It had nothing to do with tech, but it was very topical.  Well, you can't always.  There are plenty of tech books, by the way, on audible.  A lot of books on audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry I mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want to encourage you. Audible is a sponsor of the show and we really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've just been a great sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, I'm joking around, but, you know, that's a it's actually a fun book to listen to.  It's got four point seven five stars out of five.  So people love this book.  If you have 14 hours of evidence and it could be yours for free, you get a credit when you join audible.  You go to audible.com slash twit and you can get a free book.  You can pick a different book, John.  You got another book.  Yeah. Well, you know, it seems to me that since we're on the show, plugging this company, since they're a sponsor, some sort of an extra special deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we didn't have to buy any books.  Just like that for you or for everyone, John?  I just I don't care about you, to be honest about it.  But for you, then you want me to arrange a subscription audible for you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care about you.  I don't care about you.  I don't care about you.  I don't care about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want me to arrange a subscription audible for you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could do that.  No, that's OK.  I don't have a free one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I pay 15 bucks a month and it's worth it.  I get to because I'm grandfathered in.  They don't have that deal anymore.  But it's a I love audible.  I have a you know, I subscribed when I used to commute to tech TV and I spent three hours a day in the car.  And I still don't you know, I don't spend any time in the car anymore.  I still you know, I had the problem with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't listen to enough of these books.  I should.  And the rest of the family are booked.  You know, listening to book addicts.  Oh, really?  Everybody does.  Except me.  I listen to right wing talk radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a Michael Savage fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like it's kind of pathetic.  That's where you get your material, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  I get a lot of it from these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who do you listen to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I listen to all the bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Savage, O'Reilly.  I listen to Savage because he's you know, he's the most entertaining.  He's hysterical.  I also listen to Rush Limbaugh occasionally.  But the problem with Limbaugh is he's up against now Jim Rome, who I consider to be one of the great broadcasters.  Rome's actually very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually my radio show comes out of the Jim Rome studio.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Jim Rome is unbelievable.  And mainly because he created his own world.  I mean, he's got his own lingo and he's got his own kind of group of people.  That's what you got to do.  He berates his customers in a very funny way.  And then what's the name?  The comic is on at that same time.  Franken?  Dennis Miller.  Miller.  He's on one of the stations at the same time as Limbaugh.  He's toast because of this.  He's like sandwiched between Limbaugh and Rome at the morning hours.  And he's actually the show's actually gotten fairly good.  So I'm clicking between them because, you know, the trouble is everyone runs on the same clock and radio.  Everybody wants to know why you hit the button and everyone's got a commercial.  Well, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we don't want you to leave us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have these clocks that are but sometimes the clocks go out of sync and then you can make a lot of jumps back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's just a long roundabout way of saying listen to audible books audible dot com slash twits.  We thank them for their support this week.  What an ad.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let us celebrate.  Let us commemorate the twenty fifth anniversary of the CD on August 17th,  Now, there's some debate.  According to an article by the BBC, the first CD produced was The Visitors by Abba.  But if you read the official press release, I think Phillips Corporation, who made this first CD, was a little embarrassed to have the notion that the first CD was Abba.  So they say it was a Richard Strauss Waltz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was a Richard Strauss Waltz because I remember when these things first came out, I remembered the first thing being a classical recording.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody.  They produced it in August.  Nobody had a CD player till October.  Bill, do you remember when you?  Yeah, really.  Do you remember your first CD, Bill?  Absolutely.  Must have been classical, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, it was when the when Ver released the Ella Fitzgerald songbook on CD.  What a great, what a great.  That was the reason to to buy all of the the LSDs and buy a player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you happy with the quality of the first CDs you heard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Surprisingly, yes.  Of course, those were really carefully engineered.  I'm sure they could be done even better now.  But when you had engineers sitting there just loving the experience and game writing and scratch filtering and doing all that stuff, they really did a superb job.  Those CDs still sound great to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phillips did the hardware.  Sony did the software, the firmware for the player.  And there's you know, there's debate also about why the CD was the size.  It is the length.  Some say it's the size of a Dutch beer coaster that I find hard.  I find that hard to believe.  Others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Well, I understood it that it was pocketable with very, you know, you just put it in a pocket.  It was a pocket.  Yeah.  The same pocket that fit the Walkman, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the Dutch beer coaster, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all fit in the same pocket.  The other theory is that a Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been to Holland a lot and I've never seen a beer coaster that size ever.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Well, maybe you'll believe this story that a Sony executive said, well, I don't care what size it is as long as it's long enough to hold Beethoven's ninth.  And in fact, it is just.  And that makes sense because you don't want to break up Beethoven's ninth.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I was thinking more.  It holds the second live at the Apollo recording by James Brown.  What an amazing album, you know, that ends right at the end of the length of the CD.  Yeah, it's a great album.  One of the great collectibles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sixty nine minutes and 59 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's over.  So what was your first CD, Mr. Patrick Norton?  I'm sure you remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I'm not sure if it was Ariems life, life's rich pageants or if it was a Joe Jackson album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Joe Jackson, Senegal on CD.  How about you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I can't remember.  I mean, there's I have so many of these really old ones.  It was one.  It was some early rock thing, some sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember very well for some reason.  I think a lot of people remember their first CDs.  Mine was Roxy Music Avalon.  And I picked it because I thought, well, this will sound good on CD.  It will be well produced.  And it did sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think mine was the what was the song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ninety nine Luft Balloons.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think I remember it.  But I can't for some reason.  I can't remember what it is.  Well, it was 25 years ago.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh.  Happy Anniversary CD.  And of course, the CD is a dying medium now.  It reached its peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wait, Leo, before you finish, you should mention that to this day, 200 billion of these babies have been sold.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of plastic.  Sure is.  The peak was 2001 when it sold 700 million.  It's down now to about 550 million units a year in the U.S.  So it is kind of dying out.  You think it'll last?  I don't know.  I don't think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How much longer for the CD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long before downloadable music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Backup data.  I'm backing up all my data now on DVDs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the thing is that music needs to be sold at higher bit rates.  And right now online, you know, a lot of the bit rates you can get music at is garbage.  A lot of record producers are saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're upset by the 128 kilobit.  Yeah.  128 sucks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  192 begins to be listenable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  192 is the beginning of acceptable if you have a decent system.  We've talked about this before, though, that consumers don't seem to care anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't.  All these kids, they all have tin ears because they put those plugs in their ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They crank it up.  They're half deaf.  When they talk to you, they yell at you because they think that they're talking at a low  voice.  Is it that, John, is it that so much or is it that we have an entire generation that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  been raised on digital cable or satellite with heavy compression on the channels.  They've, you know, they started downloading music in their early teen years and MP 128  megabit MP3 format, you know, off the Internet, which sounded crappy, you know, now just as  crappy now as it sounded then.  And the standards have kind of been lowered.  It's amazing when you think about just exactly much, you know, you look at it and, you know,  sort of standard deaf television and it's amazing how crappy it is on a lot of cable  networks compared to what it is on over the air because they're compressing it and they're  squeezing it because, you know, I need that extra 300 channels on direct TV.  It's just it's it's frustrating.  Good article by Joel Selvin in The Chronicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He quotes Phil Ramone, the great record producer, saying you can get used to it.  You can get used to awful.  You can appreciate nothing.  We've done it with fast food.  We're doing with music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I agree with you, Patrick, to a point.  The other thing is if you go out and hang out with some guys who manufacture speakers,  they say nobody buys speakers anymore.  Right.  They have the things in their ears and they crank it up and they go deaf.  And then they, you know, the sound's not going to be any you're going to have any range  anywhere when you've got this thing pumping like injecting sound directly to the eardrum.  And, you know, within a few years, I mean, they don't give a crap what things sound like.  And nobody has a you know, who buys nice speaker systems and sits back and relaxes  and tries to imagine the soundstage?  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Home theater people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, home theater people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're not listening to music even.  They're listening to explosions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  But, you know, those subwoofers really do come in handy for a lot of orchestral stuff, too.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally.  I'm a great but you're an old guy.  That's true.  I'm an old fart.  We're all old farts, except for Patrick.  And it's like, you know, so we can complain about this like from the from our perspective.  But, you know, eventually it's going to be revitalized.  There will be a comeback to somewhere along the line.  Someone's going to discover, you know, hey, this these things that we're doing, it stinks.  It sounds crummy.  Let's, you know, look, listen to this guy's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going on in this article and this might lend credence to this rebirth.  Guy named John Meyer, who builds speakers at Meyer Soundlands in Berkeley, very high end speakers, says,  The truth is, literally, poor audio does not touch you as much as better audio.  He says it turns you into an observer because the brain is working harder.  This is how MP3 works.  It takes out parts of the sound that you don't need to hear.  And the brain has to solve this.  And it's working so hard that you don't actually get it.  It stimulates the brain in a different way.  They quote a guy, Dr.  Robert Sweetow, who's head of UC San Francisco's Audiology Department.  He says, poor fidelity music stimulates the brain in different ways with different neurons,  perhaps lesser neurons stimulated.  There are fewer cortical neurons connected back to the limbic system where the emotions are stored.  So this crappy compressed music doesn't move you in the way that high quality music does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's another interesting statistic there, too.  And that is that the average dynamic range for popular music is 3 dB.  Wow. That's not possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the compression. That means it's so highly compressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Check it out, John.  It's true.  I'll buy into that.  That's horrible.  Well, it has to sound good on the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's not good on the radio.  And also, it's amazing.  I mean, you know, it's funny to listen to orchestral music if you've been listening to a lot of rock and roll,  because once you get past kind of like the late 60s, early 70s,  there's not a whole lot of dynamic range built into most albums.  And you know what I mean?  When you run into that situation where there's a flute or a piccolo  and then all of a sudden the entire orchestra jumps in and it blasts you back in your seat,  which is what it was supposed to do.  But that can be a little...  It's just not the way music's built anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  All right.  That brings me to the first CD I bought, which was the Money for Nothing.  What's the name of that group?  Oh, yeah. Dire Straits.  And it chicks for free.  Dire Straits' first album.  That album had a huge dynamic range.  And one of the things I liked about it, especially the early one,  I think I had maybe even a Japanese pressing,  is that the dynamic range was so outstanding, especially when that song began,  that you could demonstrate your stereo system using the CD player to people  and it would just blow them out of the room.  Because, you know, as we know, you have a 90-DB headroom on those things,  and they were taking advantage of it.  But if everything's been compressed down to three, it's ludicrous.  What's the point?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the most depressing episode of Twitter we've ever done.  The world is going to hell in a hand, Bassic.  The audio sucks. Politicians are corrupt.  Yeah, we've got the Internet.  Some are all distracted and happy.  But at least we're distracted and happy.  That's it, Patrick Norton. You hit the nail on the head.  Corruption lurks.  I want to thank you all for being here.  John C. Dvorak is online at Dvorak.org slash blog.  And if you don't know that by now, shame on you.  The best place to go to get all your crap.  Patrick Norton is unemployed but ready to have a baby.  We congratulate you, Patrick. That's such great news.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  I actually start my new job on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  What a shock.  The facts come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for giving us the scoop, Patrick. That's great.  So now it's Jim Latterback, Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Sarah Lane, Martin Sargent,  David Prager. It's practically tech TV.  Hardly.

Transcript:  The retirement center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the old folks home for tech TVers.  Hey, that's great. What are you going to do on revision three?  Oh, you know, making content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New shows?  We're going to continue doing system, which I've been working.  David Randolph is amazing.  He's been doing a lot of projects.  We're doing more, you know, basically episode concentrated on a single project,  going in depth on how to do something.  And that would be system.org, S Y S T M dot org.  And then there's another show I'm going to be working on.  But it looks like we're going to have to get a fresh new name for it.  Can you describe what it's going to be about anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be about, you know, using technology and not getting your ass kicked by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds good to me.  Hey, that's great news. I'm glad to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's not a huge surprise, but I'm glad to hear it instead of from the gossip columns to actually hear it here.  To actually hear it here first. Thank you, Patrick. That's great.  Congratulations. Bill McCrone is writing everywhere.  Where's the best place to find you, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm pretty sporadic these days, but I mean, you can just Google me or something.  But I guess my biggest project is the Wall Street Journal holiday gift guide, which is going to be an enormous undertaking a little later this year.  That sounds exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will that be on newsstands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll be in the Wall Street Journal.  It'll be in the Journal. Okay, good.  And I imagine it'll have an online component and all of that stuff. And, you know, it should be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's always Bill'sBest.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's the site that Ziff Davis froze 10 years ago, and I haven't been able to update it since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still got a Yahoo button on it. I love it. And mcrone.net, is that frozen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I don't have ever updated, but it's still out there.  It's not. Yeah.

And they have a similar show in Canada called To Protect and Serve.  Oh, I bet it's great.  And the show, the Canadian version, the Canadian version of the show, I swear to God, is nothing more than a Canadian cop that's usually walking a beat, poking a drunk with a stick saying, get up, get up, go home.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Go home. Go home now. Go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got a low speed chase going down Main Street.  It's the whole show.  Bad boys. Bad boys.  Maybe doing the twit.  All right. Doing the twit.  Maybe.
