But that for generic, just sort of going out and surfing the web, you really need  more screen than that, or you spend all your time pinching and zooming and  scrolling around. It's just not enough screen for content that isn't targeted  towards a small screen. So we've talked about that in relation to the Kindle

Transcript:  Fire for sure. Precisely. Yeah. Okay, coming up Wednesday, December 14th,  Apple will get its HTC patent ruling. Also on that day, T-Mobile and Nokia  holding a mystery event, and Judge Huvel will give her decision on the  Department of Justice's motion to stay the AT&T merger trial. We'll talk about  that in a little bit. RIM has their earnings. I'm sorry, the Judge Huvel  decision will be on Thursday, December 14th. That's the same day as RIM's  earnings. So there could be lots of bad news that day. Star Wars Galaxies,  the role-playing game set to close in advance of the new Star Wars The Old  Republic online game that will be launching soon. Friday, December 15th,  Bradley Manning goes on trial. The iPhone 4S launches in Brazil and Russia  and several other countries. And Saturday, December 16th, the PlayStation  Vita goes on sale in Japan. So that's some of the stuff coming up in the week  ahead that we'll be looking at on tech news today. Let's start off our  discussion here though with HP's decision to make webOS open source. This  was announced by Meg Whitman. And then she did a little kind of a road show  with Mark Andreessen going around to some of the major publications and  giving interviews. And as I understand it, they are going to let the community  help them determine what license it will be open sourced under. They will then  hand it over to an open source community that they will govern and they're going  to let the community help them figure out how to best govern it. And then they  will continue to do webOS hard. We'd like you to add this to the kernel.  Well, how does it govern open source? That's normal. You always have a go. I  mean, Linus Torvalds is the governing of. There's nothing unusual about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dictator for life. I think it's just BFD. You don't care, huh? No. I mean, does  anyone care? I mean, it's clear we need an alternative to iOS so that  there's a non Apple majority market leading alternative. But we have that  with Android and it's well established and it's there and there's a ton of  developers and a marketplace and so forth. And it looks to me like HP is  going to be abandoning this. They're not going to be putting a ton of money  behind it. And traditionally open source platforms that don't have some sort of  benefactor sort of wander off and just sputter and die. But how about something

Start time: 416.56
End time: 437.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's good? Yeah, that I know I'm going to piss off a lot of Android people, but  like Android is I mean, Android has a lot of things going for it, but it does  not have, you know, the clarity in terms of interface and and sense of design  that WebOS has. WebOS is really, really nice. But it's also had the advantage of

Start time: 437.42
End time: 451.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  having a single father. I guess the problem would be with WebOS is that as  soon as you open it up, everyone starts pulling it in different directions and  wanting to do their own their own surfaces on top of it, and it starts to  fragment the same way that Android does.

Start time: 452.34
End time: 471.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's a threat to any open source project. But I think that goes  back to what you said about the successful open source projects have had  a lot more take up and a lot broader situation and usually started as open  source projects. And I think that's that's what you were pointing out,  Patrick, is HP is trying to turn this into something that it has never been.  And that's that's a hard pill to swallow.

Start time: 472.00
End time: 490.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know the thing it got me is like the the pull quote from the Engadget article  WebOS is the only platform designed from the ground up to be mobile, cloud  connected and scalable, said HBCO Meg Whitman. And it's like, huh?  Yeah, you know, that's yeah. Only WebOS was designed to connect to the cloud and  scale and be.

Start time: 491.68
End time: 512.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Ryan, Ryan, I agree with you that it is a nicer platform today. And it would  be great if it happened. But it's just hard to see how something coming along  now has a chance to gain traction.  I mean, it's going to it's going to fragment the Android market further.  And what's it run on?  You know, an abandoned tablet at this point?

Start time: 512.54
End time: 577.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if it runs, you know, here's here's here's my counterpoint to that,  though. Your HTC or your Samsung or your any of these other guys who are primary  Android licensees.  Now, Google, who obviously makes Android, bought Motorola.  So it's pretty clear that the winds are shifting in, you know, first party  favorability direction.  And you're one of these guys, you don't have control of your OS.  You don't really have the ability to launch a phone with a full Google suite  without going through Google certification first, which is kind of a thing that not  a lot of people know is Google is not completely open with Android.  You actually have to go get certified with them if you want to launch with like  the YouTube app and Gmail app.  And WebOS actually presents an open source operating system that is many ways  superior, in my opinion, to Android.  But more importantly, because HP doesn't have any skin in the game on the hardware  side right now, there's no agenda attached to it.  So it's actually going to be a much better alternative for those who want to  actually go down that path, potentially for people like, you know, HTC and Samsung.  Samsung, if I was one of those guys, I would be looking very seriously webless  right now.

Start time: 578.14
End time: 635.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because HP, what they're doing here, I think is very smart.  I think what they realized was we can't make a profit putting this out anymore.  We can't sell it to anyone anymore.  But it would just there's there's we've got too much tied into it to just  ditch it altogether.  Let's this is our last chance.  It's basically the only choice they have.  We have a bunch of people out there using HP touchpads for ninety nine dollars.  We got some more refurbs on sale this weekend.  Let's see if that's enough of a platform out there to make this work.  And if and she Meg Whitman said we're going to give it four to five years and very  wisely, they're setting it up exactly the way the open source community would ask  that it be set up with a lot of input, a lot of a lot of collaboration and and  truly open source so that they're not doing what Google does where they're like,  well, this version of Android not going to be open source.  Next version. Oh, this one is open sourced and you just never know.  This is a truly open source project.  Whether that changes anything that you're saying, Steven, in the end, though, I  don't know.

Start time: 636.80
End time: 654.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I get why people are skeptical.  I really do.  But it's like here are the alternatives.  Either they can completely kill and abandon WebOS, which obviously I think most  people don't want to see, or they can go on and continue failing at it, doing what  they've been doing.  I think this is actually among the better decisions that they could have made here.

Start time: 656.26
End time: 661.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't necessarily mean, Steve, that you're wrong.  I think it just means that's all they had left.

Start time: 662.16
End time: 694.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I do, I do think Ryan makes a good point about, you know, about the idea  being that, you know, for for another vendor that is willing to to, you know, pave  their own way, essentially, and wants real control over a platform where they're chafing  a little bit with Android and Google, you know, here's something that is mature and  is, I mean, it's a beautiful piece of work.  It's it's really a lot of work went into it.  It's it's worth not throwing away.  So I'd certainly agree with that.

Start time: 695.28
End time: 784.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell you what else is a piece of work.  AT&T and T-Mobile's attempt to merge.  If you've missed previously on AT&T T-Mobile merger, AT&T decided that they, you  know, because the DOJ had said they weren't going to be approved and they pretty much  knew the FCC was going to say the same thing.  They pulled their application from the FCC on Thanksgiving morning in the United States,  hoping that that would mean that the FCC report wouldn't come out.  The FCC said, we're not playing that game.  Put the report out anyway.  AT&T got very upset and said, well, you know, that was that was an ill move.  You know, we're reconsidering our options.  We're just waiting until the Department of Justice is done looking over their suit  against us. Now, the Department of Justice this week told a federal judge that the  government plans to ask the court for a motion to stay or even withdraw the trial,  partly because AT&T withdrew their application from the FCC.  And they say, point, yeah, they're going to have to resubmit that application if they  win. And that could mean that they change it.  And that could mean that all of this is for nothing.  And Judge Huvel seemed to agree.  She said the landscape has changed.  You could change the deal in a month and everybody's time will be wasted.  First, AT&T says they're not playing games.  But yes, they are.  This this Tuesday is the deadline for the department to file its motion and the judge  will render a decision on December 15th.

Start time: 786.34
End time: 791.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not entirely for nothing, though, right?  Didn't AT&T pay four billion dollars on this as a kill fee?

Start time: 791.98
End time: 816.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they will. Yeah, it's four billion.  Well, it's some combination of cash and spectrum and whatnot that's worth four billion  dollars. But if this doesn't go through, you know, I mean, I guess a stay might be the  best thing AT&T could get right now rather than a kill.  Right. Because then that puts off them having to pay the money.  Yeah. OK, first of all, go ahead.  I know you're biting your chomping.

Start time: 816.46
End time: 870.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just the whole it's just, you know, the if AT&T has probably more lawyers than  anybody on the planet. Right. But we're not playing some strategic game.  One of the telcos attorneys argued before the judge was the line and Arstotzka.  And it's of course AT&T is playing strategic game.  All AT&T does is play strategic games.  AT&T and Verizon spent 11 million dollars lobbying on the Hill last year.  There's the idea that AT&T is not playing strategic games is hysterical.  They're they're they want what they want.  They're like the AT&T says the FCC report is like full of lies and addictive and wrong  and hurt their feelings.  You know, the the this the whole it's just a mess.  The whole mergers and the idea for a merger was a bad idea.  The idea that taking T-Mobile out of the equation in the United States wasn't going to  impact the market is ridiculous.  But the mobile market's a mess.

Start time: 871.10
End time: 877.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I mean, the big problem here is T-Mobile dies no matter what.  Right. I have a feeling.  I mean, Steve, what do you think?

Start time: 878.06
End time: 894.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree.  And I do. I'm really made uncomfortable by the idea of AT&T getting any more powerful  than they already are.  I mean, they have a phenomenal amount of power.  And this is what makes everyone so uncomfortable about the idea of giving them more.

Start time: 896.06
End time: 966.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to I'm going to be the lone dissenter on this one.  I think I've said this before.  I actually don't really particularly mind the idea of AT&T acquiring T-Mobile.  Not that it really matters a ton right now, because that's clearly not how this is  looking like it's going to wind up. But I mean, part of the problem is in America,  we have this really messed up system with how we dole out wireless spectrum.  It goes on the market very frequently.  You basically have to rent it from the FCC for an insane amount of cash.  It's very hard to get wireless spectrum, the same spectrum that's shared by other countries  in terms of the cellular bands.  So basically what winds up is we have this massive, massive country that can't roll out  enough wireless spectrum and infrastructure to support the demand.  And you see this with AT&T, how their service sucks in so many places.  So, you know, one way to get around that is to acquire another carrier.  Sprint did this with Nextel. Verizon has done this with Alital and a number of other carriers.  So it makes sense. I mean, you know, if I was AT&T, I would be looking for other ways  to get spectrum. I don't really think that they care about the customers.  I mean, it's not like T-Mobile brings a huge enough customer base to really make a massive  difference for them.

Start time: 966.22
End time: 984.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, so if we're assuming that T-Mobile's absence from the market, we're assuming T-Mobile  dies if the deal doesn't go through.  If the deal does go through, T-Mobile can no longer be a disruptive influence because  they'll be under AT&T and they'll be doing whatever AT&T wants them to do.  So if T-Mobile dies, does the spectrum then go up for auction?

Start time: 985.46
End time: 1039.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if AT&T buys T-Mobile, then AT&T gets the spectrum.  It's an asset, they can sell it.  If AT&T doesn't buy T-Mobile, there's a chance that Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile,  USA, carves up T-Mobile and sells it off in pieces.  And one of the things they would do in that case, it is speculated, is that that spectrum  would then get sold to AT&T, which is really all AT&T needs.  Or Verizon.  Well, it could go to anybody.  But the best guess is that AT&T gets it and then that helps them not having to pay that  $4 billion fee because they renegotiate a deal and get away from having to pay that  penalty.  And that's really all AT&T wants.  To me, isn't that the way it should end up?  Is that AT&T gets what it needs, which is the spectrum, but they don't get T-Mobile.  T-Mobile is going to go away anyway.  So it gets divided up to maybe some other people that need it.  The problem is, we're going to lose a competitor in the marketplace.  Right.

Start time: 1041.10
End time: 1057.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, it's fourth place by like a huge margin, really a quote unquote competitor.  Aren't they third place?  They're not moving the needle and they're hemorrhaging customers quarter after quarter.  I'm not saying that the marketplace isn't better with competition.  It clearly is.  But T-Mobile is losing.  That's just the reality.  They've been losing for a long time.

Start time: 1059.18
End time: 1201.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard Sprint listed as fourth place and T-Mobile is third, but I'm not sure how they  rank that.  There's lots of different ways to slice it.  But you're right.  I mean, T-Mobile, obviously Deutsche Telekom doesn't think T-Mobile USA can make a go  of it.  So in some ways it's like, well, then they should die.  The problem is, do we see anyone else in the wings ready to come in and take their place?  And that was one of the things the FCC said when they released their report on this was  AT&T points to players like Leap and MetroPCS as competitors, and they're not.  They're very, very much small regional players that don't threaten AT&T or disrupt the market  at all.  I think that actually leads very nicely into our next story.  Light Squared is an adventure.  I've talked about it on Twitter before.  We talked about it on TNT quite a bit.  They would like to operate a satellite-based LTE network and wholesale it out.  I think I read somewhere today $7 per gigabyte per second is the wholesale rate.  They've got deals with lots of different companies, including Dish Network, Sprint, and many others.  And so they're like, look, everybody else says we don't want to be the dumb pipe.  We'll be the dumb pipe, and we'll collect the fees and make the money and roll this out.  It sounds great because all of a sudden now we have a platform for lots of different competitors  to come on board.  But the GPS folks have been very upset about this because Light Squared's spectrum is right  next to GPS, and it bleeds over into the...  The GPS bleeds over into the spectrum that Light Squared holds.  Light Squared has proposed we will only use half of our spectrum to stay away while you  adjust your GPS devices to not bleed over into our spectrum.  We'll try to play ball.  And they've been waiting for the FCC to approve them.  The FCC is waiting for an evaluation of whether this plan will work or not.  And today Engadget reports that a leaked draft of the government's assessment of this shows  that Light Squared's network would interfere with, quote, the great majority of GPS receivers.  Now, this is a leaked draft.  Of course, Light Squared's incensed that this got leaked out.  And it also is not the final decision because it has to be reviewed before it's published.  Now you were erring.  Yeah.

Start time: 1203.66
End time: 1312.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first time I read about this in Texel, I was reading about this months and months  ago and I was like, oh my God, Light Squared, who is this foolish company that's going to  crush GPS?  And I think you start learning more about it and there's a tremendous amount of he said,  she said going on here.  One of the things Light Squared maintains is there's this kind of like 14 different angles  here and so if you want to see a really horrifying group of people to be fighting against, Light  Squared is fighting against effectively save our GPS dot org, United to Protect GPS and  National Utility for more than 30 years.  And the group of people under Save Our GPS, the coalition members list is insane, like  Aeronautical Repair Station Association, AG Leader, AGCO, like half the agricultural  businesses, the aircraft owner and pilots association.  I'll just randomly flick through here.  Garmin, the fire department of New York, FedEx, the farm equipment manufacturer's association,  the experimental aircraft association, Magellan GPS, Lycageo systems.  So what what's going on here is the spectrum.  It's an incredible list of companies that are behind Save Our GPS and against Light  Squared.  The spectrum that Light Squared purchased that was approved by the FCC was originally  supposed to be used for satellites.  The Light Squared's deals are going to be they want to deploy a zillion ground state  base stations in the United States.  20,000 ground stations, right?  Yeah.  And so the end result is that the signals coming from here rather than up there, which  could overlap with some of the GPS devices.  Light Squared basically says GPS devices, GPS manufacturers have kind of cheaped out  of the construction of their devices and that they should not be getting interfered with.  You know, I think what they're going to say is that the test was kind of a worst case  scenario.

Start time: 1313.18
End time: 1326.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Light Squared is saying that the power levels were 15 times higher than those that  would be used in practice and that it has to still be reviewed by the NTIA before we  can be sure whether this test actually has the results that it sounds like it had.

Start time: 1326.90
End time: 1390.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Essentially, what was happening was that the GPS devices, the GPS receivers were designed  to be very inexpensive and they took advantage without really intending to of the fact that  the adjacent bandwidth, the adjacent spectrum was empty.  And so they were able to make less sensitive, less finely tuned receivers that were able  to also to operate at lower power, which is good for battery consumption, which we care  about in our GPS devices.  So they're just not, they don't have the filters in them and the technology to reject the immediately  adjacent spectrum.  And so that's the problem is that suddenly someone now wants to use that spectrum.  But all the receivers that are out there, like half a million or not, yeah, no, more  than half a million.  All of them are susceptible to the use of this adjacent spectrum that LightSquare now  wants to put a 4G LTE network up on.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, I was going to say, well, not to put too fine a point on it, but I mean, you want to  talk about how the FCC spectrum allocation system is totally messed up.  I mean, it's like here by a bunch of spectrum.  Sorry, you can't really use it for anything because the Air Force is operating GPS on  a frequency that's going to be interfered by the spectrum that we sold you.  So this other government branch is negating you from using the spectrum that we sold you.  I mean, you think that they would just give them some other spectrum to use that wouldn't  be here.  Well, I mean, there's actually a lot of spectrum that could be reassigned and there's a ton  of legacy stuff, but it's just, it's messed up.

Start time: 1433.55
End time: 1444.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just, there's no way to kind of get around this mess we're in with the spectrum at this  point.  So these light square guys are going to probably take the fall for it.

Start time: 1444.86
End time: 1512.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really shrill debate that's going on as well because there are very legitimate  technical concerns from the GPS industry and light squared has provided some very sound  possible technical solutions.  We still don't know if their solution is adequate and we don't know if the GPS industry could  adjust to stay out of that spectrum.  But while you have legitimate GPS concerns, you also have a lot of industry getting in  on it on both sides and saying, well, wait a minute, if light squared comes along and  makes a balanced playing field, that hurts our business interests because right now,  we have a limited competition out there.  So we are going to get in behind the GPS industry and push them and make the, and turn this  into a political issue.  And you get light squared being discussed on partisan blogs and radio shows as if it's  a Republican Democrat issue.  It's been turned into a total political football when it's really just a very complex technical  issue that's at the heart of it.

Start time: 1514.26
End time: 1540.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And light squared has said that they would operate at the half of their allocation, which  is farthest away from GPS and that in that way, minimize the interference.  And apparently that brings down the percentage of devices which are sloppy enough that they're  still having an interference problem.  But to me, it sounds again, sort of like a half measure.  They really, I agree that they ought to just be moved somewhere else.

Transcript:  Light squared spectrum should just be say, it's like, we're sorry, we didn't realize  that the existing infrastructure of GPS had been designed to take, to sort of assume that  the adjacent spectrum was unused.  Now we realize that's the case, sorry, we're going to leave it unused because that's the  best solution for GPS and light squared, you can go have this chunk over here that'll do  the job for you.

Start time: 1571.86
End time: 1577.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, light squared has been very smart at striking a lot of deals with a lot  of companies to get in on their side and help them fight this.  So I think this is far from over.  And I think this leak is something that is far from definitive about whether light squared  has been found to interfere and in what way.  Don't forget the NTAIA has to make that final determination about how many devices passed  or failed rather than the people who made this document that got leaked out.  They may still find out exactly the same thing.  They may find out, yeah, this is really bad.  And then light squared is going to be up the creek.

Transcript:  Apparently it's possible to do a little bit of retrofitting of antennas on the GPS receivers  to add sort of a physical filter at the antenna so that it solves the problem, you know, upstream  in the receiver too.

End time: 1676.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a problem.  Yeah, there may be in theory, there may be a way to retrofit the devices.  But the reality is that one of the things light squared says is like basically they  built the, you know, one of their VPs actually, there's kind of a great story up on light  squared where they're basically like, yeah, the GPS industry bled all over the spectrum.  They didn't pay attention.  They didn't put in inexpensive parts that would help filter signal interference and  we're getting screwed for it.  But yeah, I can't imagine somebody like, you know, disassembling the GPS system on a tractor  or a harvester or something.  There's just, there's just, it's a mess.

Start time: 1677.43
End time: 1806.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  A light squared has even volunteered to pay for part of the rollout of such a thing, but  nobody else is jumping up to pay the rest of the bill.  So yeah, the jury is still out on that.  Let's take a quick break and thank one of our sponsors of this week in tech, GoToMeeting.  This time of year, holidays, bad weather, sick days.

So Microsoft had a big week.  They unveiled their new Xbox dashboard and their new Windows 8 App Store.  Let's actually start with the Xbox dashboard.  They released the embargo on Monday.  Everybody had their reviews out.  Everybody was talking it up.  And then Tuesday morning it didn't come.  And Tuesday afternoon it still wasn't here.  And then finally, or late afternoon, early evening, depending on where you lived, it  finally started rolling out.  You're an Xbox user, right, Ryan?  Oh yeah.  What do you think of the improvements here?  It's more Metro style, a lot more options for search and video.  They improved the way Kinect works.  Is it as promised?

Start time: 1808.26
End time: 1863.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So far I think so, yeah.  And many of the common features are more quickly accessible.  And the new Beacon system is actually really nice.  What's the Beacon system?  I haven't seen anything like it.  You can basically set up to automatically alert people on your Xbox friends list that  you would like to play a certain game.  So it used to kind of be, and I think with PlayStation it's this way as well.  If you want to play a game with somebody, you have to see them come on.  And then you have to see them start playing a certain game or not.  But it helps if they are.  And then you would send them an invite.  And then they would come in and play the game with you.  So with the new Beacon system, you would just say, tell all my friends automatically,  hey, come play this game with me at all times.  So when you come online, instead of them just seeing, hey, Ryan just logged on, it says,  Ryan logged on and he would really like to play Modern Warfare 3 with you or Battlefield  3 with you.

Transcript:  Good.  That's cool.  And then there's also the Windows Phone integration.  If you're a Windows Phone user, you can start and you can play some games using the Windows  Phone as a controller, start some games on the Windows Phone, finish them on the Xbox.  A lot of video stuff in here too.  In some situations around the world, you'll be able to watch television shows on the Xbox  that you get over cable.  It varies depending on where you are.  And it's rolling out from different services at different times.  Here in the US, I know Comcast On Demand is coming later and Verizon Fios subscribers  will get 28 channels.  I think they finally got them later this week or in the late part of the week.  But have you tried any of the video stuff?  Supposedly, if you say connect, Bing, find the show, it'll just tell you all the different  places that it's available.

Start time: 1921.24
End time: 1956.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't yet because I have Comcast and I'm dying for the HBO Go support.  I really can't wait to add that.  I think that's coming in the spring.  But yeah, I mean, it's funny because if you actually go back in time, this was part of  Microsoft's vision for Xbox for a very, very long time.  I mean, they had U-verse support a really long time ago.  In certain parts of Europe, they had IPTV streaming to the Xbox for a while, I think  through Sky.  So this is something they wanted to do for a zillion years.  And I'm glad they're finally kind of getting to it, even if it wasn't exactly the way they  originally intended.

Start time: 1956.92

Transcript:  Now, there's also a report today that Microsoft is seeking executives to develop original  Xbox programming.  They actually do a little bit of that already.  That's one of the things Major Nelson does there.  But Bloomberg reports the company is seeking an executive, former NBC executives, with  the idea of making short film pilots or actually going beyond making short film pilots.  They previously have done that with Peter Safran.  So this is all part of what seems to be Microsoft's strategy to become that box, that one way  that we combine all of our video watching on our television, whether it comes over the  Internet or over cable or elsewhere, into one place.

Start time: 1998.72
End time: 2005.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a big difference between Google and Apple.  I don't think they...  I don't know.  It's interesting to watch like YouTube starting to develop channels.  The idea of Xbox being like, okay, we're going to develop a really lucrative series to draw  people into.  The truth is, Apple TV, it's all about the content deals and making it three clicks,  if not one click from when you pick up the remote control to watch your program.  I don't really understand why Microsoft would want to create original programming.  It just seems like getting the content onto the machine and into people's houses.  Somebody comes up with a hardware box that will allow me to watch, legally watch HBO  content without having to be subscribed to a satellite or cable.  I'll pay 25 bucks a month to watch HBO without having to have cable.  But nobody seems to be able to make that deal.  HBO is not interested in it.

Start time: 2057.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they changed their tune.  They'll change it again.  Yeah.  I think the idea of having original programming is, we want to be that box, and that's one  of the ways we get a leg up, is if we can say, we provide Netflix and all of their original  programming that they're going to be doing.  We provide a Zoom marketplace so you can buy shows.  We provide the ability to get crackle and all of these other services, and we integrate  with your cable television provider, and we provide shows you can't get anywhere else  except on the Xbox.  Right.  That's everybody's theory anyway.

Start time: 2110.84
End time: 2117.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Actually, you know what?  We've got to set that up.  This isn't the first time beyond Major Nelson that they've done this.  It just seems like they're stepping up their salary requirement, essentially, by approaching  NBC executives, because that's good quality stuff with the Gild on there already.

Transcript:  Now, Microsoft also made a big deal about their new Windows 8 app store that will be  coming with the beta of Windows 8, which by the way, we're going to get a beta of Windows  8 in February.  The app store is going to be like the Mac app store.  You'll use it on the desktop or tablet with the Metro interface.  You'll be able to buy all the Metro style apps directly from the store and install them.  They'll have desktop style apps available that you'll then click through and go to the  vendor of those particular apps.  The apps will range in price from $1.49 up to $999.  Now, remember, the reason there's not a lot of 99 cent apps, this is Windows 8, which  is a desktop system, although it's going to be on tablets.  It seems weird that they've got a minimum price at $1.49.  All versions of the apps will be available so that you can just try an app for 30 days  and then decide to buy it later if you want.  Devs will be able to use app certification kit.  This is part of their big pitch, which is you'll actually know before you submit the  app whether it's likely to be approved and will tell you where the app is in the approval  process.  That's been one of the complaints about Apple.  With Apple.  Yeah.  Plus the payment structure.  Microsoft takes 30 percent.  Dev gets 70 percent.  That's pretty standard.  However, it will...

Start time: 2249.70
End time: 2271.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really clever.  That and the $1.49 actually.  The $1.49 is because Apple is at 99 cents.  So by making the minimum price higher, it's going to increase revenue, or at least I guess  that's the assumption.  At very least, it means it makes that... it provides the impression that that application  is more valuable on that platform.  And the assumption is nobody's...  This is really, really clever stuff.

Start time: 2271.50

I don't know if there's anything else to say about this until we actually get a chance  to see it, but it is pretty clever of Microsoft to address on the developer side many of the  complaints of app stores.

Start time: 2340.79
End time: 2352.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

But I don't think anybody who currently runs Windows 7 is expected to upgrade to Windows  Windows 8 is there so they can sell a lot of tablets and still have a new operating  system.

Start time: 2448.68
End time: 2461.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But Apple also has the advantage of basically drawing a line in the sand every three years  and ignoring all of their older legacy hardware at that point, which is not an advantage that  Microsoft has ever held in the market.

Start time: 2462.62

Start time: 2467.68
End time: 2486.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  What I mean is Apple is such an unusual situation where basically compared to Windows, Apple  just ignores all of its older hardware every three years.  It just walks away from it.  And then eventually people buy hardware to replace their old hardware so they can have  applications that can run or software updates and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the best moment I've ever had in an Apple press event.  And maybe in the last Apple press event I got the chance to attend, but there was literally  like that announcement came out and it was like 300 people had been sucker punched because  there's just like...  Because they had all been fed the rumor for so long, the lies, the completely bogus benchmarks  that PowerPC was kicking Intel's ass and all of a sudden they were being told that  Intel was the future.  It was incredible to be in that press event and just to listen to...  It was literally like a bunch of people had been sucker punched in the gut and then dead  silence.  And then you watch Steve ramp up the reality distortion field to maximum because he had  to sell that entire room on the future of the platform.  It was really fun to watch.

Transcript:  I wonder if Microsoft is at all worried about losing their dominance on the operating system  platform though.  I mean, they don't have to sell a ton of new Windows 8s to maintain dominance and that's  really what they want.  And then they can continue to try to get enterprises to move along to whatever, whether it's Windows  7 or Windows 8.  I think Windows 8 is a ploy to say, we need to eat into that tablet market.  That's what we're actually worried about.  We'll maintain our dominance on the desktop, but we need to be on more tablets.

And look what's happening with mobile.  Everyone's now talking about that's where the...  Ultimately, that's where the future lies is in mobile stuff and Microsoft is still  nowhere there.

When you get up to the point where there's like 3 billion, 4 billion people using the  internet, 5 billion people using the internet, most of those people will be on a mobile platform.  Most of them will be a relatively inexpensive cell phone or maybe if they're lucky, a tablet.  And yeah, I think Microsoft, whoever has like the sort of 50 year event horizon hat on it,  Microsoft has to be freaking out about just their complete lack of a presence in that  market other than Bing.

Transcript:  It's so difficult to right click on a tablet.  All those web OS tablets will be dominating.  Let's change gears and go to a story about an Oregon judge handling the case of a woman  named Crystal Cox from Montana.  She started several websites accusing Obsidian Finance Corp and its principal Kevin Padrake  of misconduct in their handling of a bankruptcy case.  And the URLs were rather provocative.  ObsidianFinanceSucks.com, BankruptcyTrustyFraud.com, OregonScheister.com.  In January, Padrake filed a defamation lawsuit against Cox, charging that her accusations  were false and asking for $10 million.  The court found Cox guilty of defamation, awarded Padrake $2.5 million.  Oregon law requires victims of defamation by journalists to first request a retraction,  and Padrake had not done so.  So Cox asked the judge to set aside the verdict, claiming she was an investigative blogger.  This week, Judge Marco Hernandez disagreed, said although the defendant is a self-proclaimed  investigative blogger and defines herself as media, the record fails to show that she  is affiliated with any newspaper, magazine, periodical, book, pamphlet, news service,  wire service, news, or feature syndicate, broadcast station, or network, or cable television  system.  He's basically quoting how Oregon law defines what a journalist is and says thus she's not  entitled to the protections of the shield law in Oregon.

Start time: 2800.44
End time: 2837.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, there's, I wish I could find it.  There's a really good write-up on this.  The blogger in question, like, one of the, the article I'm thinking of is basically like,  blogosphere, you may not want to claim this person as one of your own because this is  somebody who is running a large group of sites to promote SEO, which isn't that particularly  onerous, had maybe offered, you know, basically this guy, this, nobody can quite figure out  why or the, the, the, the writing is a little sort of over the top, like frantic in the  sort of, gosh, I'm glad this person doesn't live next to my house kind of way.

Start time: 2861.12
End time: 2879.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I will agree that there's an issue with Oregon law because Oregon law, current  Oregon law needs to be corrected because, you know, if, under Oregon law, if you're  not affiliated with a newspaper, magazine, periodical, book, pamphlet, news service,  wire service, news or feature, syndicate, broadcast station or network or cable television  system, you are not a journalist.  Well actually, Oregon law doesn't read a street.  What is a periodical?

Start time: 2880.56
End time: 2887.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Oregon law says such as, and then list all these things.  So there is wiggle room in there.  The judge just didn't choose to use it.

Start time: 2887.44
End time: 2944.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that said, what this particular individual has been doing is, what Cox has been doing,  I would not consider journalism, it's ranting.  And it's ranting to a purpose which may or may not have been to receive monies from them.  Because this guy, this guy, Patrick, who's run an obsidian, and I don't know whether,  maybe is scumbaggy, a financial company, I have no idea.  They may be wonderful people, but they were in receivership.  Patrick was assigned to basically run it to deal with the bankruptcy things.  And he's like, you can no longer search in my name without having the umpteen websites  this woman created coming up top of the fold under my name and my online reputation is  permanently ruined.  There's like 1900 websites Cox has created to write about people and companies.  You could argue that this is a reputation destroying network that has been very solidly  engineered under SEO to be able to hammer on targets.

Start time: 2945.02
End time: 2962.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there's several valid questions about what laws would kick in, even if she  did qualify for the shield law.  She may have still been found guilty.  It's just interesting to see all the headlines saying bloggers aren't journalists according  to Oregon.  And I'm not sure that that's actually what the judge is saying.

Transcript:  And bloggers don't, at least in my experience, the bloggers that I associate with don't  send out, and this is the Forbes, the email that Forbes pointed to, don't send out investigative  bloggers don't send out emails that say, I want to let you at Obsidian Finance know  that I am now offering PR services and search engine management services starting at $2,500  a month to promote law firms, finance companies, and to protect online reputation and promote  businesses.

Transcript:  I think one interesting thing to point out though that doesn't get mentioned a lot is  that shield law does not mean that you can say anything.  Right.  It doesn't mean that you as a journalist or a blogger or any person can just defame companies  willy-nilly.  If I write for the New York Times and I write something defamatory about a company or an  individual I'm still held accountable for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me that's what these stories are all about.  This isn't the first time a court has ruled about a blogger and whether they were a journalist  or not.  It doesn't matter whether they were using a blogging platform or not.  The question is, is the person in question a journalist?  I think it's fairly clear from some of the things we've said that this person was not  acting as an investigatory journalist no matter what she said.

Start time: 3061.50
End time: 3072.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they sure as hell don't want to be nailed to the floor for saying nasty things about  somebody else that they can't prove are true.  Which is essentially defamation.  If you can't prove it's true and you say something nasty about somebody it's pretty much defamation.

Where is I.S. anyway?  He's on tech news today.  Later this week.  We actually talked about this then too.  But yeah it's an interesting question.  But I think I wanted to bring it up simply because so many headlines make it look like  something that it isn't.

Start time: 3095.22
End time: 3124.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I was very confused by the CNET headline on this which makes it, you know,  it paints it very much in like this person is a blogger and like it's been ruled that  this blogger does not count as a journalist and therefore it is not applied to Shilva.  And it doesn't really go into any of the actual important details which are like this person  is clearly very crazy seeming and is doing things that are clearly very untoward seeming.  And that journalist blogger or otherwise I don't think that this person is going to be  getting very many protections of any kind.

This has been reported quite a bit that their Google deal is apparently.  We don't know this for certain but the odds are from the smart people out there talking  about it that it's up at the end of the year and it may not be being renewed.  Steve you brought this to our attention.

Start time: 3362.32
End time: 3377.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah and maybe you guys have more backstory on this than I do because I didn't realize  that Google was providing so much financing to Mozilla historically and that's apparently  what the concern is that's going to end.  So what do you guys know about that?

End time: 3418.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I was going to say like you know e-week 12 hours ago Google Mozilla still negotiating  search toolbar.  I mean we're talking about it before the show is you know I don't see why maybe Bing or  somebody wouldn't step in to finance to finance Mozilla.  It's kind of funny right.  If you think of Google providing the majority of the funding for Mozilla their browser competitor  with Chrome.  I think it's interesting to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah well it's like Google yeah the search deal the e-week article says Google accounted  for roughly 100 million of Mozilla's 123 million in sales in 2010 like 85 percent of their  financing.  I mean I get to admit I started using Firefox again recently.  The number of updates in Firefox are driving me insane.  I think they are probably driving corporate users even more insane assuming there are  any enterprise users left.  I think it'll be interesting to see whether or not Google renews it and if Microsoft steps  in.

Start time: 3458.24
End time: 3461.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right that's the guess right is that Bing would provide it.  Go ahead Ryan.

Start time: 3462.48
End time: 3529.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So part of my understanding in terms of how Mozilla is structured is that because we know  Mozilla is being a nonprofit but that's only actually part of their way that they're structured  because Google represents so much of their revenue they can't be a nonprofit.  I guess nonprofits have to have to legally be with like 503 C compliant or five of that  camera it's 50 C 3 or five or three C whatever it is.  They have to be they have to have more varied sources of income.  And since Google represents like not even the majority but like almost you know basically  a hundred percent of their their income they can't be a nonprofit.  So they have their corporate wing which then donates to the nonprofit side.  I think that they have in some ways you know maybe more money than they know what to do  with.  I don't I don't really know what what the haggling is all about.  But yeah I mean I think of course Google I mean of course Bing is going to buy you know  the the slot if they can get it.  It's like it's not uncertain what's uncertain about that.  Of course they're going to buy it.  Who else has the kind that kind of money to throw at this thing and is desperate for exposure  to that audience.  Of course Bing is going to do it.

Start time: 3530.34
End time: 3549.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I don't think they would blink an eye although everyone assumes like yeah but they  make Internet Explorer and as we mentioned IE9 has made Internet Explorer you know stop  declining so fast if not bounce back a little bit.  Why would they fund the competition.  But it's the same thing.  They want market share.  And if being the default on Firefox brings them more market share they do it.

Start time: 3550.22
End time: 3559.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I think it must be that the calculation Google is doing is deciding what it's worth  them not to have Microsoft put Bing on Firefox.

Start time: 3560.80
End time: 3593.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I mean it's for Google it's also a pretty easy you know thing to do.  They can track very very easily how much money they're making from Firefox.  Right.  So they can see OK yeah we're actually you know we're turning profit on this.  Everybody wins.  There must be something else going on in terms of those negotiations.  But I mean IE is you know it's a fine business for Microsoft and everything.  But I don't think that IE is you know has the potential to make the money the way the  Bing does.  And I don't think that anybody at Microsoft would say IE should should you know pose a  significant threat to Bing being able to do a deal like that.

Start time: 3594.04
End time: 3608.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now do you think it would be the other way that Mozilla is toying with switching to Bing  and Google is being dragged over the coals in negotiations.  Google told E-Week we don't disclose specific terms of business arrangements we can confirm  that we still have an agreement with Mozilla.

Start time: 3609.36
End time: 3631.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope so.  I really hope that this is Mozilla actually you know pushing a harder negotiation on Google  because I think it's just been kind of a given for a while.  I mean for all we know Bing came to them six months ago and said hey when this deal is  up we'd really love to get in for 2012 and forward.  And then Mozilla went you know back to back to Google and tried to get them to up their  their annual commitment.

Transcript:  Now there's a there's another story I actually want to get Steve's opinion on this.  I just I just discovered this story just the second Steve.  I'm taking you a slightly bit unawares.  Did you get a chance to look at the AccuVant study that's going around about browser.  Good.  OK.

Start time: 3646.52
End time: 3651.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll see a lot of headlines saying Chrome is the most secure browser AccuVant study  released Friday ranked Chrome IE and then Firefox in that order as the the security  of the browsers.  They said that Firefox rated four of the seven security features tested in Firefox either  unimplemented or ineffective.  But as you say AccuVant was funded by Google so that that cast a bit of a shadow over this.  I switched back to Firefox recently Steve for a short period of time and and was enjoying  it.  But the tab management just this past week got so horrible because I have to have like  40 tabs open when I'm preparing for tech news today.  And it was it was fine at first with the new version but then now it's so slow I had to  be waiting 10 15 seconds for a tab to move where I wanted it to move that I went back  to Chrome because the tab management is so good.  But you know what I feel more secure in Firefox because I can run things like not not script  or I have to run not script on Chrome but I can run no script on Firefox.  That's why I wanted to get your opinion on this.  Do you think that Chrome is getting more secure.

Start time: 3720.80
End time: 3833.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually agree with the conclusions which were largely agree with the conclusions which  were reached and I carefully read Mozilla's response to this where I thought that they  would mount a good defense and that their defense was pretty weak.  They were saying well I mean they sort of agreed with with with the result of this study.  And I really do believe that that Chrome's underlying architecture is stronger than  Mozilla's. The point that's been made that I think is the best is that that Google had  the advantage that you always have when you're when you're the last person to come along  of looking at the mistakes that I made and looking at the mistakes that Firefox had made  or and mistakes is too strong a word.  But you know but learning from those who went before you precisely.  So so being the most recently the most recently initiated browser they were able to say OK  what do we really care about in terms of like making a strong competitor and how do we want  to fundamentally architect the the browser's operation.  And so I mean there really is a strong sandbox in Chrome that is missing completely from  Firefox and it really does provide value.  Also I think that they've got this this this complete tab isolation working much better in  Chrome than in Firefox.  And I mean we're we're a ways away from the era which we'll all remember where one tab  could like lock up the entire browser.  You really don't see that that that much but it cannot happen in in Chrome and it's still  possible as you just said like something can get kind of sticky and gunky in Firefox that does  sort of bring the whole browser down.

Transcript:  Yeah.  You know the things that Google actually does that I really appreciate as well is they've kind of I  mean I know it's slightly for publicity but it actually does work and that is they put a bounty on  security issues in Chrome.  So you surface a security issue of any kind in Chrome and I think it's of like different classes of  severity.  They'll give you a different amount of money.  And so people are collecting donkeys.  I think it's like they go up to like three or four thousand dollars where if you find like a real big  flaw in Chrome they not only want you to get out there and like show them whereas most companies kind of  like they're like tell us but you know maybe we'll do something about it maybe we won't.  They want you to like tell them they're going to fix it quickly and they'll pay you for it.  And I mean there's certainly like I said there's PR value in that from like having the perception of  security but I actually think that it helps.  I mean it really incentivizes people to make them help them become more secure.

Usually it's the Department of Homeland Security through ICE immigration and customs enforcement  seizing domain names and putting up that famous page that says this is you know has been seized by ICE.  It was a criminal investigation and the website is gone.  DeJazz1.com was seized on November 26 2010 as part of a seizure of 81 sites.  They made a big deal about how they were preventing copyright infringement.  But DeJazz1 shared some emails with New York Times shortly thereafter saying look we had  permission to host these tracks.  We have the emails from the record company agents saying you can host this track on your website.  ICE filed court documents but they filed them under seal so nobody could see what the  documents were and they kept extending.  They kept asking for extensions and those were under seal so you couldn't find out why they were  acting asking for extensions.  And then earlier this week DeJazz1 got its domain name back.  No explanation.  They dropped the case and everything still was under seal.  So we still don't know.

Basically yeah two of the staffers that wrote Protect IP and SOPA are now working with one  went to the MPAA and one went to the NNPA which is music publishers and songwriters where  she'll be chiefly as in the Capitol Hill.  The other one went to the MPAA where she'll be the director of government relations.  You know so this is this is this is not exactly a new thing in on Capitol Hill.  It's just been in cases where underlings have inserted single lines to the request of a  company into a bill you know like a 13000 page finance bill they insert a line that a company wants in there.

Transcript:  And so you know so this is you know I you know provision three was accidentally blanked off the  internet by a security company that was working that mistook us for a for a BitTorrent hosting site.  Senator Wyden is one of the senators from Oregon is basically pointing a sharp stick at DHS.  And wanting to know exactly how some of these sites ended up in operation in our sites.  I understand what the Department of Homeland Security is doing in some cases they're taking down websites that are  hosting fraudulent goods.  The last round included a number of BitTorrent hosting sites or tracking sites.  But he's basically the senators basically saying you know administration will be seeing I expect the administration  will be receiving a series of Freedom of Information Act requests from our office that the senator will have very  pointed questions regarding how the administration chooses to target the sites that it does.  Because it's it's it's really sad this guy's website got wiped off the internet for a year.  No explanation.  No it was a year.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.

So we're seeing that in action with this.  No there was no due process here and there is no explanation or or or or or method of remedy for the Jazz 1 for having  their domain name seized apparently without cause for a year.  Yeah.

End time: 4222.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in some cases it may not even be that somebody is acting bad.  I mean it's it's it's it's unfortunate that the it's unfortunate basically that that the the the MPA and other  organizations have so much power on Capitol Hill.  Yes.  It's like look if there's scumbags great use due process take them out.  You know there's a reason these these checks and balances are put in place in the legal system.

Transcript:  There there is an argument to be made that with the Internet there are so many bad actors that it is difficult to use  the old fashioned brick and mortar process to track them all down because in an infinitely replicable universe there  can be thousands of them.  So isn't there a way to make it more efficient.  I think we just the way to make it more efficient in my opinion is not to get rid of due process.  But I get the I get that there's an issue here on the side of an of enforcing the law.

Transcript:  I think to your point Tom in a universe where everything on the Internet is infinitely replicatable taking sites down is  meaningless anyway.  You have to actually go after the bad actors.  There are a lot of bad actors and they're doing bad things.  You have to go after the people who are actually doing that taking a site offline is not really going to help anyone.  You can just put up another site.  Not a big deal.  And I mean this is also like a really minor like in the grand scheme if it was copyright infringement.  I mean is that really that big of a deal.

Transcript:  Right.  I think Ryan you just nailed the question that no one ever deals with or doesn't deal with as often as they should in  these situations which is why is this a priority.  Is copyright infringement enforcement such a priority because we're losing jobs and losing money.  You always hear that said by the industry but where is the evidence of that.  The only evidence I've seen recently is that the copyright media industries are doing OK.  Sure they could be making more money.  We all would like to make more money but it doesn't seem like the industry is suffering horribly.  We don't see mass layoffs.  They're not saying we're not going to be making bad movies anymore because we just can't afford it.

And these are the sensible laws that we have since figured out.

We got a few other things to finish up here before we get out.  I wanted to talk about Spotify's new app.  Well it's a new app platform that they announced at the beginning of last week.  I think we talked about it a little bit last week but Spotify announced a third party app store and an open platform.  It was less than what a lot of people thought.  A lot of people thought they were going to get that on API and anybody could include Spotify and their apps.  Instead it's you build an app in Spotify so last FM can be integrated in the client.  It's a way to keep people happy within Spotify.  They also announced at the end of the week Spotify radio which is a Pandora like feature which allows you to just drag a  track from your Spotify list over to the radio and it'll start a radio station and has an algorithm that will decide what  other songs you might like based on that one track.  Anybody use Spotify use Spotify.

I managed to get an account from the Spotify people and I thought it was impressive.  It wasn't really like it just it felt too heavy.  But like iTunes you know iTunes you really like it or you really don't.  For me it's just so heavy Spotify feels really heavy.  I like the RDO just feels like really light and simple and easy and sharing is very nice.  But maybe I'll give it another go.

Transcript:  Twitter also announced a major redesign.  You've probably seen it by now.  It's rolled out to most everybody.  It affects their mobile apps as well as their their website.  So when you go to Twitter now everything is is simple.  It's in line.  They brought a bunch of press into their their new office space that is being built and made a big metaphor about  rebuilding and simplification and all of this and how 140 characters is all you need.  But I like most of this stuff.  They simplify the navigation.  So on the website you get home connect and discover the home is is pretty obvious.  It's it's the home site.  That's where you get your feed.  The connect is got an at symbol by it and that shows you all the people who are interacting with you.  So people who followed you any at replies you can you can simplify it down to being just the mentions if you just want to see the at replies and then discover is sort of their  search situation although they raise a bunch of stuff that's trending in there when you go there and then you can enter a hashtag or keyword.  It's and it's got the hashtag symbol up at the top.  Now on the mobile side they also have one that is called me I think which takes you to your profile on the website.  They just have the little silhouette for you to go to.  But the big thing is when you're when you're looking at somebody's posts on your timeline now instead of stuff going over into the sidebar like  pictures and videos it all takes place right there below.  So you get to see that embedded map or that video right in line with what you're looking at.  I'm trying to find a good example here Clayton Morris flying to San Francisco and drinking a beer and there's the beer he's drinking right there in line.  Isn't that gorgeous.

Start time: 4826.62
End time: 4844.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean there's some stuff in there that I actually think is really clever like the the tweet box on basically everybody's page in the upper left and there's some nice tweaks but I think this whole thing is basically a mess especially the iOS client.  It's just really not good.  They did some stuff in there that just really rankles me.

Start time: 4846.52
End time: 4886.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chaps you're hired.  I'm kind of right there with you.  I mean there's there's a there's not anything overall that I think was awful but then there's there's a couple of things in particular that I just hate the fact that when I go to connect I now have to click on mentions because I don't really want to see all of these other interactions.  I just want to see the replies and it never I can't change it to default to that at least I don't think so.  And I don't have the ability to tweet from that page without clicking.  There's no box at the top.  I have to go and click.  Now these aren't killers for me but there are things that I don't really love and there's nothing else that I that they did that I'm like wow this is revolutionary.  Like having stuff in line is nice.

Start time: 4888.36
End time: 4929.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean you know part of me wants to say that like maybe I don't like it because it's just different and it's not what we're used to.  I mean for so long we've thought of mentions as being mentioned not as being connect and then they changed it.  And you know the idea is that it's easier for people to understand and maybe I just find it harder to understand because I'm so used to being a certain way.  Maybe that's part of what it is but I actually just don't really see the necessity for those kinds of changes.  If the problem is that users don't understand Twitter I think that changing what's already there and making it even more obscure is really not the way to solve that.  I think educating your users and making sure they understand how to use this app is the is the correct approach.

Start time: 4930.60

And there's also some something called phase change which is coming along surprisingly quickly also.  So I think we're going to see a bunch of non-volatile stuff happening and you know that's all good.  When is the magnetic hard drive done.  Yeah that's my concern.  A long time from now.  Long time.

Every year we get closer.  I'm actually really stoked about where we are.  I've been looking forward to SSD since the mid to late 90s.  I've been wanting one.

All right while we were talking there I put it to the chat room.  We want to have more Apple television rumors the new Verizon video service or crazy stuff  Eric Schmidt said as our last story and Eric Schmidt seems to have won the day.  It was close with the Apple TV rumors so the Verizon video service just for those who might  slightly be curious Verizon says they're going to put out their own video service all on Netflix  in a limited way in areas where they don't do Verizon files.  And you can you can find out more about that elsewhere.  You already know what the Apple TV rumors are because they're the same crazy one  everyone's been saying for a long time but Eric Schmidt at the Web was speaking and said  most TVs will have Google TV by mid 2012.  Now I'm not I'm not 100 he said he was smoking what he said by the summer of 2012 the majority  of the televisions you see in stores will have Google TV embedded in it.  So I'm not paraphrasing to make him sound any crazier than he already does.  I've taken millions of my own dollars.  2011 maybe he thinks 2012 that's a long way in the future.

That's why everyone jumped on that 3D bandwagon which I won't even get into that but you know  because they had nothing else they had nothing else to get people excited about their TV.  So everyone's kind of looking for the next thing that they can get people excited about with the  television.  Google TV 1.0 obviously not that but if there's something they can do I think they're going to  try to pursue it.

It was a little buggy at first it didn't pick up on our on our account right away and it  couldn't let us install apps but once we got past that you're able to install apps.  The interfaces it's not perfect but it's much cleaner.  The video pass through which I had had problems with direct TV video going through the Google TV  and looking jaggy.  That is much better.  It still looks like it's getting a little dark when it goes through for some reason but that I can adjust  for and that and that's fine and they have a new app that you basically say I want to watch this and  it tells you whether you have it available on television how much time is left in that show if  it's airing right now or if it's available on Netflix or Amazon or any of the other sources  that you have installed on the machine.  I mean I think they've made a huge improvement.

Transcript:  Well you can they still have relationship with Sony.  LG has said that they will be releasing Google TVs at CES 2012.  You know it's interesting.  I think it'll be really interesting because you know Samsung has made huge efforts to  differentiate the software platform available on their TVs.  Vizio has worked.  They've integrated a lot of stuff on there.  I mean Vizio is like half the television sold in the United States or was close to it at least last  year or year before and so you know Google could be if Vizio secretly is adopted Google TV and they  managed to not leak anything about it and that's you know between you know Vizio and LG then yeah  more than 50 percent of televisions available could potentially be running Google TV but the  reality is the software packages still you know vary so much across the different levels.  I don't see I don't I find it difficult to believe 2012.  2020 sure 2015 maybe 2012.  That means the entire HCTV industry or the majority of the HCTV cells the  companies that control the majority of the HCTV cells in the United States managed to keep their  mouths shut keep their engineers mouths shut and keep the suppliers mouths shut about the fact that  they're putting Google TV.
