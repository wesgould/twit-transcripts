Transcript:  should also mention that it is  Ramadan and that is a very  important all month long festival  of course in your part of the  world as well as here and  because Ramadan you fast  speaking of fasting it's a  fastable you fast all day no  water no food but that means  feasting and parties at night  and because you're on the roof  you're surrounded by parties  mostly sounds like kids. That's

Start time: 340.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. That's right. I mean  people really celebrate it here  and yeah we can hear the kids  that's nobody nobody loses  anyway because they do they  really feast and it's really a  lot of fun we've actually  broken the fast at around 730  p.m. the big cannon that goes  off you hear the call to prayer  and then you hear this big  cannon and then everybody can  feast and they all sit around  the family together so we we did  that with a couple of families  and the food is delicious  everybody's very happy and then  they pretty much stay up most  of the night they eat three  squares during the night and  they have to be finished  eating 330 in the morning and  then there's no food from like  330 to like 730.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just it's not a lot of weight  loss fast it's just a it's a  religious fast. It's food  shifting. You know it's  interesting when I started  reading about fasting because  it was you by the way who  triggered this all Phil and then  I talked to Kevin Rose and he  made a fasting app and on and  on and on it seems like all my  friends were doing this new  thing which is intermittent  fasting it's not fasting for  extremely lengthy periods of  time it's it's brief for fast.  How long do you fast though? I  shouldn't say that. Two to eight

End time: 420.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  eating fast. Like so. Eights a  lot. I'm I I too is plenty for  me. But that's more for health  and weight loss. Ramadan is  more it's a religious fast but  every it seems every major  religion actually has a fasting  tradition of some kind. Yeah.

Start time: 420.98
End time: 423.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 458.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  actually have enjoyed it.  Anyway we'll talk about that  some other time because this is  twit and we're supposed to talk  about tech and it looks like  tomorrow's a big day. The  Worldwide Developers Conference  is going to be a big day for  Apple's yearly event. They  haven't had a public event since  September eight months right  something like that. My wife  calls it WWD 40. Well it is the  squeaky developer that gets the  grease or something. I I think  I have two minds first of all  there have been very few leaks  about WWDC this year. It's a

Start time: 458.88
End time: 472.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  weird yeah yeah I don't know if  it's because what's his name who  went to Bloomberg. Mark  Mark. Yeah but they're not he  there was one WWD where he just  had everything. He knew it all  yeah and I think well so that's

Start time: 472.80
End time: 493.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the two minds one is he does  know it all and there's nothing  he's there's new laptops maybe  a Siri device iOS 11 Mac OS  we've decided it's going to be  Catalina by the way. I thought  I'd say that and then there's  not much else to say or Apple  could have now saw augmented  reality and clear phones and a  new iPad and I think that's

Start time: 494.78
End time: 507.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the biggest thing. Yeah and  it's just nobody knows nobody  knows. I think he's leaked  probably the the biggest thing  is probably going to be the  series speaker whatever they  call it. Yeah and then to get

Start time: 507.92
End time: 513.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  excited about productizing Siri  which is such a laggard well

Start time: 513.78
End time: 518.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's first they have to fix  Siri and I think that's  supposedly one of the fixing

Start time: 518.78
End time: 521.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  series as they bought it. It's  not going to get any better

Start time: 521.94
End time: 538.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  embarrassed. Someone did a  study came out last week and  they rated it was like 5,000  queries and who did you see  that you tell this already and  Siri led in just completely  wrong answers. Yeah. Yeah I

Start time: 539.49
End time: 552.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  swear at Siri more than I do  anything else. I in fact it's  a joke running joke with Lisa  and me my wife will for some  reason has this undying faith  in series she'll ask series  definitely just go no no I gave  up on that. No so you know I

Transcript:  have Alexa and Google Home I'm  trying to get them to talk to  each other but it doesn't work  yet but you know you throw  different kinds of questions  their domains differ but they're

Start time: 561.58
End time: 580.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  basically roughly equivalent  Cortana is the next one down  maybe. I've never used that is  that good. It's better than  Siri. Yeah well that's not  saying much. Yeah. You're in an  AI Phil why is this so hard  what is Apple doing wrong why  can't Apple create a product  that at least competes with  Alexa. I mean I think a lot of

Start time: 581.88
End time: 596.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what they do in serious really  impressive it's just a more  diffuse use case you know Alexa  has specific interactions and  use cases that it's really good  at. It isn't really trying to  be a general purpose assistant  and I think Siri tries to be a  little bit more general purpose  it's a lot easier to say oh I

Start time: 596.60
End time: 603.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  could play music for you I can  do a kitchen timer I can have  these domains that I can work  like I miss Alexa like when I'm

Start time: 604.56
End time: 609.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  traveling and I do too is not  around like I kind of get long  miss it. Yeah my theory about

Start time: 610.74
End time: 612.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alexa is that. Let's call her by

Start time: 612.40
End time: 622.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the way let's do this everybody  at home a favorite echo. Okay  echo. I started it and I  apologize because it really is  going to trigger people. What  really impresses people about

Start time: 622.44
End time: 638.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  echo is that it understands you  so frequently and I always  assume that that's because it  has a plug in the wall so it can  power seven microphones and  that's where the strength of  its. Well if that's the case  then an Apple Siri device that

Start time: 638.42
End time: 652.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is plugged in they should have  the other part of the rumor is  that it will have better  speakers echo has always had  kind of weak speakers and  Google's were a little bit  better I think that was one area  Google decided to excel in Mike  did you bring your Google home  with you to Morocco. I didn't

Start time: 654.30
End time: 661.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I always bring my echo with  me everywhere we travel you  have an echo with you does it  work does it work there. It

Start time: 662.30
End time: 663.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  works great you can't you have

Start time: 664.38
End time: 699.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you can't. It won't. But it  won't. Default to where you are  so we have to specify what the  local weather we have to  specify. As Morocco. But other  than that it works great place  music it plays our Amazon music  and so on and that's one of the  reasons why we bring the full  size echo because. It's also  like. We can always have music  you know everywhere we go. So  you don't mind those speakers  you consider those adequate.  They're certainly adequate I  really. It's hard to. Think of  any sort of speaker system  that's that compact that would  be. I guess. I'm sick of  that. I mean. It's it's

Start time: 700.20
End time: 720.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  significantly better than that  right. Bluetooth speaker it's  okay yeah. Waiting for the  source integration. Yeah we  were supposed to get that six  months ago I am. I think  there's something not working  quite right. I agree that will  be. Frankly so knows if you  had if you had to pick somebody  who missed the boat it's so  knows if they could have put  that technology right to those  speakers. Yeah that would have  been a killer. This school  house. Go ahead. Go ahead Mike.

Start time: 722.18
End time: 787.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry I also think this is  an opportunity for Apple to  actually get into that so no  I think. Yeah. I think that's  the whole point of this because  really so knows has a apple S  kind of reputation for high  quality and a compact size  it's very elegant to use and so  on. And I think. Apple would  like to be in that space  except for just dumb speakers  are not interesting enough for  Apple if they can have really  high quality speakers and again  I don't. Expect them to  necessarily do this but I think  they should do this. Really  high quality speakers that  could also double as extra  speakers for the the apple TV  and the way it doesn't matter  that the apple fan fans are all  going to jump on this thing no  matter what. It's going to be  serious going to be adequate  for lots of lots of people no  matter what and I believe and  I said this before in the show  the- I think this whole smart  speaker. Thing is a stop gap  and eventually we're going to  be wearing. This kind of thing.  Somewhere on our body probably  in glasses probably. You know  air pod type of integrations  you know give it give it five  years or six years or seven  years I think that smart  speakers gonna seem kind of  antiquated. Five years is a good

Start time: 789.98
End time: 793.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  product life. I mean that's  yeah. Yeah. The problem is I

Start time: 793.98
End time: 812.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  mean I can see apple doing the  hardware I just don't think  that they will ever catch up to  you frankly is could be google  that's going to win. Because  while echo is ahead because  they launched earlier. Google's  the one collecting all the  signals. Google knows more  about. But you don't think but  you're an AI guy again Phil you  don't think that's a. Getting  them ahead at the start. I

Start time: 813.12
End time: 820.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think the main lesson. I think  the most important thing about  AI right now is the most  important thing are. Really  well thought out specific use

End time: 831.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  training. No it's like it's  it's interaction. It's like  who's got the best attention to  detail about. What are the  great experiences that you're  going to have with this thing

Start time: 832.00
End time: 853.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is that because we're early  days and so general  intelligence general artificial  intelligence is way off so we  have to be domain specific. Or  because ultimately wouldn't we  want something that was  generally intelligent. No why.  I don't know. I don't know.  Because then I don't have to  know what domain that  particular agents good at I can  just address a question to it  and is that what we wanted is  that why Siri fail. I don't

Start time: 854.00
End time: 873.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think so I think like. Where  A. I. is an industry went went  wrong is. Right in the  beginning right with the  Turing test like the Turing  test was a. Most day experts  agree that that was a dumb  it's just like a is a bad idea  to try to make something  that's generally intelligent  especially if you're if if the  bar you're setting is like  human level intelligence is  somehow like the goal and  it's a yeah doesn't make any

Start time: 873.80

Start time: 879.14
End time: 912.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everything that I work on  starts out being better than  human. Like in a in a domain  exactly. And I don't care  about what a person could do  this plenty of people in the  planet that I don't really  feel like interacting with I  don't need more of those. I  want experiences. I want  experiences that are better  than what a person can do.  This is AI for missing tropes  all right I get it now. So  Alexa is much better than a  person could be I'm sorry  Echo is much better than a  person could be at the stuff  that Echo is good for. And  also and Siri I think. Say  again. Sorry to interrupt

Start time: 912.78
End time: 927.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phil. Amazon is is way ahead  of the game precisely because  of what Phil is saying they  have the Echo look the Echo  show they have the different  types of Echos and that's I  think brilliant to have a  different special purpose  Echo for every room in the  house can't wait for the  bathroom Echo. Don't think  of it as like a I don't even

Start time: 928.68
End time: 946.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think of it as special.  I don't think of it as like a  I don't even think of it as  special purpose I just think  about it as like a sharply  good experience. That's what  that's the products that win  like once the technology gets  to a point where it goes from  being a engineering problem  to being a product problem  like the products that win  are the ones that are the  best designed with specific  interactions and delightful  experiences in mind. I have a  different take on how Apple

Start time: 946.72
End time: 972.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  fits into this. I think  Google homes problem is that  it doesn't have it doesn't  have a way to monetize it  well. Echo is a product that  has a way to monetize it  because people buy more stuff  through Amazon because  they're using the Echo.  Apple has the perfect  monetization strategy they  sell the device in large  quantities. To do that there  has to be a high margin

Start time: 973.18
End time: 992.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  device. It has to be more I  mean an Echo you can get a  dot for $40 now you can get  all of the the entire Echo  experience minus the speaker  for $40 because Amazon makes  it up on the other end but  what would Apple have to  charge to make this available  to the world? It's a very  valuable product. Hundreds  it doesn't matter. It doesn't  matter because it's Apple.

Start time: 992.56
End time: 994.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're going to buy it  like Mike said. One of the

Start time: 994.52
End time: 1009.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  things I'm intrigued about  is whether Apple can go  international fast. Right now  the Echo is dominant but only  in the United States. If  Apple can do a smart speaker  system and go global they'll  suddenly be ahead of  everyone. Right and they

Start time: 1009.50
End time: 1013.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  already have a lot of  language stuff under their  belt. I think a lot of this

Start time: 1013.54
End time: 1058.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  comes down to like where is  the where's the center of  gravity where's like the  center of empathy for each  company? And you can tell a  lot I think about what's  going to happen just based  on that. Do you mean empathy  or brand reputation? I mean  like what fundamentally is  the most important thing to  each company? Like for  Amazon like the empathy is  really on selling you stuff  right whether it's physical  products or subscriptions  Amazon Prime or video like  they want you to they want  you to buy stuff that you  love and need and have a  good experience with. Right.  For Google their fundamental  thing that they're about is  showing you ads and like  getting you to click on  stuff same as for Facebook.  Right. For Apple their  fundamental thing is  selling you Apple devices.  None of these companies has  transcended past that  original focus. Increasingly  Apple's services company

Start time: 1058.28
End time: 1065.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  too a lot of their revenue  is coming from services they  see that as their biggest  growth area. Yeah but like  what's the stuff that they're  excellent at? Like the  Amazon is world class at

Start time: 1065.28
End time: 1072.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  selling you stuff. Apple is  right now really world class  at making the devices. They  both I think Amazon and  Apple both share an interest  in making the devices.

Start time: 1072.28
End time: 1095.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And interest in making it  really a good experience  for the customer.  Mm hmm.  And for Amazon it's a good  experience for the shopper.  Yep. And for Apple it's a  good experience for the  user. Google not so my  experience is not so much.  Try to find a human to help  you with a Google problem.  I think the Amazon center of

Start time: 1098.22
End time: 1114.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I think if like  if the company is basically  about like getting your  attention distracting you  making a click on an ad like  that isn't a quality that  you'd want in a friend.  And it's pretty hard to make  you listen to ads on a  Google home.  But it's just like you

Whereas I think Apple and  Amazon are better aligned.  I agree with what you're  saying Phil but I would  amend that to say that  Amazon is a better  aligned product.

Start time: 1131.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that's a good  thing. I would amend that  to say that Apple's genius  is not just selling you the  hardware but it's getting  money on all the levels.  They sell you the hardware  they sell you the software  they get they get a third  of what other people sell  you. And it's all of it.  It's the services it's  everything subscriptions  you name it.  And I think that's a really  interesting model for Apple  on this kind of device.  I mean if you think about  the money that they could  make on an app store for  the smart speaker it could  be enormous.  I mean I have trouble  really picturing it and  nobody's done it well.  Amazon certainly has not  done the third party app  thing very well.  You have to memorize all  this stuff.  It's very difficult.  If somebody like Apple can  crack that if Siri can  actually choose the third  party app offer it you can  buy it with a command or  whatever then they could be  way ahead of the game and  they could be looking at a  revenue stream that's  comparable in some ways to  the iPhone app store.  Where it's just very  lucrative and they dominate  the field for those third  party apps.  And I think Apple had a  problem with people asking

Transcript:  And there's usually  developer focused stuff.  So I don't know and even if  they announced laptops I  don't think that that would  be a big thing.  The reason I think the  Siri announcement makes a  lot of sense is you're  talking to developers.  You're talking about  basically a new ecosystem  and almost a new platform.  So developers are very  incredible.

Start time: 1289.48
End time: 1307.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about the  perfect home run that they  could do tomorrow would be  to announce this product,  have it be super high  quality, have there be one  or two attributes about it  that are surprising and  then say here's the SDK  everyone.  Go for it.  It's kind of hard to  imagine that they'd be  that far away from the  system.  It's kind of hard to  imagine that they'd be  that far along with it but

Start time: 1307.40
End time: 1328.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that would be amazing if  they did that.  It's hard for me to believe  that it's really going to  be like a high end or even  a medium end speaker  system.  I know that's what  everyone's saying and I  guess it's likely to be  true.  To me it just seems like  Apple announces stuff that  can grow fairly quickly.  And for their target  audience like most people  who are Apple fans have  high quality speakers of  whatever type.  Oh so you think it'll be a

Start time: 1328.38

Start time: 1340.38
End time: 1353.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to go buy new  speakers.  So you think take Siri as  it stands in the phone and  put it in a stand alone  device.  Maybe.  By the way home  automation is also I think  we kept expecting with  HomeKit that they'd deliver  a hub.  They have yet to deliver a

Start time: 1353.38
End time: 1379.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hub, the Apple TV wasn't it?  What I would love is for  something like Siri would  just be the hardware is  just super high quality  microphones and it just  integrates well with  whatever speakers you've  got set up.  That would be the thing  that I would buy.  Via Bluetooth?  I don't know, something.  Magic.  But I'm not going to,  there's no way that I'm  buying entirely new  speakers tomorrow.  Right.  That's a very good point.  So would Apple release  something that didn't have  the potential to sell  millions of units right away?  The only reason I went

Start time: 1379.38
End time: 1383.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that way is because we  agreed that large margin  was critical as a hardware  company.  Right?

Start time: 1384.40
End time: 1412.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but large margins are  in China for Apple now.  So does everybody in China  have a super ultra high  quality speaker system?  I don't think that that's  true.  And the other thing is  that we also know about  Apple that they love to  control the entire  experience.  I doubt that Apple is going  to want to just say, well,  whatever speakers you have  around, that's going to be  your experience with this.  And I can't imagine Apple  coming out with a sound  experience, a music  experience that's inferior  to the Echo.  It's got to be better than  the Echo.  Not much better.  It would be much better  than the Echo if it worked  well with your existing  speakers.

Our coverage begins 10 a.m.  Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern.  That is 1700 UTC.  We'll be streaming it live.  Nathan Olivares-Giles and  Megan Moroney will be  covering it.  And as we always do,  Apple has said they're going  to be doing the keynote.  We will do our kind of  Mystery Science 3000  version of it.  Well, we'll snark away  while Tim Cook takes the stage.  You know who will not take  the stage, and I'm sad to say,  is Bozoma.  Bozoma.  Bozoma.  Bozoma.  Bozoma.  The woman who was so good  last year at WWDC.  It was a fairly dull  presentation.

The basic idea is we're kind of challenging  the idea that if you're a brilliant product person  that what you have to do is make a company first  before you can make a product.  We're product first.  Oh, I like it.  Look, if you're a brilliant writer,  you just write.  You don't have to make a writing company.  No.  And if you're a musician, you just play.  You don't have to make a music company.  So why is it that if you have a vision for a product  that you have to make a startup first?  Why don't you just make a product first?  And so, yeah, it's a worldwide studio.  Kind of is like an incubator.  Well, except we're not focusing on companies.  It's like Bill Gross's ideal lab a little bit, maybe.  It's like a lot of things.  To me, I'm most inspired by maybe Netflix and Amazon.  Like, I'm trying to make Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of these are, I'd say, practical AI,  which is it means that we really focus not on the  cutting edge tech stack, but on the design aspect of it,  like on the use cases.  We kind of did this with Evernote, right?  So like, Evernote, we started Evernote at, like,  we got lucky at just the right time.  Right as mobile apps went from being an engineering-driven  problem to a product-driven problem.  So like, if you were building mobile apps in 2005,  it didn't really matter how good your design was  because it was all, like, technology constrained.  Right.  But if you were building mobile apps in 2008,  like, the ones that won were the ones that took it  as a product challenge, as a design challenge,  not just an engineering challenge.  So we're kind of at that stage.  AI is exactly at that stage, yes.  So if you were building something three years ago,  it was very much engineering-driven.  Like, you needed the lab coat wearing,  PhDs at Google.  Right.  Now, as long as you're not trying to do general AI,  as long as you're trying to do, like,  a specific beautiful use case,  it's gone from being engineering-heavy  to being product-heavy, and like,  that's the time for us to step in and do something.

Transcript:  Did Google's TensorFlow change that a little bit?  I mean, it's an open source AI platform.  Yeah.  You can use their TPUs now.  They're doing hardware.  They announced a Google I.O.

Start time: 2226.78

Start time: 2228.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It commoditized the software and hardware.

Start time: 2230.82
End time: 2247.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Commodity, commoditized isn't the right word,  but it's definitely a platform.  Made it easy to get to.  So like, all turtles is a,  it's a meta-platform.  Right?  It's like, it's basically saying that  what you couldn't do before,  now you could do because there's a platform for it.  So now you can get closer and closer  to just building the product first.  And that's going to keep happening.

There's a lot of TensorFlow.  There's, but there's also just a lot of Java.  There's a lot of Python.  It's everything.  There's a lot of R,  which I like to say like a pirate.  R!  It's the statistics based language.  R!  The idea is,  if you're a brilliant product person,  you have a vision.  You see a hole in the world  in the shape of your product idea.  Rather than having to make a startup  and figure out how to do all of the hard  but not interesting company stuff,  which I had to do for 20 years.  You just make the product first.  And then we figure out everything else.

I think you could slipstream better chips in there.  I haven't heard that.  Do remember, we do remember that Phil Schiller when he had his apology meeting  for the five saying we screwed up on the Mac Pro did say,  but don't worry pros, there's going to be a new iMac this year.  This year.  That will make pros happy.  Yeah.  That's a stretch because what pros, I think,  probably mostly care about is not form factor,  but the ability to swap in more hard drives,  swap in newer cards.  Something like the old cheese grater Mac,  if they don't do that or something that is as upgradable as that,  they've missed the boat.  The cheese grater Mac.

Transcript:  Steven Levy got it.  You brought up the Apple campus, Leo.  Can I make a couple of points about this that have not been made and I really think they need to be made.  Please do.  The first is that people talk about whether they should...  We talk about whether Eddie Q should ever have fun.  People are also talking about whether Apple should be building big fancy headquarters.  Does this mean the end of Apple is just what happens to companies that build amazing headquarters  and then that's the beginning of the end, etc., etc.?  It's not to be said that the new Apple headquarters are the new icon.  They are to tech and Silicon Valley now.  What the Eiffel Tower is to Paris or Europe and what Big Ben is to London, etc.  It's an iconic...  It will always be used from henceforth as an iconic visual to be shorthand for tech and for Silicon Valley  and that's pretty cool.  The second thing is if you look at the...  There's a mystery around parking at Apple Park.  They have so much parking.  They have way more parking than they could ever possibly need.  If you look at the numbers of parking spots that they have...  That's interesting.  Plus Apple's plans to minimize parking.  Now, there's an argument that says that the City Council requires a certain amount of parking per employees,  blah, blah, blah.  I don't buy it at all.  If you look at the future of self-driving cars,  you look at their plans to have shuttle buses and bicycles and all that kind of stuff.  I think that campus is actually designed to hold 15 or 16,000 people.  And they basically built it so that knowing that they're not going to develop parking,  there's way too much parking and way too little.  If they went into the City Council and said,

Start time: 3456.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're going to build a campus that's going to house 16,000 people,  I think everyone would have freaked out.  So they said, it's going to be 12,000, maybe 13,000.  I think this campus is...  I think that within three or four years,  it's going to be 15 or 16,000 people at this campus.  So this is designed for big expansion.

In fact, there's a couple dozen of their employees.  I'm trying to find the name now of it.  They've been working...  That contract manufacturer has had multiple engineers  working in Apple buildings for a few years.  And so if you think of it,  they're looking at cars the way they look at iPhones.  Apple doesn't manufacture iPhones.  Foxconn does.  And so this company is the Foxconn of automobile manufacturing.  And I think that they...  First of all, I don't think manufacturing a self-driving car,  the wheels, the motor,  that is not going to be all that difficult.  The difficult part is the navigation,  and that's where Apple is seriously behind.  But why would they be working with this company in Austria?  Why would they be...  If you look at their...

This whole area used to be fruit orchards.  That's why the big mall there is called the pruneyard.  It was all plum trees and cherry trees.  And in 1910...  It's not even an old barn.  At least Connecticut people wouldn't think so.  In 1910, they built this barn.  HP preserved it in its campus.  So Apple took it, moved it,  board by board off the premises,  and they have now restored it back to the premises  now that construction is over.  And the barn will survive for no apparent reason.  I think they promised that.

We got up before the sun came up.  We watched the sun rise.  And Sarah, we got back on the camels  and rode back.  It's like an hour ride.

Transcript:  We're going to show you tonight,  brought to you by Carbonite Online.  I was just talking about Carbonite, David, friend.  Carbonite is...  They're rocking.  And I didn't realize,  but I was talking to David the other day,  they use some pretty interesting proprietary technology  to write to the disks.  They've really optimized it.  So what is it?  It's cloud backup.  But is cloud backup done right?  It's automatic.  It's continuous.  It's low cost, flat fee.  They've got plans for home.  It starts at $59.99 a year,  less than $5 a month,  for everything on a PC or a Mac.  But then, when you go to the business side,  man, the office plans include servers.  They have a high availability backup  so you don't have any time wasted getting back online.  They have hardware devices.  They have the eVault that lets you back up locally  and then back up to Carbonite.  There's the eVault.  It is a solution for every business.  And I'll tell you,  it solves the biggest problem in business  because you're reliant on data.  And if your data isn't safe,  your business isn't safe.  And what you only have to do is look at the want to cry people  who just makes you want to cry  who've lost everything,  businesses, hospitals,  300,000 people a bit.  Now, if you use Carbonite,  you don't have to worry about ransomware.  In fact, go to the Carbonite site, carbonite.com,  click the office website,  carbonite.com, click the office tab up at the top  and look at their resource pages.

Every security expert says backup is kind of one of the keys  to keeping your system safe.  Carbonite Cloud Backup.  I want you to check it out.  You can try it free, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there actually is a group...  If they're not Google's ads.  Yeah, that's annoying.  It's annoying to Google.  There's a group called...  Annoying to Google.  The Coalition for Better Ads.  In the great tradition of naming these industry  self-interest groups with a name  that makes it feel like it's good for America.  KABKA.  KABKA.  KABBA.  KABBA.  Whose members include  the Interactive Advertising Bureau,  the Association of National Advertisers,  the Washington Post,  Thomson Reuters, Facebook,  Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and oh, surprise.  Procter & Gamble.  Google.  They don't have much.  That is a party.  But admittedly, there is a problem, right?  I mean, ads have gotten way out of control  because you know what?  Here's the real problem, Google,  and this is they'll never admit,  is that banner ads don't work.  You look at a banner ad  and you don't see it  because we've learned how to tune it out.  So what happened?  They had to make them more intrusive.  They had to punch the monkey for a while.  And then they had to do takeovers.  It's got to the point you can't read a page  until you click and they move the close box  to a different place.  I mean, it's just gotten incredibly annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, Mike Elgin,  you gave me the best example of why ads support a media  and what we do is good  because it's democratizing.  It means you don't have to have money  to hear content or to read content.  I don't have anything against ads.  I do.

Transcript:  Let me ask you guys this.  There's a behavior that I've noticed in myself  where I have an ad blocker  and any publication that pops up a thing  and says you have your ad blocker,

Start time: 4440.89
End time: 4447.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just disable it for that site,  just automatically.  And it works out fine, I guess, so far.  I just leave the publication  and then we're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You never come back.  You hate ads so much that you will...  Most ads.  But you understand, and Philip,  you run a site that is ad-supported.  No, it's ad-free.  That's the point.  Why do you...

Start time: 4459.06
End time: 4465.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, because you have subscribers.  Right.  I left Fortune because it was becoming  more and more intrusive.  Got it.  You couldn't read the stuff for the ad.

Start time: 4472.08
End time: 4511.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's true.  But most of the time,  it's a pretty bad experience.  And certainly most of the time  on the internet, it's a pretty bad experience.  But it does have the potential for getting better.  But as we go more and more...  Mike, you were saying this about wearables, right?  Soon we'll just be wearing the tech on our glasses.  Okay, look, if I'm browsing the internet  on a giant monitor on my desktop  like Leo's doing here,  okay, I can allocate...  Then it's not so bad.  I can allocate a few pixels to the ad.  If I'm looking at it on my phone,  how many pixels on my phone  I'm willing to allocate to an ad?  Not very many.  Well, there's also the issue of...  Once it's in my glasses.  How much of my retina am I giving up to an ad?  Very quickly approaching zero.  The thing is that...

Start time: 4512.65
End time: 4539.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The big mystery though is that  we always talk about all the personal data  that these companies take,  Facebook, Google, etc.  They're harvesting everything.  They're finding out everything.  They're following us to the store.  They know they're recognizing our faces.  And they still can't give us relevant ads.  Why is that?  If you talk about advertising in your glasses,  I think it was perfectly relevant.  It was so good that it didn't even feel like an ad.  It just felt like good advice.  Well, it won't be ads.

Start time: 4539.98
End time: 4552.47

Transcript:  It'll be things like you're walking by the Gap  and something says,  oh, hey, you know what?  You need new pants and you want a new pants  and there's a great deal on pants.  What's wrong with my pants?  You were clearly looking at my pants  when you said that.  I just got these pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on the fundamental problem.  This is the Google paradox, they call it.  If they really were super useful,  they wouldn't be ads.  Let's just say Google knew at any given time  what the five most useful things for me to know  right now are,  the five most delightful useful things for me right now.  None of those would be things that somebody  would pay for to put in front of me.  Those are all things that I would pay to see.  The better ad targeting gets,  the more they become not ads.  At some point, this idea that someone's going to  pay money to interrupt your attention  stream is going to be completely in conflict  with where the technology is going  of actually figuring out what's most important  and delightful and useful to you.  Ads of that type are totally not sustainable  over the next decade or something.  We'll see how long that takes.  But look at what Amazon is doing with the Amazon Echo.

Start time: 4607.88
End time: 4625.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, this is absolutely brilliant.  You actually point their camera at yourself  and you say, Amazon, do these pants  make my ass look fat?  And Amazon says yes.  But these don't.  Maybe the problem is terminology.

Start time: 4625.56
End time: 4642.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's not an ad.  Right.  Because then they're actually going to sell you the pants  that make your ass look fat.  But maybe they're selling it from a third party.  I mean, maybe Amazon.  No.  A lot of what's on Amazon is from a third party.  But look, if Amazon.  Does that make it an ad that's a third party now?  So here's the thing.  If Amazon gets money no matter what you buy,

Start time: 4643.56
End time: 4667.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're incented to show you genuinely the best things  because they just want you to buy more.  They want you to be happy.  They want you to be happy  and they want you to be happy and you'll make money.  That's not what advertising is.  Advertising doesn't want you to buy the best thing for you.  It wants you to buy the thing that somebody has paid  to confirm you because it's not the best thing.  So if you were the best thing, you would need an ad.  Right. You would just sell it.  So companies that actually control like...

Start time: 4667.48
End time: 4674.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not true, but okay.  I'll accept that.  It's mostly true.  I think there are a lot of products that you never heard of  that may be the best thing.  That's true.

Start time: 4674.46
End time: 4677.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you would hear about it through a recommendation,  not through a paid placement.

Start time: 4677.46
End time: 4681.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I find that I discover stuff through ads.  That's clearly what advertising was,

Start time: 4682.50
End time: 4697.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  especially on television.  If you look at Mad Men,  that's what the whole show is about.  Yeah, make you smoke even though you didn't want to.  They're manufacturing your desire for that product,  whereas with all the data collection,  they should be able to find out what you actually want,  not tell you what you want.

Start time: 4697.50
End time: 4710.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this idea that Google Chrome is going to start blocking  annoying ads, what is this coming from?  I mean, this is a company that sells ads.  Is this a rear guard action because they're afraid  you're going to put a real ad blocker on  and block all ads?

Start time: 4711.85
End time: 4753.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what they're doing,  it's actually a great idea because essentially,  they brought down the price.  Google is one of the companies that brought down  the price of ads so low,  and that's one of the reasons ads are so crappy.  They can simultaneously create more scarcity  by taking people out of the, you know,  can't see the ad.  They'll have all these people blocking ads by default,  and that makes advertising and reaching the remaining people,  I guess, more valuable, doesn't it?  I mean, it's like, you know,  it's a way for them to get monetization  whether you're looking at ads  or whether you're not looking at ads.

Transcript:  I have a fantastic idea for an ad startup.  I'm going to pitch it to you guys.  Free?  It's actually, it's fantastic slash terrible.  This is like a half serious startup idea that I have for ads.  We're going to scrape your email to find out,  like, what you bought from Amazon,  and then we're going to buy, as you're browsing,  we're going to buy ads so you see ads  for the stuff you already own.  So imagine, like, being in the internet,  and all you're seeing is ads for things you already own.

Start time: 4782.26
End time: 4785.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4792.34
End time: 4808.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's there to make you want the things you have.  Oh, it's a confidence builder?  It's there to make you want the things you have.  It's the stoic idea.  It's to affirm that you made the right decision.  It's the stoic idea.  Like, the secret to happiness is wanting what you have.  Right.  And who pays for this?  That's why it's not a best idea.

Start time: 4811.16

Start time: 4822.24
End time: 4863.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe you'll like this.  This is Google.  Remember, Google had this thing I thought was very good  and they had a new contributor.  You'd put some money in and then they would deviate out  to various Google ad sites.  And instead of the Google ad, you'd get kittens  or whatever you chose to see instead.  And I thought that was a good thing.  They discontinued it.  And this is their new Google contributor.  You go to a website.  They've got, I guess, only four so far.  Grub Street, WWG, Comic Book, and Popular Mechanics.  Popular Mechanics, that brings back memories.  The website says, hey, I see you're running an ad blocker.  Would you like to buy a Google contributor pass  that will remove ads from your site?

Start time: 4863.54
End time: 4870.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you say, no, I will not.  This is, I don't know.  It's a good idea.  They can actually scale it.  If they can scale it, which they probably can.

Start time: 4870.18
End time: 4893.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it does is it does respond to both of you guys  who say, I don't want any ads at all.  The problem is there are plenty of products  nobody's going to pay for.  I mean, look what happens with paywalls  on a lot of publications, right?  Fortune's not going to put a paywall up  because they look at the Wall Street Journal  or whoever.  They threaten to put a paywall up.  Yeah, and I think they probably thought about it  and realized that's not going to make any money.  It's a bad idea.

Start time: 4894.22
End time: 4901.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's user hostile.  But ads are different from product referrals.  All right, like what I...  Well, that's what I do.

Start time: 4902.10
End time: 4906.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like when we do an ad, it's a product referral.  Yeah, well...  It's a word of mouth recommendation for a product.

Start time: 4907.12
End time: 4910.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's right.  And I think if you had...  So we're very picky.

Start time: 4911.14
End time: 4929.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We pick the clients that sponsors products we use.  You are picky?  Yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, I turn down ads all the time.  You have to because I consider it introduction.  Yeah.  I mean, that's kind of my rationalization.  I mean, I want to be ad supported media  and my rationale is,  well, okay, if I'm going to do this,  I only want to recommend products, I believe.

Start time: 4930.38
End time: 4947.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's got to be high quality.  And the way that you do it is aligned  with the interests of the listener,  which is you're trying to make it high quality  and entertaining and a net benefit  to someone's quality of life  because it wouldn't work if it wasn't.  Right, and also gives us...  So those kind of ads are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really, that is the value of ads in general.  It gives you a chance to go to the kitchen,  get a snack and not miss much of the show.  The funny thing is,  I don't think people for the most part anymore  are watching live broadcasts.  They're watching on demand even when they're watching...  Sports ball.  Sports is about it.  So like, okay, so House of Cards are...  Well, that's a bad example  because it's not ad supported,  but...  Oh, Fargo.  Great show.  But I'm not watching it live  because I want to skip the ads.

Start time: 4980.08
End time: 4992.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and sometimes I'll watch something on demand  that has disabled the ad skipping.  That drives you crazy.  I never watch it again.  Right.  Like I just...  I can't remember...  There isn't much that makes me angrier than that.

Start time: 4992.78
End time: 4999.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I understand your point of view.  I just...  It's scary for me.  Somebody sold me a button.  By the way, podcasts are exactly on demand.  I mean, what we do is a completely on demand product.  So presumably people could skip our ads  just as easily as they could skip a DVR.  Which aligns the incentives to actually make them

Start time: 5023.76
End time: 5027.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like good and entertaining and informative  so that most people don't skip them.  Exactly.

Start time: 5029.10
End time: 5035.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or we do a tease  at one end and then people stay through the ad  to the other end.

Start time: 5035.56
End time: 5038.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or you have the live chat.

Start time: 5039.76
End time: 5061.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we have live, but it's a tiny fraction  of the total audience that watches live  and is in the chat.  That's less than 10% of the audience.  That's not bad.  And we can't even monetize it.  Right.  So even though those people are compelled  to watch the ads,  we actually can't make any money off of them.  Only the people who could skip the ad  and we just hope that they don't skip the ad.

Start time: 5063.13
End time: 5150.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that we need in podcasting  is to know a lot more information about  whether people are skipping,  what parts when they stop listening to podcasts.  I really don't want to know that.  I really don't want to know that.  Well, no, I think you do because if people,  I mean, I monitor my own behavior  and there are some podcasts I listen to  and I love the podcasts,  but I skip the ads because they suck at reading them.  On Twitch shows, I don't skip the ads.  I listen to them because it's always different.  You probably just sewed out.  No, I'm curious to hear the new information.  It's mixed up and there's a lot more energy put into it.  It's a lot of podcasts.  You can tell these people doing the podcasts  are being dragged, kicking and screaming  into doing the ad.  They don't really want to do it.  Because they don't own company and so on.  And so it's like, it would be fantastic to know  when people are leaving, when they're skipping.  I think podcasters really need to know that stuff.  I think it would improve podcasts a lot.  The other problem I have with a lot of podcasts out there  is that people start a podcast  and it's like 20 minutes of like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  and they don't get to the point.  It's like, I don't have that kind of time.  I would like to be able to tell them,  look, get to the content.  You know what I mean?  I don't want 25 minutes of like hearing about your sandwich  or whatever.

Start time: 5151.94
End time: 5179.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny because when I first started doing this,  that was a really high priority value for us  was not to waste listeners' times.  And I think over time I've kind of stopped doing that.  I just waste your time like crazy.  I apologize.  It happens.  No, no, no, no.  So for me, I'm getting a little sloppy  because I just like talking with,  every one of these shows is with friends  and often that I don't see very often.  So I'm catching up,  but I probably shouldn't waste our audience's time  with catching up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should get right to the point.  See, but that isn't,  I don't think that is,  like I like that.  What bothers me is when they don't have new guests  and it's the same two people.  Yeah, yeah, that is boring.  I don't care about your relationship  so much as the content.  And you know, five minutes is fine.  Twenty minutes is fine.

Start time: 5280.53
End time: 5318.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because radio still exists.  The only reason radio still exists is the car,  frankly the car.  Because there's very little radio  listening outside the automobile.  And that is a very short-term thing.  Already music radio is suffering because-  But I'll tell you why it's not dead is  there is a value to having somebody  to keep you company in your car that is alive  and right now as opposed to pre-recorded.  And I think that is something genuine.  I mean, isn't it nice to watch live TV  or listen to live radio and know that  that person's doing this right now?

Transcript:  And I love Terry Gross,  this is not to knock her,  it's more to knock the format, the structure.  She was interviewing the son of George Martin,  the Beatles producer.  Right, because of the 50th anniversary.  50th anniversary, I was very interested,  I just bought it, I was really excited.  She reintroduced him in 25 minutes, five times.  And not just like, I'm talking to Glennis Jones,  it's like a long, she's clearly reading,  and this is Formatics, probably dictated by NPR.  I doubt, well, Miami Terry does do that.  She's pretty old-fashioned.  But it pissed me off because  I was interested in her subject  and I wanted to hear him talk.  I didn't want to hear her reintroduce him.  And it makes no sense on a podcast,  it only makes sense on broadcasts,  because it's only on broadcasts  that somebody might show up.  Right.  If you're listening to a podcast,  I don't need to re-interest you guys more  because it's a chance to plug you  and to acknowledge you and thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The advertisers want to know  and that's how we sell it.  And what do you use to measure them?  Well, we use,  we have been going through a company called PodTrack  which is a podcast advertising agency  that offers free metrics.  But we actually also do our own numbers.  We at first thought,  you know, it's traditional in broadcast media  that you, no one would,  if I were a radio station and I said,  well, I could tell you how many listeners,  you wouldn't trust me.  Right.  So there is Arbitron and Nielsen.  There's a third party independent kind of certified measure.  Just like the,  for magazines, the advertising, ABC, right?  Yeah.  The Circulation Bureau.  That's an independent metric.  But it turns out in podcasts,  they, for some reason,  they do trust podcasters.  Most podcasters just say a number and that's that.  Oh, that's good to know.  Yeah, just make it up.  Okay.  In fact, I know people are making it up  because I look at some of the numbers people quote  and I go, that's impossible.  There's no way they have those kinds of numbers.  So you could say that that's a failing of podcasting,  that there isn't this kind of independent metric.  I like it.  But we don't trust them.  We don't lie.  We actually under, we intentionally underestimate  because we don't want to get in a situation  where we're inflating numbers.

Start time: 5585.12
End time: 5609.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, I believe based on my own listenership  and viewership that you are better than anyone else  at keeping the audience listening and watching.  And that's why I think you benefit enormously  from metrics about how people,  how much they listen all the way through,  or if they listen halfway through, whatever.  That kind of thing, if that were measured  and were made public, it would dominate.  There's a cautionary tale.

Transcript:  For a long time, the way radio was rated  was you would get a diary, maybe some of you have received a diary  that said write down your radio listening  and at the end of the week mail it in.  And of course, nobody does.  It's one of the reasons I think Rush Limbaugh did so well  is that people were fanatics about Rush Limbaugh,  even if they didn't, you kind of look like Rush Limbaugh.  Oh, God, that's the worst one I've ever heard.  I've never put that together.  Sorry, Philip.  But shows that had devoted followers would do much better  because nobody ever recorded their actual numbers.  At the end of the week, they'd come and go,  oh, crap, I've got to mail this back.  I want my $5.  And they'd just write Rush Limbaugh, Rush Limbaugh,  right across the board.  And so shows with devoted fans would do very well.  Then Arbitron, the company that does this,  invented the People Meter.  Remember, Nielsen does this.  They have a box in your house that would measure.  Well, they came up with a way to measure it.  There's a company that's actually called Arbitron.  There's Arbitron and Nielsen.  Arbitron is the one that does most of the radio stuff.

Start time: 5670.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's suspicious that a company that's trying to give you  good stats is called Arbitron.  It's kind of arbitrary.  Yeah, that is an odd choice of name.  It's not what I would have gone with.  So Arbitron figured out a way to actual metrics.  It could have been like Precisiontron.

Transcript:  And the sad thing that happened, across the board,  stations had far fewer listeners than they ever saw  from the diaries.  This happened about 10 years ago.  A massive depression in audience ratings.  And surprisingly, like for instance in Los Angeles,  all of a sudden the number one station is a Spanish language station.  I wonder why.  It makes sense.  When they start measuring it accurately,  and maybe I'm the Spanish language station in this story, Mike.  Maybe I would benefit from accurate measurement,  but maybe not.  So let's not, okay?  You have to own a tag.  Yeah, it drives LA radio stations crazy  that you'll often hear them say,  we're the number one English speaking station in the market.  It drives them nuts.  But you know, the truth can be painful.  Truth hurts sometimes.  Phil Liman here.  It's great to have you from allturtles.com  with a dash in the middle from Morocco, from Fez.

On Tuesday, June 6th, Google is expanding  its Waze carpool service from the Bay Area  and limited areas surrounding  out to the entire state of California.  And who knows?  Maybe someday you'll be carpooling with Waze  in your neighborhood sometime down the line.

So Jason Snell next week, Jason Calacanis the week after.  I'm going to miss my mattress, of all things.  I'm looking forward to going out.  You're not taking it with you?  I'm not taking my... I could, though.  Startup idea.  I could have a Casper sent to the hotel in Lima.  Nice segue.  The Casper mattress is the best mattress in the world.  They're an online retailer.  Premium mattresses made in the U.S.  And because they're made in the U.S.  and sold directly to you, there's no markup,  no department... you know, department stores  that double the price of everything.  No mattress store markup.  So you're going to get a great mattress  for a fraction of the cost.  Obsessively engineered, it's made of supportive memory foams.  It's hard to describe this,  and this is why I want you to try the mattress.  It's got sink.  You know, you're comfortable.  It's not hard, but it's firm.  How could something... I don't know.  You just have to try this.  It sinks a little, I guess.  And it's breathable.  So as summertime's coming, it's going to get hot.  I want a mattress that helps you sleep cool  because we know you'll sleep better if you're cool at night.  Not too hot, not too cold.  Just right.  Long-lasting, too.  Great comfort, great support.  You buy it online, and here's the most important thing.  It's completely risk-free.  We're not talking about going to a mattress store  and lying in broad daylight with your shoes on on a mattress  while the salesperson gives you the stink out.  We're talking about taking the mattress home.  And actually, they ship in a very surprisingly compact box.  Look.  And you open it up.  It comes out, and they give you...  They get this wrapped in Tyvek.  They give you a little head cutter.  It goes...  And then suddenly, this beautiful mattress.  It doesn't smell like rubber or anything.  It smells fresh and delicious.  And it's...  Well, you might worry.  It's been in the box.  I'd eat it.  And then you got 100 nights.  You sleep on it for 100...  Any time in the first 100 nights, if you're tired of this,  you say, this mattress is not right for me,  they come and get it and take it away,  refund you every penny it costs you.  Nothing.  There's no risk.  You've got to try it.  Free shipping, free returns in the U.S. and Canada.  But not Machu Picchu.  Unfortunately, not Machu Picchu or the Galapagos.  I'm just going to have to suffer.  But you know, then it's one...  Traveling's great because when you get home,  it makes you appreciate it.  And you get in your own bed with my Casper mattress,  my bowling branch sheets, and I go,  oh, I'm home.  I feel so great.  Save an additional $50 on your mattress  if you go to casper.com slash twit  and use the promo code twit.  That way they know you heard it on the show.  Casper.com slash twit, promo code twit.

He then went to Auto,  which was his own startup, a self-driving truck.  Uber bought Auto and hired Lewandowski  and then got sued because, strangely enough,  the LIDAR on the new Uber self-driving cars  and the Auto looks suspiciously like the  invented at Waymo LIDAR that cost one tenth  what LIDAR normally costs.  The courts told Lewandowski that he had to turn over  information that he had evidence.  He asserted his Fifth Amendment right  to avoid self-incrimination.  Ooh.  A lot of people do in that these days.  Yeah, that seems popular.  I'm going to remember that.  I have declined to testify on the grounds  that I might incriminate myself.

They're sort of responding to accidents  and things like that.  It was really well done.  It looked so believable.  And I think that's, I think trucking is going to be  one of the first implementations of self-driving vehicles.  Makes so much sense.  Already truck drivers are pushed to the limit.  They're exhausted.  They tend to be often dangerous drivers  and so on because they have such big vehicles.  And they're on speed.  Yeah.  But if anybody is still going to see the movie Logan,  check out the detail with which they depict  this world of self-driving trucks.  It's so funny.

So this was decided in the Supreme Court this week  by an 8-0 vote.  The Supreme Court was hearing a case  about a company that was reselling,  taking Lexmark cartridges, refilling them.  These are printer cartridges?  Printer cartridges, inkjet cartridges.  A company named Impression Products  was refilling them.  Lexmark sued saying,  we have the patent on this  and you can't refill them.  The Supreme Court decided against Lexmark  by 8-0.  Actually, it ended up bidding revised  because Ruth Bader Ginsburg said,  well, okay, yeah, I agree,  except it should be U.S. only.  The 8-0 decision was originally U.S. and overseas,  the point being that a patent  and patent rights expire upon sale.  In other words, if you buy something,  you own it.  This is huge.  This is a big deal.  This is a big deal.  I was surprised to get more coverage,  maybe because it seems so technical,  but I think it really...

Transcript:  I tried to read it.  This is from Hacker Noon.  This is a guy named Terry Crowley  who was a former Hacker Noon.  He was a former Hacker Noon.  There was a guy named Terry Crowley  who worked on the Office Division,  wrote an article on where Microsoft  took a wrong turn in the 90s.  And it really was Longhorn.  And Bill Gates decided,  and this is the fascinating thing in here,  at some point Bill Gates decided  that HTML and the rich web had no future,  that in fact Windows presentation layer,  Avalon, was the future of middleware  and spent untold amounts of developer time and effort  on building up Avalon and Vista  and in deprecating the browser.  In fact, most of the Internet Explorer team  was moved off IE and over to Avalon.  I remember that.  Kind of a spectacular misunderstanding  of what the future would be.

Start time: 6979.40

Start time: 6983.15
End time: 6991.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The whole history of Microsoft, he writes,  from its origin is about the primacy  of software over hardware.  Hardware is a commodity.  Value lies in software.

Start time: 6992.05

Start time: 6997.17

Start time: 7000.30
End time: 7009.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7034.16
End time: 7077.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so there's a second story going on  as you read the article because what you're seeing  really is Sinovsky, he's no longer at Microsoft,  he can kind of speak his mind.  So there's annotations.  In recent horrors it's now.  Yeah.  As you go along there's underlinings.  That's one of the things I like about Medium.  You can see what other people have picked out.  I'm not seeing them right now maybe  because I have an ad blocker on.  But there's underlinings.  So you can see what Sinovsky says is really the issue here.  And in a way the second story is the successor at Microsoft,  Steven Sinovsky, and what he really thinks.  But he did it all with underlining.  Anyway, it's worth reading.  It's on HackerNoon.com which is a Medium.  I wrote a note to Steve Ballmer at the time

Start time: 7077.96
End time: 7093.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when they first announced Vista.  Because Evernote was a big Windows product.  Yeah, well still are.

Father's Day is just around the corner.  Ooh.  Harry's would be a great Father's Day gift.  I gave it to my son for graduation.  Oh no, for Christmas.  And he loved it.  I have to say.  Harry's knows that dads are tough to shop for.  Do not give dad a tie.  Unless Tad has a big bushy beard  that goes all the way down to his chest  and never uses a razor.  You might want to take a look at Harry's.  Actually, get one for yourself  and then give one to dad.  And the grads.  Harry's is all about a great shave at a fair price.  They bought the factory in Germany.  This is a great startup story.  Harry's founders got a little money.  You know, probably from somebody like you, Phil,  an angel investor.  How do we disrupt?  Is there really?  Yeah, right?  Oh.  Is that because of you?  No.  It's actually a mastodon.  It's a mammoth, yeah.  It's a mammoth.  It's a wooly mammoth.

Transcript:  So they got a little money  and they said how do we disrupt the shaving industry?  It's really clear that the...  In fact, it's even an adage.  The model is you give away the razor  and you make it up on the blade  and these blades are way overpriced.  They realized the best thing we could do  is buy the factory in Germany  that makes the blades and sell it direct.  So that's what you get.  You get amazing, well-made,  blades designed to work great,  give you a close, comfortable shave,  and you get it for about half the price  of those blades in the drugstore.  Actually, I shouldn't say that anymore  because you can actually find Harry.  There they are, Jeff and Andy.  You can actually find Harry's in the drugstore now,  which I was really pleased to see,  but you still get that great price.  The Harry's kit will get you started  with the razor handle, the moisturizing shave gel,  three of Harry's, five-blade precision engineered razors.  They have a limited edition Father's Day shave kit.  I don't think I have that here.  Maybe I do.  Show it on the, yeah, no, this is the orange one.  This is the beautiful, it's beautiful.  It's a storm gray razor handle.  Plus you get the chrome razor stand.  You get the foaming shave gel, three replacement blades,  the travel cover, which I will use tomorrow  and I use all the time.  It's really a great idea to keep yourself  from getting cut when you reach in your shaving kit  to get your blade.  I love it.  Plus it comes in a sleek, giftable box.  You can even add custom engraving  in a personalized card for free.  This is a nice gift.  And right now I'll get $5 off,  actually any shave set, at harrys.com slash twit.  Sean Parker's back.

Transcript:  The music industry didn't like that too much.  But his new thing, and Hollywood doesn't like it  too much again, is premium video on demand.  This new acronym, PVOD.  That's a good one.  How does it work?  That's a winner.  PVOD.  Well, the company's called Screening Room.  So you rent the movie.  Instead of the inexpensive $4 for a movie that's been out  and out of the theaters and months later,  you rent it for 40 hours for 50 bucks.  20% goes to the movie distributor.  A theater chain, I guess they're going to work  with theater chains, would get up to 20 bucks.  Each customer would get two tickets to see that title  at the theater.

Transcript:  I love this one.  I use Delicious.  Remember Delicious?  It's a great bookmarking site.  Got bought by Yahoo.  Yahoo managed to kill it pretty good.  Then the guys who started YouTube bought it.  Weirdly enough.  Then they didn't want it.  It's been sold five times.  Five times.  The YouTube founders bought it in 2011.  They sold it to Science Incorporated in 2014.  Science sold it to Delicious Media in 2016.  During this whole process, when Delicious was bought by Yahoo,  I moved to Pinboard.  The guy who does Pinboard had this great model.  If you get in early, you pay less.  As more people use it, his server costs go up, you pay more.  I've been very happy.  It cost me $12.  He must be doing all right because he just bought Delicious.

It's such a cool service.  It is great.  Apparently all your bookmarks, if you use Delicious, are still there.  They didn't delete anything.  Maybe there will be some future for Delicious.  Speaking of Delicious.

Transcript:  You know what's funny though?  Delicious looms large in all of our minds  because at some point it was the flavor of the month  and it was the new hotness and all that stuff.  You're looking at 2008 or something like that.  It only acquired 5.3 million users.  Yeah.  Compare that to Facebook or any social anything nowadays.  It's amazing how tiny it was  compared to how big we remember it.

I think it's time to have a little quiet thank you  for our fabulous hosts.  Mike Elgin visiting us from Morocco.  Wow, that was cool.  Find out more about Mike and Amir  and what they're up to at gastronomad.net  and read his great writings in Computer World.  I didn't even get to your fabulous article  which I talked about on the radio show  about why businesses should prepare for a laptop ban.  Not that it's imminent, but when it happens,  it will happen because there was an incident.  It'll happen like that and all of a sudden  you won't be able to carry laptops on an airplane.  It'll be like sneaker bomb.  It'll be a huge deal.

Transcript:  Because that's even more dangerous.  That's dangerous too.  Very dangerous.  There was a fire and lithium ion batteries burst in flame,  but fortunately they were in the cabin  where they could be dealt with.  Had it been in the hold,  it might have been a whole other matter.  You need cloud services and airport laptop rentals.
