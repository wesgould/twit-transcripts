Transcript:  This is twit, this week in tech, episode 48 for April 2nd 2006, Apple's 30th anniversary.  Hi, this is Leo Laporte and I'd like to welcome you to a special edition of This Week in Tech.  No news, a new crew. We're going to talk a little bit about the 30th anniversary of Apple Computer  and with it of course the 30th anniversary of the personal computer revolution. Don't worry,  the regular cast of twits will reassemble next week for our usual broadcast. We do want to thank  our friends at AOL Radio for providing us with the bandwidth for this podcast at AOL.com slash  podcasting. And now to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Apple Computer, Steve Wozniak,  Andy Hertzfeld, Randy Wiginton, Bill Fernandez and Dan Kotke. Hey Bill, how you doing? Excellent,  greetings. Good, it's good to hear you. I've got as you can see Daniel Kotke, Randy Wiginton and  Andy Hertzfeld in here. Hi guys. Hey Bill. So first of all, happy anniversary. Let me probably  should introduce in order of Apple employee ID number and I think Bill you'd probably get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pride of place until Woz gets here. I'm number four. Number four. Hired after Woz jobs in Marcola.  And hired on April Fool's Day 1976. No, I think it was like February. Oh okay. I'm not sure when

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  exactly it was. Well what a lot of people don't remember is that this is actually the anniversary  of Apple's second incorporation. Randy Wiginton. The first was actually done at Jobs House and it  was sometime in the fall. It was like after one of the homebrew computer club meetings. Except then  at that point I think like Ron Wayne owned a third of Apple which he sold for $900 and other things.  I don't think it was set up very well. But that was actually the first incorporation. We were trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to track Ron Wayne down. I thought it'd be fun to see what he's up to and whether he has any regrets.  He's probably out drinking heavily. Well I think Woz told me that he was just scared. He was afraid  of betting the farm on this crazy little company. He had lost money on every investment he'd ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  done. So he was thrilled to get his original investment back. He got his money back. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill were you at all nervous joining up in those early days? No not really. These were some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knew and it sounded like a great and fun thing. I was still living with my folks and my car was  paid off and I wasn't married so I figured what the heck I could take a risk. Was your job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mainly soldering? What exactly were you up to in those early days? My title was electronic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  technician which means technical jack of all trades. I do everything from running to the store  to pick up parts that have been ordered to designing and building burn-in boxes and test fixtures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this was on the at that time I guess it would have been would have been the Apple One still or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was the Apple Two? Yeah it was the Apple One. Yeah I think we'd had the first batch of Apple One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And who was next in the group? Was it you Randy or? I would be next. Yeah Rod Holt was number five.  I was number six and then Scotty was number seven. It's fun do you still have those old badges? I still  have mine. That'd be fun to have. No I think they took mine when I left. Give it back. How long were you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there Bill? Well I was there for about a year and a half and then some other friends I'd worked with  before hired me away and then I went to Japan for a couple years and then I returned in about 81 to  work on the Mac project. I worked on it with about 15 people on it. That seems total life worked about 13 years for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems very common that people come and go isn't it? Yes. Many people have. It's common in this industry in  particular. Yeah many people have multiple tenures. Randy what were you doing in those early days? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was in high school. Really? Oh yeah. I actually started I started working at Apple before I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  drive. The entire executive staff at Apple went to Randy's high school graduation I think. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  true. That must have been fun. Very unusual honor. Watt would come back from one of the Homebrew  Computer Club where he had taken an Apple One to show and he'd come back raving about some high  school student who'd done some fantastic demo on it. Something with colors and something with  graphics and I think Randy Wiggington was one and Chris Hesbunn was another that I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  particularly in those days. So I mean for all of you was this your first experience with a personal  computer? I had actually worked on a friend's IMSAI. Yeah and there was the Mitz Altear too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nobody had the Altear it was too expensive. They were going for the IMSAI. And I was doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  timesharing and I had my own KSR 35 which was the military version of the Teletype. This must

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have been pretty exciting at that time though the idea of building a mass-market personal computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well throughout high school I and all of my electronic buddies we wanted to build our own  computers so to finally be able to have your own computer was incredibly exciting. Yeah. Leo I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think any of us really thought of in terms of a mass market for computers. I mean we just wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one for ourselves. Daniel what number were you? Well I worked in the garage in the summer of 76  and then went back to finish my senior year of college in Columbia. So I was employee number 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in June of 77. Is that garage still there? Somebody suggested that the best place to do this would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have been in the garage. Well the garage belongs to somebody else now. It's been through many changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  since then. I was actually there this year. All the numbers on the street. The houses all got read numbers. Do they know what they're living in? I mean do they know the history of the garage? I went and rang the doorbell but nobody in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said who's that weird guy out front? Don't answer it might be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Hewlett Packard of course has saved the old HP garage but in many ways I think this is an even more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  important garage frankly. Well Apple hasn't saved it. Somebody's gonna have to step forward and save it. I guess. You're asking about who worked for Apple first. To be honest  Daniel Cocky and Patty Jobs, Steve's sister, helped stuff the Apple One board and do testing and so forth before the company was incorporated. So they were the first pre-employees if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't get a number for doing that. No they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah well I worked in the couch days too so that doesn't count either. The couch was before the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Andy of course you came along a little bit later Andy Hertzfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I started there in August of 79 so much later than all the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think maybe among all of us you have the best sense of history. I mean you started the folklore website to keep track of all this folklore.org. You've written a book on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah mainly though on the development of the Mac which was a couple years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah but also Andy is better at telling stories than most of us so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys stay in touch at all? Have you kept in touch over the years? Are there reunions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In various ways every once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was no party from Apple though as I understand. Nothing to commemorate this. You didn't get a pin in the mail or a little paperweight? Nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen Bill Fernandez in a while but I used to see his mom all the time because she would come to the concerts at Shoreline in Waz's box. So I've seen her much more frequently than I've seen Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah well what I've found in this industry is that you fall out of touch with people for years and then you start a company with them and you're as thick as thieves for a couple years and then you fall out of touch with them again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it like that in the early days? Was there a sense of kind of tight knit group doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it was so much tight knit as it was at least for me and it seemed like for the people around us that we knew we were involved in something very very special.  So it's not like we were a clan against the world. It's like we had this amazing opportunity to do something wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Randy was saying that you all wanted your own personal computers. This was the best way to go about it is to build it as a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that there was a transition between the first batch of Apple I's and the second batch of Apple I's. With the first batch of Apple I's it was like finally hobbyists can have their own computers.  And with the second batch of Apple I's it's like hey maybe everyone else could have personal computers too.  And I think that there was a big shift in the expectation and the philosophy and where at least for me the mindset really opened up to embrace more of the world than just the hobbyist market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm different than the other guys because I came to Apple as a customer. I bought an Apple II when I really didn't know hardly anything about Apple or any of the people.  But it was such a tremendous product. It drew me to Apple inexorably. I couldn't resist becoming an Apple employee because of the greatness of the Apple II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some people might think well here we are celebrating the anniversary of a company but I think really it's much more important than that.  It's the beginning of an era of the personal computer era and it started in that garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes and I think that's really true. Apple is cool and Apple has done wonderful things and Apple has played a pivotal role in a lot of this.  But I think that the more important thing for humankind is that is the opening up of personal computers to the world.  And the empowering of people to do things they couldn't possibly have imagined before because now they have tools that they can understand and they can use to do wonderful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there was a sense that they were doing this for ourselves, for hobbyists. Was there at the time that you were building a new market, a mass market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, Wads built it for himself and he went to show it to all the other people who wanted to build their own computers at the Homebrew Computer Club.  And Job says hey we could sell this. And the first sales were really, if you will, to hobbyists.  But as soon as it went to say the first West Coast Computer Fair when we showed an early Apple II, that's where it really started being kind of beyond the hobbyists.  And then one of the first programs that was written for the Apple II was a checkbook balancing program that Mike Markle wrote in Basic.  And that's really, and some of the early advertisements for Apple where you see the Apple on a kitchen counter, there was really that shift to a computer for the masses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as one of the masses like Andy at the time, I very much remember the excitement that wow, you can afford this, you can have this, and you can do your own thing with it.  And it was also important that you could write your own, you know, because of Apple Basic, you could write your own software too.  You could.  That became a very big part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now that still made it like a do-it-yourself product at that point.  But even back in those days, in my mind, the core motto of Apple was power to the people.  The power implicit or inherent in computing technology make it available to the people.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's pretty exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the people were much, much farther beyond the hobbyists and the technicians and the scientists.  One of the wonderful things about the Macintosh in particular was it opened it up to artistic people, creative people, not just technical people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the time the Macintosh rolled around, we were very conscious of what we were doing.  We had seen the success of the Apple II.  We knew that there was a mass market for personal computers, but we knew that the ease of use issues were holding it back.  So we were very conscious with the Macintosh of, you know, sort of removing the ease of use barrier so the mass market can enjoy their personal computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you knew that something was happening by then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, by then it was already into the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we were mostly guys, so you'll understand it when we say that a mantra that we repeated over and over again was that we were developing the Mac for our moms and for our sweethearts.  So these are people who we wanted it to be nice for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the interesting things I think that the difference between the Apple II, the Apple III, and the Mac, you know, is the Apple II we were doing it for ourselves.  The Apple III we were doing everything that all the MBAs said we should do.  And the Mac, once again, we were doing it back for ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, boy, you can tell the difference, can't you, in the three products?  I think so.  It always seems better to do it for yourself. I would draw that conclusion from that.  Were there a lot of sleepless nights early on? Was it a hectic schedule or was it fairly easygoing? I mean, everybody was young and kind of hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was pretty easygoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Things kind of accelerated a little bit, you know, as we got into our first building and then our second building and we got the manufacturing set up and we started hiring a lot of people.  But, you know, it wasn't, you know, the first couple of years I think it was kind of pretty normal business in terms of the intensity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was software a big part of it in the early days or was it all about hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was started out with a piece of hardware upon which you could write software.  But sort of as soon as we had that, then it really became all about software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Randy's a software guy. He says software is huge.  Yeah, it is huge.  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the whole reason that the disk drive worked is because it was half hardware and half software.  Right.  Was, you know, brilliant at integrating the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point. It is not just application software. There's the system software below it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Well, the Apple has always been based upon sort of a hardware-software synergy.  At least the Apple I and II work.  And the Mac again. I don't know about the Apple III.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a false dichotomy. I mean, Randy, that's, you know, you work both on hardware and software with the drive.  Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But for, you know, for the buying population, you know, it was really became all about software.  You had a piece of hardware upon which you could run software that you wanted.  Because for the buying population, you didn't really want a new tool or a new machine.  You wanted a checkbook balancer, a game player, an online terminal.  You know, you wanted things that would do something for you.  And the computer being a universal machine, you could make it whatever you want with software.  So software that would make it do what people wanted became really the key thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even from day one, you were already building computers for the public.  But do you remember your first show or your first conference, the first time you actually met the people who were buying these things?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First West Coast Computer Fair, Convention Center or Civic Center in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've actually got one good story which ties in with a question you were asking earlier about all-nighters.  When we first introduced the disk drive, up until then really, before the disk drive, the Apple II wasn't taking off.  I mean, it was selling, but it wasn't exactly taking off.  And we first debuted at the CES in Las Vegas.  And the night before the show, Was and I worked all night.  What we'd do is we'd work for an hour and then we'd go and gamble for an hour.  That's when Job, that's when Was taught me how to gamble.  Of course, I was 17. The casinos didn't seem to mind.  That was the first time we met people like normal people.  West Coast Computer Fair, yeah, we showed it.  But basically they were all people like me, you know, I mean geeks, right?  And when we went to CES, we showed it to people who were like normal, which was weird.  You know, it was like there were all these, I mean, they're beautiful car models.  And you know, I mean, you know, car stereo booths and all this kind of stuff there.  And all sorts of people were coming by and getting all excited about what we were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People in suits. Exactly. Was that a little weird?  That was very weird.  Did it kind of change how you thought about what you were doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, all of a sudden I realized that, you know, people like that I knew in my real life,  you know, outside of work would be using it.  People would be using it at school.  People would be, you know, actually doing checkbook balancing and being able to save stuff on the disk.  Because before that, everything on the cassette tape, I mean, that was, you know, that was fun.  But it wasn't what anybody really enjoyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a music student at Columbia when I came to work for Steve in the summer of 76.  And so I had no experience in electronics at all.  So the Apple One was kind of a revelation to me.  And I just jumped right on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So unlike these other guys, you weren't an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I wasn't at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what was Steve's interest in you? Why did he hire you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he just, you know, he was working hourly a few hours a day.  So I was answering phone calls and testing Apple Ones and shipping them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody had to do that while everybody else had their soldering irons in hand, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, to follow the earlier thread, you know, when I arrived,  Patty Jobs was plugging chips onto the Apple One boards on the coffee table in the living room.  So that was actually before the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the coffee table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the coffee table.  That's why she could watch television while she was doing it.  And so the PC board assembly got moved into the garage when I showed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember that, you know, the boards and the bags of parts were in the bedrooms.  And the only workroom was like, you know, on your bed or in the coffee table in the Jobs' house.  And then, you know, after, I think, the first set of boards,  then Mr. Jobs, Paul Jobs, set up some work benches around the perimeter of two walls of the garage  and really turned much of it, converted the garage into a little base of operation for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel bad that Steve Jobs is not with us.  Waz is going to join us later.  But even in his absence, how would you characterize Steve Jobs' role at the beginning?  Cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cheap?  Cheap?  His job was to get all the parts prices down as low as could be.  He was very good at that, too.  He was awesome.  Waz and I always used to joke about how he'd be saying,  well, I think you better go sharpen your pencil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how is it that somebody, you know, a barefoot guy, dropout, college dropout,  was able to convince these big electronics firms to sell their stuff for less?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think you look at it as more of an industry.  Back then, it wasn't an industry.  You know, I mean, I would call up these parts houses and they'd send me parts, and I was only like 15.  I mean, it's like...  It was all hobbyists at that time.  It was all hobbyists at that time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in the Bay Area, there were many electronic suppliers that were set up to supply all of the electronic startups  that were spin-offs of Varian, for example, and Hewlett-Packard.  And all these...  Hewlett-Packard was sort of like a startup that was spun off of people who'd worked for other companies.  So there were a number of electronic suppliers who were accustomed to people calling up and placing orders,  and they'd give you prices depending upon, you know, what quantity you ordered in.  And you could just call and set it up for will call, which means I will come by and pick up my parts later  and pay for them at this will call counter,  or you could get an account where they would bill you, you know, for the parts that you supply.  So there were companies accustomed to working with a variety of sizes of customers  with a variety of price points.  So part of the trick was convincing someone that you should be at a different price point than someone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did individually you each realize that you were involved in something that was more than just a company?  Or is that something you knew all along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when I went to work in the garage, I felt that there was magic palpable in the air.  Even then?  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had no clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were building something that would have the potential of putting the power of computing technology  into the hands of ordinary people.  Were the two Steve's true believers at that point, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, only jobs.  Was was just in it for the fun? The girls? What?  He was for the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not the girls for sure.  No, I mean, actually, he didn't even originally want to start the company.  I mean, one of the famous nights is the night that jobs called all of us.  I was friends and said, Hey, you need to call Steve and tell him to do this startup.  You know, I mean, it's like we have the chance to do something amazing, you know,  and was wanted to stay at HP and, you know, just be an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a tough decision for me. That was all he'd ever wanted to do.  I've heard him talk about it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was working with Wad at HP at the same time.  We were both in the calculator division.  And I think I jumped ship from HP first.  And then later, jobs that Markilla kind of had to prevail upon him to commit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get the sense even today that he's kind of the reluctant mogul.  He would just as soon be sitting in the back room designing something, I think, than anything else.  Well, he's not a business man so much as a person who just loves things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he loves technology. He loves education and so forth.  And he wants to be involved in the things that he loves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a big kid, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. Hasn't come that far since Dial a Joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if it weren't for jobs and somebody saying, Look, we can make a business out of this.  Look, let's, you know, we can change the world. Let's get this together.  It might not have happened.  Oh, absolutely not.  It wouldn't have happened.  Yeah. Yeah. He really was the motive for this without again, without a brilliant design like Wazza's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wouldn't have happened either because there were other designs out there.  There was the processor technology, Saul, and there was the inside out there and so forth.  And later there was the Commodore PET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was it that made the design so brilliant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For one thing, it did useful things.  It did them relatively easily.  And for another, it was really inexpensive to build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Wazza was always focused on how few chips I can build this with.  And make it reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wazza and I built a computer in my garage several years earlier with surplus parts that he had talked out of the application engineers at Signetix.  And we spread them out on my mom's living room carpet.  We started putting a little envelope and filing them.  And he said, You know, we've got enough parts here to build a computer.  So we went home and designed one.  And he came over to my garage and, you know, I did most of the construction.  He did most of the design. And we have a little computer there.  So he's always been interested in doing that.  He's always wanted to build computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the main thing that I just marvel about is how far the technology has come.  There's been so many generations since then.  You know, the Apple I and Apple II generations were chips with sockets that you could swap out.  And in fact, hey, Bill, can you hear me?  Yeah.  Do you remember Chris Drake?  Oh, yes.  Chris Drake? I just got contacted by Chris Drake.  He has an Apple I that doesn't work.  And he wants somebody to help him fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was helping him out about a year ago, track down chips and giving him some information  because he was trying to get his Apple I working.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, the story that I remember hearing maybe from you was that Chris Drake and Phil Drake were brothers.  And one was a friend of Woz and one was a friend of Jobs.  And that's how Woz and Jobs knew each other.  No, they were brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were brothers.  Phil did go to Homestead High School with Woz.  And Chris was a contemporary of Jobs and me.  But I was the one who introduced the two of them.  It was on our street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you get credit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you all go to Homestead or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the two Dreiks and Woz and Jobs and I went to Homestead.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Randy and Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope they've dedicated a room there to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, really.  It's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all went to the same high school.  It's kind of incredible.  So why did you introduce the two Steves?  Did you think that they'd get along?  Oh, they were both electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they were both electronics buddies.  You know, I'd been doing electronics projects with Woz.  And then I'd also do electronics projects with Jobs.  And then Steve was over one day.  Jobs was over one day.  And I was going to go across the street to Mr. Taylor's house.  Mr. Taylor was this fellow who had had an electronic surplus store.  He'd closed it out and moved the stock into his garage.  And I would do weeding and painting and stuff for him.  And we'd have a little booklet we'd collect the hours in.  And then I'd trade in my hours against electronic parts.  And I needed some electronic parts for some projects.  So I said, so Jobs tagged along as I went across the street to knock on Mr. Taylor's door.  But before I got there, I saw that Woz was out in front of his house,  which was next door to Mr. Taylor's, washing his car.  And then I said, you know, Steve, you'd like to meet this guy because you're both into electronics.  So let me introduce you.  So we walked over and interrupted Woz while he was washing his car.  And I introduced them.  And after that, they started doing projects together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have you to thank, Bill.  If this hadn't happened this way, it still would have had to happen, right?  I mean, this revolution wasn't going to not happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The personal computer revolution would have happened in some way,  whether it involved any of us in this conversation or Woz or Jobs or someone else.  It would have happened.  Yeah, it had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, people were moving in that direction.  Technology was moving in that direction.  Science was moving in that direction.  Movies and entertainment were moving in that direction.  People's desires were moving in that direction.  You know, so it would have happened anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said an interesting thing, though.  It is amazing to see what's happened in just one generation, 30 years, one human generation, many, many computer generations.  Do you think we're going to see that kind of change continue?  Is it going to accelerate?  Are we just the beginning, really?  I mean, 30 years isn't very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we're definitely going to see very fast and drastic changes.  For example, things like electronic displays on paper,  where you can have a piece of flexible paper with colored displays,  where you could have graphics arts books or newspapers or something.  I think Hitachi and Fujitsu have announced that they both have technologies for that.  New battery technologies.  There are lots of people working on battery technologies.  And when we get batteries that will last, say, even twice as long, or better, 10 times as long as current batteries,  you're going to see amazing new things being built with those technologies.  And those are just two out of, like, 20 that are in the air and that people are talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's interesting.  All of you have stayed in this field.  I mean, you're all clearly still in love with this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, actually, one comment about software.  I think software is still continuing to accelerate.  I can write on a single line of code in a few seconds,  something that I would spend half a day crafting in assembly language back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you wrote MacWrite, was that assembler or was it Pascal?  No, that was all assembler.  It's all an assembler.  Wow.  That's kind of amazing.  I didn't realize that.  That's a little bit of a mind-blowing thing.  Of course, you had a very limited address space.  There wasn't a lot of RAM on those early Macs.  No, there wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was very cramped.  I'm still amazed that the thing worked at all.  Have you looked at the code lately?  Actually, I found one of the listings in my garage recently.  I was looking through it and laughing at it.  Laughing why?  Just, I mean, just how, I don't know, how hard it was to do everything back then.  And, I mean, just how compact everything was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things Waz said to me, and I think he said it with some sadness,  is that as you age, you really can't do these things that you did in your youth.  He would like to keep designing hardware, I think, but you just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waz had the whole opcode set for the 6502 memorized.  He would program directly in hex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was in his brain.  Now that's insane.  Yes, it is.  You talk about assembler, but he's not even writing an assembler,  he's writing a machine code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was amazing is that we would go up to the Homebrew Computer Club meetings,  and this was before he had the cassette working.  He would literally set up before the meeting, like an hour before when we first got in,  and he would just start entering the hex codes for his basic interpreter.  And so by halfway through the meeting, he would have it all entered.  I mean, this was like hundreds of pages.  And, I mean, it worked.  It was just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He may say he can't do this anymore, but I've seen him do tricks with numbers that blow my mind.  I mean, he's obviously still got a very agile brain  and still has some of those amazing skills that are still in there.  What are you doing these days, Daniel?  Did you become a geek or are you still a musician?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I definitely was a full-time geek for, you know, for 10 years.  Well, I still am, more or less.  Last year I was working on a contract for HeartMath Institute on a handheld monitoring widget  that, you know, measures your stress based on your heartbeat.  And I did a product that's not yet released that's a little message display with a USB port called the MessagePod.  We're still looking for a volume customer before investing money in custom testing on that product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys all still get excited about what you're working on?  Or is there a sense of, a little bit of a sense of, you know, when you built the Apple II and the Macintosh,  that those were the great days, you know?  Is it like looking back as a rock and roll band saying, you know, it's a little different now?  Or do you still look forward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I personally, I totally look forward. It's as exciting as it's ever been.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more exciting in some ways, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess I'm pretty jaded. I look back and I think, wow, what an amazing opportunity,  what an amazing time we lived through, and, you know, what an honor it was to be part of it.  How about you, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still love what I'm doing, but it doesn't kind of have the magic or the magnitude of like building an Apple,  a Macintosh, a hypercard, a QuickTime or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've been talking about you, Steve Wozniak, behind your back, but I'm glad you could join in.  Apple employee number one now, Steve Wozniak. Hi, Woz.  So here I am.  We've been talking about the old days, Randy Wiginton's online, Daniel Kocke and Bill Fernandez,  and talking about you and what a wizard you were.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, that's a lot of things. You know what? It's all part of the magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't just one person or two people.  I mean, we talked a little bit about how without Steve Jobs' vision and building a business,  it wouldn't have happened, but really everybody who's in a company in those early days  makes a huge contribution because there aren't that many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it's strange to be talking about it because I think, good God, I mean,  30 years since then, that's more than half my life.  It's a long time.  So far back, and yeah, but things were so exciting.  You actually remember a lot of things from back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was a long time ago, but it seems fresh to you still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those days do. Yeah. Yesterday, I couldn't tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were talking about, I guess Bill was, in this group, the first to get hired after incorporation,  but he pointed out that it wasn't the first time Apple had been incorporated.  Ron Wayne and you and Steve had incorporated once before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not really. It was a partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Partnership, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not quite a corporation. I don't really worry about the differences.  I don't really know what they are. I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember the day, though, April 1st, and that when you became a company?  Does that stick in your mind or was it irrelevant to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely not. I hear the date mentioned over and over, over the years,  but I don't recall at the time thinking, oh my gosh, we're doing something on April 1st.  Maybe we did it and just sort of occurred as an afterthought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I thought you must have had something to do with the choice of date, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thanks. Thanks. No, absolutely not. I had nothing to do with the date, whatever it was.  And the date was almost accidental because you're trying to get this done  and run that down to a newspaper and get this, this in.  And when the date happens, it's sometimes a little accidental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Leo, people will look at what Apple has been over the years  and think back to that initial date and think that there must have been something magnificent.  But I kind of imagine Steve and Steve sitting on Jobs' bed in his dinky little bedroom  sort of filling out formal papers and saying, how do I fill in this form?  You know, which isn't sort of elegant at all. Not at all.  Were there, but there must have been... One of the pieces of bureaucracy along the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But there must have been lawyers at this point.  And you had, was Mike Markkula already involved or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there were no lawyers. I think there were just friends.  Steve probably had a couple of friends that told him, here's what you have to do.  And you know, put this notification in a newspaper and fill out this form.  So he did the work on that part. I was doing my other work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, we've already talked about how you were the kind of the reluctant employee.  You didn't want to leave HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that was when we incorporated to become the real Apple with the Apple II product,  with a lot of money coming in. I was just scared of that world.  That wasn't the world that I really had dreamed of for myself  and didn't want to run a company and push other people around.  I just want to be part of a fun team, you know, sitting around joking, thinking up ideas, building things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Randy and Daniel and Bill have all said that Steve Jobs called around to try to get them to persuade you,  especially Bill, because he'd worked with HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sort of sense it, because everyone started calling me thinking that,  well, the amount of money that somebody's willing to invest in you is quite a bit.  And I think that was the big push then.  But I just went inside myself and thought it out philosophically.  And I wanted to design computers and write software.  But I had been doing that with no money, all in my own time. And I love doing that.  So I wouldn't really lose that. And starting a company, I would lose my job at HP.  I did, at first, say to Mike Markle, when he said, he'll put the money in, but I have to leave HP.  I said, well, why? I've done two computers and written a basic and all this other stuff I did in a year and a half period.  It's moonlighting. So why don't I keep on moonlighting, and then I'll have Hewlett Packard as my job for life?  HP had already indicated no interest in the product and all its divisions, although that was sort of wrong and phony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, it's one of the famous business failures of all time, is turning down the personal computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not only that, they turned it down being intrigued by it, but it wouldn't be done right by Hewlett Packard as a real product.  And they started their own calculator product right on my floor and didn't tell me.  And then I said, I don't want to work on calculators anymore. Computers are my whole life. I'll do anything.  I'll do a muesli job. I'll write it. I'll do a printer interface.  They had five guys assigned to writing the basic, and I had just written one on my own with no experience.  So I could do any job that's part of it, and I got turned down. And I asked for that job.  That's kind of amazing.  But the product they made was not interesting. I wouldn't want to be associated with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's good that they turned it down, because I don't think HP would have made the same computer that you guys ended up making at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. The one they made had a tape interface, but instead of a nice, easy, simple, cheap cassette tape that everyone has, that you could load games in on,  they had a data cartridge cassette, they had a tiny little screen with little black and white letters on it, and they had no graphics or color, no sounds paddles.  And the cost was extreme. It just missed the mark of what people would want, and it was too costly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you had to program it in reverse polish, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but that was part of HP's thinking. You get in a dilemma. When you do something good, when you can put 600 transistors on a chip,  and it takes three chips to have about a k-byte's worth of software to calculate sines and cosines and tangents,  they didn't realize that the reason that they had RPN notation, where you enter two numbers and then a plus sign to add them together,  they didn't realize the reason they had done that wasn't because it was super powerful scientific like computer scientists do,  because only computer scientists know reverse polish notation.  The reason they did it, they didn't have the software to parse a normal equation with parentheses and the like that we're used to, the same way we write them.  So when Texas Instruments did it, the engineers couldn't figure out how to solve a problem with parentheses.  They'd look at a big equation and start trying to execute it the wrong way. Just go left to right. Type in everything you see left to right, they didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were there compromises like that that you had to make in the design of the Apple I and Apple II? I'm sure there are many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's always compromises. The main thing was how do you do something with very little money and with not the experience, but so much dedication.  You'll figure out how to do whatever's needed to be done. I mean, that was the first time the Apple I was the first time I ever did a microprocessor.  The video terminal it came from was the first time I ever did text on TV. A pong game before that was the first time I did TV sets.  It was the first time I used dynamic RAM, first time I did a language basic. So these were all just firsts.  I mean, it was everything was total risk. Color, with the scheme that I thought up down at Atari one night, shift a shift register around and the signals that go out come up, go high and go low and go high and go low.  And if they go high and low at the right rate, it's sort of like color TV where you've got a wave that goes high and low at a certain rate, makes color on our TV set.  Would it work? There was no way to know if it would work. So there were, I mean, it was just a huge amount of lucky things happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill was telling the story of walking across the street when you were all in Homestead and walking across the street and seeing you wash your car and say, hey, to Steve Jobs, you ought to meet this guy.  Do you remember that first day that you met to Steve Jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I recall a little differently that Bill and I, Bill was, we were hooking up a computer in his garage and he said, you got to meet this guy Steve Jobs because he likes electronics and pranks and went to our high school Homestead.  So he called Steve and Steve came down right out in the cul-de-sac in front of Bill's house the way I remember it.  And I remember talking to Steve and trying to size him up comparing the pranks we'd done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thoroughly went on to do pranks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it a little bit of a measuring contest in those first meetings? You size each other up a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for me, yes. I was so shy. And I think Steve was a bit too. Out of my sphere, meeting new people was very difficult for me and I'd been told he did pranks.  And well, I started describing a bunch of mine because I had just done dozens of pranks and he described some of his clients going into the tunnels under the school and finding phone lines. So yeah, that was real.  Did you know at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This wouldn't be sizing up people in the kind of macho male sense of who's more powerful. This would be more finding points of commonality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that was how we got together. We sort of had a common interest in pranks that we could both laugh at the same things.  You know, we talked about music. We both liked the same music for the same reason, the wordy type folk stuff.  We also liked talking electronics and counter chips hooked up in a chain, you know, with drivers to drive LED.  And we both done that sort of thing to make displays and things like frequency counters.  So there weren't that many people in high school then that had been near that sort of thing. So of course we hit it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, guys. I'm looking for soap opera stories here. Big fights, you know, trouble. It sounds like kind of almost idyllic time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what? The press always tries to find some way to point. And they get things very wrong.  Something was against Apple or against what Apple's doing. They try to make a fight when there isn't any.  Actually, no one's ever seen me argue or fight with Steve Jobs ever, despite the fact he's known for that with other people saying rough crude things to them.  Not really with me. There are a few unknown incidences, but they're very, very minor.  I mean, it's almost like it was almost like, do we have two slots or eight slots? And oh, man, I said, get it. If you want to find another computer.  And it wasn't it wasn't because I believe date slots was critical to our success and growth.  And it turned out that it was it was for a different reason that I had a clever design that two chips decoded all these address ranges for eight slots.  Whereas the other approach being used by the Altair computers, the other little cheap computers, they weren't really computers.  They were just processors, but they weren't a computer with a keyboard, a programming language and enough memory.  But anyway, what they did was they had a bunch of dials on every board you plugged in that dialed what addresses it had, like a street address.  You dial in your address. This board is going to be addressed five eight zero zero.  And it looks for those addresses with comparator chips. It took, you know, for eight slots on that type of computer to take 40 chips for what I what I had a clever way to do in two chips.  A technique that had been suggested by my friend Alan Bowne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't what we remember. We did a homebrew sex segment on the screen savers. Alan was there and and all the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Alan was really the only other person designed part of the computer software.  We did some of the software of the monitor ROM.  He that is part of the Apple II design. Isn't it interesting?  We should have had him here. It's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daniel and Bill to hear was has lost none of his enthusiasm for this stuff.  I mean, he still loves it, doesn't he? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But young kids, young kids that age, young kids that age in high school, I want to encourage them as much as possible to go out and try to build your own things.  You know, because they're the ones that are going to find the interesting solutions we'd never think of.  You know, they're the ones are going to find the way to get people to Mars and maybe invent devices to make weapons obsolete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is it is. You're right. We're commemorating really a business event, not not a not a significant technical achievement.  But you have to pick a day. And as I was saying at the beginning, I think it's more than just the founding of Apple Computer.  It's really the founding of the personal computer revolution.  I mean, that's this is this is if you're going to pick one day, this is the day it began 30 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really look at the start of Apple II at a later date as the as the key element and the real corporation of the company in 77.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 77, you would say really is the it's good. We can do this again in a year.  Seventy seven was would you say was really the beginning? Was that the relief?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have two sides to this one. Every computer before the Apple one, especially every low cost computer, came with one of those airplane cockpit front with switches and lights and rectangles.  Every single computer since the Apple one came with a human keyboard.  There was a distinct split right then that was going to make it happen.  Yeah. And people were going to figure out you had to come with a little bit of wrong to run that sort of a machine.  Well, we use wrongs in our calculators at Hewlett Packard.  So I had a little advantage when it occurred to me that you could just build in a wrong and get rid of the front panel and have a human keyboard.  But, you know, but a real computer needed a certain amount of memory enough that you could sit down and type into a programming language.  To me, anything less than that wasn't really a computer.  It was just a processor and a few of us who could read data sheets knew what a processor was.  And it's a processor. The alter was a processor surrounded by some voltage protection chips and a bus.  And yeah, if you knew enough, you could do a bunch of right things and make it compute.  Well, it took a lot. Of course, the Mitz Alter didn't have a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just had switches on the front. You had a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And by the time you got to a computer that could run programming language, it cost a lot of money.  The type of RAMs they use, static RAMs, were so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So having a ROM, having a keyboard, having a monitor.  Dynamic RAM was a key also.  Dynamic RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first 4K dynamic RAM in 75. That was the first time ever it was cheaper than core memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? As late as 75? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I guess so I jumped right on to that is my God, that's the way to make it affordable.  I was thinking just for myself to afford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the price point that you hoped to get this out at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I had never thought I never thought of it as a product when I built it.  I just thought of what I could afford to pay. And that was probably up to maybe a couple hundred bucks.  Or I'd have to wait six months to save 400 bucks.  You know, the amount of money to even buy an alter was was a lot for me.  A lot of my income was going into a thing I ran called Dial-A-Joke.  That was back before you were allowed to own an answering machine or a telephone.  So it cost a ton of money to get the only machine being rented by the phone company.  And it really did eat up all my spare money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your dedication between computer Dial-A-Joke.  Must have been a tough choice.  Was Was a prankster in those early days?  In those early days, Bill, do you remember pranks from either Was or Jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I remember that Was was always pulling pranks.  I don't remember any particular ones except for the big one that he and Jobs did together  where they tried to pull a prank on the graduating class of 1972 at Homestead High School.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell us about that. I don't think I've ever read about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this is one of my best pranks ever.  Two of Steve Jobs didn't come off, but I'll let Bill tell this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so the Homestead High School has these big rectangular concrete block two-story buildings.  And behind them they have this big soccer field and the bleachers.  And so think of the soccer field where all the parents would be sitting in chairs  facing the bleachers where all the graduating students would be.  And behind them one of these big monolithic concrete block buildings.  They made this giant canvas flag that was, I don't know, maybe 10 feet wide by 8 feet tall.  And they made it and had it set up with pulleys and ropes so that when everyone was assembled  in the graduating class and the parents were looking out beyond their kids at the building,  the flag would roll down the face of the building and give a pleasant message to the parents.  Not exactly. Not exactly. I can correct that a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would unravel off the top of this one building as the students exited the graduation.  Half the students, the half coming out of, say, called the stage right side for the students,  those half the students would see the sign that had a Brazilian best wishes sign.  Although I have to say I talked to some people from Brazil and that was just a phony joke that Steve and I made up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We call it flipping off. We call it hand flipping them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flipping the bird.  Saying best wishes. I'm saying that with best wishes on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You painted a giant hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, a giant hand with a finger and the word best wishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ellen Bam's mother was an artist who helped us get the hand shading right.  His mom helped you?  His parents were so great at kids doing jokes, it was funny to them and I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical. Now, did it actually happen? Did it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Steve Jobs told some other seniors that were trying to do a plank to fill up the student quad with water or something.  He told them where our little fishing line, 40 pound fishing line ran and the next morning it had been cut.  We could tell it had been cut and not strained and stretched.  And I talked to one of the kids the next year and they said, yes, Steve told us where it was so we cut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now we've learned finally the root of Steve Jobs' paranoia and secrecy.  It all goes back to 1972.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he talked like he didn't tell anyone. When I asked him, did you tell him? No, I didn't, but he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you said there were two pranks. Does anybody know about this other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A few people must know about it.  We met a phone freak up at Berkeley who also said he could pick locks named Groucho.  That was his call name back then.  So we said, oh, come down to the high school. Steve knew how the sprinkler system worked at the high school.  He could pick his way into the shed.  We would open up the switches or attach some fishing line to the switches and turn the sprinklers on the parents on the football field.  Well, the students are watching in the stands during graduation.  And then we would epoxy. My idea was epoxy it shut so the gender can't run over and turn it off.  Oh, no. What happened?  He picked it. He picked it. He picked it at midnight and 2 a.m. and couldn't get into the building.  So I climbed up on top and moved something on top and there was a hole down in the building, but it was the wrong half of the building.  So it didn't come off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe a good thing. We might have ended up your years in juvenile detention center instead of designing the Apple One computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it has something very much in common with designing the Apple computer.  Going out and doing something you're inspired to do and feel and you have all this passion for and doing it at 2, 3 in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what hacking is all about, isn't it, really? I mean, hacking in a good sense, not in a negative sense, but in a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I did everything I could, everything I could to get any computer time.  I had my first class in it. It was a grad class at University of Colorado, but I ran the class five times over budget and they made it sound like they were going to charge me.  And so I didn't go back to that school. But the next year I had a friend who had a key to the De Anza computer room and we'd go in at midnight and start up all the machinery.  And I'd run punch card programs through and work all night on listings.  It's just like, you know, you just find a way to get access to a computer and that's all you want to do in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was it that made this so fascinating to you?  Bill, why is it that people are so interested in getting a personal computer?  I mean, we now take it for granted. Everybody's got one. We've got one in our phone, in our pocket, our PDAs, our MP3 players.  What was it about those days that you had to have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because you could do things with it, because you wanted to do things with it, because they empowered you to do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What kind of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For us as hobbyists, there were two aspects of it.  One, the technology and being able to get these things to work and do anything interesting was just really cool.  And secondly, being able to do something as interesting as a computer where you could make it do something interesting like draw graphics or do calculations or plan out your calendar or whatever it is that you wanted to do.  You now had a servant who could do it for you if you could figure out how to construct it and tell it what to do.  Why do people build robots?  I just saw something on PBS last night about the DARPA Grand Challenge about teams competing to build cars that would drive a 100-mile course by themselves.  Why do people do that? Because it's cool.  You know, I worked my tail off for six months. I built this thing and it ran this complicated course of 100 miles and it did it by itself.  And it solved all the problems. It got the desert. It got the mountains. It got the greenery. It got the red stuff. It got the obstacles. The person in the middle of the road.  Look, it did everything. It solved every problem. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me point out something about Bill's passion. He also had to make a big decision to leave Hewlett Packard to join Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he mentioned that. He left before you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually he was going to be our third employee but he got batch number four because he had to stick some time out at HP to a certain date.  And Michael Arpla came in officially for three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I left Hewlett Packard to go work in the garage before.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't fight over it. It's okay. It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on. It's possible because I kind of hung. No, the day that I decided we would start the real Apple II company, I told my boss and left Hewlett Packard that day.  Not one day in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You stayed there a long time. So Woz is badge one. Bill is badge four. Who's badge two?  Steve.  Because in the history books sometimes they say that when Steve found out that Woz was badge one, he asked for badge zero. Not so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know for a fact one way or the other.  I doubt that Mike Scott would have relented if he was going to badge zero. Because Mike Scott was kind of that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no badge zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know on the subject of anniversaries in history, I went to the talk at the Computer History Museum last month. It was the 50th anniversary of the founding of Shockley Semiconductor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which was February of 56 I guess. And so that's considered the birth of Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although you could go back to the 30s and Hewlett Packard really. It's hard to put one number on it. No matter what number you pick, it's relatively recent history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I started out in high school and got interested in electronics, I lusted after a good slide rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of those nice bamboo models, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And I actually carried a 6 inch plastic slide rule in my pocket protector through high school. And then during that time the four function calculators came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they were hugely expensive of course. They weren't affordable for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. And then also during that time, the Hewlett Packard 35 calculator, the first real scientific calculator came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that was an object worthy of lust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. So in my lifetime, I've gone from slide rules to a dual 2 GHz G5 Mac running OS X and a 20 inch color screen with millions of colors.  Being able to do 3D rendering and all sorts of amazing stuff just in this lifetime. And I've got many more years to live.  It's really remarkable.  I figure I'm going to see a lot more changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've gone from time seeing someone who came to talk at Apple and said,  I spent the last 10 years trying to get lines drawn on CRTs and taking frames of them with a movie camera to make animations.  To the time when any kid can buy an animation package and well, you know, they're using Halo to make a comedy series of epithets called Red vs. Blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Red vs. Blue, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where they use Halo as a 3D environment generator so they can do their skits.  That's amazing.  You don't have to be a technologist. You don't have to be a genius. You don't have to be much of anything except for a creative person. And they're amazing tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a way, that is the maturity and that is really what the big transition has been is that you don't have to be a geek anymore.  You could just be somebody with a creative mind and a desire to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And you asked, are we still going to see changes? Well, yes. And I'll tell you why.  Remember when Randy Wiginton said that now with one line of code I can do what it used to take me half a day to do?  Well, not only can he do it with one line of code, but thousands of other people around the world can do it with that same line of code.  And they can do it with one line of code, something that they could not have done themselves if they had a month to do it.  Because they didn't have the brilliance at the assembly language level that Randy Wiginton had.  You're absolutely right.  So you now have empowered thousands of people around the world to create new programs and new software because the tools are so much better.  So of course you're going to get more people doing interesting things.  Both Watts and Jobs were interested in making a computer that people could actually use.  Watts from the standpoint of things like I want you to have a keyboard and a CRT display rather than lights and switches.  And Jobs from the standpoint of I want a case that looks like an office typewriter.  And so that's a point where they were similar and on the same page rather than different.  Like the technologist versus the businessman dichotomy you often hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't think there really was a dichotomy so much in the early days.  Maybe they took different halves of the job. But I think you're exactly right.  They both were creating something as a unit. To me it's more like Lennon McCartney.  It's two halves of one like mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not at all. I did every bit. I never saw him with any technology. None of the design.  Hardware or software. So it takes somebody sitting down with ideas, playing with them, seeing what you can and can't do and coming up with new enhancements.  And wow, what if I connected this this way?  And you have to have chips in your head to come up with ways to even develop color out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had jobs not been there though, would any of this have happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, no. I think the business part is probably the more significant aspect.  I mean someone will do the equivalent technology eventually anyway.  You know, somebody it'll happen all on one chip a couple years later and be cheap enough.  You know, a lot of those things would have happened anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting it to market is also important. But don't sell yourself short because I mean what I think is the two of you  It needed both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yes.  Steve's had to have the vision for how computers could be used and fit into people.  And but he didn't really sit down.  We could use this chip and get this in a computer or have the ideas of what you could build at an affordable price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, in those days, the way the hierarchy was is you were judged by your technical prowess and nothing else. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have no idea. That's just me alone. That's all that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think for a lot of other people.  Randy, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was too shy to talk to anyone unless they noticed something good I designed and then I could talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When IBM came along with the personal computer, how did you guys feel about that?  Did it seem like it validated your dream or it just it wasn't such a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, actually the there's poetic justice on that, which is that the day that Apple ran the ad, you know, welcome IBM seriously.  The ultimate act of arrogance by Apple, a full page ad, by the way, full page ad.  I remember we were in Seattle meeting with Microsoft.  So, I mean, you know, we were totally sleeping with the enemy and had no idea that, you know, Microsoft was eventually going to come and, you know, be much larger than Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was that conversation about with Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that was they had to do a multi plan. That was they had to do a spreadsheet.  That's right. Multi plan.  They did the first spreadsheet was was truly terrible.  But, you know, they they had their own set of tools and so everything had to work with their tools.  I mean, they had some really smart people on it.  But, I mean, you know, you look back at those days and I mean, it was equivalent to using, you know, Flint axes, you know, on this stuff.  It was everything was so primitive.  And, you know, Gates was actively, you know, he was saying, oh, this is huge thing.  But, you know, you guys are still, you know, our favorite customers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, in those days, Apple was very got very huge fast and was much larger than Microsoft.  But that's because, you know, we built hardware and when you build the hardware, the last guy you get, you put, you know, 90 percent of your money into the hardware supplies, the parts you buy, assemble them in a factory and then sell them.  So you're basically nine or ten times larger than you would have been with just the software.  Although in retrospect, it's good positioning on the Fortune 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in retrospect, it might have been better to go with software from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. But I mean, to be honest, in those days, Bill Gates was light years ahead of the rest of us.  I mean, the rest of us didn't really see how you could make a business out of software because especially software was always stolen.  Right.  You know, and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even in those days, Bill Gates was was invading against piracy and people were stealing his basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Remember that letter that he sent to the Homebrew Computer Club was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't pay attention to it then, but I'll tell you, his basic just influenced me.  Having never programmed in basic, never thought I would want a basic.  I decided that was the right language for the startup computer days.  So I went and learned basic just to write us a language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you write the first AppleSoft basic or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the first Apple basic. It wasn't AppleSoft. Microsoft came along.  We were actually working on trying to define a really cool floating point basic.  And it was going to take us a while to write, maybe half a year or more.  Microsoft came up and said, hey, we have one. I don't know where it came from, but they had one for the 6502.  And that saved us the effort so we could move on to other things.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we just added some extensions to handle some of the graphic capabilities.  And that was AppleSoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In 1981, IBM comes in. You guys are now in a competitive business.  By then, had Apple changed significantly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. We were now being run by the Suits, as we called them.  All of the MBAs and the Tom Whitney's had come in and wanted to impose a corporate structure on Apple.  And it was just a very poor fit.  1981 also is when Scotty was fired and Markla took over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's point out that Mike Scott was our CEO, our president of Apple, from the day we started to the day we went public.  Yeah, he didn't run things like the Suits and Ties.  Randy just went around and saw who was inspired about doing what projects, encouraged them and talked about what they were doing and got them motivated to do even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was Steve Jobs doing in those years? What was his role?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Markla sat down when we all started, the three of us were together and said that, well, my role was obvious.  I had done all the hardware and software and the engineering.  And he was going to come leave his retirement and do the marketing.  And Steve's job would be to basically flow around to all the departments and learn to be an executive in every way at the company.  And that's exactly what he did.  And anything that was left over that needed doing, he'd do it.  Like Randy said, even getting parts, getting on the phone and talking to someplace in New Jersey to get us some parts we needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve was kicked off of the Lisa project for meddling with it in, I guess, late 80s.  And that's when he really took an interest in the Mac project.  So starting in late December of 1980s, Steve was really involved building the Mac team.  And then I remember in probably the fall of 81 when we first got the first IBM PC over at the Mac Group.  We took it apart, me and Burl and Andy probably and Brian Howard, and dissected it and came to the conclusion that it was actually quite comparable to the Apple III.  I mean, the Apple III looked very favorable by comparison for all its faults, I guess.  But technically, they were quite comparable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so did at that time did people say, well, this is no threat, IBM is just another follow on product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, of course, we were much more interested and enthusiastic about the Macintosh design that we had already prototyped.  Even then, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We laughed about how clunky the IBM PC was mechanically compared to, say, the Apple III, which was much more designed and much more integrated.  In terms of what it could do, they were comparable.  But in terms of how much elegance went into the design, it was just like a bunch of bolt-on parts in sheet metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple, of course, is still known for design and for elegance.  Was that always a part of the company?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, from very early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even starting with the engineering elegance of the WAS disk drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Apple II, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He really liked things to be elegant and beautiful.  And actually, that's one of the reasons he liked my designs over, say, Find Another Engineer.  Right.  It was sort of an artistic quality that you can't really describe or pay for.  But he likes those things to be done well and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember back in the job's house seeing architectural style renderings or graphical renderings of cases that Ron Wayne had designed.  And they all looked head and shoulders better than what anything else was doing out there, like processor technology saw, which had these nice wood side panels and so forth.  These designs were better and they weren't good enough for jobs.  So he went off and found Jerry Manach from Manach Comprehensive Design, who did the plastic case design for the Apple II.  And finally, he had something that looked the way he wanted.  So even from those very early days, having a design look and feel was just as important as having the design technology inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Going with a switching power supply, which was small and cool, rather than the big, giant, hot behemoth power supplies that were conventional in those days.  That was another thing in that direction.  We want things to be lean and sleek and elegant and the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it also avoided having to have a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even then you didn't want a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first computer. So some of these things kind of stick on. Once you've done it once, you put a value on it and forever try to save that fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? The seeds of the future are already present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's more just what Bill was saying, you know, trying to get something a little super and sleeker than the others out there.  You know, of course you got to do it at an affordable price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were you guys science fiction readers? Were you influenced by science fiction at all? I mean, was that part of it too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course. But I don't know if that's part of it. I think where you started out was in your early years, you know, six to ten to twelve years old.  You know, the sort of movies you like to watch, even through high school. It seems your direction. So of course we all, almost all tech people have that background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say that a lot of tech people tend to gravitate towards, say, science and fantasy or oriented entertainment.  But I wasn't involved in electronics because, you know, I had seen robots in science fiction.  It was because I got drawn to building things that worked. And I wanted to do it with electronics rather than, say, with mechanical parts, you know, on a lathe and a milling machine.  I love doing things with transistors and resistors and capacitors and making those things work.  And I wanted to build things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's a good point. It applies to me. And most technical people are practical type people, not theorists that would like the science fiction and maybe we could do this and want to be dreamers.  I think really the science fiction is an accidental byproduct of the fact that they love things that are complicated technically.  The stories of science fiction are complicated technically as to what makes something work or happen a certain strange way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yet I have to think that the vision of what could be the kind of imagining of how how technology could grow.  That I mean, that's part of science fiction, too. And that must have been some of it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Well, there are, you know, there's analogies between science fiction is people thinking of things that don't already exist.  Right. As were you. Engineers are always thinking of things that don't already exist.  The difference is the science fiction people, you know, they write stories that others read and the engineers try to actually make up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. And I'm with Bill on this one earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve has been talking about all the effort he put into designing with creative and cutting edge stuff and going back to the time that he and I built a computer in my garage.  That was the time that he taught me never to take anything at face value.  Always look at what things could do, not what their names were. If you had a flip flop and you needed an inverter, you could make it an invert.  If you had a NAND gate and you needed a pulse generator, you could make it a pulse generator.  You didn't have to add another chip with the name inverter or pulse generator to get the thing you wanted.  If you just thought creatively about what you already had. And that really transformed my engineering thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill, I have to thank you because I try to put that concept into words over and over and I can never do it as well as you just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, thank you. You're welcome. And thank you very much because you really changed my way of thinking, you know, forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's also the power of constraints. I mean, even in poetry or the arts, having some constraints sometimes enhances creativity.  Not having all the money in the world or as many chips is maybe that's why HP couldn't do as good a job as you guys did because you didn't have all of the resources.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You had to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It forces you to think about other different ways of doing things than the normal. Yes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what I think. It influenced Steve's design a lot because he didn't want to spend a lot on the chips because remember he was doing this all out of his own pocket.  He didn't have a corporate bankroll.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also was very lazy. And if I designed something with half as many chips, it meant half as many wires I had to bother soldering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Annie in some ways has been keeping the oral history alive with folklore.org.  I actually want to ask all of you. I mean, there have been a number of histories written of Apple Computer.  I've heard Woz say that none of them were accurate. In fact, Woz says he's trying to live up to the picture that people paint of him instead of the truth.  Are there anything, any just horrible blunders that you'd like to correct at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only one I can think of is just that, as Woz pointed out earlier, is that a lot of people think that Mike Markle was CEO.  And that wasn't true. It was, you know, Mike Scott was CEO for many years and, you know, did a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Markle had put money in early on. Was that his role early on?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he was also the one that assembled the business. You know, as someone said earlier, he was the adult.  And he knew how business ran and who you needed. He was the person who found Mike Scott because he said, you need a real president. You can't do a job.  You need a real president. So let's get Mike Scott because he knows how to do this stuff. And you need to incorporate, so this is how you do it.  I can put in some money, but you need more. So this is how you go and you get money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Markle was CEO after Mike Scott and before John Sculley for about a year. He hated it, I think. He did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He aged about 20 years during that one year. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Takes a certain kind of personality to do it, I guess.  Andy, you came on, you said you were an Apple fan. You came on in 1979. What kind of company was it when you joined the Apple company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it was still exploding in terms of growth. It was growing incredibly fast. Everyone was really excited.  The Apple II was... I came just before VisiCalc came on the market. I think I started in August 79.  And then VisiCalc started really taking off just shortly afterwards. And so Apple's growth just took even another step way forward.  So, you know, there was a certain euphoria, I think, because the Apple II had found the sweet spot and it was growing like crazy.  At the same time, Apple was consciously trying to mature.  And instead of the homebrew roots that came from started hiring all these engineers from Hewlett Packard.  I remember Randy once called them Mock Lydesdale engineers because they seemed more for a show than for their actual skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe they plotted a little bit too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it was very much a company in transition, I would say.  Trying to grow up, putting all its resources into the Apple III and Lisa, which didn't end up being their future.  But luckily, you know, Jeff Raskin had this small Mac team that did eventually create Apple's future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me about the beginning of the Mac team. Was it a pirate organization right up front?  Was it kind of a black box organization, a skunkworks? Or was it considered important for the company right from the beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it wasn't from the beginning. It was Jeff Raskin's baby.  Jeff had a dream of an ultra simple, ultra low cost computer.  He was head of pubs at Apple, but he also was a thinker and he started writing papers.  The first one I remember was called Computers by the Millions that analyzed what it would take to sell computers by the millions.  And his answer was extreme simplicity along with extreme low cost.  So he kept lobbying Tom Whitney and Mike Markla for some people to help him set up a little team.  And finally, in the fall of 1979, they allowed him to do that.  And his first great find was Burl Smith, who he recruited from the service department.  And Burl did an incredible job at designing a little digital board for him, and that's really what made the project take off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have to remember also that the Mac project was given to Raskin so that Raskin would get out of the hair of Tom Whitney and all those who were doing the important stuff, which was the Apple III and the Lisa.  So it was really sort of like kicking him out to the side office. That's how it was internally done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at the sort of people that Jeff staffed Macintosh Group with, it was the most incredible collection of creative and humanistic people in the company.  I mean, there was a bit of that in the Lisa Group, too, but it was a rare strange blend of people, people like Andy Hertzfeld and Burl Smith and Bill Atkinson and myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All the people you had on the show, even though I'm the only one who wasn't involved in very early Apple, all of them were involved in the Macintosh project in its early stages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that's interesting. I wonder why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think when Steve took it over, he hired back as many of the original crew as he could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he see that as almost a rebirth of the original Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was some of that, like getting back to the roots, finding the original spirit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Apple III and the Lisa were really intended to be business machines.  And I remember at that time, everybody was a little disappointed that the home market hadn't taken off, and it looked like the business market was the only personal computer market.  Were you trying to recapture that home market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we didn't really have to recapture it because all during the time the Macintosh was developing, the Apple II was doing just great.  There was nothing really so much to recapture, but we also could see the future a little bit, and we knew we had to make things radically easier to use to really expand the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, also a lot of it was motivated by Jobs wanted to show that the Apple III and Lisa were not being run properly, that he could do things better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which seems to be also another leitmotif in Jobs' story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think another aspect of the Macintosh was that the Apple II had been allowed to be basically the same kind of computer for so long, and there was so much more you could do with computers.  And once we had seen what could be done with, say, Xerox PARC and with Lisa and so forth, that you could really break out of the character-based display and uppercase characters and so forth, that there was much more you could do and much more people wanted to do with personal computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep in mind that it was Jeff Raskin that led us into Xerox PARC.  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, he's the one that said, you guys need to come over and see what is being done over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the famous story of Steve Jobs seeing the interface of the, I guess, the Alto or the Star and saying, hmm, Windows, menus, mouse, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me about his reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was pretty much, once we all saw it, we sort of knew this, once you went this way, you'd never come back.  This was the future.  But Steve's real position was that Xerox didn't know how to mass produce it, make it low cost for the masses.  And he was absolutely right.  And that's why he was really starting to even start, well, technically hiring people like Andy and Burl, where people that could write very short, small code that took very little RAM, very little money for RAM, and could design circuits like Burl did, extremely few chips the way I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did he run up the pirate flag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Steve, that wasn't Steve.  In a way, we did that to make fun of Steve Jobs.  In January 83, Steve, we had these periodic retreats like every six month off sites, and Steve would begin them with slogans to set the tone for them.  And one slogan he used, I believe, in January 1983 was, you know, it's better to be pirates than to join the Navy.  And I can only speculate as to exactly what he meant by that, but I think it was something to do with the Mac team getting big and at least some of the original people not feeling so good about that.  But anyway, in a way, we were making fun of it when Steve Capps had the idea when we were moving into a new building.  We moved from Danly 4 across the street to Danly 3, which was seemed like an ordinary big drab Apple building.  And Steve Capps was thinking of a way to how can we make it reflect our attitude a little more.  And he came up with the idea of the pirate flag.  And we weren't sure what Steve Jobs would think of it.  But when he saw it, he liked it.  It stayed up there for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you feel like you were not a part of the main Apple crew at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the very beginning, I think there was a feeling of that.  We were off in a little building by ourselves.  And I would say we liked that because we were a little disenchanted with the main Apple crew at the time, the large Lisa and Apple 3 projects.  But eventually, by the time the Mac shipped, I felt we were very much in the mainstream of Apple.  The company had come around sometime in like 1983, pinning a lot of hopes on the Mac.  So by then, I think we were in the mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also in 1983, the PC overtook the Apple II as the largest selling computer in the world.  And I think that was a factor of us being more concerned about our future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  By the time of the Macintosh introduction, Apple was in a little bit of a panic because the IBM PC came in on incredibly strong in the fall of 83.  And of course, Lisa and the Apple 3 both had stumbled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So everything was riding on this Macintosh.  Jeff Raskin kind of got chased out before then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, way before then.  He really, the day I started, he was chased out officially the day before in February 1981.  Steve Jobs, actually what he had done was he had written a memo about Steve Jobs that he sent to Mike Markla that was extremely scathing about Steve's inability as a manager.  And I guess I never really got to the bottom of this, but someone gave that memo to Steve.  I don't know who did it.  When he saw that, he hit the roof and he asked Jeff to take a little vacation.  A paid three month leave of absence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that a loss to the team?  I mean, he had already set the tone of an easy to use computer.  He named it Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the original team more or less loved Jeff.  And a lot of them, like Brian Howard, was his closest personal friend.  But we also saw that for the good of the project, Jeff was against too much of it.  And so all in all, it was sad, but it was a relief when he stepped away.  It wasn't that we thought we would miss him at making the computer.  It was more that we loved him as a person.  Jeff was a great person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it seems politics become a part of all of this as the company gets bigger, as pressures get greater, and there are strong personalities, of course, all along.  Did they get in the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  People had very strong personalities, especially Steve Jobs.  He could sometimes be just a terror on people.  If you weren't self-confident, he could eat you alive.  And there were a lot, like a story I didn't put in my book, just because it was a little too sad, was we had an engineer who would just cry at her desk.  If Randy's still here, he'll remember Angeline Lowe.  Oh, yes.  But I'd walk by her desk at 5 p.m. in the evening, and she'd just be sitting there sobbing because Steve had yelled at her, or she just didn't feel up doing the work she was expected to.  And so there's a human cost to all the pressure and stuff.  Definitely everyone's personalities weren't perfect.  And it took a certain confidence to successfully work on the Mac team because of the mix of personalities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if you had to hold up to Steve, you had to be pretty strong yourself, because otherwise he would smell blood and just go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was he always like that, or did it get worse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it got worse.  By the time the Mac was around, he was pretty determined to show that he should be the next CEO, that he had all the leadership abilities that he actually wouldn't develop for another 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, Waz, you're not a fan of politics. How did you stay above the fray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sort of out of it. I had an airplane crash and decided to go back to college instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by then you were gone.  Yes.  Yeah.  You want to talk a little bit about the plane crash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To tell, I crashed taking off. I have no idea what happened. I have no memories for the next five weeks. I'm kind of thankful for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because at that point you said, I don't want to do this anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. After being out for five weeks, not even realizing I was out away from work, missing my dogs, I had a lost tooth, I suddenly realized, well, my gosh, this is the last chance in my life. I could really manage to go back to college for one year to get my degree. I'm thankful for that.  Did you miss it?  I missed it a bit, although I wasn't worried about the company critically needing me as a real critical element. There were enough engineers of high quality there and enough projects going on that was well enough managed that the company was okay. That was the important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill and Andy and Randy, if you want to speak to this, how important was Waz? What was the role that he played even after he left? Was he a role model for you guys? What exactly role did he play?  Spiritual leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Waz was an incredible inspiration to the MAD team. I know especially to Burrell. Burrell learned electronics, not electronics, but he really learned to design computers by just looking at the Apple II design and he worshiped Waz. I did too. I learned the Apple II assembly language just reading the monitor code and I worshiped Waz before I ever even met him just based on that monitor listing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Waz set the standard. Everybody wanted to do far above average in whatever it was technically. You wanted your designs to be elegant. You wanted your things to be useful. You wanted everything to be wonderful. You wanted it to be something that people would appreciate and would make hearts glad. All of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And even Steve Jobs always said great things about Waz's ability. He says we need more people like Waz, not people like the Lisa team where there's a hundred engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say he used to use Waz as a threat even when Waz wasn't as an Apple. If he didn't like your design, he'd go, I'll just call Waz. He'll do it in half the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they ever try to pull you back into Apple, Steve, or did they respect your decision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just went back in one day and worked for a while. I walked in after the US festivals and worked in the Apple II division where I felt I could make the biggest contribution. That was around the time John Scully joined and we were getting rid of the Apple III finally. There was nobody working on the Apple II in engineering since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that around the time of the LC?  The Apple II GS.  GS I mean, yeah.  Yeah, this was before that.  And then of course there was the famous Apple II Forever conference and everybody surrounded the Apple II and what a great design it was and then promptly moved on to Macintosh. Was that a sad day when the Mac kind of replaced the Apple II?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not at all. It was actually a very gradual thing. It was a couple of years while the Apple II was still our bread and butter product and it wasn't really like, I mean I felt it very awkward about these sayings like Apple II Forever. I mean good God because we're moving on to other things.  That's what you do. That's what you do.  That's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually one of the mistakes Apple made early on was not supporting the Apple II the way they should have. I mean the fact is that if they had put money into the Apple II earlier it would have lasted much longer but at the time that you know was and I were working on it we thought it would only last like two years, three years.  You know I mean that was sort of the lifespan of a calculator back then.  Right.  Who would think that ten years later you know anybody would have any interest in it other than historical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well six years ago I walked into my kid's kindergarten class and there were eight Apple IIs sitting on the desk there.  Exactly.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're still used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The funny thing is not only do they still work but I don't think there was ever a bug in the hardware or the software that was found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? That's pretty remarkable.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a different style of design and coding back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why? How was it different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it did, you had to be, it was so intense that it was all in me but had to be so aware of every little detail in my head walking around not when I'm just looking at it on paper and it wasn't, everything just had to be perfect and had to work perfect.  It was like hardware. If hardware doesn't work you can't go out and update it. These days everything can be updated so that's a reason to, certain flaws are allowed to slip through.  You don't have to test thoroughly and you never could because you never have enough time to test everything these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was much more complex than it was of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in every possible environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But in a way it's still, so genetically identical to the original. I mean computers do pretty much the same thing they've always done.  Yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do a lot more. I mean I think, I use my computer now for so much of my entertainment that I never did back in the days when the Mac first came out and the networking really added such a strong dimension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh God, I mean I can't even imagine on the Apple II doing a phone call on the Apple II. You know the closest we ever got was having Draper make an automatic dialer out of it, generating all the calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually by now computers would have gone this way but what it points out is that when we came out with the Apple II and thought we were going to take over the world we couldn't really see what those applications were going to be in the long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But that's the beauty of a general purpose device, you don't need to.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right, exactly right. If it could have a programming language there's a million things you can do every day of your life forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I don't want to keep you guys forever, I could do this for a long time but you've been very generous of your time, we've been talking for a couple of hours and I guess I'll give you a chance to put a coda on this. Bill do you want anything you'd like to add or say that we haven't said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think we're code complete.  Randy Wiggington?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NP complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's just it's been so much fun I can't believe it's been 30 years. It was so much fun and so exciting and still some of my best memories working on the Mac, working with Waz. Waz I told earlier the story about the disc drive at CES when we'd go and gamble for an hour then work for an hour.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said by the way Waz that he was 17 and you taught him to gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true but he won money, I think he won 35 bucks but I don't know if he told you that at the very end of this all nighter finally had everything working I decided to copy one track, read this track, put in the other floppy, write it, put in the first floppy, read it, the second floppy, write it. All 36 tracks or 34 tracks I read and wrote and when I was done I was so tired I looked at them and I think I copied the bad one onto the good which was the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's good to know that even you can do something like that. I think we've all done something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually what's more likely is that Waz would turn sadly to Randy after having done it perfectly and say oh no I copied the bad one onto the good one and then you have this little gleam in his eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would sound more like Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have got to say that my feeling about when you start a company and you're a small community, every little word you say, every bit of praise between you, everybody getting excited about your ideas, the whole team is so important and boy when you go back to that floppy disk it never could have happened without Randy Wiginton.  This was just, I mean there's no way in the world. I mean he probably told you, I don't know if he told you about the two weeks where we worked every day getting ready for CES just so we could go to Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a fun time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Maybe Andy Hertzfeld would be the right person to kind of wrap this up since you more than anybody have been following this story and have helped tell it with your book and with folklore.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I can't wait to read Waz's book. I think that's going to be fantastic for me.  November.  Yeah.  November, I Waz.  Yeah, yeah that's great.  I love that title. That's a great title.  I'm looking forward to that. Anyway, I just want to say happy birthday to Apple. Apple changed my life as well as changing the world and I feel incredibly privileged to have worked with Waz and Randy back in those days and just to get to do what I did on the Mac was tremendous for me.  And Apple's been tremendous for the world. It's so great that on their 30th birthday they're so much healthier than their 20th birthday.  That's for sure.  Apple feels like a young company again with Infinite Horizon in front of it and I'm a big fan. I'll be buying the next iPod the day it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, as we all will no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Few people get a chance to change the world. And I think that many of us on this podcast have had several chances through Apple to change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a remarkable gift. You're right.  Waz, any final thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to thank all the loyal, you know, the real passionate people. People that really love computers for being computers.  There's so much more in the Macintosh group than the PC group.  And it's just neat to be around because they all have this one commonality that their Macintosh is the most beautiful, wonderful thing they've ever had in their lives. And it means something to them. It's not just their work tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you think about in any endeavor to have a great hit is usually a one-time thing. I mean to have something like the Apple II and the success of the Apple II, it's rare that you see a follow on that is of equal success.  And Apple's unique in that respect that not only did they follow the Apple II with the Macintosh. Yeah, there were a few flops in between.  And then now the Macintosh and the iPod. I mean, it's really been a remarkable company that has consistently created great products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and at this point, you just got to tip your hat to Steve Jobs. I mean, he's the he's the common thread through all those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It all starts with Steve and Steve. Thank you guys.  Thanks a lot.  Happy birthday.  All right. Great to talk to you.  Bye, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bye.  Thanks.  See you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve, thanks for helping organize this. I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This podcast is like the most appropriate thing on Apple's 30th birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's singularly appropriate, you know, to commemorate this with a podcast rather than with a statuette or something.
