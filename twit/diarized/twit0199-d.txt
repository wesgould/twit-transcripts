Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is  It's time for Twitter, the show that covers all things technology and a great panel we  have here assembled around the table virtually, so to speak, from his getaway in beautiful  Washington state, John C. Dvorak.  Hello.  Hey, John, good to talk to you.  Also just back from his getaway, he had a nice, I hope, vacation, Dwight Silverman of  the Houston Chronicle.  Hey, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, it's good to be back and great to be doing this as my first semi-official act back  after taking my daughter up to orientation at the University of Missouri.  Oh, that's where she's going, huh?  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Congratulations.  So I remember the last time we, a few months ago, we talked, you were doing college tours  and getting ready for all that.  And so she's going to you, you, what do you call it, old Mizzou, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's called Mizzou, right?  Mizzou.  Incredibly, incredibly rich in tradition.  This was the school that started Homecoming and it is the first, it was the first journalism  school in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is she, she's not going to study journalism.  Yes she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, as much as I try to dissuade her, that's what she wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She must be very worried and proud.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yes.  And buggy whip manufacturing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a future in buggy whips, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she's going into the convergence.  She's going to focus on online, so at least she's taking the right track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's actually great.  I mean, you still need the traditions of journalism.  You still need the ethics, the background.  I think that's, I mean, online journalists are still journalists.  It's just because the dead tree newspaper is going away doesn't mean that we don't need  journalists.  Right, right.  Also here, Doug Kaye, the proto-podcaster, the guy who, I think you're now officially  the longest continuous running podcaster in the world.  You didn't say oldest podcaster.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  You're not the oldest, I guarantee you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He is the longest.  Yeah, six years old.  Six years.  IT conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Six years last week.  He's also at conversationsnetwork.org and has really been one of the people who's really  forwarded this medium.  You were way ahead of the, you knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you don't count yourself and about a half a dozen other people.  You can beat me.  Yeah, but you're discounting 20 years of radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Does radio count when you're talking to new media?  Does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all the same.  You're talking to a microphone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess.  I guess.  It is kind of actually all the same.  Thank you.  It's been fun six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You haven't been on in ages.  I haven't.  Somebody said to me today, he said, weren't you just on Twitter?  I said no, it's been nine months.  Nine months.  I've been coding.  I've been busy.  You still code.  Yes.  Well, no, I code again.  You're back to.  I went for 15 or 20 years with no coding.  What are you writing?  I was an executive.  What am I writing?  PHP.  Yeah, I'm doing a new site.  Cool.  Anyway, yeah.  I'll ask you about it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Also here, Mr. Will Harris from the UK.  He's in studio, which is very nice.  Watcher fellas.  Out with his watcher.  Wait a minute.  Doug said that he's been saying hello.  Hello.  Hello.  And you're starting a new trend.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be a watcher fellas from now on.  Watcher fellas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got my wife is now saying hello and she doesn't know where it came from.  She walks around saying the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello.  And we started out the thing of slightly camp catchphrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My new catchphrase, screw you.  That's good.  It's been very useful.  Did I hear a mash up on it?  Yeah, there's been a bunch of mash ups.  Oh, endless series of mash ups.  I want a t-shirt.  Leo says.  You know what would be funny is to do.  Leo told me, screw you, it'd be like a special small club.  So a couple of stories actually John, you had something you wanted to talk about.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I forgot now.  I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so we'll start.  The pre, the pre.  The pre, you want to talk about the pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been out for a week.  So I got my hands on one finally.  Was yours free?  It wasn't mine.  It was somebody else's.  I borrowed it.  Oh, good.  I didn't even get one free or pay for one or get one loan to me or anything.  Did you have a time that you had to give it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it ascertained?  I had to give it back to the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's the solution.  Go through a middleman, Leo.  If you have a middleman, then you're never responsible.  They can't get to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just get John to get everything for me.  So you don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think the keyboard is unusable.  I think the device has got, you know, what's the difference between that and an Android?  I like the fit and finish.  I think it's kind of cool.  It's got a nice little rubbery background and the screen feels really nice when you  move things around on it.  But I'm not seeing that it's anything out of the ordinary.  It's a little late to the game.  I think it's late to the party.  I know that Sprint set new records for sales and all these kinds of things happen, but  I, you know, I'm not seeing this thing save in the company, to be honest about it.  Well, there is a challenge.  I mean, it's great apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to be tough.  Verizon has now apparently, well, Verizon's president said we're going to carry it.  They're saying now the scuttlebutt is January 1st.  Does that change your attitude if Verizon sells this as well as Sprint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't care about the carrier, to be honest, but I'm just talking about the phone  per se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think there's a lot of people that would say the best thing about the pre is that it's  a usable smartphone that's not on AT&T.  Because the number one complaint I hear about the iPhone repeatedly over here anyway is  that AT&T is just not the carrier that people want to use.  And so even if it's only half as good as the iPhone, it's twice as good as most other smartphones  out there.  And so to get it on Verizon and Sprint is an automatic win for a lot of people that  don't want AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When anybody says I want to stay on Sprint, I say, oh, you got to get the pre.  I mean, that is the it's number two.  I'm going to say it's the second best.  I mean, to me, it's all about the apps.  That's the big.  And they're very few apps, although more apps on this than when the iPhone shipped.  The first iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there were no apps than when.  Well, that's not saying anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The apps are something that actually make a phone something that becomes more valuable  over time.  And there aren't that many phones you can say become more valuable over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the form factor, John.  I feel like it's it's like a little pebble that was supposed to be a river rock.  And I think they've kind of done that.  It multitask, which the iPhone doesn't do.  It's got a very good camera, which the iPhone didn't have until Monday.  Now, of course, the iPhone's leapfrog.  They not only have a camera of equal quality, the new three GS, you you look at the picture,  you tap the person you want to focus on and it focuses it.  That's something even a digital camera can't do.  And it's going to have video that you can edit in in phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a very nice segue to the news of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the news of the week, but also the news of the week, which is what you were  saying, which is that people hate AT&T.  People are not blaming Apple for the price, but they are blaming AT&T because a lot of  people bought an iPhone exactly one year ago and they're going to be paying $4.99 and $5.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's the same in the UK as well.  Is it? The official carry in the UK has come under such a lot of heat.  Especially for gouging on the on the on the data tethering charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But to be fair, that would be true of any carrier.  Anybody what carrier is going to let you have a two year plan and walk in after one year  and get a new phone at a discount?  They don't do that. Should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just the standard way that AT&T handles its smartphone upgrades.  It's really not that. Is it just AT&T, though?  Is everybody does that?  Right. Everybody does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guarantee you, if a year from now you want to buy a new pre, you'll be paying four or 500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand why these carriers, given that they've got people wanting to give them money,  surely the sensible thing to do would be to make sure, OK, you can have a subsidized upgrade,  but you've always got to keep a two year contract.  You've always if you have everything you go great, you've always got to make sure you're right.  Either prorate it or keep it pushed out to a two year.  So you can upgrade in six months, but then you've got to add another six months to your contract.  Or you can upgrade in 18 months. You've got to add another 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, you know, we have to you have to look at the economics.  I'm not trying to defend the carriers, but you have to look at it  and recognize that that they counted on a certain amount of revenue for all those sales.  The phones are underwritten.  And the question is, you know, can they really do that within the economics of the plan?  I don't know. So what were you what were you about to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny that whenever the iPhone comes up and there was some of this  during the introduction of the first iPhone, that what people end up talking about is how crappy AT&T is.  Yes. You remember David Pogue's video for the first iPhone where he's explaining the iPhone  to his colleagues at the New York Times. There's a big crowd around him.  And he mentions, and it's only on AT&T. And everybody goes, oh, and I think that one of the problems  with this with the iPhone is, is that every time it's mentioned, it it it shows off or emphasizes  the the weaknesses of AT&T. I think I think in some ways the the iPhone is bad for AT&T's reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but what was it? 30 percent of iPhone owners are new AT&T customers.  I mean, it certainly has not been bad for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bad for their reputation. What reputation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is there somebody we love? I mean, come on. Aren't all cell phone carriers sleazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's here's something interesting.  I just I went to Missouri and that requires traveling through the wilds of North Texas and Oklahoma.  And AT&T has no 3G there.  And sometimes there's not even the edge network in some of those locations.  And I took with me the Verizon Mifi and used that to talk to Verizon's network with my iPhone.  And it was dramatically better. Oh, dear.  It was kind of like, here's what the iPhone would be like on Verizon.  And it was much, much better.  And I think that if if when the iPhone's exclusivity with AT&T ends and Verizon is able to to strike a deal  with Apple, I think the stampede is going to begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  2010, it ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless they get an extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be. Yeah, it'll be.  You know, is it in Apple's interest?  Isn't it in Apple's interest to dump or not dump, but at least diversify?  Yeah. Open it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, again, it comes back to this this question of Doug's about the economics.  If it makes more economic sense for AT&T to keep paying Apple to have it.  Well, it probably does. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much? Yeah. But see, you know, for instance, you know, here's Phil Schiller talking about  we're going to have tethering on the new 3GS and we're going to have MMS on the new 3GS.  And he shows all the carriers are going to support MMS.  No AT&T. He shows all the characters are going to show tethering.  Rogers, T-Mobile, Orange.  No, no AT&T.  With the 3GS, you're saying? Yeah.  Right. Which implies AT&T says, well, we'll have it later this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that implies that they'll eventually get it. Right.  In 2010. Someday. Someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someday my MMS will come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, thank goodness there's some competitive pressure.  Unfortunately, those of us with iPhones are going to just suffer for another year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's the question.  I mean, how many people are going to buy or going to bite the bullet?  I already did. I'll tell you the truth.  As usual, and buy the new 3GS, even though I'm not out of contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm waiting my second year. I've got a 3G.  Me too. I'll wait a year.  You're going to wait a year. Yeah.  Yeah, there's not a way to year also.  There's not enough for me to go.  I mean, I like it if I if I didn't know anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? The big announcement really was the ninety nine dollar  3G, the 8G 3G. That's remarkable.  That is going to be very good for AT&T and very good for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But unless you just bought one of the eight gigs for one ninety nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, which I did, of course. Yes.  And for my son. And, you know, now I'm screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, see, when I get I bought a 3G, I ordered a 3GS for my son.  So that's that's my way of getting.  Well, you did get one then.  Yeah, but I get to play with it and I get, you know, all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's some features I like.  I love the idea that you can leave the phone in a restaurant.  And then the GPS says, oh, look, this is where you left it.  And then you call the restaurant and you said, hello, I left my phone there.  Do you hear a screaming sound coming from the cushion in the booth in the back?  That's my phone. Go get it.  You press a button and this phone goes, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. So that begs a question, though.  Do you leave location services turned on all the time?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll see. Friday, I'll get this.  We'll let you know what you need. Yeah, you need it.  Yeah. Do you leave?  Dead is a door in 10 minutes.  It sucks. Dead is a door nail in 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it sucks battery.  You know, it just it just pulls it right.  Yeah. And they say twice that you have to have mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need a mobile me to make that work. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, because I'm a complete fool.  I have a mobile me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I also have a mobile me.  Oh, I'm a fool. I thought you were kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do need mobile me for that. Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got to put I got to give you some reason to buy that.  Well, that's the reason to buy it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, now there's a few other things and you can do the  you can automatically lock it if it gets stolen  and you can put a little message on it saying, you know,  if I've lost this phone, please call, you know, your home number.  So there are a few little Brucey bonuses in there that,  you know, make mobile me can.  I use back to my Mac. I'll be on that side.  Wait, my Mac works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to one of the Mavens on the Twitter, I see  he says it doesn't scream, it just beeps.  Yeah, he's tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a loud annoying beep beep beep beep.  Well, he's tried it on the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ellen Fice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's her voice.  Well, that is a memory, I'll tell you.  You know, I was looking that up only the other day.  That was the that was the girl who did the Apple  ad that she was clearly high.  And they never aired the ad, but it was online everywhere.  Right. Yeah. Yeah.  She was clearly high.  And she said, you know, like, well, I was using a PC and it lost my paper.  Well, VVVVVVVV, it's very funny.  He was like, it's a classic.  Yeah, I'll play it at the end of the show.  You can be the judge. You be the judge.  When we come back,  Will Harris is going to say, I cannot imagine.  So what are you going to say?  I'm a Dina Jad. I'm a Dina Jad and I'm a Dina Jad.  And I'm a Dina Jad and Musabi.  Yeah. Yeah.  We're going to talk about Iran and the colossal CNN fail of the week.  But before we do that, I want to mention our friends that go to meeting,  Go to Meeting from Citrix is the online meeting service that's just so easy to use and saves you money.  How can a product that costs $50 a month save you money?  Well, how much do you spend on business travel?  You know, a ticket across the country, 300 bucks, not to mention the stress,  the time wasted, even driving across town today as gas prices go up again is expensive.  That's why Go to Meeting is a money saver, a time saver, a stress saver.  Hold your meetings online.  By the way, these meetings are more engaging, more fun.  People appreciate it.  It's not like, you know, people are going to say, oh, you didn't come to visit us.  Frankly, they don't want you to come visit and they got to buy you dinner.  Come on, let's admit it, right?  They got to entertain you.  That's no fun. Stay home and have a Go to Meeting for sales,  presentations, for product demos, for training.  I use it to collaborate.  We use it on the Maxwell's House podcast because he could show his screens,  beautiful, high quality screens.  Just about any kind of conference call is easier and better with Go to Meeting.  By the way, including it includes free voice over the Internet and free  telephone teleconferencing.  It's the most secure way, the easiest way, and I want you to try it right now.  Go to meeting.com slash twit, G-O-T-O, meeting.com slash twit.  These guys are fantastic.  They've been real supporters of the twit network.  So if you support the twit network, also give it a try.  Go to meeting.com slash twit.  I think you'll find a lot of ways to use it.  I'm a dinner jacket. What is it?  I'm a dinner jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say this is the CNN fail of the week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of the week. This is I think you could say this might be a turning point.  No, look at here. Here. I'm Saturday afternoon.  You know, I went home after the radio show you're seeing on Twitter.  Just, I mean, literally live, people are saying I'm being tear gassed right now.  I'm right. You even can see Musavi's tweeting saying they've got me under house arrest.  I'm going, oh, my God, this is huge.  The election is being stolen in Iran.  Quick turn on CNN.  It's a Larry King rerun with American Chopper.  There's guys without slaves talking about motorcycles.  Oh, well, geez, maybe MSNBC.  They're talking about prisoners.  They're doing their like documentary, their sleaze-o documentaries about people in jail.  Maybe Fox?  No, they got a rerun on too.  Nobody, none of the news stations were covering this story all day Saturday.  But if you go to Twitter now, admittedly, you're not getting news on Twitter,  but you're getting, I mean, the stuff as it happens.  It turns out that in Tehran, of course, for those who don't know,  Ahmadinejad decided that he won the election, even, you know,  regardless of what the actual vote is.  Although, well, I'm going to raise some issues about that, but we don't know.  The most supporters of Musavi, who really the Green Revolution,  I mean, they were really progressive Iranians, at least in the cities.  And I think that's the issue here, were burning cars.  They were protesting.  They were being shut down.  The Iranian authorities immediately turned off text messaging.  They blocked Twitter on the Internet.  They did everything they could to keep it from getting out.  But people still had Twitter applications on their phones and tweets were still getting out.  And if you were reading these tweets, you were watching a revolution in the streets  live in real time.  And meanwhile, CNN.  Well, if you want to build a motorcycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did see one news crew, I think it might have been NBC,  who was in Tehran, who was videotaping, had their videotapes taken away by the police  and they covered it with their mobile phones.  Isn't that amazing?  So they actually covered it and sent footage back and you see the burning.  And to CNN's credit, this morning on GPS,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they did very good coverage.  Christiane Amanpour was there.  She's Iranian.  So, I mean, there are people there.  The New York Times, though, did a brilliant.  It's ironic.  The newspapers did a brilliant job on their websites.  And so my point is that it I think this might be a turning point.  If you want to see breaking news, you go to the Web now.  You do not turn on the news station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's not just that.  I mean, first of all, there's another irony, which, of course, is that when the people  did start to catch up, what did they do?  They read Twitter on the air.  Yeah, that was that was their source.  But it's it's not just a matter of a change in media.  It's a matter of changing source.  You actually are getting you're getting this information, not from reporters,  but from the first person, from the people who are Iranians who are there.  That's almost as big.  Maybe that's a bigger story or a bigger issue  than the fact that the media didn't cover it.  Right. The fact that this is citizen journalism.  Yeah. Well, it does raise an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is the second issue I wanted to raise, is that you're getting the point of view  from the cities, from the people in Tehran.  And it may be, in fact, Ahmadinejad did win the election  because he won in the countryside where people don't have Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, well, we will never know who actually won the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I'm just pointing out that the Twitterati in Iran  may be a very small group compared to the overall.  It was interesting to see.  You don't you get first person news, but you get it, you know, kind of.  Yeah, but you get, you know, you got analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you get a large number of people supplying this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. And if you if you looked at the hashtag  Iran election, in fact, today, if you look at it, there's still stuff going on.  Half a minute ago, the riot police are now shooting at protesters.  I mean, this is this is still going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you say you get news, but not analysis,  Leo news is not analysis ever. OK.  This reportage is actually accounts for news of some sort as eyewitness accounts,  which I think is quite valuable.  By the way, Christine Amnouppour is Lebanese, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said on CNN that she was she was born in Iran.  But anyway, OK.  She's certainly on the ground there and doing a great job, as was, by the way,  a New York Times reporter who was I mean, there's a dramatic video on the web  of him up on the roof saying we had to get off the streets.  You know, here's what's going on. And that was yesterday.  They were on. They were doing video on the Web.  New York Times yesterday.  They were doing great coverage.  And Leo, have you seen any kind of explanation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  as to why CNN and Fox and MSNBC  did not cut away and try to provide live coverage?  Have any of them kind of addressed the anger and the questions that people have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I saw I saw one crew was saying that anytime there were more than two people  together, they were being beaten by police.  I mean, they I think it was I think it was a they couldn't.  They were not able to cover it.  And I think that comes back.  I want to just go back to this one more time.  I won't beat this to death.  But the fact is that we often talk about comparing  people who are tweeting to CNN.  And I think the comparison isn't valid.  I wouldn't even make the comparison.  We're just going to have to get used to the fact that whatever we want to call it,  news or journalism or something else, we are going to get a lot more information  from things like Twitter in the future.  And I'm not sure that we need to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what it is.  We just need to we need to embrace it because it's going to be there.  And it's a very, you know, in this case, it's an important source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from Silence No More.  This came out a minute ago.  We want to keep tweeting.  This is the only place the real news is getting out.  I mean, this is a very, I think, remarkable.  The source, the information direct from Iran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room.  I didn't see the whole thing, but mentioned the Daily Show.  Did you see a thing last week where they went and talked to the New York Times?  Did you see it? Oh, God, great.  In the interview, interview to Guy at the Times.  And he says, so tell me, you know, this is a daily newspaper.  What in your newspaper happened today?  Is there anything in your paper today?  No, it's all yesterday.  And that's a that's a fundamental issue right there, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a real daily newspaper music comes out.  No, it's like one hour cleaners.  The guy goes, is this one hour cleaners?  No, that's just the name of the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  24 hour fitness.  We're not open at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if you needed it, we the fact is that you're you're talking about  somebody who is, you know, if you want to sit back and not see the world  in real time, but you want to see the world as it was a day ago.  That's a valid source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think in a way of Newsweek did this about I read the Times every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't get me to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're Newsweek about a month ago said we give up.  We can't cover it. We're a weekly.  We can't possibly cover news as fast as it's happening.  So we're going to become an analysis magazine.  I don't know if you've looked at Newsweek lately, but it is not the same magazine.  I think that that maybe that's what CNN's doing.  Maybe they don't have the budget to do anything but reruns on the weekends.  Certainly MSNBC, that's what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think the problem is it purports to be real time.  Well, we know now it's not.  Yeah, you know, the whole point of a 24 hour news channel is CNN.  Breaking news is 24 hour news.  As John says, it's just the name.  Yeah. So it's it seems really strange that, you know, something that's set up,  you know, we're always talking about how we live in this 24 hour news culture.  But it seems that even that is now not enough.  Like we need like a second to second news culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's you know, stuff happens real time and the Internet has connected us  in a way real time. You know, when when Iran,  when you had to send a telegraph dispatch from Iran, you know,  you're not going to have real time news, but we can now, thanks to the Internet,  really be real time. And I think that's that's very powerful.  We're we're tied together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are there were some people who said that what CNN should have done  was gone on the air.  And even if they couldn't report, if they couldn't get any video,  was to begin working with the social media and reporting  what was being said there and try to provide some context.  And they might even have been able to do  real time verification of some of the things that were being said,  because they do have reporters there.  And so it just struck me and others who were watching it is very odd  is that they did not cut away.  This was the network that cut its teeth on cutting away.  And on Saturday night, you know, everybody was taking the night off.  And I think that that struck a lot.  You know, what happens is people see this initially on Twitter,  on social networks, and then they go to television to get it,  you know, live as it's happening and put together and get pictures.  And I do that. Yeah.  And that failed them.  And that's exactly right.  Just see that that that process failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter was the early warning system, and we expected then the follow up on news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what happens when Iranians in the streets of Tehran  have can initiate live streaming video from their  which is limited, right?  Then you'll say, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not going to go.  You know, think of the things that you've done, the live video events.  Think of Scoble standing at the iPhone,  the first iPhone thing in New York or where Palo Alto was.  I mean, at some point, the event is the coverage through a streaming  mobile device, and you don't go anywhere else  because you're not going to get closer to the action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that I think that's really interesting because the word that you had there  was like coverage.  And it's true because, you know, you can have lots of Iranians  on the streets of Tehran with streaming mobile phones  and you can see what's happening.  But nobody can really kind of tell you what that means or put it together.  Yeah, but you're getting but you're getting the raw material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're getting the raw material. Sure.  And then you've got somebody like Leo who will sit here  and he will watch a half a dozen video streams from a half a dozen people  in Tehran, and he'll switch back and forth.  And he'll be the anchor slash technical director.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I do notice that nobody's get on it.  No, I do notice nobody's doing live tech coverage.  And I do think that that's an opening for me  in a very poor man's way to do coverage of that kind of thing.  I don't know if I'll ever be covering revolutions in Iran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that timely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, some of it's not some of it is.  So we have this kind of programming, which is, you know,  we're covering last this week's news.  We're not covering today's news.  Well, we are a little bit, but it's not this this minute in tech.  Yeah. But on the other hand, if a big DDoS attack happened  all of a sudden on Yahoo or if Microsoft announced that it was getting out  of business, we'd go to we'd cover it live and we could we'd have the capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I have talked about this before, a live anchored control room.  And I can see that I think that's where we're headed.  And it's going to be a mobile devices and you'll you'll cut away to somebody.  We'll be able to pull from all these sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then in 10 years time, there'll be somebody else  sitting in a room going, Leo Laporte, I can't believe he didn't cut away  to that story. Ten years, ten minutes, ten minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the beauty of it is now anybody can do it.  It's not expensive.  And and if that coverage is out there now, what about but now here's the issue.  What how does stringers make any money anymore?  Do they make any money? Who's going to pay him?  I'm not going to pay him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but again, you're comparing it to an old system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the whole system fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you're you're you're trying to you're trying to shoehorn it  into the old system.  I'm just getting the whole system false. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I was.  Can I ask a question amongst this during this little debate here? Yes.  What's the rush?  What's the rush?  Why do we need to know what's happening in Tehran?  This very, you know, that's a very good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not that John is I think it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to have no effect on our lives at the moment.  We could sit back and wait for it to be analyzed and we'd probably get more out of it.  What is the rush?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I understand that, John, but the fact is, I think there's a human nature aspect.  Why do we watch car chases on television in Los Angeles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but I I will fess up to the fact that I have done that.  I have been in Los Angeles where that seems to be.  They have to have a car chase channel down there, don't you think?  Anyway, I've watched car chases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have. They really should, because it's pretty much 24 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And the fact is, there's a sense of immediacy.  There's the fact that I want to I want to know when something happens.  And I think that's inevitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's some compelling reasons to do this in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is a scoop mentality that always leads to bad information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's dangerous. And that was kind of what I was making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This isn't the scoop. This is the raw material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is as it happens. It's a scoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still see it as a scoop.  There's only one person perspective from one spot.  He's delivering maybe a picture or something like that.  It's a scoop.  Surely it's the anti-scoop because at that point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because a scoop is one person has some exclusive information.  That's right. Twitter is everybody can see what everybody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have disintermediated the scooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to be the title for today's show.  Just intermediating the scoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it. Exactly.  Disintermediation is what it's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, John, you're also doing the same thing I did,  which is kind of interpreting it through the lens of old media.  And I think what we what might just as a possibility for how it might end up  playing out is the thing happens, the fire.  You see the pictures live.  There's a swarm of attention around it.  There are people putting the story out.  People watch it. Think about it.  A conversation starts around it.  That's what we're seeing on places like Friend Feed, where people start  analyzing it themselves and consensus is reached through these  conversations that happen over a period of a day or two or three  that actually, in the end, I think produces a better understanding  of the story than waiting a day and reading what the New York Times has to say about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I spoke at a conference last week, the Beyond Broadcast Conference.  And this is primarily people in public media,  the public radio, public television, as well as academic journalism.  And I came away with it from the same sensitive.  I get all the time at these events, which is there's still such a sense of preserving,  you know, try to understand new media in the sense of how do we adapt  what we have to new media, instead of going directly to the media. Right. Right.  You know, how do we keep the jobs is, of course, one way to look at it.  That's always the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at the record industry.  If you've built a business around a business, I'm starting to understand  this now having a business, when you build a business around a business model,  it's ducibly hard to change the business model underneath the business.  Yeah. Right. You've you've kind of you've the whole thing is set up around.  We print these broadsheets with that have a display ad on it and some ad copy,  and we deliver them via truck to a newsstand where somebody picks it up for 20 cents.  If that's your business model, it's very hard to say, well,  what happens when we get rid of the truck, the newsstand, the broadsheet,  the display ad? Now, what's our business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you know, they'll focus on, well, maybe we should do it by, you know,  getting more gas efficient trucks. Right.  You know, I mean, that's it's very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think Microsoft's got the same problem.  It's the innovator's dilemma. It is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a big part of the innovator's dilemma is, is that the alternative,  the so-called sort of new way of doing things doesn't generate the same amount  of money that the old way of generating. Not at first.  Well, possibly not ever.  I mean, if you look at what a page... Not ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if that's it, that's it, so be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the New York Times charges, you know, per page,  they can't do it. They can charge online.  You physically can't do it.  You either have to accept the fact that it's a small business.  I mean, I saw a great statistic out of from Rupert Murdoch, of all people,  last week, saying that the amount of of web advertising  inventory online doubles every year and has doubled for the past three years.  And that means that every year it gets doubly as hard to keep an audience  and build an audience.  Your advertising rates halve and you've got double the number of competitors.  And that's just not true on the newsstand.  And so it's not a case of adapting old business models.  I mean, as you say, it's fragmented is what's happening.  There is there is no business model for generating something  like the New York Times online.  There is no if the Times goes away,  that can sustain is there a fixed amount of advertising money

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's now available and floating around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's a decreasing amount of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK, that's it. That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is that there are, you know, there is X billion dollars  in the advertising market and in the print world, everybody gets,  you know, 10 percent of X billion dollars. Right.  Whereas in the online world, everybody gets a thousandth, a thousandth.  And the rates are dropping and there's another thousand people.  So what happens with every year? Well, everybody gets screwed.  All right. So here's what you're all screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not everybody gets. No, not everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what's what's one of the reasons that people think that newspapers  have gotten into trouble?  Who's who's the who's the guilty party?  Craig's right party. Craig's guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The guilty party are the people who are trying to take this old model  and shoehorn it into the Internet.  I think that's no, that's that's that's the guilty party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who who who is being blamed?  I think Craigslist is getting a fair share of the blame. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what would happen on who's talking?  I don't think I think a lot of the a lot of the higher ups in in  in the newspaper industry are using that as a scapegoat.  I think those of us who are actually like doing it on websites  and in and still, yes, in print, we kind of understand  what I think is really happening and and and what I think has to happen.  And some of us are doing it.  We're trying to do that at cron.com is to change fundamentally  what journalists do.  The classic journalism activity was for a reporter himself or herself  to go out, get the story, make sense of it and distill it.  Now, what what I think journalists have to do is we have to be curators  of what the community is saying about itself so we can help people make sense  of the community covering itself.  So so the the comment that was made about somebody like Leo  piecing together all the best video and kind of making sense of all the  individual streams that are coming out of an event like Tehran.  That's where the future of what are called newspapers now.  Aggregation. And it it'll be aggregation and curation,  and it will be done in cities nationally and globally.  And the person or the people who kind of find that model first  and hone it and make it palatable are going to be the people who win.  And we're trying to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dwight, what just as another irony, can you imagine what would happen  if Craigslist, who what do we hear, 100 million in revenues or profits  or something? Right.  Suppose Craigslist decided to fund some journalistic activities.  Wouldn't there be a fascinating irony there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'd be a fine irony. Bring it. I would love to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, certainly, aggregators are going to be some of the winners.  And if you if you're a big enough aggregator, you'll get a big enough chunk  of that old advertising dollar.  So you might be able to survive.  And then one hopes that some of that income will trickle down  to the stringers and reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting. There are going to be fewer dollars in the business.  That's probably business will show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huffington Post, just what did they put aside?  A million dollars for investigative journalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's not that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Compared to what?  What kind of budget is is a typical newspaper budget?  Is it a lot more?  Oh, yes. Yeah.  Yeah. So do we lose?  Do we lose investigative journalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The New York Times has got over a thousand people working in its newsroom  to produce the daily. Meanwhile, the news over on MSNBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're learning the rates for call girls in New York state.  So hey, I'm glad that they're investigative journalism.  They're covering the big story.  You see, this is the problem is that these guys, not the Chronicle, obviously,  but some of these guys are just shooting themselves in the foot.  They're just they don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things we should always mention, we're talking about newspapers  and the problems that they're having is the fact of the matter is there's  that they are a redundant product  and they can maybe blame the Associated Press for part of this  and also the New York Times Syndicate, I'm guessing,  and perhaps the Washington Post.  But, you know, if you pick up any newspaper around the country,  it essentially has the exact same news in it as another paper nearby.  And when they all go online, it becomes, you know, patently obvious  that these guys are the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's four different rewrites of AP copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you'll see these stories.  And if you go to the look at, you know, go to Google News  where they show you the number of stories that are similar  and they break like the Iranian story, they'll be like five  thousand stories and they're all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's one site that Dwight, you may know these guys.  Voice of San Diego dot org.  Do you know them? Yes. Yeah.  So this is a this is an interesting sort of transitional group.  Voice of San Diego dot org is a nonprofit investigative journalism organization.  I think they got started with a particular story  uncovering some local scandal and it's become so popular.  They've received a lot of nonprofit institutional funding and so forth.  But this is a very lean, mean, low budget investigative journalism site,  which I think has a lot going for it.  I met some of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your daughter's getting into journalism.  She's going to college for journalism.  Dwight, are you discouraging her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She knows the reality of it.  I mean, she, you know, she lives in my house.  So she's seen it firsthand.  She's seen it firsthand.  You know, we had 90 layoffs here in the Chronicle Newsroom earlier in the year.  And it's, you know, so and, you know, I did not know if I was going to be on that list.  I hope not. And I was not, thankfully.  But she understands that she's like I said, she's taking the convergence track  and, you know, is going to be studying video.  Audio is going to be learning to write, is going to be learning to work on the web  and report for the web.  She's already got a very active Twitter account  and communicates with other journalists and talks about stories  with other professional journalists online.  So she's doing the right things.  You know, it'll be interesting to see what kind of a job she can get  when she gets out of there.  But because that'll be, you know, at least four or five years from now.  So she's aware of the reality.  She also has one eye on law school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I was just thinking, if I were starting out,  especially in California, I would I would buy a lot of arable land  suitable for growing marijuana and maybe get into the bong business,  because I think marijuana is going to be legalized.  I'll pass it on to her. Yeah.  And I think that's going to be really a great business to be in  in the next year in California. Just a thought. Just a thought.  Just, you know, we're going to take a break when we come back.  There are other big stories.  The digital transition happened on Friday.  300000 calls to the FCC.  Most of them sounded something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened? My TV is not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll also talk about the Facebook land grab.  But before we do that, I want to talk about audible.com,  the place to go for audio entertainment, the greatest books.  It's your digital library online.  Sixty thousand plus titles, some wonderful literature.  And I've got a deal for you. This is the platinum deal.  I have a platinum account.  That's two books a month.  Well worth it. I go through two books a month easily.  And I see one way I'm building a library.  The neat thing about audible is those books are yours forever.  You can go back to audible, download them again,  put them on a different device, plays on everything.  iPod, Zune, most of the MP3 players, iPhone, of course.  Even the Kindle and some MP3 or GPS devices.  And and with two books a month, you know, you're building a library.  Audible.com slash twit to that's the place to go to sign up for that gold account.  And your first two books are free. Two books free.  Well, you said, are you were you listening to some audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was on the way over here listening to a fantastic book called Making Money  by Terry Pratchett, the latest Terry Pratchett.  But I love Terry. It's a real it's a real return to form.  There has been a segment in the last couple of years  where some of the books have been a little slightly ropey.  The last couple of books have been really good.  A new cast of characters.  You can get the abridged version on audible narrated by Tony Robinson  of Blackadder fame, the counterfeit money.  Yeah, right. You've read it, Doug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I've heard about the book. It's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very scary, of course, his Alzheimer's and he's writing very slowly right now.  But he but this is a new book from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's a new book.  And I would argue it's definitely one of his best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that great?  So he was saying he was only able to write sometimes a sentence a day.  Yeah. So this is a book that a lot of heart and soul put into.  Wow. So which do you recommend abridged or unabridged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the unabridged is read by Steven Briggs, who no offense,  Steven Briggs is a bit of a no name.  Oh, as opposed to Tony Robinson, who is the abridged,  who's a very famous name in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get to so get them both.  So get them both. They're both free.  Listen, you want to listen to an audio book twice.  Once abridged, once unabridged.  I think that's nothing wrong with that.  I'm just thrilled that, you know, much of the Discworld series is on Audible.  In fact, I recommended a lot of it is on Audible.  A lot of it's read by Nigel Plainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he does a great job. Fantastic.  And of course, of the young ones, another great.  Oh, see, I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. But she's a wonderful reader.  Actor in Britain.  So so there you go. Terry Pratchett's Making Money.  I'm looking for the abridged version.  I see the unabridged here by Stephen Briggs.  I wonder if in America, you know what?  We may not have. It may be a UK only UK.  Oh, dear. Oh, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says I'm looking on the site and it says it's in dollars.  It was definitely it's definitely on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, dear. I know. I'm looking for it.  OK, well, I'll find it.  Making Money will put a link in the show notes.  But, you know, any of the Terry Pratchett books would be great.  What's the first Discworld one? It was called The Color of Magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the light fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think it was a well, anyway, both of them.  Get them both. You get to audible.com slash to it too.  But now we've told you four books and maybe you want to, you know,  just get to next month as well.  Audible.com. I love audible.  I know you will, too. It's the greatest.  Listen to the books next time you're on the plane in the car on the train,  stuck doing the laundry, working out in the gym.  I listen to audible all the time.  Audible.com slash twit to we thank you so much for the support.  And thank you, Will, for I had no idea that making money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was on audible. Well, having just done an 11 hour plane trip,  I can attest to the usefulness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know how long the unabridged is.  You should have got the unabridged 11 hours, eight minutes.  Would it take you to the tarmac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would have just about done it. Just about done it.  Maybe for the way home.  Listen to it again. Listen to it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The full unabridged.  Usually I don't mind abridged in nonfiction, but I hate to listen.  Unabridged novels. I want to hear every word, especially if it took him  like a day per sentence.  You just like took a year of his life, you know, and threw it on the street  and said, I don't need it.  Audible.com.  So just teasing slash twit to answer Terry Pratchett.  We love you. Keep writing.  We love those books.  Have they made movies out of any of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wince Rinse Wind and they they've made TV movies in England.  I would love to see movies were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, not not quite that.  I'd love to see somebody put their heart and soul like it like the Harry  Potter quality Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really should be.  And it's amazing. That would be wonderful.  I'm sure it's sat in a Hollywood back lot somewhere on somebody's desk.  Optioned and sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, John, I'm going to give you your choice.  You can talk about digital transition or Facebook, which will it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to choose something.  I might take a third choice.  I think it's something we should discuss a new car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry. No, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Let me look under my chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Video game industry sets or hits two year low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's yeah, we just got off E3, the big video game convention.  My son's in that business.  Is he? Yeah.  Is what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it? Is it because well, my daughter who's sitting here, she says  this because there's no which is what I thought, too.  There's no good games. They suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh. What's your what's your son's game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Transformers 2. Oh, so he comes out comes out this month.  He's working for Activision.  I think he will.  You know, like everybody, the freelancers know, is he design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is he? What part of it does he do?  Oh, cool. So he sits there, plays games all day.  That's what he yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's what it sounds like.  He wishes it were that easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had the dream, the dream of every adolescent everywhere  someday to get paid to play video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  After three years, I don't think it's quite that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it loses some of its thrill, I'm sure.  Yeah, they they say that it is a bad time right now for the video game industry.  U.S. retailers in May hit the lowest mark in nearly two years.  Overall sales dip below a billion for the first time.  Now, when you say below a billion, you can't exactly.  That's a billion per month per month.  It's not exactly, you know, tanking.  It's not like CD-ROM sales or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you'd expect in this economy for everything to be down.  One of the interesting things about the video game business  that always fascinates me, you wouldn't.  Wait, it's it's you know, it's bigger than Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, maybe not now.  No, it is. Yeah, you wouldn't.  That's the thing.  You wouldn't expect movies to go down in a bad economy or video games.  These are relatively inexpensive things you can do that, you know,  you don't have to leave the house.  You don't have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Movies wouldn't have gone down except we have rental.  Yeah. Right.  In the 30s, movies did fine. Right.  Huge. But they were no, they were only in.  You couldn't rent them. You couldn't watch them at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think another point.  I mean, this is a good story in general.  I think another point for the particular dip  in May is the fact that, I mean, May is a really slow time for video game sales.  June is.  June is notorious.  Oh, summer is bad.  I mean, summer is great for movies.  And the flip side being that it's almost always bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought kids getting out of school would help video games,  but I guess they don't want to play them if they have homework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the run up to Christmas, the holiday season,  that's always the huge season.  There's going to be a bonanza this holiday season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Biggest decline, hardware sales, which fell 30 percent from last year.  Games themselves 23 percent down.  While there were some very strong new releases this month,  along with continued strong sales of evergreen games,  the top 10 games sold only two point six million units  compared to three point six, three point seven million last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you just got to look at what I mean,  there's a great article on the Redshard where comparing them.  The top game this year for May is UFC 2009,  which by all accounts is a little bit lame.  Is we fit infamous again, a bit lame Pokemon Platinum on Platinum.  Come on. Whereas last May, the biggest selling game was Grand Theft Auto 4,  which had just gotten released.  So if you compare Grand Theft Auto 4, it's not fair.  This is not platinum.  It's not quite the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is your daughter saying the games suck these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what she said. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she should know she like spend a lot of time on the.  That's all she does.  All your kids are big, big video gamers.  She just gave me a dirty look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What grade is she in?  She's she's in the ninth grade.  Yeah. Straight A's, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My son's in the ninth grade, plays a lot of video games, not straight A's, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, aren't all maybe he should play more.  All the big games we mentioned are all sequel games, too, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's one thing about video games.  Sequels are usually better than unlike movies where the sequels are usually worse.  Video games are usually better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Auto Halo. Yeah, they get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at the first Grand Theft Auto compared to the most GTA four.  I mean, it's like night and day.  The first one was like top down.  To me, I remember playing it like a Pentium 90.  It was fun, but it wasn't anything like today's games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I think it's I think it's mostly economic.  I mean, somebody mentioned that these games are inexpensive and they're not.  The you know, people pay what?  Three hundred, four hundred, five hundred dollars for the hardware.  And then a game like Grand Theft Auto four is, you know, 60 bucks.  The Sims three just came out, which is, you know,  usually played by younger kids, a lot of times girls.  But I bet John, your your daughter is interested in it.  You can get that for 50 or 70 dollars, depending on the version.  That's not cheap. And in this economy and the titles that you listed  are all less expensive.  We titles or that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are the best sellers, aren't they? Yeah.  Well, the we think it's an economic thing. Country mile.  That might be they're just too expensive.  Should they cut prices and I think so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they should.  But the trouble is the cost of development of these games as the systems  get more and more complex is getting higher and higher.  Let me tell you, my son needs a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me tell you, keep those prices up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Grand Theft Auto four cost 150 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was at a I won't say the name of the game or the company,  but I was at a big scoring session for a video game.  They rented Skywalker Sound, 70 piece orchestra, four day recording session.  This is the music for a video game.  It sounded great, but that must have cost alone, you know, several million dollars.  For sure. I mean, you've got musicians there all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is one of the reasons why a lot of game developers are really interested  in the iPhone is game casual game.  They can do things a lot cheaper.  The development is a lot cheaper and it's it's they can also recycle a lot of games.  And potentially you can reach a much larger audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the amount of people with iPhone is that what are we into, like 10, 20 million?  We must be up in that direction, whereas the sales of most  video game consoles are still not quite there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I go back to that Hollywood comparison, you know,  an individual can still make a documentary, let's say,  or even a theatrical, a small theatrical film.  But an individual cannot make a game that's going to compete for the Xbox or.  Or they can make an iPhone.  But you can't exactly.  Exactly. So this is really it's really the change of platform  that enables the the individual developers or the small groups of developers,  because the the skill sets that you need to produce a  competitive game are essentially the same skill sets now as a Hollywood feature film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You look at the the biggest selling,  I believe the biggest selling video game company on the iPhone is this company,  NG Moco, who nobody had ever heard of before the iPhone came along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm thinking I should learn iPhone development.  That's really it's a really interesting.  And by the way, Palm Pre development, anybody who's lining up  to develop for the Palm Pre know, I mean, they may know it's easy.  It's JavaScript. But.  I think the platform is the iPhone. I really do.  What games does your daughter play, John?  I don't think it's Sims 3 somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She doesn't want to answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's killing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she actually plays a lot of of Wii Wii games,  and she plays on the DS a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  DS is great. In fact, Henry and I are going to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she's also she also comes into the living room here  and she turns off the HD feed on the big screen and plays on the  Xbox 360 and leaves it on standard definition video.  Never changes.  She just left. She stomped out kids today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tell you, they don't know we used to be happy with SD.  So so while your daughter is playing Nintendo  and my daughter, my son is playing Xbox 360,  a 14 year old student from New York State has become the youngest person  in history to discover a supernova.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I miss them. Yeah. Wow.  That puts it in perspective. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Carolyn Moore, using a relatively small telescope,  spied the faint object 70 million light years away from Earth.  Yes, they dubbed it SN 2008 H.A.  It's actually a new kind of exploding star,  a thousand times more powerful than a super than a regular Nova,  but a thousand times weaker than a typical supernova.  And I guess she'll be going to Harvard next year.  I don't know. I mean, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  snappy. That's good work. Yeah.  It's better than game playing games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get on that telescope, get that telescope out, look for a Nova or something.  Maybe you can get something named after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now what were these other stories we were going to discuss?  Face squashing. Face squashing.  I like it. I like it. Face squatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook announced  earlier this week that to come midnight Eastern time on Friday,  you would be able to apply because, you know, when you have a Facebook URL,  it's, you know, Facebook dot com slash question mark colon equals number one  three seven four eight seven one one.  You could apply to have whatever you wanted as be your name.  So, for instance, I have Facebook dot com slash Leo Laporte.  And there was a, you know, a presumably a big land grab.  They said in the first 15 minutes, half a million names were assigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, infrastructure handled it. Kudos to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went there in the first three minutes.  I got three domain names because I got Chief Twit for my personal page,  Leo Laporte for my fan page and Twit live for my Twit page.  And it flawless. Nothing. No delays. Nothing. I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw one of my favorites. What's that?  In index dot HTML.  And they get and they got it. No, actually that one.  I just had to want to check on it and it was available.  I think now, now by now I've said it, it's gone. But index dot HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because dots are ignored. So really would be index HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the point is the URL looks like a URL or you could put a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  MySQL command in there. Drop tables. It'd be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody look like, you know, missing page dot JSP or something like that.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think most people, however, opted for their own name.  So here's the question.  Is this kind of from Facebook's point of view?  I think they're looking over at Twitter saying, gosh, you know,  this could be the phone book for the Internet generation.  We got to get into this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it? Yeah, but so who everybody's got a phone book now.  Now there's phone books everywhere.  I mean, everybody who has a large base of customers has a namespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no one has a larger base than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you know, AOL had this 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody was their value at AOL that you're, you know, Leo Laporte at AOL.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was that I think it was tied to screen name.  It was tied to the fact that in their case, it was critical because  if you gave up your AOL address, you lost your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody took Facebook dot com slash default. Now, that's a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's so there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is there value or is it so fragmented that there's not value?  Is it possible that somebody like Facebook could become kind of the de facto?  In other words, somebody said instead of saying at Leo Laporte,  you'll say slash Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think I think it's definitely possible.  I mean, isn't it?  Or I think for a lot of people, particularly, you know, that younger generation,  you know, Facebook is their directory.  Everyone has their phone number listed on Facebook.  Nobody bothers using email. You just Facebook them.  You know what you do on the Palm Free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You enter your Facebook ID in here and it takes all the phone numbers  from all your Facebook friends and populates your contact.  I have an app for the iPhone.  That's the same thing to your address book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's exactly what you want, because that means, you know,  they can update their Facebook page.  You can automatically have their latest numbers.  I think I think it's certainly going, you know, I can see in a in six months  to a year, you know, Facebook is your address book.  And I mean, I think that there's got to be that there's got to be some kind of Twitter  Facebook. I was going to say why I mean, there has to be again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once you have a few million users, you know, you have a certain amount of clout  with that. I mean, how many people do you know on Facebook who aren't also on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know a lot of people on Facebook that aren't on Twitter.  But that's because I think Facebook now has expanded.  We know there's a lot much, much larger group of people.  Facebook is universal. I mean, my mother is on Facebook.  And, you know, my mother would not dream of being on Twitter,  but everybody she knows is on Facebook, all her old friends.  And so, you know, she's got to be on Facebook as well. Lord help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook is the new AOL.  Yeah, that's why Facebook is probably look at it.  It's going to end up like AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's John.  It's the right. I think I think Facebook's days are numbered.  Really? Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Facebook made money last quarter.  Because it's a walled garden?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't like their attitude.  I don't think. I mean, if you look at what Facebook is doing.  I just don't like it.  I don't like them. That's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not only are they creating a universal address book, but they're, you know,  Facebook Connect is the most genius thing I've heard in the last 12 months  because they're allowing you to use that address book to plug in everywhere else.  I was giving a talk the other day and I was saying, you know,  there is no reason if you're building a web app today  to ever build your own sign on system, you should know.  You know, there is no reason because everybody can just sign on with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except aren't you kind of a prisoner of Facebook then?  I mean, doesn't that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what you lose, what you lose in terms of like the flexibility  and, you know, somebody else owning that user data,  you gain in the fact that there's no barrier to entry for whatever your service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  On my, for instance, I use discuss on my blog comments and discuss  automatically allows Facebook login.  And I get many more comments because they don't have to create an account.  They already have one.  Although now they've added Twitter and also people can sign it.  Twitter's got a lot.  So now that all is the is the engine behind this is that the open's open  source, you know, authentication system.  Twitter supports all Facebook supports all.  It's open ID.  Basically, they've just become different.  It's different. Open ID and all the other different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Related conceptually the same.  Yeah, but not related technically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, the nice thing about Flickr used off is that you can give somebody  access to your account without giving them the keys to the kingdom.  And that was the problem with Twitter.  You have to give you used to have to give them your password.  Now you can just say authorize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not sure somebody in the chat room will tell us.  I'm not sure that Facebook is off.  Oh, off is more for APIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook's using open ID.  They may not open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm not. But is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the big deal that they support.  They are now an open ID as a user.  As a user, it doesn't look like it, but that that no, that's kind of that Facebook  Connect, I guess, could also be used in an open ID.  I should try. We use open ID for our sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should try it. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a story at Silicon  Alley insider Nicholas Carlson has it  that in which it's an interview with Zuckerberg.  And he says that Facebook's future is not as a website,  but rather it has a platform spread across the web.  And if if they do that and do that successfully,  I think Facebook has a future.  But if they stay kind of as a walled garden,  that is as much irritating as it is useful,  which is, I think, kind of the way a lot of people feel about it now.  I don't think they have much of a.  And here's the key.  And I really don't like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the key.  You can't be a platform unless you're open, in my opinion.  So I think Microsoft would disagree.  But but I agree with you.  They disagree.  I think that that's why they're going to lose in the long run,  because they are a closed platform.  You know, look at Google Wave versus whatever, you know, SharePoint  or whatever Microsoft's going to do in the collaboration field.  Who are you going to adopt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to adopt the opening open is possibly game changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huge. Yeah.  So I would say the same.  I would submit the same thing about Facebook if they are.  And this is the problem.  I actually had this conversation with Facebook with Dave Warren.  If the problem is that the culture at Facebook, they even said this,  our users don't want us to be open.  They come there with an expectation of privacy.  It's very difficult.  Facebook, in effect, has to change its culture.  You go to Facebook because no one can see what you're doing there.  I asked my daughter at nine o'clock on Friday.  Well, aren't you going to create Facebook dot com slash Abby Laporte?  She said, no, the colleges will see me.  She doesn't.  The point of Facebook for her is privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think I think there's a difference between  being open with data and being open as a platform  to allow people to do what they want with their data.  I think it is perfectly acceptable.  I agree. Facebook to be very, very open about its platform.  But still, but, you know, use that openness to enable people to choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was my point. I said, look, you've already got this everybody switch  on your privacy controls.  Shouldn't if somebody says chosen, it's not the default.  Somebody's chosen.  Everybody can see my data.  Shouldn't you make it open?  And Facebook did not.  In fact, they said sites like Friendfee can only cash it for 24 hours.  They have to dump it.  That isn't open.  And they say the reason we didn't make it fully open is because our users  expect privacy, even though I agree with you, Will.  You could make that a switch.  You could say you could have a public facing Facebook,  but they say we're not public facing Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Leo, well, why doesn't your daughter use that name of hers anyway?  And just keep what kind of a facade site.  So the colleges do see her.  They're going to see her some prim and proper person who's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  happy to have a lot of photos of really, really, really proper things.  There's lots of teenage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, don't you think as a dad wondered, well, what the hell is on your page  that you don't want anybody to really?  No kidding.  What is it? The drunken photos?  Not for public consumption.  Abby, what exactly is on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many Facebook users are there compared to Gmail users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gmail is pretty small.  Facebook much, much, much, much bigger.  Gmail is surprisingly small.  Yahoo and Hotmail much bigger than Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Much, much bigger.  But Gmail has such a mind share among the tech.  The Dijerati.  Is there anybody who's I mean, it's a numbers game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there anybody who's close to Facebook to have that kind of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and Facebook's growing at a faster rate than anybody.  Facebook is growing.  Even Twitter is close.  Facebook's growing by like three Twitter's a month.  I mean, Facebook is growing.  I don't know what the actual number is, but it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, last number I heard was 40 million, but it must be a lot bigger than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, it's well over 200.  I think it's over 200 million.  Yeah. And the last time I heard a user, 300 somebody in the chat room says 300 now.  I think now and these, by the way, as far as I know, are active users.  This isn't even people who signed up for a Facebook account and haven't used it again.  This is this is per month, 300 million people.  I mean, it's that's that's that's huge power.  And is one of the reasons I think we should we should really be pushing Facebook to be open.  So I like your threat, Doug.  You're going to be a well, if you don't open up.  I told him I told him you're going to be classmates dot com if you don't open up.  Now, that was a threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there's a big difference between.  I think we'll had it right.  It's a big difference between an open platform and, you know, everything being public.  Those are not all the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But I agree with you.  And I said that to them and they said, well, I know, but we still think are, you know,  they and I think there's an interesting observation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I made this and most of the Facebookers I know are over 40.  And Leo, you're a big user.  My daughter doesn't have a Facebook page.  And I don't know if my most of the people you know are over 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say the same thing about Twitter.  They say, oh, Twitter is really not where it is for the older demo.  Isn't it odd that social networking is actually taken over in a with the older  people better than younger people?  Why is that? Where are we more social?  I don't have any more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. My daughter came back into the room.  Finally, she says we don't like to be surrounded by old farts.  So where are they going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they? Yeah, right. Who does?  Are they going? I don't think.  Are they going to my space? Where are they going?  Where do they? Where are the kids dying?  Yeah. By the fact, that's one of the stories.  My space, supposedly big, big layoffs on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think Facebook is full of old people.  I think older people are now joining Facebook faster.  But you got to remember what Facebook's roots were.  It was as a college away for people in college to find each other at universities.  And that's also where the privacy comes from, is is is from its roots  and the design of it originally.  And I think that's kind of built into it.  And it's hard for them to get away from it.  But yeah, I don't think Facebook is mostly old people.  I think that's who's getting on now. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. Something on the one of you guys there said to something like your  your mom or your grandmother. Yeah, my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But your mom's like my age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't that say?  Super old. You're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your mom's your mom's probably younger.  Your mom's probably much younger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would it take for something new to come along that was creative and interesting  and that attracted younger people?  They're using Facebook.  Listen, we've gone from AOL to Live Journal to MySpace to Facebook.  What is that? The end?  We're going to stop at Facebook.  I don't see why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Clearly not. I agree with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's you know, and I think also Twitter has some legs there.  I mean, my you know, I don't know a lot of kids my daughter's age,  but but she's gotten on Facebook and she I mean on Twitter and, you know,  has found it useful and is beginning to kind of evangelize it to her friends.  She's the job.  She asked me to mention her Facebook name.  So she's the job.  T-H-E-J-U-B.  So you go follow her, treat her nice.  And just got a few thousand more people, more and more people who are younger,  I think are getting on Twitter.  And I think the kind of the rap that it's for old people  doing social networking is probably going to end soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what you're seeing is the universality of these platforms that as people start  to realize, you know, it all it doesn't happen till your friends are using it,  but it sweeps through groups virally.  So I remember in Facebook, the fastest growing town was Toronto.  And Toronto was growing faster than like the whole United States  because everybody was, you know, there was this viral spread.  And I think that's how it kind of goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's because social networks are only useful  if you have a network of people on them. Right.  And so they inherently sweep through groups of people  because one person tells the other person tells the other person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although Twitter is not quite that way because Twitter,  you can follow people you don't know.  Twitter is not really a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter is kind of like a fan club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's here's here's your daughter's site, the job, everybody go see the job.  My daughter is also on Twitter, by the way.  In fact, she started she started using it more.  But, you know, to actually give the lie to your daughter, John,  my daughter, when she went to France as junior in high school,  everybody that was going she was going to be going to school with was on Facebook.  They connected that way.  They got to know each other that way.  They stay in touch now that way.  Everybody in her high school is on Facebook.  I think that that's it's it's not for old farts.  It's for everybody now. I think everybody's using it.  That's I mean, that's how you get to 300 million active users.  That's stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this endorsement has been brought to you by  so on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many of you guys got your vanity URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got mine like two seconds ago.  I literally just sat here and typed it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good thing if you didn't do it.  So you got Will Harris, Will Harris, not Channel Flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got Twitter dot com slash Will Harris, Facebook dot com slash Will Harris.  I think I already had Channel Flip for them from the fan page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they did something weird with fan pages  because I had Leo Laporte before this all happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm hoping somebody else takes mine so I can sue them later.  Thank you, Tony LaRusso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they yeah, Tony's suing Twitter.  They actually had a mechanism, which I took advantage of.  If you're a trademark holder,  you could send a note to Facebook saying I have a trademark on Twitter,  which I did, and they will monitor for people using your trademark and block it.  Wow. But now they sent me a note back saying we're kind of swamped right now.  So it might be a little while before we do that.  It's it's I think it's quite interesting.  Denise Howell has a blog post on her ZDNet legal blog, Logarithms.  I always confuse it with blogarithms, by the way, which is my blog,  which is your blog, Doug.  Six things to know if your Facebook username has been squatted.  See, once you pick a name, you can't change it.  You know, you're kind of stuck with it.  Can't get more than one. Can't get more than one.  It's kind of bad.  I mean, I chose Chief Twit for my personal page, but, you know,  it's like getting a tattoo.  What if, you know, in a few years, I want to be a dignified fellow.  And now I'm stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure if you call Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm sure he'll he'll take my calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, Chief Twit Online for.  Here's some things to keep about.  Keep in mind about username squatting.  There there is a form, the IP infringement form that you can say, hey, I don't,  you know, so this is on Denise's blog.  Six things to know.  Logarithms. It's blogs. ZDNet.  .com slash Howell, H-O-W-E-L-L.  Many jurisdictions, including California, where Facebook is headquartered,  restrict or prohibit.  I didn't know this unauthorized use of a person's name, image, likeness  or unequivocal aspects of one's identity.  So if somebody's posing as Doug Kay on Facebook and pretending to be you,  not that their name is Doug Kay, you can't do anything about that.  But if they're pretending to be the Doug Kay, you can pursue them.  She said it's not squatting if somebody happens to share your name.  And, you know, that's kind of the legal thing.  Did you get Doug or you, Doug Kay, Facebook dot com slash Doug Kay, Doug K.  The dots are invisible.  Well, you could use it or not. Doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what was that?  Now, there was one other story you wanted to get to before we finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the digital convergence.  So we have three minutes left.  We have three minutes left.  There's not much to say. I don't think, you know, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're talking about the digital convergence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the digital analog to digital.  They turn. Look at actually a moment of a moment of silence  for analog television, which died  after a long and healthy life on Friday, June 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess it wasn't a big catastrophe.  They expected they probably could have done this a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, they got three hundred thousand calls on Saturday.  As I said, most of those calls were, huh?  It's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that the FCC got the call? FCC.  Who's going to know to call the FCC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they most people call the TV stations, if they knew to call the FCC,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they would have known about the converter.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good point. We should probably ask TV stations

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  put a message on call the FCC.  Don't call us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, my daughter is not working.  I can't figure out how to use the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the thing that's scandalous to me is how all the cable companies  have used this as an excuse to befuddle people.  You know, the digital transition is something you probably don't have  to deal with yet in London.  I think like we have another couple of years.  Yeah, but at some point it's going to happen.  And the cable companies go, oh, the digital transition is happening.  You better get a digital box as if that had anything to do with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but they see you were talking earlier today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They re digitized Petaluma.  This is. Hello. Yeah.  Come on. So what phone is that?  Is that the 71?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an analog clunker.  Oh, it's a real phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Analog. Is it a princess, a pink princess phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I could see.  If I had those, I believe me, I would love to collect a few of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, my wife wants me to buy desperately a phone that hangs on the wall  in the kitchen as a really long cord.  She says we keep losing the dang wireless phones.  The kids keep taking them.  I'm on a corded phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's you just get a cradle and then coil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember the really, really long coiled cord.  You kind of get it wrapped all around you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny how the more you go forward, the more you want to get back.  Yeah, please bring back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I have on my desk is a corded phone with a long cord,  because in a hurricane, when the power goes out, you want a corded phone.  And so and you want to be able to make sure I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to be able to carry it all the way into the into the bathroom.  The cellar.  So Comcast.  John, do you have Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's Comcast stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So so the have you seen the spots that they're running  telling you that if you have Comcast, whether you have a converter box or not,  you don't need to change anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I we actually if you watch the last cranky geeks we did,  I think it was either the one that's run on maybe it's the one running on Wednesday or  the one last week.  We somebody brought in the card that they're sending out to all their customers,  too, which has all this vague information.  Oh, we're going to lose this channel and that channel.  You better get a hold of us.  So it's very confusing.  But I actually only I have Comcast, but I really only used it for a  for a sling box and for my Internet connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their goal, they really want to go all I remember this when we were at Tech TV.  They want to be all digital because they can get more channels jammed in there.  And they have and they can't FCC won't let them force customers to do this.  I think there's a few more years before they could say willy nilly.  You got to get a digital box.  Customers don't want a cable box.  I don't want a cable box.  Who wants a cable box?  So they're tricky.  They're trying to trick you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but now they've made a technological change that requires it.  They have disabled the analog channels.  They don't tell you that.  Yeah.  They tell you if you're on Comcast, you're covered.  So, you know, they're doing it, you know, sort of area by area.  We lost our analog channels about 45 days ago and you have to get a DTA.  It's called you have to get a box.  It's nearly they've disabled analog.  It's gone.  I thought they couldn't do that legally.  No, that's that's the scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I'm jumping up and down.  I think what's really interesting is that, you know, I think these companies really do realize  the amount of cool and clever and money saving and money making stuff  that you can do when you get people into digital.  I read an amazing article yesterday about how I guess the equivalent in the UK Sky TV,  which runs digital satellite, about how they're now doing user profiling based on what you watch.  And they'll stream you your own like bespoke ads to insert into your TV service.  And so they'll pick up what it is you like to watch and they'll stream you the ads digitally  that they think is going to be most relevant to you in your TV break.  So you might be watching Lost on TV, the person in the next door gets, you know,  like a Chrysler ad, but you're really interested in technology.  You get a Microsoft ad.  But what's wrong with that?  On the hard drive.  Isn't that a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because then I'll see ads that I care about and not as I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can argue about whether it's good or bad, but you can't do that with analog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So another reason for them to go to another reason to push digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, about a year ago, they stopped sending the channel guide down channel 11 where I live.  Right.  It just stopped.  Channel 11 went empty.  They didn't put another channel on it.  And now you have to get the digital to get to get that back.  You want a channel guide.  I hate the channel guide, but you know, sometimes you know what the most watched cable channel is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always has been the TV guide channel.  It's the most watched cable channel.  So fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just leave it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that I think it must be to default in some way and it's just it's what's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, another way that the cable companies are trying to kind of push this onto people is with DVRs.  You know, if you have a DVR, you don't need that either.  And that actually makes a separate box.  Right.  Something at least is valuable.  Yeah.  Right.  It has some value to it.  I switched to U-verse a while back.  They have that in our area and you know, it's basically works the same as cable comes in over the phone lines.  You know, great DSL service if you choose that.  And so people where, you know, they have Verizon's Fios or where they have U-verse,  you know, you're starting to get some choice, but it's not everywhere yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I lost my FM too.  That was a nasty problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we used to be able to get a radio on the.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So now you can't DTA won't give you any audio outputs.  Now you're supposed to subscribe to the music channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're one of those old people.  You should call the FCC.  I just lost my radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I happened to know the phone number of the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a call on the, I got a call on the, on the radio show this week from somebody who has,  remember those old radios that you could get TV stations on?  She says, what happens?  You don't have those in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the heck is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could, you could in the U S you could buy a radio that tunes the television dial.  Right.  And listen to the radio, the TV on the radio, which is great.  You know what?  90% of the time it's plenty.  Yeah.  It's all I want.  That would be awesome.  Yeah.  She said, what's going to happen?  I said, this doesn't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you know the iPhone app public radio tuner?  No, I don't know that public radio tuner.org.  Okay.  Just before we go to public radio, a freebie for you all.  It's a, it's a nonprofit app.  It's a great app.  It's a version one is available now and this gives you access no matter where you are to  almost, almost all the, all the major public radio stations in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I use wonder radio, W U N D R from weather underground.  And it has the most complete list of everything, including all the public radio stations.  So you don't have to be limited to that.  There's, does it give you the stations or just the listings?  No, you can listen on your, on your iPhone.  In fact, most of them work on, on edge.  Wonder.  This works on edge.  Yeah.  So this wonder radio, I would say also another good choice, but I'll give you,  I'll give you a plug for this one.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And, and what they're working on coming soon will be all of the public radio programs on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is nice though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Many of them do that.  KQED does it on demand, but on the phone, it's a, it's a beautiful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People should be listening to podcasts.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forget this radio.  What's radio?  Actually the BBC to their credit has most of their shows on demand as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.  They did.  Well, they, they made this new thing.  You can listen on the audio.  So you can also, you can get, they make a lot of podcasts through the iTunes store or,  you know, RSS, which you can get just downloaded.  But of course they've also got the iPlayer, which is their kind of, I guess, Hulu equivalent.  Hey, which you can, which you can watch on the iPhone.  What's more exciting is that.  Unless you're outside the UK.  Unless you're outside the UK, in which case you need to proxy your,  proxy your connection and you can, you can wangle it.  But what they're working on now, which is fantastic, is a,  is an open standard for set top box on demand over IP.  So in five years time, you know, theoretically every TV will be built to a standard that includes  IP streaming straight from the internet.  So you can go BBC one, BBC two, BBC three,  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can create your own channel guide and it can include any on the TV's have to be updated  to do that or?  There'll be new TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's actually a couple of Sony sets out there now that do that.  Yeah, the IPTV sets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's a Sony standard.  That's the future.  Whereas BBC is creating an open standard.  Fantastic.  Anybody can contribute.  What's the name of the standard?  Well, the code name of it is called the Canvas Project.  And so the idea is that it'll just pipe any IP channel to your TV,  like any other channel of TV.  And when that comes, that is the whole.  It's all over.  Right.  Yeah, it's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All video, all on demand.  Yeah.  That means DVRs go away completely because everything's.  Well, it's a challenge that we have because we do streaming video and we need to offer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it downloadable so that we don't you don't have because you can't TVO streaming video.  Yes, exactly.  So we need to solve that.  I think it's a small fraction of people will watch the downloads,  but nevertheless, you got to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the ability then for Indies, for Indie producers to be a long slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you do channel flip.  You must be thrilled.  Yeah, I'm quite excited.  Yeah.  Well, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two words, bandwidth caps.  Yeah.  In the US, we've got to we've got to fight that video bandwidth.  You got to fight that baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, good luck is right.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to buy this PRX public.  In fact, not only that, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, Doug.  I'm going to plug it.  I'm giving it on the next Mac mania in about a month.  I'm giving a lecture on 60 great iPhone apps.  This will be one of them.  Hopefully version two.  It's a great app.  Version two looks really cool.  Did you know about it already, Dwight?  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  In fact, I think version two is out.  I think I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's in beta.  iPhone.  Oh, OK.  Works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the new one, the Wednesday night technology bites radio show I do wasn't on the first one  and it is on the new one.  So I was really happy about that.  We are on a Pacifica station and not all of those are carried on apps like this.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we're out of time, but what a great show this has been.  I want to thank you so much for coming all the way from London, England.  I mean, Oxford, England, ladies and gentlemen, Will Harris.  We flew out of London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You flew out of London.  So can I get a twitter.com slash Will Harris plug?  My numbers are minuscule compared to the mighty Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I get a tweet tweet?  Did you see the New York Times did a I think fairly scathing article on the suggested users  list on Twitter?  I was very happy to see them out that not scathing, but they revealed the truth about it,  which is it has nothing to do with anything.  So it's twitter.com slash one L. Will Harris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone get me over 14,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we can do that.  You're currently at 13,880 followers and a lovely background.  What is that?  It's a it's like a ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a cute ninja.  It's from one of my favorite web comics, which is little gamers, little dash gamers.com.  A massively under read web comic with some fantastic illustrations.  It's from Sweden.  So it's very, you know, pro pirate bay, et cetera.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell me about that.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, rather than try to grow our own podcasting, we realize that the new challenge is finding  and sharing podcasting.  So it's a site for finding and sharing everything in online spoken word, video, video, and meta  site.  What's that?  It's a meta site.  Yeah, it's a meta site.  And it's we've got over a quarter million objects in there now.  We've got audio books, public radio shows, podcasts, you name it.

John, I would curiously somebody pointed out to me that also if you just run it by itself on a boat,  this is a boat flag.  That's for the letter D.  Would you like to signal to each other?  It means when it's running by itself, it does that distress a boat out of control.  Look out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And actually, Leo, that aired.  That did aired.  It aired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It did air, but only briefly.  Didn't they pull it?  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They aired like a few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because otherwise, we wouldn't have it if it hadn't aired, I guess.  Or maybe they put it.  I thought they maybe put it on a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was writing a paper on the PC and it was like, and then like half of my paper was gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She'd gone on set or she'd gone to a company.  She says it was cough syrup.  Who was auditioning for it.  And she'd gone to a company, somebody else.  She wasn't there to be on the show.  She wasn't there to be on it.  And she suddenly had this story and they said, this is amazing.  The only problem was she'd been on some kind of drastic pain medication.  So she was kind of hopped up on the pain medication,  which they didn't realize.  And it was only kind of afterwards when they put it out.  Well, I think Apple is very stoner chic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to play it one more time.  Now that you say that, I think we should end the show with the lovely  Heidi Fleiss.  Not Heidi Fleiss.  She was a madam.  She was a madam.  Ellen Feis.  Ellen Feis.  Not Heidi Fleis.  No.  Although we could end the show with Heidi Fleis too.  That would possibly get us in prison.  Actually, there's a second one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Let's find it.  There's one that the other one didn't air.  I'm sure that...  Oh, yeah.  Here's the second one.  Ellen Feis strikes back.  I figure if you're going to do one, do two, right?  I've seen the second one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take it someplace fun.  Skiing or something, you know.  The beach by the pool.  It's really fast.  And I just got it and it's silver and it's really exciting.  And the sound quality is really good.  And I don't have to watch airplane movies anymore.  You got your feet in the sand and you're typing away and it's fun.
