Transcript:  I really liked protocol.  And every time we had you on, I would say, what a great job you were doing.  What great coverage.  This was you were I didn't realize this.  You were still under the umbrella of Politico, which was sold to Axel Springer, the big German  publisher some time ago.  And it was Springer's decision, I think, to to cut protocol.  Would you say it is a comment on tech?  Like maybe maybe we're in a bad business, heaven for fend covering tech.

Start time: 303.21
End time: 333.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think it's much more a comment about media.  I mean, you know, there certainly is like a, you know, an incestuous merging of tech  and media these days.  But, you know, it's a tough business.  I have been through a lot of publications that are sadly no longer with us.  You know, RIP suck dot com, Red Herring, Business 2.0.  I mean, maybe it's me.  Maybe it's you.  Maybe I'm the problem.  By the way, all of those were great.

Start time: 335.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I loved suck dot com.  What a wonderful attitude and take and a great place.  Great writing.  Tony Perkins, Red Herring was fantastic.  I love Tony and I loved Red Herring.  I mean, it's kind of you worked for the best except for Gawker.  I'm not going to include Gawker, but you've worked for everyone else.  It's been great.  It is a tough it's a tough road to how we're even struggling.  I think as a tech focused podcast, I'm really close to murdering somebody and having a mystery show because joking, joking.  It's OK, John.  John's going to disappear and people are going to think I did it.  What happened to Jam or B?  It could be a good podcast.  Jill, you're still PC magazine still around, but kind of a shadow of its former glory days, I guess.

Start time: 454.54
End time: 465.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta say, since he left, I have not been super happy with Evernote's direction.  I jumped ship a couple of years ago on that.  I just couldn't keep up with that tool anymore.  I think we all did.

Start time: 465.66
End time: 482.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Phil is one of those diplomatic guys who's going to be careful.  He even almost had something nice to say about Elon Musk, almost.  And Consumer Reports, how old is Consumer Reports, Nicholas?  I think 93, something like that.  It's older than my mom.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's an old publication still around.  Still, the magazine is still around.  It still does well.  I still get it.  The website.  I mean, most of my stuff is on the website, of course.  But yeah, I'm happy to be here.  I'm proud to be here.  And long may it continue, I guess.

Transcript:  It's, you know, it's a tricky business like Owen was saying.  And I'm actually interested, too.  Is it a tech thing?  Are people just over tech?  I feel like since 2016, it's been just like nod, like an onslaught of nonstop, like big tech, tech is evil, yada yada.  And maybe people are just over it.  Maybe they're done. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Consumer Reports made a little bit of headline last week for the first time,  Disrecommending the Tesla.  I remember in the early days of the Tesla, it was the highest rated car.  And I know you're not involved in the car testing.  So, yeah, I have zero.  But they said it's the highest rated car we've ever tested.  They give it a hundred points.  Now, here we are some years later and they've actually D.  Oh, no, it was Ford, not Tesla was Ford.  They delisted their electric vehicles.  I noticed this because I drive one because of unreliability.  But even even the Tesla, even all the electric vehicles do not score very highly on the rated on the on the reliability.

Transcript:  I just bought a brand new 22 Toyota RAV4 gas engine.  The electrics seem interesting, but I feel like I'm not quite there yet.  Maybe not there yet. Yeah.

Start time: 580.00
End time: 644.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an interesting thing.  You know, maybe we're going back to gas engines.  Maybe it's maybe gas is back.  No idea. No, I hope not.  So let's talk, I guess, about Twitter.  There's really only one news story at this point, which is that Musk said on Friday that they're going to restore.  He had a he had a poll.  So weird that Elon Musk, who tried to get out of the Twitter deal by saying, oh, the bots, the bots, the bots, you can't nobody's real on Twitter.  And now has having polls, which are clearly bought it heavily bought it.  The poll, 72 percent, I think, voted yes.  Twitter should reinstate accounts banned for harassment, misinformation, hate.  As long as it's not illegal, he said, we're bringing them back.  Is next week going to be a nightmare on the health side?  Owen, do you still spend time on the Twitter?

Start time: 646.26
End time: 713.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tend to be more of a broadcaster than a consumer.  Yeah, me too. When I use Twitter, I tend to I tend to put messages out there.  I try to keep up with any responses.  But like these days, especially, I'm just not going back and forth a lot with it.  And I find that's kind of a healthy relationship with Twitter.  I, you know, I think it is an unwinding of all of the work that Twitter said.  Yeah, you know, Twitter under Jack Dorsey did on prioritizing health.  And I think the real impact you're going to see is that advertisers who had already paused a lot of their business with Twitter are going to just walk away because it's not a must buy.  It is a relatively small audience online.  It doesn't, you know, it doesn't move the needle for like a big, you know, consumer brand these days.  And that's going to be a real problem for for Elon because, you know, it doesn't seem like blue verified is, you know, burning up the charts either in terms of bringing in revenue.

Transcript:  I know that Jill's Twitter handle is now, Jill, I didn't pay for the checkmark Duffy.  You still have it, by the way. I didn't pay for mine either.  We still have them. But I guess at some point they'll expire.

Start time: 728.44
End time: 752.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And that's fine with me. I don't really care.  I'm taking I'm taking a hiatus from Twitter. Last week was just the moment where I said this is not what I can do right now.  This is not where I can spend my time. This is not where I feel good about spending my time and sending out my message.  So for those of you on Mastodon, I'm on the big server at Jilly Duffy at Mastodon dot social.  And I'll build up there a little bit. We'll see how it goes.

Start time: 753.70
End time: 760.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just followed you on our Mastodon instance.  Thank you. Twitter. Social. Yeah, that's great.

Start time: 761.16
End time: 831.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm happy to see some new ideas coming up about social media.  You know, I think Twitter, Twitter really did have a place.  Maybe it will continue to have a place. I'm not sure.  But I think that what Mastodon is really doing is getting people to think about what would something that's similar to Twitter but different be like?  Anybody who's coming to Mastodon thinking that it is a Twitter alternative that is just a recreation of Twitter on a different place.  They're totally wrong. You have to go into Mastodon thinking that this is something new and you should really be open to experiencing it in a new way.  So the way that you interact with people, the way that posts don't get bumped up into your line of sight based on how popular they are,  the way that people are hosted on different servers that is not just one big place controlled by one person.  Like this is a great experiment in a way for people to try out something new, see if they like it, continue critiquing what they don't like about social media and get more experience with it.

Start time: 831.82
End time: 842.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it could be a different thing entirely. A kinder, gentler, no ads, no algorithm conversation is an interesting idea.  But Nicholas, you said you're done with social entirely.

Start time: 846.24
End time: 853.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of think so. About six months ago, I really kind of stopped caring about social media and stopped using it. Not just Twitter, but Instagram.

Start time: 853.08
End time: 855.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're not alone. I think a lot of people feel that way. Burnout.

Start time: 856.92
End time: 889.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I've always used Twitter, frankly, as like a silly, you know, soccer jokes and video game gifts.  I've you know, since going back to 2008, so I never really treated it as like critical to my life.  So for me to step back and just like not use it as much is frankly not that big of a deal.  But yeah, I wonder if if if you know, just seeing the news coverage of this and seeing how people get really maybe in some cases kind of justifiably upset about the changes made.  It's like, do we really want a website to have that much control over our lives?  Like, I don't I don't know.

Start time: 890.00
End time: 905.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just lives, our mental state, our our, you know, how we how we think about the world and especially one that's designed to spin up outrage and upset.  I stopped using Facebook because I always felt bad afterwards.  That was years ago. Twitter.

Start time: 907.04
End time: 969.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter. Like I often think I often think, you know, as I'm, you know, you know, on my deathbed or whatever, not to be too weird, but like, am I am I really going to say like, well, I wish I spent more time refreshing my timeline on Twitter?  Probably not. I don't think I'm going to be saying that.  I think I think I'm going to be saying, oh, I wish I spent more time with my friends and family.  So like, I just I just feel like the balance on a lot of these platforms has gotten way out of whack.  And I personally am just trying to like bring it back a little bit.  And I've had, frankly, great success over the summer.  I really tried to start jogging and I've gotten pretty decent at it.  I've gotten into pretty decent shape and just like the number of hours that you just like spend just scrolling through.  Yeah, it's I don't know.  I don't know. And I'm not trying to be glib or anything, but like I really I hope folks kind of use this kind of like Twitter moment as an opportunity to kind of like reflect and be like, is this is this how I want to spend my life?  Just like really getting amped up about this site.

Start time: 969.48
End time: 1056.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I feel like Twitter Twitter has had its time, though.  I want to say, you know, if we think back to the Arab Spring, for instance, or even Occupy Wall Street, Twitter really became the way that people organized and that they were allowed to talk to one another, find out what was going on.  Even as recently as some of the riots in Hong Kong a couple of years ago, a lot of that was just, you know, grassroots organized through Twitter.  I think we should keep in mind that there is a population of people who are using it for doom scrolling.  I think it's it's really become a replacement for RSS in a lot of ways in the sense of getting your news right.  So instead of getting an RSS feed of headlines that you're interested in reading, people started using Twitter instead and following journalists.  And that was kind of an interesting use case in the same way that organizing social movements has become an interesting use case.  And so, you know, I think the doom scrolling and getting sucked into it and feeling bad about yourself, that certainly is a problem for a lot of people.  But it's not the only way to use this tool.  And again, like if we think about the ways that we are experimenting with social media, like there's a lot to be learned, whether people decide to stay with Twitter or not.  There's a lot to be learned from it going forward about what kinds of tools do we need if people are going to collectively organize against a government or an institution of some kind, you know.

Start time: 1057.10
End time: 1139.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that you say that because it's going on right now in China.  I think that to some degree, that's opportunistic.  People have done the same with WhatsApp or Telegram.  Twitter was there, so they used it. But there are other ways to do it.  It's interesting because about three weeks ago, Apple changed iOS 16 to change the way AirDrop works.  You can't turn on, accept AirDrops from anyone for longer than 10 minutes.  It turns itself off.  And in the US, I guess you could say, well, that's a security measure.  But it was widely used in China for organizers because it was one of the few ways you could communicate with anybody in your vicinity.  You had to be geographic within, I guess, 100 feet of each other.  But you could communicate with anybody in your vicinity without identifying yourself or them.  It was a fairly anonymous way.  And I'm told it was widely used in China for organizing.  China is now undergoing the most severe civil unrest it's had in years without that.  And it's, you know, I'm not, I mean, we can't point a finger at Apple and say, well, you see Apple was asked by the Chinese.  I mean, you'd have to presume Apple was asked a few weeks ago by the Chinese government to turn that feature off preemptively.  They're no longer able to use it. But I think you find other ways to.

Start time: 1141.44
End time: 1170.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Twitter is one example.  But some of the things that you just said, you know, air dropping information using WhatsApp, finding other encrypted messaging apps.  These are all ways that we're still trying them out.  We're still figuring out what works.  I just think when we look back at Twitter and its value, we should remember those things and remember how they worked, when, why, and not just say, oh, it was just doom scrolling all the time.  And, you know, looking at Trump's tweets and Elon Musk's tweets.

Start time: 1170.08
End time: 1182.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And we're very US centric.  I mean, Twitter is most of the users or 80 percent of the users are outside the US.  I read, I don't know if that's true.  I think Elon said that. And many of them are in Japan.  It's very popular in Japan.

Start time: 1183.08
End time: 1209.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you remember when the White House actually called Twitter and asked them not to shut it down for like scheduled maintenance because there were protests, I think, in Iran at the time.  Oh, interesting.  And they were, they were worried that it would interfere with the ability to communicate.  I think I agree with what you're saying.  I think people are mourning that Twitter, you know, or the many Twitters, you know, everyone kind of had their own experience.

Start time: 1210.08
End time: 1218.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people who didn't have a voice use Twitter to create community, to get a voice.  Yeah, we're mourning it.

Start time: 1219.32
End time: 1243.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think those people are feeling that like with the, you know, with the dramatic loosening of policies and the deprioritization of health that like, you know, Twitter is just no longer a home for them.  And it's hard to move homes.  You know, it's certainly Macedon and Telegram and, you know, everything else is out there, but you just.  Tumblr. Tumblr.  There's a lot of people going to Tumblr.

Start time: 1244.20
End time: 1274.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt Milingweg said 18 percent increase in Tumblr signups this week.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a throwback.  But yeah, I know I'm not going to go to Tumblr or Macedon to organize the next revolution.  I don't think it's going to happen there.  It's not that kind of a place.  Twitter felt so much more public.  I do also like you, Nicholas, got news from Twitter.  Yeah.  And that's going to be a big loss.  That was a, it was almost a wire service in a way.

Start time: 1275.10
End time: 1321.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it definitely replaced RSS for a lot of my colleagues and friends and media.  We all use Google Reader.  I used to use that newswire on Mac back in the day.  And it's like these Twitter replaced all that for better or worse.  And so it will be interesting to see.  You know, the other thing I'm thinking is that maybe, you know, with, you know, these communities that are maybe it's time for a new a new thing.  Maybe Twitter had his time in the sun.  OK, great.  Let's try something.  Let's try something else.  It's like the idea that Twitter was that was it.  The final boss.  Like that's that.  That is as good as it's ever going to get on the Internet is very weird to me.  That's not like the idea.  It should be constantly getting better and improvement and like cooler or more interesting.  But just the idea that Twitter is that's it.  No more.  That never sat well with me.  It's interesting.

Transcript:  I do feel like people are performatively quitting Twitter.  Like an example is Phil Schiller, the longtime Apple marketing executive.  You got to remember.  So Phil Schiller deleted his Twitter account.  But this is also the guy who deleted his Instagram account when they launched on Android years ago.  So, you know, like you've got to remember that some people have their own agendas for like using this moment to say, well, I am done with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I know that Tim Cook posted recently on Twitter.  Apple is, you know, Tim Cook sent Thanksgiving greetings on Thursday on Twitter.  I think some people are saying I'm going to stay on Twitter because I want to preserve it.  I want to make sure that there are other voices on Twitter.  One of the things Elon really seems to be taking it rightward.  And it would be it would be a shame if he turned it into another gab or truth social, a right wing network.  He seems to want to do that.  I'm not sure I understand why, but the motivation is.  But it's certainly not dying.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I will say anecdotally when I log out in the morning and this is I've never had Twitter on my phone for several years.  That to me is a bad idea.  I only use it on a desktop when I'm working during the day.  But when I log on in the morning, especially the past week or so, I'm definitely seeing fewer humans that I know on the timeline.  It is more just kind of like brands like Pepsi or.  Yeah.  Or CNN or a lot of broadcast.  I don't know.  A lot of broadcast.  Yeah.  Twitter now.  Yeah, that was very interesting to me.  I noticed that a couple of days ago.  What is happening?  Who knows?

Start time: 1426.00
End time: 1516.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think part of this preemptive death sentence is that people were worried when a bunch of engineers got laid off and a bunch of people quit that there wouldn't be the same.  That there wouldn't be the staff around to support the tool anymore and that little by little cracks would show things would break and the site would go down.  So and I saw a little bit a little bit of that personally.  There was a day when somebody who had protected tweets was retweeted by somebody and that retweet became visible to all no longer protected.  So so it's that kind that it's that level of subtle stuff that may break.  Right.  And little by little, if enough of it breaks, the site could theoretically go down.  I don't think it will just one day, you know, not be available on the on the URL anymore.  I think what we're going to see is these cracks showing.  And certainly a lot of that is going to come from content moderation.  You know, those divisions all got completely obliterated from from the various layoffs and quitting in protest.  So, you know, there's a lot that those of us who don't work at Twitter don't know it was going on behind the scenes.  We don't know the extent to which people were studying the kinds of language that was being used, what sort of harm was being done, how to prevent that harm.  And so that's again where we may start to see things very slowly devolve and break rather than the site disappearing altogether.

Transcript:  It was Phil Libbon's opinion last week.  I got by the way, I got a lot of email in both saying you should never have Phil on again.  He's obviously, you know, in Elon's corner.  And then people saying it was really great to hear a different take, a refreshing take.  He's and I and I like Phil and I trust him and I think he's very honest.  And I think he he said, you know, you shouldn't count it out.  It may well be what Elon is up to is getting.  And I think there's some evidence for this getting rid of all the people who didn't like him weren't 100 percent in, you know, believers in Twitter,  stripping it down the metal and then building it back up is a brutal way to do it.  But it could be said that that was what he was doing.  And maybe maybe, you know, it certainly didn't go offline on Friday.  I thought if it's going to go down, it'll go down during England, US and World Cup.  Sure didn't. It handled it fine.  Elon posted that, in fact, Twitter's doing better than ever and has signed up more.  It's more active than ever before.

Transcript:  Right. I mean, but Elon, look, Elon still has plenty of money, even with he says new user signups are at an all time high, which is, I think, interesting.  He posted a Twitter slide talk that he gave to the company showing, you know, we're recruiting new user signups at an all time high,  two million a day, new users, active minutes also at an all time high, although that doesn't say anything.  Some of that could just be people coming to watch the flames.  The endows passed a quarter million monthly daily.  I'm sorry. What is M Daily Active Users?  M monetize monetize.  In other words, not bots. Yeah.  Hate speech impressions are lower.  OK, certainly lower than they were when he took over.  Let's put it that way.  Reported impersonation spiked.  Yeah, we know why. And then fell.  Twitter 2.0. And this is his plan for Twitter going forward.  Advertising is entertainment.  I do remember one story that he was talking to some people and said, you know, we should do more native advertising on Twitter.  You should make ads look like tweets to which somebody responded.  That's what we're already doing.  I don't know what he means by advertising is entertainment.  Maybe this in this case, the picture he's showing is from HBO.  Are you a Targaryen, Valerian or Hightower?  Take this like this tweet and I'll analyze your profile.  This is straight out of the Facebook playbook and absolutely something I don't want to see on Twitter.  Video as part of Twitter.  Well, Twitter already has video.  He has been it's been rumored he wanted to bring back Vine, which Twitter bought and killed with mismanagement.  Encrypted DMS, which they were working on.  They were working on. He says he's doing he's working with Moxie Marlinspike, formerly CEO of Signal.  And there is some some people have seen code saying the word signal.  So maybe that's going to happen. Long form tweets.  So he fired the guy who who cheer cheerlead the 280 character tweet in Twitter.  He's gone. But maybe they're going to do something even longer.  Relaunch blue verified, at which point Jill and I and you guys will all lose your blue checks, I guess, which is fine with me.  Payments. It's interesting.  That's right. Has nothing.

But the problem is, Leo, that his playbook has not evolved in two decades and payments has moved on and e-commerce has changed enormously.  Twitter has never been a good spot for e-commerce.  They have tried payments. They've tried shopping inside a tweet.  And the problem is people are there for conversation. They're not there to buy things, generally.

Transcript:  You can actually watch the game. Yeah. Yeah.  And 4K. Fox is producing in 4K this year. It looks awesome.  It does, doesn't it? Yeah.  But I will say, I remember, man, I remember 2009 being on like a tech crunch, an early tech crunch podcast.  We were recording the podcast during the Champions League and I think Barcelona scored a goal and I was like, hooray, etc.  And I was saying, wow, Twitter is perfect for this.  I'm talking to you guys on the air and I'm tweeting as we're speaking.  And I'm seeing all the people saying, hooray, Messi scored. This is great.  So Twitter has always been like a very good sports thing.  So I definitely agree with Elon there.  That's one of the things I've used Twitter for since 2008 is like sports commentary, sports rumor, trade stuff, live, kind of like a live water cooler or whatever.  So it's actually awesome for that. And it is it is held up during the I was actually kind of semi expecting it to kind of buckle under the pressure of the World Cup.  The volume of tweets, maybe bringing the site down or bringing back the fail whale or whatever.  I haven't seen that. And I've been on the site and I've been watching every more or less every second of the World Cup and on my desk here.  So it's like it seems to be OK. I don't know that it's the best place for live coverage.  I think television is a little better, but I see his point.  It is it is it is a nice additive to the experience and it makes it you know, I used to you know, back back in the day, I used to watch a lot of WBF pro wrestling.  And I remember I was in an IRC chat room with some friends during the show on Monday nights.  And OK, maybe that was like 10 people. So this is the same thing now with millions of people.  And it's kind of fun to kind of join in like in Hooray, you know, Spain score, Germany scored and go back and forth.  So I don't entirely disagree with them there, I guess.

Some people in our chat room are saying, well, you could do the same in Mastodon.  I don't know. This is a world.  If I pin a column with World Cup as the hashtag, I guess I can I can follow.

It's so big our brains can't wrap around like having that many people in connecting to and maybe a smaller Discord with like 20 folks or whatever.  Maybe that's more manageable.  Dunbar number. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Something to that effect.  But my brother is on Discord frequently.  And I know I've seen smaller podcasters who, you know, who are in fact kind of migrating their communities away from Twitter and putting, you know, Discord access behind a Patreon paywall and saying, hey, guys, we're going to hang out here.  We're going to talk about the same stuff.  But this feels like a little bit more curated, a little more personal.  And we'll see how it goes.  But I do see Discord as being kind of like a place where the kids are, where they're already there.  Gee, what a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should do that.  Oh, we did.  Yeah, it's been, it was, that was an eye opener for us.  We started Club Twitter about a year ago.  Just like, just as you said, it was behind a paywall.  Seven bucks a month.  Mostly we thought the benefit will be ad free versions of the shows.  No ads, no track, right?  You just get to listen to the content.  And it turned out the Discord, which we threw in as a sweetener, turned out to be the best place.  It's a great social network.  There's about, I think there's three thousand, four thousand people in there now.  And it's just, Mitch's maybe a little too big, to be honest.  But what we did is we created a lot of sub channels.  So, you know, you can hang out in, you know, I hang out in the coding channel.  In fact, Advent of Code is coming up, so we're getting ready for that.  But there's, you know, beer and I wonder if there's a football.  You know, geeks are not big.  Yeah, there's a sport ball.  Geeks are not probably the biggest sport ball people.  But we got some sport ball.

Regardless of what's happening in the industry, the people who listen to your shows like this stuff.  Yeah, they want to hang out there.  So there's already a commonality there.  So maybe, OK, we all like Android.  We all like the iPhone or whatever.  But also maybe we'll talk about the Oscars because we're all friends anyway about this grander thing.  But I want to watch the Super Bowl.  That's a good point.

Transcript:  I think you're bringing up a really interesting point, though, about communities.  So I think, you know, these smaller places that are a little more protected, a little more private, maybe behind a paywall are good for cultivating small communities if people have similar interests.  When we start to think about news and culture and education, I think that's a point where we also need a place that isn't an insular community where we should be exposed to news that we aren't individually seeking out or articles and reading that are not just in, you know, the group of people that we follow are going to tweet about them or push them out or whatever.  I've been doing some mentoring this year with some younger writers who are just starting out in their careers.  And something that I never really put words to before, but I've realized in talking to them, is the value of a very broad general magazine.  So when you get a magazine, content is coming to you that you have no idea what it is, whether it's weekly, monthly, whatever.  But it's this opportunity to explore ideas that you wouldn't necessarily go and seek out yourself or that people in your small insular community aren't going to share with you.  So I think they're and they shouldn't necessarily be thought of as the same thing, right?  These insular, small communities and this idea of expanding yourself, reaching out, getting new ideas, new information, exposing yourself to that.  And I think a lot of what has gone wrong on places like Facebook and Twitter and even to some extent, YouTube, is that those two things started to at times kind of intertwine in really ugly ways where people were sharing articles and, you know, information that wasn't factual.  And people were fighting about it or people had different ideas and opinions about what the facts were.  Right. And so I think it's just so interesting to think about the ways that social media could feed those two different parts of our needs and our desires for both community and information beyond our own walls.

Transcript:  Mastodon, which, you know, we've been doing a mastodon server for three years. My lower third has had my mastodon handle forever.  Is nice because it's international. So it's much more aggressively international. And so that's kind of, and I shouldn't really call it mastodon, I should call it the Fetiverse because it's not just mastodon.  There are lots of other ways people can talk to one another across barriers using activity streams. Mastodon is just one way to do it.  And I think that that is one of the things that mastodon can bring to the table. Not to flog mastodon because honestly, I think it's maybe groaning under the weight of all these new Twitter people.  But I just think that there are, I guess my point really is that there are other ways. Discourse, discord, mastodon. There are lots of other ways that we can communicate.  And maybe this is just an opportunity for us to find it. It's sad that Instagram has chosen, Facebook has chosen at this time to turn Instagram into TikTok and really destroy its personal, it's so much more algorithmic now than it used to be.

It's still a young technology and it's still getting molded by its users.  And every generation that comes along uses it differently. That's why TikTok took off.  That's that's a that's you know, that's a different generation than the Facebook generation.  All right. We're going to take a little break. Come back and talk about something, anything other than Elon Musk.  If you'll let us. It's great to have Jill Duffy here.  PC mag, the book, everything, the everything, everything, the everything.

Transcript:  One of the things I say very on in the early on in the book is that remote work is not one thing.  There are so many different ways that we experience remote work.  So sometimes it's an entire team being remote.  Sometimes it's one person being remote in a different time zone.  Sometimes it's a hybrid situation of people coming in one or two days a week.  There's no one right way to do it.  But there are lots of tools and guidance and best practices that make all of remote work better.

Start time: 2591.00
End time: 2722.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, there's lots of mixed studies.  You know, like I said, remote work is not one thing.  It depends not just on the configuration of who's remote and how and when, but also the actual work that you're doing.  So a number of years ago, before the pandemic, and I'm going to bookmark that and come back to that idea in a second, that remote work under the pandemic.  So before the pandemic, there was this great study done.  I believe it was in China with essentially like travel agents and about half of the team was randomly selected to work at home.  And if they didn't want to, they could opt out of it.  But they sent 50% of the people home and they worked for about seven months and collected data on the number of calls that they answered, the number of, you know, travel reservations that they made, et cetera.  So people who work from home, they weren't burned out from a commute.  So they started work on time.  They weren't worried about rushing to get home for kids or other obligations, elder care.  So they worked until the end of the day.  They were at their leisure to take breaks when they needed, which helped them be more productive throughout the day.  And so the productivity of the team that was working remotely was much, much higher.  And I want to come back to this idea about remote work during the pandemic because the most important thing that happened then that people often neglect to mention is that people weren't opting in.  People were being sent home and told, you must work remotely.  It's not your choice.  It's not my choice as the employer either.  Everybody's got to go home.  So that created a situation where people weren't choosing to do it and organizations weren't set up to support them.  So when we look at what happened during the pandemic, we had really mixed results.  Some people hated it.  Some people were less productive.  Some people were more productive.  But it depended a lot on whether you wanted to be there, what the other conditions were in your home at that time.  If you had kids at home, if you had other people in your house that wouldn't normally be there and whether your organization was ready to support you and give you the tools that you need and really the corporate environment to support people being remote  and sort of trusting them to do their jobs effectively.

There's some people have to.  Engineers have to.  But a lot of our hosts still do shows from home.  And it's worked out fine.  I think there's some fear among manage management, not here, but in other companies that, oh my God, these people aren't going to be.  Elon feels like he really thinks you're not going to be working if you're at home.  I want to be.  I want you to send me a snapshot of your codes commits every week to make sure you're working.  Even said managers, make sure that everybody we're paying is a real person, that there's no fake people on your payroll.  I think he's kind of got a little screw loose around that people aren't working thing is most was most a protocol in office.  Owen, or was it some of it work at home?

Transcript:  When we, I started doing the radio show 19 years ago in 2004, I did it from my house.  And what I found was I, you know, I'd go in my slippers, right?  And I just didn't have the energy.  It was like, yeah, it's time to do a radio show.  Like it didn't feel like work.  So I actually rented a place down, down in this downtown that I would go to a little like Garrett.  But just the fact of having somewhere that I would get up, get dressed and go to.  So I guess, I guess I'm the person that needs an office.  I think Lisa's that way too.  My wife and our CEO, she likes to come in and she likes to have the people she's working with there so she can, you know, communicate with them in real time instead of over Slack.  It's funny.  Everybody has a little different.

And so they needed that.  Me, I was, you know, I was like, I'm fine either way, frankly.  But I definitely know folks who are in the same boat, Leo, who were like, I need to be in an office.  I need to see humans.  Otherwise, I can't, I can't do this thing that you're asking me to do.

Transcript:  Can you, I mean, well, just for me, the idea of staying at home all the time seems like horrible.  That's that was the bad thing about the pandemic is being locked inside all the time.  Hey, I want to take a break.  Come back with more with a great panel.  So fun to have all three of you.  Our show today brought to you by Collide.  This is actually timely because a lot of people are working in hybrid situations.  A lot of IT departments are going crazy with endpoint security these days.  And, you know, it kind of brought home a truth about endpoint security.  When you, when everybody was in the office, you know, you could do things like, you know, crazy glue the USB port.  And, and, you know, really lock everything down.  But as soon as people went home, if they didn't like, you know, the user agents you were putting on their machine,  if they didn't like how locked down their system was, if they were worried about, you know, the company spying on them, what do they do?  They've got their home computer.  They've got their own phone.  And it pretty soon became clear that the old way of doing endpoint security wasn't going to work.  That's why Collide has come along to tap the most powerful untapped resource in IT, end users.  When you're trying to achieve security goals, whether you've got a third party audit coming up or your own compliance standards,  the normal wisdom, the conventional wisdom, treat every device like Fort Knox.  But the problem is old school device management tools like MDM's force disruptive agents onto employees devices.  They slow performance.  They keep privacy as an afterthought.  Employees know this.  That way of doing things turns IT admins and end users into enemies, opponents.  And then what's next?  It creates its own problems because users turn to shadow IT to do their jobs.  They start using their own stuff.  And that's worse, right?  That's far worse.  Collide does things differently.  Instead of forcing changes on users, Collide sends them security recommendations via Slack.  So it works everywhere, whether your employees at home, at work, whether using Mac, Windows, Linux, it's completely cross platform.  Collide automatically notifies any team member when the devices are insecure.  You know, if there's something wrong, gives them step by step instructions on how to solve the problem.  It all begins with that first DM from Collide saying, here, let's install the Collide agent on your system.  When you're reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM, educating about company policies and enlisting them as your partners in security,  you're building a culture in which everyone contributes because everyone understands what's going on, why you're doing it.  You'll love it as an IT admin because Collide provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet running Mac, Windows or Linux.  You can see it at glance.  Which employees have their disks encrypted or are up to date on their OS patches or are using a password manager,  which makes it all easy to prove compliance to your auditors, your customers, your leadership.  And it makes it easy to fix anything that comes along because Collide helps them do it.  So they're your partners now.  Collide user centered, cross platform, endpoint security for teams that Slack.

Protests, significant protests due to a number of causes, COVID lockdowns, zero COVID policy.  I don't know.  I imagine the Xi regime has the will and the ability to crush the dissent, I'm sad to say.  It seems like it's a kind of childish to say this, but it's also going to affect iPhones.  Among other things, 30% production loss because of mass quitting at Foxcon.  Foxcon, this is just part of the overall unrest.  I'm very curious to see how this is going to impact China.  But among other things, at least in the tech sphere, Foxcon was losing workers.  They promised a $1,400 bonus for workers coming to Foxcon and then neglected to pay it.  Due to the failure to pay and growing fears about COVID-19, it is said that more than 20,000 new hires have left.  And according to 905 Mac, an internal estimate reportedly says that more than 30% of production for iPhone 14 could be lost.  It's already behind due to COVID.  All of this is happening at iPhone City in Zhengzhou, China, the big Foxcon plant.  Just one of many ways unrest in China is going to be disruptive globally.

Transcript:  It's interesting.  The quiet quitting that you hear about in the States, and I know there's controversy of that term,  but it really had its roots in the lie flat movement in China.  And lie flat is basically what it sounds like.  You just stop working, you just lie flat on the floor.  And that really came from this kind of crazy culture of overwork in China's tech sector,  where people were expected to work 12 hours a day, six days a week.  Elon Musk would have loved it.  But tech workers revolted against those conditions.  And I think you're seeing that kind of now move down to factory workers who have historically not been kind of apt to engage in these kinds of mass protests.  This is a big story, just a global news story.

Transcript:  Here last night, Sunday night in Beijing, demonstrators holding a blank white pieces of paper.  This is from the BBC.  The pieces of paper are symbolic of censorship.  Censorship.  People are saying, President Xi should step down.  I mean, since Tiananmen Square, this has not happened in China.  This is somewhat shocking.  So of course, you know, look at this.  It's kind of amazing to think of it in a country where you really assume rigid control of the populace that people would take their chances.  But you see this in Iran, too.  You know, you see people, there's a point at which people say enough.  So we'll watch that.  It's more than just iPhone 14 production, but still, that's one impact that we're going to feel in the US, I guess, probably in manufacture in many ways.

Transcript:  You know, I studied China in college and the throughout history, the Chinese government is always thought of as having the mandate of heaven.  You know, a legitimacy that's kind of handed down.  And even the modern Chinese Communist Party in some ways is legitimate because it's legitimate.  You know, that tautological mandate of heaven, I think, applies even in the modern day.  And so that's why it is so interesting to watch.  And it's possible that this could really spiral because once you lose it, it's gone.  You know, and so much of the Chinese regime really relies on kind of compliance.  And, you know, you can lose it quickly.

Transcript:  And as much as these stories are kind of taking the news now and last month a little bit with this relationship with Apple and how is it going to hurt, you know, international business, the lockdowns have been really strict and severe, particularly in a few of the major cities going  back to like July and August, where I follow a lot of news out of China.  And there were reporters who were just giving their day to day accounts of being locked in an apartment building in Beijing.  Yeah, remember that?  And having to kind of like trade with your neighbors to get the right foods that you need because you couldn't get access to food.  So if you think about like the stress people have been under for the last four months of going through this, you know, in a strict and severe way, not just the standard everyday protocols with COVID lockdown, but the more strict COVID lockdown measures that have been going on as cases have been rising.  Yeah, people are at a real breaking point.

Transcript:  Does Apple get any heat for shutting off airdrop right before these protests broke out?  We don't know if the Chinese government said Apple, I told Apple to do this, but they did it kind of unilaterally.  You know, they seem to cover it up by saying, well, we're going to do this globally as well eventually.  It sure feels like this was Apple once again, acting at the behest of the Chinese government.  That's kind of hurt their reputation if people start to think that, right?  What do you think, Nicholas?

Transcript:  Oh, this is so outside of my wheelhouse.  That's why I'm asking you.  I want to push you, man.  Well, I wonder how many average consumers really think about what Apple's policies in China are, at least consumers in the United States.  I would wager they probably are out of sight, out of mind type of thing.  So I don't know.  All of us as journalists are aware of this.  It doesn't look right.  But also, you know, I didn't like when the tech companies kind of bent to the will of the NSA during all that stuff, during the Stodin stuff either.  And, you know, I still use I still use those products.  So I don't really know.

Start time: 3668.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm being a troublemaker, but I really think that the public should know about this and that Apple should be held responsible for this.  They they tout, you know, that they are, you know, this privacy loving, freedom, freedom loving country company.  And Tim Cook, you know, says that.  But they have very close relationships with China.  So November 9th, Apple released an updated version of iOS 16 16.1.1.  You might have seen it globally.  All they said was this update includes bug fixes and security updates as recommended for all users.  But and this is from Quartz.  Hidden in the update was a change that only applies to Apple iPhones sold in mainland China.  AirDrop can only be set to receive messages globally from everyone for 10 minutes and then turns itself off.  There's no longer a way to keep the everyone setting on permanently in the Chinese phones.  And you're right, Nicholas, probably nobody understands that that's a big deal in China until you know that AirDrop has been used as a communication tool in Hong Kong for protesters.  It's been used to communicate with other protesters, to reach passersby, to spread messages to tourists from mainland China visiting Hong Kong.  We had stories some months ago when mainland Chinese people arrived in Hong Kong, they would just miraculously get on their phone a pamphlet explaining what's going on.  News that these people in mainland China never heard because it was censored on the mainland.  In mainland, according to Quartz, protesters have also AirDrop protest literature, particularly on college campuses, which is, by the way, where some of these protests are breaking out now.  China's control of the Internet is so strong that dissidents have to use any tool they can to get around the Great Firewall.  Now, Apple, when asked about this, according to Bloomberg, didn't respond to questions.  They said, we're going to make this feature global next year.  But, you know, they did it without announcement in China just three weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I seem to remember AirDrop also being like a vector for abuse.  If you just have accept everything from everyone, you could be on the subway and people are just sending you photos you don't necessarily want to see.  So I always turn that off. Personally, I always recommended to friends like you should just turn that off.  I don't really see the point in having everyone having the ability to just send you stuff.  Obviously, the context in China is different.

Start time: 3825.04
End time: 3844.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, yeah, no.  In fact, I agree with you. I would recommend turn it off.  You don't want everyone. But if you're a protester in China, sure, there's a value to it.  So Apple gets a little cover because they can say, well, this is the right way.  This is the way we should do it anyway. Everybody's going to do this globally soon.  So they get a little cover that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to make it explicit, I feel like what the Quartz article is kind of suggesting and Leo, what you're sort of suggesting is to the Chinese government ask Apple to make this fix explicitly.  And did Apple comply and do it quietly without explaining in its notes?  Right. And we don't know.  But that is certainly a conclusion that one might speculate.

Transcript:  I mean, it's all kind of pointing at the fact that the relationship of a major world power and a government that is pretty oppressive has has a strong relationship with the world's richest company.  And perhaps the most important company, at least in the Western world.  And that relationship is a little bit worrisome.  Like the phrase too big to fail kind of comes back to mind.  Right. If either one of these parties, you know, reneges on this contract that they essentially have with one another for Apple to get its inexpensive labor to make parts for its products.  Right. And and keep feeding the purchaser, the people purchasing these products to keep growing the company like that relationship is is kind of worrisome.  Like it's so big and so important to both parties and really internationally that you almost you almost need to make sure that it doesn't fall apart.  And that if it is dismantled, it is dismantled very slowly and with care.  And I want to say about a month ago, there was a lot of pressure on Apple to find new partners to start making some of its phone products or pieces of the phone product from other countries so that it wouldn't be relying explicitly on China because there were already so many factory shutdowns.

Transcript:  Apple makes phones, iPhones in India.  They've already started that Brazil.  I think they want to make them in Vietnam.  But that's for a number of reasons, partly because they want to diversify.  But also Brazil and India both have very high tariffs against products not made in country.  So it's also just an economy.  You can't sell an iPhone in Brazil or India at a reasonable price unless you make it there.

Start time: 4007.16
End time: 4078.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good point. Yeah.  This is a year ago.  The New York Times did an investigative report, censorship, surveillance and profits, a hard bargain for Apple in China.  Apple built the world's most valuable business on top of China.  Now it has to answer to the Chinese government.  And we're seeing that.  We're seeing it.  We saw it a year ago and then we're seeing it again.  Tim Cook went to China.  He met with Xi and others.  He probably made commitments in order.  And that's the business of Apple.  They've got to make these iPhones.  They've make them in China.  It's the cheapest, best place they can make it.  They've actually built up the Chinese industrial economy considerably by building so many iPhones there.  So Nicholas, you're right.  I think most people aren't aware of it.  I want to bring it up because does Apple have a responsibility?  And what is its responsibility?  I mean, they have a responsibility.  They're shareholders to make the most money possible.  If you want it, the Chinese business is huge for them and growing.  If you want to do that business, make that money in China, you're going to have to follow the laws of China.

Start time: 4078.02
End time: 4127.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I yeah, that sounds almost too literal.  But like if you if you want to do business with China, you can like I don't I don't really fault companies for, you know, doing find a law.  Find the law of their local, you know, whatever country.  So I don't know. I I I struggle with this because it's like if China wants to be if Apple wants to be in China, China has rules.  If Apple doesn't want to be in China, they're free to leave.  But it certainly feels like there's no middle ground is there?  Yeah. So I don't you know, what do I want Tim Cook to do?  I don't know. I'm just a I'm just a guy in the Hudson Valley.  What do I know?  That's like what it's like. I'm just in a cubicle in Yonkers here, folks.  But no, I hear you. And it's interesting.  It's like we want companies to do better.  We want we would like companies to stand up for like human rights.  Google walked away from China.

Transcript:  But Google didn't depend on China in the way Apple does.  Right.  A Times analysis is from that article May of last year.  A Times analysis found that tens of thousands of apps have disappeared from Apple's Chinese app store over the past several years.  More than previously known, including foreign news outlets, Quartz, by the way, was one of them.  Gay dating services, encrypted messaging apps.  It also blocked tools for organizing pro-democracy protests and skirting Internet restrictions, as well as apps about the Dalai Lama.  So I don't know, Owen, what do you think?  What is Apple's responsibility here?

Start time: 4167.14
End time: 4194.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, Apple obviously wants to operate in China.  And it's really hard for the iPhone business model to work unless you, you know, unless you have that tight link of the app store, the apps and, you know, and the hardware.  And, you know, to do that, they have to go along with with local governments.  I mean, we do expect tech companies to obey local laws.  You know, that's that's a reality.

Yeah.  But it doesn't seem like the, you know, the kind of brewing Cold War has has gotten to that point.  The Biden administration has taken a really surgical approach to this.  And I credit my my soon to be ex colleague, Max Cherniot protocol for doing really in depth reporting on this.  They've been going after very specific chip manufacturing technology, especially technology that helps China build like the most sophisticated chips for artificial intelligence and encryption of our encryption.

Transcript:  There is an issue in specifically with a company called YMTC, which is a small Chinese chip maker.  The government, the Chinese government funded and Apple uses, but not in its American iPhones, only in its Chinese iPhones.  There is a pressure on Gino Raimondo, the Commerce Secretary, to add YMTC to the entity list, that surgical list of Chinese chip manufacturers that are not allowed to buy American technology or components.  But Apple is saying, you better don't do Apple say we don't worry.  We only use YMTC chips and iPhones sold in China.  But if if it's put on the entities list, then Apple would have a problem.  They actually couldn't use those chips anymore.  So somehow they lobbied.  I don't know.  The Commerce Department put export restrictions on YMTC, but they did not put them on the entity list.  This is the balancing act.  And I actually have a lot of respect for Tim Cook, because that's a he's doing diplomacy.  Like real hardcore diplomacy, balancing the US government's interests, Chinese interests, and still trying to sell iPhones to both.  Marco Rubio said, if Tim Cook understands the risks that YMTC and the rest of the Chinese Communist Party's chip making efforts pose to US national security and that of our allies, then he and his company should clearly commit to not proceed.  But they haven't yet.  It's an interesting situation.  This is increasingly the problem with big tech, isn't it?  That they're global and they have to operate in a global environment.  Elon's going to face this in spades.  He's fired most of the EU, the people in charge of responding to EU privacy issues and laws.  I don't know what's going to happen at Twitter there.  It's tough.  I think it's important for people before we buy iPhones to understand the deal with the devil that Apple has done and to be okay with that or not okay with that and respond.  But consumers don't do that, do they, Nicholas?  They don't care.  In my experience, I feel like a lot of consumers have bigger problems in their lives.

Transcript:  One of the few tools that we as consumers have to influence all this stuff is our dollar.  Right?  Yeah.  Anyway, so now you know the rest of the story.  All right.  I'm going to take a little break, talk about other tech stories in just a bit.  But first, I want to talk about what a good night's sleep I got.  You don't care.  You should care because you deserve a good night's sleep.  And our sponsor, 8 Sleep, is going to get it for you this holiday season.  Give the never-ending gift of deeper sleep.  Consistent good sleep is a life changer.  Nature's gentle nurse, Nicholas, is going to give you a good night's sleep.  Gentle nurse, we call it.  It can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues, decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.  But most Americans suffer with poor sleep.  And the number one problem with sleep, I think, for a lot of us is getting hot in the middle of the night.  It's the worst.  And you know, you'd think, well, that's only a problem in the summer.  And it is.  But it's also a problem in the winter because it's so cold you leave the heat on.  And then you wake up in the middle of the night, you're sweltering.  Well, I'll tell you something.  I don't leave the heat on anymore because I've got the 8 Sleep pod cover.  We got it more than a year ago now.  And I can't, I mean, honestly, when I travel and I stay in a hotel that doesn't have an 8 Sleep, I'm going, I don't know if I can take this.  I don't know.  The 8 Sleep, let me explain what the 8 Sleep is.  They make mattresses, but we have the 8 Sleep pod.  It's a tech layer that goes over your mattress.  It's like a fitted sheet, a mattress cover.  But oh, it does so much more.  The pod dynamically cools or heats each side of the bed.  So you can each have different settings to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs.  And it changes over the night.  So it can go as cool as 55 degrees.  That's basically air conditioning for your bed.  Oh, man, when it was hot over the summer, I just loved that.  Or as hot as 110 degrees.  Sometimes I need that heat for my sore muscles.  I get in bed.  But here's the best thing.  It adjusts.  It adjusts according to how you're sleeping, how you're moving, the temperature of the room.  It has an automated system to give you the perfect temperature.  See, it turns out that, you know, you might want to get in bed and it's nice and cozy and warm, but you, ideally, as you go deeper and deeper in your sleep cycle, you want to get cooler.  And that will put you in a deeper sleep.  And it really works.  Clinical data shows that eight sleep users experience up to 34 percent more deep sleep.  I know I do.  It makes a huge difference.  Now, the nice thing is each of you gets your own settings.  So Lisa has completely different settings.  She likes it really hot.  She turned it up to 10 all the way up last night.  And I'm just thinking, God, I don't know how you could take it.  I'm more of a five, four or five guy.  But then it goes down to two.  In the summertime, it was actually minus one, cooling me off.  So great.  It just feels so good.  With that great deep sleep, your mind and body just feel like they're there for you.  It's vital for physical recovery, hormone regulation, mental clarity.  It is the single best thing you can do for your sleep, if you ask me.  And by the way, I save money on my heating because I don't use my heating during the night.  I don't have to heat the house.  It keeps me warm.  And it's a lot less expensive and a lot lighter on the budget to warm just the bed than it is to warm the whole house.  It's not a holiday miracle.  I know it might sound like one, but if better sleep is on your wish list, you know what?  You can give yourself a gift this holiday season.  Look no farther than the new Pod 3.  Cover more sensors to do an even better job.  And right now, what a great deal.  For a limited time, 8 Sleep is offering Twit listeners up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday Bundle.  Exclusive holiday savings.  That includes the pod cover that we have and we use and we love.  In fact, we're upgrading now to the Pod 3.  We have the Pod 2.

Your contribution makes a big difference.  It keeps the lights on.  Please, twit.tv slash club twit.  I know if you can't afford it, that's fine.  We had somebody send us an email saying, I'm on a fixed income.  I only have $1,000 a month.  I said, please don't join club twit.  I sent him a complimentary subscription.  He says, no, no, you don't have to do that.  I'm going to do it anyway.  I said, all right.  If you can't afford it, I understand.  But if you can, it really makes a difference.  Hey, some good news in the robocall world.  The FCC is finally getting some teeth.  Nicholas, you must get people talking to you all the time about how do I get  rid of the robocalls and the spam texts and all that stuff?  Yeah, I get that all the time.  I personally get those calls all the time.

I don't really know what to tell them.  So I'm I'm I'm glad that hopefully there are some steps being taken to eliminate  because it's gotten to the point where it's like I know like millennials, people  don't pick up their phones anymore because they expect it to be about like  their phony car warranty or some other scam.  And so it's like, well, the phones, if I can't call someone because they're  afraid to pick up the phone, because then phones become what's the point of  having a phone anymore?  Yeah.  So this is a very American problem.  We just let scams get out of control so much that phones don't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's frustrating because the FCC can regulate this.  They have they you know, there's this protocol called Stir and Shaken,  which is basically an authentication protocol that lets your phone company,  whoever your cell phone company is, authenticate that the call is coming  from an actual subscriber to that actual company.  That's their real number, not a spoof number.  And the FCC's been really dragging their feet in forcing this.  So that's why this is good news.  The commission required that any US based carrier with IP networks,  which is all of them, by the way, use Stir and Shaken.  And they had to implement it by June 2021.  But at the same time, because the FCC is the best commission money can buy,  they created something called the RoboCall Mitigation Database,  which actually should be called.  It's okay to spam people database because if you're in the RoboCall Mitigation Database,  then T-Mobile and AT&T and Verizon and US Cellular and all the cell phone companies can say,  yeah, yeah, go ahead, do those RoboCalls.  So this database, which is basically a get out of jail free card,  finally, the FCC is finally, they've took years to do this,  going to start blocking companies.  They told providers that if as of September of last year,  if the company is not in this database, block them.  You have to legally, you have to block them.  But they didn't take anybody out of the database.  In October last month, they said we are, they warned global,  a company called Global UC and six other companies,  we're going to take you out of the database.  We're going to, you're going to lose your get out of jail free card  if you don't comply with the anti-RoboCall technologies.  For the first time in living memory, the FCC has actually done something.  They have blocked Global UC.  Now, I don't know how many RoboCalls come from this one company,  but they're no longer in the database.  It's unknown according to Engadget whether anybody else will be blocked,  whether there's any other penalty.  The FCC says we're still reviewing responses from the firms that we've warned.  Nor do we know yet if this is going to reduce the volume of RoboCalls.  Just anecdotally, it doesn't seem to have done much.  You're still getting them.  I just feel like the FCC needs to kind of step up  and do what they said they were going to do.  June of next year is the drop dead date for any call,  any company outside the US that doesn't have, that has facilities, that has buildings.  Maybe June of next year RoboCalls will be a thing of the past.  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  At least they're making an attempt.  Let's see, what else here?  New York State has banned for two years proof of work mining.  The newly elected governor has signed the law.  Because crypto mining using proof of work is incredibly energy intensive,  they have made that illegal, which just means they'll move over to New Jersey.  But everything's legal in Jersey, as they said in Hamilton.  Anything to say about that?  Are we happy? Are we celebrating?  It's only a two year moratorium, which is kind of weird.

Transcript:  I mean the funny thing is these miners were very reluctant to sell Bitcoin when it was peak  because they were hodling, right? They were holding on for dear life.  They kept betting that the price would go up.  And so they would borrow money to buy Bitcoin mining equipment.  They'd borrow fiat.  And so they've been just kind of triply hit by rising interest rates,  the dropping price of Bitcoin and...

Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. All along, all along.  People who know history sort of were really alert to the fact  that this whole money scheme was not going to go anywhere.  And I think in the international scene, what we've seen happen in El Salvador  with the Bukele regime and people being literally murdered in the streets  after the value of crypto dropped, presumably because the government  was paying off the gangs and then the value of the payment that the gangs  received dropped incredibly suddenly.  So they had to make a big statement and somewhere above 50 people were  murdered one night in the street, just shot in the street.

Transcript:  Yeah, the very young leader of El Salvador, Bukele.  So, you know, these are the small struggling countries that we don't hear  enough about what's going on in their economies.  Those are the people who get really hurt.  You know, we can talk about the people in the United States who put their money  into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, lost it, no longer have any value to cash  out, no longer have any equity.  But the real people who are being hurt are like actual physical human bodies,  human beings in other countries. So sad.  It's really messed up because, you know, we have to remember like money needs to  be stable. That's part of what money does when it has value to a society,  is it needs to be stable. And when it's not, really bad things happen.  And we can look at all kinds of examples throughout the world where, you know,  a physical currency was not stabilized.

Transcript:  The sad thing, and just to pick up on some points Jill is making very,  very eloquently, is that there is actually potential for crypto to serve a purpose  in, say, international reminiscences. I'd say for a lot of purposes like day-to-day  payments, buying a pizza, buying a coffee, crypto is not particularly useful in any,  you know, developed economy. But reminiscences are still really expensive.  They take a big chunk out of, you know, out of the budgets of some of the least  well-off households in the U.S. and around the world. And, you know, this erosion of  trust is absolutely correct. You know, you should not trust people who have behaved  this way. But it would be kind of sad if that potential to pull out costs from a  really costly system were to be lost in all of this.

Transcript:  I, you know, I think I don't know if Bukele was a con man from day one. I understand  why, you know, he wanted to, you know, withdraw from the world banking system that he  felt like was, you know, conspiring against El Salvador. He moved the El Salvador  currency from the U.S. dollar to Bitcoin about a year ago. Unfortunately, he did it  right before Bitcoin crashed. So a lot of people in El Salvador lost a lot of money.  It's dropped 61% since September. And Bukele spent hundreds of millions of dollars on  Bitcoin and still says to this day he's going to buy a Bitcoin every day. They put in  Bitcoin ATMs in every town plaza. They told businesses, you must accept Bitcoin as  payment. He bought $100 million worth of Bitcoin at its absolute peak, which means  it's only worth about $30 million now. This is probably, but do you think it was, you  know, I think maybe he just was as much a victim as anybody.

But, you know, like El Salvador did, you know, did have kind of a legitimate sovereign  interest in de-dollarization. They had their own currency. It, you know, it fell apart  as many, you know, many of these small country currencies do. And they went on the dollar,  which has a lot of downsides, but it had at least...  It was stable.  Yeah, it offers some stability, which, you know, in the face of like, you know, runaway  hyperinflation has some appeal. But, you know, for me, El Salvador embracing Bitcoin was  as much about de-dollarization as it was about Bitcoin. It was just, you know, they didn't  have their own currency to use and Bitcoin was kind of fun and trendy.

Miami club owners told the Financial Times, business is slumping as the crypto industry  takes a blow. It's hurting even Miami clubs. I guess that's where a lot of the Bitcoin  bros went to celebrate. Many clubs, this is from Business Insider and the Financial Times,  many clubs had grown used to serving a new demographic, 95% men, young with a kind of  nerdy style. They were all crypto bros. Out of the blue, all these kids from crypto started  coming down and spending a lot of money, like an insane amount of money, said Andrea Vermeccati,  director of food and beverage at Moxie Hotel Group.

Early on, people said, do you really want to promote audio books? People will listen to them and not  listen to your shows. I said, yes. I said, if that's what you want to do, you do it because audible is the best way to enjoy audio  entertainment all in one app. I've been an audible member since the year 2000 when I had a long commute from here to San Francisco every day,  sometimes as much as two or three hours a day in the car, sometimes even longer. And I was going nuts and I found audible and it saved my  life. I had the diamond Rio. I used to, I used to listen on a little, and audible had its own little thing at first. And then I listened to the  diamond Rio. Of course, now it's easy. You kids today, you don't know you get an audible app on your iPhone or your Android and you've got a whole  world of audio entertainment waiting for you. You don't, you don't ride in an elevator to listen to the music, right? You don't choose an airline  because it's got the best movies. So when it comes to audio entertainment, it makes sense to choose audible because they've got the best, the home for stories told by  the biggest stars, Ethan Hawke, Kerry Washington, Kevin Hart. Lisa and I have been listening, we've listened to all of Kevin Hart's audio books. Audible is  home to epic adventures, chilling mysteries, can't miss comedies. When the peripheral came to Amazon Prime, I said, wait a minute. Yeah, it was in my  library. And that's what I love about audible is I can listen to audio books before they become major motion pictures or big T big time TV shows and, and see the pictures in my mind.  That's kind of what the best thing is about audible. Go to a U D I B L E dot com slash twit or you can text twit to 500 500. Just now I have any of you ever listened to Ian Banks's  sci fi. I have not his culture series, I found out is a major influence on one Elon Musk. So I thought, oh, oh, I've got to listen to this. In fact, those crazy names he gives the drone ships where they land the  the rockets, those all come from Ian Banks novels. So I am now embarked upon a long, we'll see, we'll see how long it is how good it is. Long journey with Ian. They think they're still recording them because they're not all there yet. That's one of the things audible does.  That's fantastic. audibles frontiers program is recording classic sci fi that never got turned into audio books. So you can listen back to some great stuff. Oh, new Stephen King. Got to put that on the list, right? Whenever there's a new Stephen King. Paul Thurotte and I were talking about  11 2263 about one man's attempt to go back in time and stop the Kennedy assassination, Paul just relistens to it. Another thing audible does that's great is they do. What do they call it full cast. So if you're a Neil Gaiman fan, for instance, audible is heaven for Neil Gaiman fans, but they also have done an incredible dramatization of the sandman. And a full cast.  With some of the best actors in the business, including Neil himself, the sandman is amazing. And you're just going to love it. If you go to audible.com slash twit, you can pick your first audio book. And that might be a good one. But one of the nice things that they do is they let you sample before you buy. So I recommend you do that. They have an incredible selection of audio books in every genre, best sellers, new releases, mysteries, thrillers, motivation, wellness, business.  As an honorable member, you could choose one title a month to keep that includes all the latest best sellers and new releases. But this is something relatively new. And I really like this. You also get full access to a growing selection of audio books that are included in your membership. You get podcasts. You can download or stream their included titles all you want.  Steve Gibson told me about the Silver Ships series. Great audio books. I listened to the first one and then I noticed most of the rest are part of my account. I get them just for free listening anytime I want. That's, that's awesome. Audible no matter where you are, washing dishes, walking the dog, driving to and from work. Whatever you're doing, you can let your imagination run wild. You I swear if you can watch the program, you can watch the show.  You can listen to the audio book and it comes to life in your head and you can listen about the lives of celebrities journey to your best self. Check out the spider web of true crimes. I love mysteries on audible. Discover new worlds, old worlds and how to make a better world. It's all on audible.  Let audible help you discover new ways to laugh, be inspired or be entertained. I hope I've sold you on it. If you're not a member, I'm most of you probably are by now, but if you're not a member, you could try it free for 30 days by going to audible.com slash twit or text twit to 500 500. That's a good thing to do on your phone because they'll just send you a link to the app. You can download it right away audible.com slash twit or text twit to 500 500 and you get it free for 30 days. That's a lot of listening audible.com.  I'm highly highly recommended. Speaking of Amazon, it just came out that who would have thought it? The Amazon Echo is a colossal failure. On pace, according to ours, Technica to lose 10 billion dollars this year. In their layoffs, Amazon laid off as much as half of the Amazon Echo.  I'm going to call it Echo team, but you know it's the A word A-L-E-X-A team. This is a report from Business Insider which says even though Echo has been around for 10 years and has been kind of the trailblazer as a voice assistant, copied by Apple, copied by Google and Samsung, it never created an ongoing revenue stream.  Business Insider says the division lost 3 billion dollars in just the first quarter of this year with the majority of the losses blamed on Echo. That's the worldwide digital group, so it includes Amazon Prime. But Echo has really been the money loser. Double the losses of any division. The hardware team on pace to lose 10 billion.  How do you lose money on Echo? Well, one, the devices are sold basically at cost. Echo is among the best selling Amazon items, but most of the devices are sold at cost. The internal document seen by Business Insider described the business model by saying,  quote, we want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices. But the problem is, well, you tell me how do you use your Amazon Echo if you have one? Set a timer, play some music. That's it, right?

Because why would you want a device that is listening to you at all times in your home? I mean, there's two fundamental things. One is listening to you all the times.

Transcript:  I mean, you have to trust that the microphone is not active at all times, right? Like I don't have my device set to automatically hear me if I say a trigger word or lift it up. I have that all turned off. But the other fundamental problem with the Amazon devices is what have they done differently in 10 years?  Right.  You know, when they first came out, I think they did not meet consumers' expectations of what they could do. People thought they could talk to them naturally and have information come back to them. That is sorely not the case. Anybody who actually has one of these devices knows you get trained over time to know what you can and cannot say to it, how to phrase it, in what order, etc. etc. And that has really fundamentally not changed in the 10 years since it's been around.  So I think if you were to give this device to a new person who had never used it before and said, you just get to talk to it and it will give you answers, do things for you, they would immediately do five things that just don't work at all. It's not an impressive device. It's just not.

I even in my kitchen have Sonos, which listens to me.  And frequently when we're watching TV, these devices wake up and go, what? No? Okay. And go back to sleep. It's like your house is inhabited by nice little creatures that really aren't very helpful, but they're there.  Do you have one of these, Owen?

Transcript:  You know, I have an Echo Flex, which I think is the smallest one, which I think I literally got for free. You know, it was, it was like, Hey, we'll sell you an Echo Flex in this order for $0.  Yeah. Okay. Why not? Okay. Sure.  And I put it in my garage where I had a garage gym during the pandemic and I used it to play music while I worked out. So I didn't have to have something in my ear.  That's nice, right?  Yeah. And that, and then I occasionally tried to use it as like an in-house intercom and my husband hated it.  Oh, it annoys people so much when you do that.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally. So that was off.  I was, I remember writing about this when it first came out and being fascinated by the idea of, you know, essentially an audio app store.  And I think that was the ambition Amazon had and it just never realized it.  As Jill pointed out, the quality wasn't there. The understanding, you know, the natural language understanding wasn't there.  And so they never really, you know, created that business model.  Like Apple makes 30% off of, you know, off of app store transactions.  And that helps, you know, that helps kind of fuel the profitability of the iPhone business.  Amazon, you know, doesn't make money when they sell hardware by and large.  And they don't have the app store that, you know, that, you know, kind of buffers that.  So I can see it, you know, just kind of spiraling out of control in terms of losses.

But I pay for it. And you're right that because I pay for it, I immediately go to the Amazon site.  When I, when I like I'm in the bathroom, I run out of shaving cream, which I don't use, but I'm using as an example.  If I rent it, I would say, Echo, buy some shaving cream.  And then it will say, well, last time you bought this kind of shaving cream, you want to buy that?  And I'll say, yes. They say, what's your order number? What's your magic number? I have a pin.  I say that. And then the shaving cream comes the next day. That's, wouldn't want that. Apparently nobody.  Not enough people.  Not enough people want that. Come on, Nicholas, you must use the Echo.

Right. And the story did like very well, which was very surprising to us because like Motherboard was not like, you know,  Motherboard was a tech is, tech is bad.

So you could be it to read all the articles hoping there's some magic command.  Yeah. Instead, you just doing timers, music.  There's not much people do it, which is fine. Yeah.  Fart sounds like I don't do this. Do you? I mean, I remember they were pushing the skills like I do remember.  Yeah. Yeah. I don't use it. Don't use any of that. No, I think this has really been a flop.  And I have to think it's not just Amazon.  Well, we don't know. But I bet Google's having the same problem.  What's Google getting out of this? Except listening to Jill didn't didn't Microsoft basically kill off its.  They did. They had one. They made one with Harmon Garden called Cortana.  Yeah. And that was the effect. I bought that too, because I wanted everyone to listen to me.  I live in front of a microphone. What am I going to have? What's what are they going to hear that they don't?  Everybody else isn't here. But the Cortana, they now have repurposed it.  So it just kind of it stopped working as a Cortana device. And you can it's a Bluetooth speaker now.  It's a very pricey Bluetooth speaker for Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.

Transcript:  They don't need that money, though. Yeah, like that loss in their business is not really hurting them.  Right. I think I think there was definitely some early speculation that natural language processing was going to have a big value payout.  And it just I don't think it I don't think it has. But that's not to say it's not valuable for the business at large.  So, for example, Microsoft can use a lot of the information it's it's learned and acquired in its natural language processing systems and use that for its accessibility features.  Right. So it's not it's not like they would scrap it entirely.  There's still useful things that they can take from that end of the business and put into other sides of the business.  With Amazon, I'm not sure how they could leverage it in a different way, but I'm sure they have ideas about how they could do that.

It can be a beacon now. Yeah, that's so that's that's useful beyond just timers and whatever.  And also, as an aside, you know, these devices may not be transformative to Google's business or whatever, but they're kind of neat and useful.  I can ask the weather that I couldn't do that 10 years ago.  I could set a multiple timers. That's kind of cool.  I know my father has these devices all mixed mashed all throughout his house.  And he just kind of gets at a kick out of like turning off the lights and stuff.  Is that you know, is that is that so bad? I do that too.  Doesn't make Amazon any money.  Oh, it doesn't make an Amazon money, which is I suppose the bigger problem.  That's the problem. Because it costs them, right?

Apparently, I'll tell you one place Amazon's Echo is in space aboard the Artemis Orion capsule.  This is Callisto, Orion's onboard technology demonstration.  Now there's no astronauts in Orion, but they said they thought astronauts would like having Echo in space.  The only you know, I asked Rod Pilar space guy, is this just basically an ad for Amazon?  And he said, no, actually, if you're in a spacesuit doing an EVA, being able to talk to the system,  say open the pod bay doors, please, would be useful if it does, as long as it does.  If it doesn't, not good.  Callisto involves both an iPad and Amazon's Echo.  And for some reason Cisco's WebEx, there is nobody up there.  They obviously don't have to call back to the home offices in Seattle.  They have the whole database up there in space.  But the only good thing about this is if you wish, you can actually send a message to Callisto before they get home,  which they're going to be home in a couple of days.  You can be part of the Artemis One mission by sending a personal message for free, and it will show it on the screen.

There's just what is his name? Mannequin Skywalker, the dummy.  And there's a little stuffed Snoopy floating around as well.  It's a pretty capsule, though. I wouldn't mind going up there, you know.  And if you get lonely, you can always talk to Echo.  All right, final break. I got a few more stories.  I will find something of interest, I promise.  And I will not say anything bad about protocol again. I'm sorry.  I loved protocol. That's what I was saying.  I was saying how much I loved it, how sad I am to lose it.  That's all.  Oh, let me show you this. This is cool.  This is our sponsor for this segment of the show, a little company called OnLogic.  These are the coolest things ever.  These are industrial computers made for environments that a normal computer would not be happy in.  That's one of the big shifts in computing.

I bought the Eero 6E, Eero Pro 6E, whatever percentage off that was.  I bought a bunch of Steam games.  I'm excited about like, oh, this thing that used to be $100 a month ago.  Now it's 60.  Like, I don't know.  And so I don't know how big.  I think one of the issues is that like everyone, this coverage is now wall to wall.  I feel like you can go to like variety.com or like the Hollywood Reporter and read about Amazon's Cyber Monday deals.  That doesn't make sense.  If Gizmodo wants to do it, if Consumer Reports wants to do it, OK, that at least makes sense.  But it's so pervasive now.  Yeah, exactly.  Folks who cover this stuff, like I don't need Sports Illustrated telling me about like the best Amazon.  And that's what it feels like it's becoming over the years.  I've been doing this, Lord knows, many years now.  So I've kind of seen.  Now everyone does it.  So I think it's kind of like an exhaustion there.  But as far as like on the low level tactical, I don't know.  I feel like folks still like getting a deal on a Kindle or whatever the case may be.

Yeah, I think it's a month now.  Yeah, for sure.  Remember, Cyber Monday as a phenomenon existed because people were on dial-up modems at home.  And then they would go back to work when they had high speed connections on Monday and do their shopping.  And I mean, that's just ridiculous in 2022.  Like, that's not the behavior.

Transcript:  So I spend a lot of time outside of the United States and I've lived in a couple of countries outside the United States.  And it just tickles me with so much delight in November when all the shops have Black Weeks sale, Black Friday.  Because they don't have Thanksgiving.

Transcript:  Black Friday was somewhat of a success.  We already have metrics.  You know, Adobe and others do report on how it went.  I think it's pretty clear now that online shopping has to some degree replaced in-store shopping.  There was a boost in in-store traffic.  Actually, there was a surge last year in 2020.  People were so happy to get out of the house.  But high gasoline and grocery prices and inflation have weighed on households.  The report is from at least this is from retail next.  There's several reporters.  Store traffic up 7% on Black Friday compared with 2021 in-store sales up 0.1%.  A lot of lucky loose going in there.  I think people I hope people aren't doing this.  They're going to stores to choose what they're going to buy and then go back home and buy it online.  I hope they're not doing that.  But that kind of implies that they might be.  MasterCard, which kind of monitors everything, says Black Friday sales were up 12% over last year.  But that's also online as well as in-store and is not adjusted for inflation.  So it might be taking inflation into account only a few percent more.  It wasn't this giant, we're going to get out of the red and into the black holiday that it used to be.  That's why it was called Black Friday, right?  It was a chance for retailers to make all the money to get out of the money losing column, get into the money plus column.  Customer sentiment index from the University of Michigan, by the way, congratulations, University of Michigan,  fell 5.2% compared with October down 16% compared with November 2021.  So people are less bullish than they were last year, but a little more bullish than they were last month.  Walmart and Target said shoppers are spending less on discretionary items.  Again, that chill in the economy.  People are buying things they have to buy, but not things they don't have to buy.  Macy's, Kohl's and Target said sales slowed in October and early November.  And people think that it's possible shoppers are delaying their holiday purchases until closer to Christmas.  In other words, bottom line, a lukewarm Black Friday.

Transcript:  I went to a local Macy's on Black Friday itself to buy some dress socks.  And it didn't seem any crazier than any other Friday or Saturday.  It felt the traffic seems about the same.  It just felt like a normal day.  So I assume that's a consequence of just so much shopping going online.  But I wanted to see the calamity.  There is a short story there.

Transcript:  This is a great headline.  Great headline.  That's the Washington Post.  No, when you read the story, it's more about having to go on these weekend retreat getaway  things where there's excessive drinking and people sleeping with one another.  Legitimate that he doesn't want to participate in this.  But I love the headline and I love the idea of bringing up this topic that not everybody  wants to have fun at work.  Yes.  Lots of us want to do our job.  Yeah.  Paid for what we are contractually obligated to do and go home and have the right to do  our job.  We want to go home and have the rest of our lives to live.  We want to enjoy our leisure time.  I think that is such an important thing for people to learn at an early age before they  get indoctrinated into this idea that you have to work so hard over time.  You have to give your all.  You have to be at work all the time.  You should make friends with people at work.  Hey, enjoy the free dinner we give you at work.  Learn early on that you can set those boundaries and you do not have to participate in those  things that people do not want to.  Something I talk about in my book for remote companies is that if you are going to make  it fun, make it optional.  Everything that you are going to put out there for employees to socialize, get to know one  another, it has to be opt in, not opt out.  Very good.  I like that.  You cannot make people feel pressured to be a part of something that is optional.  It is so important to talk about this.

Transcript:  The man referred to by court documents as Mr. T, pity the fool who does not want to  have fun at my company, was fired from Cubic Partners in a paraspace consulting firm in  This has been wending its way through Parisian courts for seven years.  He refused to take part in seminars and weekend social events that his lawyers argued included  excessive alcoholism and promiscuity.  Mr. T argued that the fun culture in the company involved, quote, humiliating and intrusive  practices, including, you know what, this guy should get compensation, mock sexual acts,  crude nicknames, and obliging him to share his bed with another employee during work  functions.  In its judgment this month, the highest court in France, the court of cassation, ruled the  man was entitled to freedom of expression and refusing to participate in social activities  was a fundamental freedom under labor and human rights laws and not grounds for his  dismissal.

When your, when your wife runs the company, you have to, you have to do it.  The company didn't like Mr. T's brittle and demotivating tone.  You're so cranky.  Anyway, thank you, Jill Duffy.

I thought for sure they were deprecated by now in the phone system.  Because the way they work, it's clicks.  And the zero is like a bunch of clicks.  And then the one is one click.  And the phone system hears that and switches based on that.  I thought those were replaced by dial tones years ago.  Years ago.  Wow.  I've learned something today.  Thank you, Jill Duffy.
