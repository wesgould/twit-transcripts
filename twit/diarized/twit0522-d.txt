Transcript:  I would I would do that  I would just stand in front of the mirror and talk for half an hour about something. It's it's really kind of embarrassing  So  Anything happen this way I feel like I don't know did anything go on this week any big stories in the news?  I read a great story on Wired magazine actually kind of caught my interest about messaging actually  I thought this would be kind of a fun one to start with  It's author David Pierce  Says can we just decide to have one messaging platform that we all use?  I  Feel like the next big thing there it is  Kill the ad it says screw texting. It's time to pick a universal messaging app in the states. We use SMS  But there are a lot of apps vying for our attention and when you hear that is, you know  Facebook paid 22 billion dollars for whatsapp  I think a lot of people in the US were puzzled by that like how could that be worth that much?  But in fact outside of the states these apps are dominant Pierce talks about WeChat  We chat is huge in China half a million active users and he points out it's more than just messaging  I mean, there's there are WeChat stars just there as youtuber Instagram stars or the vine stars that people buy train tickets  They get their laundry done. They'll  They do everything live in WeChat which I haven't had that experience same thing in Japan with line line is amazing

End time: 550.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We are meanwhile in the states kind of in a situation  I guess kind of as instant messaging was in the early days where there's people on ICQ. There's people on aim. There's people on  Microsoft messenger. There's no unified platform. Is that that you think and it's this is the question  I'll pose you all is that is that the next big thing? I mean  messaging

Start time: 551.62
End time: 577.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Messaging is already here is the next big thing and Facebook really wants to take messenger and  Make it into something a lot more like WeChat or line  You know last year when Facebook told everybody that they were splitting off messenger from Facebook  And you'd have to download and use a different app  It ticked off a lot of people and people were puzzled and it became clear eventually that the reason they did it was because they  Wanted to make messenger into an all-encompassing platform similar to the ones people use in other countries

Start time: 577.96
End time: 580.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  WhatsApp they also bought whatsapp so they have two of them and and whatsapp  I mean the theory is it won't be like that whatsapp is gonna stick to its knitting and be focused on messaging  And it's never gonna be inundated with ads because they won't do advertising

Start time: 596.40
End time: 736.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you go ahead?  The funny thing is that I read that article and my first reaction was an old person reaction  Yeah, we need a unified messaging app  But in reality is today the different demographics different people different geographic  Locations people use applications differently so that is why we have so many different applications  You know slack has a certain purpose in our life just like SMS or iMessage  Has a certain purpose and whatsapp and so is Facebook messenger  So I think to dream of a unified app is just kind of like a childish  Dream to have I think there should be a little bit more interoperability  between the various services, but I think it's more like you know think of messaging platforms as  Communication network all  Social networks if you look at the way they are they are essentially  Messaging or communication platform Facebook you know people communicated through status and photos and and updates  And then it became messages and and now there is they have a Facebook messenger  So I think we have messaging and communications are code to social human behavior  And like every so often we reinvented  I think if you remember skype when they came out since all the people were on skype  Skype took off and all the other services didn't really take off even though they were still there now  you see the same thing with  But the with the current generation of messaging apps  They're taking off because you know we just like to communicate all the time. That's like a very fundamental  Human human need I think it's like something I've been writing about for almost  20 plus years is that you always overlook that at the end of the day  What really makes the internet work is our ability to communicate and interact the next generation of interaction is  Essentially what's happened to each other so and they will all remain this you know different from each other  I don't think that we need to have all of them in one one package like the way that the wired writer was  was trying to

Start time: 737.80
End time: 749.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Persuade us, but if that's true  Well, how do you account for the fact that we chat is used by half a billion people or that line is used by?  The is it the majority of Japanese users. I mean it's everybody has a line ID

Start time: 750.08
End time: 756.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's even though it's a messaging app  It's more comparable to Facebook in terms of sort of its importance

Start time: 756.28
End time: 771.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've had unified apps before like trillion and pigeon and I'm those do it's never as satisfying though  It seems to me is using them if we were all using one  App Jill, what do you do you now see you're an interesting question a lot? Yeah?

Start time: 771.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have a lot of international friends, and we use whatsapp as as a simple messenger that everybody signed up for early on  And I think it was sort of similar to Skype in the early days everybody's got a Skype account  This is what we were going to use and it was a simple enough tool that once we all had accounts  It was fine. I think when you when you look at something like the Chinese market  You know you have to remember that it's its own market in a lot of ways  You have a lot of people in one country that has its own special technological challenges  So it and it makes sense that in in the timeline of how China's technology is rolled out that they  Came to have a different messaging platform among the majority of their people at a different time than other parts of the world  And I agree with what almost saying too that you know I don't want one messenger for all of my needs  So when I use business communication tools  I want to have something else that lets me more easily search my history upload large files mark up PDFs  And that's a different kind of service than maybe having very private quick one-on-one communication  With my friends where my main concern there is did they get my message did they read my message?  You know I just that's all I want is that confirmation  So I think they're very very different uses and I think there there should be a lot of room for lots of different messengers

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apple enabled everything to be synchronous right so that you could get messages and SMS on  Your Mac and on your iPad as well as your phone  That kind of helped that platform move along so again.

Start time: 913.92
End time: 932.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't seem like the ideal situation  I reject your premise oh that I'm just an old man I  Feel like all of us would like one platform that just doesn't know I agree with them that interoperability would be nice

Start time: 932.46
End time: 950.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we've been waiting for it since the 1990s at one point when it was all about aim versus I see Q versus  MSN messenger the theory was they'd all talk to each other and that went almost nowhere  Yeah, and I don't see any evidence today that any of the major platforms are serious about no incentive  Yeah, they want to keep you within their garden walls

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook has added  Payments to messenger by the way they've got to come up with a new name since they're all messenger right it's very confusing  They've well, maybe that's intentional. They want it to be the messenger there  According to this article rumored to be doing something called money penny  Which would be a personal assistant messenger like on an automated personal assistant?  Those things exist already, and here's an interesting listing from Apple for an applications engineer for Android  And what's really interesting of course you figure well Apple music needs an Android app although if they're not well on their way to  Finishing that then they're in trouble  The implication is it's it says exciting new mobile products to the Android platform besides  The music and move apps I find that intriguing maybe Apple wants to do a native Android iMessage

End time: 1030.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said they were gonna open it up  And never do and they know they still haven't although they never said they were gonna write all the apps themselves  It's that they said they would let other people write the apps Apple and that's my complaint with

Start time: 1030.98
End time: 1059.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even though you can use iMessage with SMS. I'm always a blue bulb a green bubble in the message and  Apparently I didn't even know this people  discriminate against green bubbles  Also, if you jump back and forth, that's a real headache. I'm told and there was I mean, I'm told by my kids  Oh, yeah, you're if it like when we're doing group messaging, you can't be part of group messaging because you're a green bubble  So we just leave you out  We don't include you

Start time: 1061.14
End time: 1112.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think that's that's kind of a good point too  Is that social networks are social right and messaging?  I would say is a social network the way that people behave online is similar to the way that we behave in life and  Especially when you're younger, you don't want to be one of the large large large group, right?  Like you don't necessarily want to be included in the biggest thing  You want to have your own niche environment where people are like you right?  So it's that social behavior of wanting to be with your group and I think that can certainly happen  With messaging right like you want to be in the platform that is representative of you and your people I would say  What makes something like we chat successful is that has that within it, right?  Like there are sort of subcultures within we chat  So, wow, maybe that's part of the problem is that the messaging platforms we have don't allow for that  differentiation between people

Start time: 1113.22
End time: 1148.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have I mean I I told my wife can we just use Facebook Messenger because it's got stickers  it's got more stuff and  We did one message and then it's back to SMS  So I don't I feel like this isn't gonna happen in the United States  So you probably write on and it is and I guess we don't want all be on the same platform  We want different tools. I just bothers me that I have hip chat slack  line wire  messenger  Good feels like Google's missing the boat here Hangouts could be a unified  Platform that unifies a lot of people but they're not making many efforts in that direction

Start time: 1148.84
End time: 1159.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were sort of on the cusp of that and then they walked away from it. I don't understand Google at all  If there was like a consumer a personal version of slack that could be really appealing to me because I love slack  I'm on slack all day for work

Start time: 1159.76
End time: 1199.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I've heard that people actually do use it for as consumer group  they have slack groups and they'll do stuff and you can have slack is kind of cool because you can have bots and  you know, you can it can be elaborate every time I  type certain phrases and we use slack with our web develop web team and  when I type certain phrases, it's slack like borat shows up every time I I  Say something like nice move borat goes. Yeah, and just it's very customizable and very  powerful  Maybe that's what's missing is that there isn't there that if if we all use the same platform  We could all be speaking the same language  I know you're right on that's it's old-fashioned the idea that we we used to all watch the same TV show Sunday nights

Start time: 1200.40
End time: 1203.04

Transcript:  You know, we're in a more fragmented world you're all unique snowflakes Oh God  I'm just an old one  All right, let's take a break we're gonna come back  I would I really I thought you guys would all join me and we could all team up we could create a movement to all  Use whatever but that's what would it be? I mean, I don't want it to be Facebook. I don't want Facebook to win  I guess that's the problem. I do not want face because if Facebook's already won one and a half billion  monthly active users on the Facebook platform  300 million on  Instagram what is the whatsapp? Is it it's gotta be at least that  How many hundred 800 800 under a billion I guess they've already won  if they if they okay if they put a  Personal assistant if they put more features in the messenger  Would we could you think that that could they could win? Is it possible to win in the US anyway?

Start time: 1260.52
End time: 1333.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're big messenger would be their play in  non  China markets  I don't think they can win in China or some of the other big Asian countries like, you know  Like in Korea or in Japan, but they can you know messenger could be a huge win for them in India  For example, like they're massive in India. I think that's where their big numbers are coming from really interesting  Africa is another place where messenger could be huge  I think a lot of people don't really realize it that you know, what's up got a lot of traction in Africa  You know BBC used to publish a lot of stories in whatsapp and people had created slack like groups  Inside whatsapp and BBC used that to cover, you know  elections in both in Nigeria and Kenya  I mean so like, you know, these societies are much more mobile first and much more advanced  Compared to to us. So I think if you're looking at Facebook to make an effort  It would be I would say it would be in in in places like India and many parts of Africa  Some parts of you know, Latin America where they're massive. I would not be surprised if it becomes a dominant

Transcript:  You know, they hired the Facebook hired the guy who was running PayPal  To to lead the the messenger effort and David Marcus  Yeah, David Marcus is leading a huge effort a push into commerce inside the messenger platform  so it'd be interesting to see what what  They can they can actually achieve but you know, it looks pretty promising

Start time: 1372.81
End time: 1392.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we talk a lot about you know  Being virtual reality and stuff like that messenger  messaging platform seem like kind of a mundane subject and yet that's to me that seems like  there is a battle raging but kind of between these big companies and  Because there's no incumbent. There's no big winner. It's gonna be very interesting

Transcript:  20 plus years of covering communications and and  Messaging so for the longest time the only way you could monetize  Messaging was like in the early days it was through SMS when Skype and all came  You essentially bought minutes and like buckets of minutes  But now you know with mobile things have advanced to a level where we can actually start to think about  making  commerce and and like not just commerce like, you know, I'm  Like like why can't I have a subscription group where I share a link to read an article?  There's a fiber, you know  just you get the link and it only is available to that group and you read it and you go away after that and you know,  The only like you can't share it you can do anything. It's confined to that. I mean, that's what whatsapp can do  That's what you know slack can do as I think there's a lot more promise in messaging and communications now  you know, I'm a firm believer in the whole idea of  This conversational user interface the the emergence of intelligent bots which allow us to  Automate a lot of things we do on the network. I think those are things, you know, they they're not they're not too far off  They're like within  12 to you know, 48 months time frame. We're gonna start to see a lot of these services become mainstream

Transcript:  And of course Microsoft is not being counted out here because whether anybody realizes it or not  They are all in on Skype and in fact on Windows 10. They've started the movement towards separating Skype messaging into a separate  application just as Facebook did with its messaging  And I think that Microsoft wants to get back into this business  It gave up on MSN messenger quite famously a few years ago, but I think they want to get back into this  The problem with Microsoft is that they kind of get too distracted with making a lot of complex

I put it on my up-to-date late model brand new Google phone the Nexus 6  Running Google Fi and I'm vulnerable  So if I'm vulnerable, we're all screwed because I mean what about somebody with a really old phone  There's not going to be any update although LG Samsung and  Google have all agreed to start a monthly update cycle.

So all of a sudden people in the United States are seeing what that smartphone actually costs  Not 200 bucks and iPhone 700 bucks many of the top-of-the-line phones are between six and eight hundred  Dollars and I think that's gonna add pressure to reduce phone costs here in the States even  In fact the new phones that we're seeing the moto X the moto G the one plus two are all sub five hundred dollars  I think that's telling isn't it?

Transcript:  It'll still work as long as there's a payment plan system right so so part of the issue is that people have decided how much they're  Willing to pay for a mobile phone monthly, right?  They've kind of been anchored into a price and that price can be anywhere from about I'd say  $4550 to about $100 right and if you're saying okay upfront  I need to pay $800 now and enroll in a plan people are not gonna go for that  But if you can work out the numbers one way or another to make it a monthly  Payment based on what people are ready to pay I think it can still work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is clearly T-Mobile strategy. Okay. I think they're changing the game. They're making things work more  effectively in favor of the consumer and  Using that as an advantage to steal market share away from Verizon. So  definitely there is a an  upside to the whole thing right now, you know the one thing I  Wonder like where the future is headed is is it's the sticker you have on your on your  On your laptop the Google Phi sticker the project by yeah  I think you know as we speak less and less and the phone data becomes more important  You're gonna start to see many more experiments like Google Phi  Start to emerge and that's where the next battleground is going to be so that's why also  you know, I look at what T-Mobile and and  Verizon is doing are doing is is actually preparing for the reality of tomorrow not today  I think tomorrow I mean if I can get you know  $100 for data only on my phone. That's all I want  Be very happy like I would be much more happier getting a phone number or SMS and data and because I  Never use the phone anymore. Yeah, and and whenever I do I'm actually calling through Viber or right WhatsApp or sometimes even from Skype  And even you know Google voice  So it just is not that important the phone part of the phone is not important at all  And the text messaging is very important and even that is becoming less relevant  What you need is just a data connection. I think that's why it makes sense for these guys to get away from  You know subsidizing the phone itself

Transcript:  Well, in fact T-Mobile the most popular plan among the geeks is a kind of a hidden pay-as-you-go plan on the T-Mobile web page  $30 a month for unlimited text and data and only a hundred minutes of calling a month and  I tell you what I'd easily do that for me  I never do more than a hundred minutes Google Phi is  $20 for the texting and by the way, I'm holding the five phone up because I suckered Lee fell for it  ten twenty dollars a month for texting and phone  Unlimited and then you pay ten dollars a gigabyte for data  So that's that's the only upside for Google is the more data you use the more you'll pay  but it and it uses the T-Mobile network and the sprint network and Wi-Fi if if you're if you happen to have Wi-Fi and  handy  I don't really understand though. This is not for somebody who's using the $30 T-Mobile plan. This is not a savings  So I'm not sure what I'm sure what again. I know I'm I don't feel like Google's strategy is clear  Maybe I'm missing the boat

I think you know, I I mean creep by the Google Phi  You know now that I'm a civilian I didn't I'm still waiting for my phone to show up  So I haven't tried it  Yeah, but I look at that and I just like this is interesting because I can get 3g when I'm traveling worldwide, which is great  Yeah, and and it also  Allows me to not worry about which platform. I'm I'm on T-Mobile or  Sprint, you know, not exactly the rock solid networks, but good enough and Wi-Fi  I think this is where we are headed like maybe not this exact model  But this is where we are headed where we see all the carriers getting abstracted on our devices  I think it's not as crazy to think about the future  You know service like device coming with okay, you turn it on  you don't have to think about who you are assigning up with that just is the network and  In the background stuff happens, I think this is  Not today, but in in in the future, you know  You look at what companies like Comcast and Cox and time Warner are doing they're setting up their own  Massive Wi-Fi cloud everywhere, right? So you suddenly start to think it's like what is the idea of?  Connectivity going forward. It's not the way we've always  Assumed it is right. So which is just a phone sign up with the phone company give them $150 a month and  Basically, you're locked into a three-year contract. It makes no sense anymore

So I have a headset right and I use my computer  I use Google voice often. So when I have meetings with companies in the United States, I always want to give them a US phone number  so I still use Google voice which is  Not the best system. I have to say like that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah  I didn't realize you I used to live in the UK too  And I used it a lot there for the same reason, you know to give people a US phone number  But the the convenience of just having a US phone number is huge and you don't have to pay for it with Google voice the  Way that you could with Skype to get a phone number, but my setup is you know, I'm usually at my desk  My phone calls are always planned.

Transcript:  But it behaviors change of emergencies. I have I have an article coming out tomorrow  Monday morning on PC mag about putting emergency contact information into your phone  So this was something as I started to look at the different phones and the ways to do it  Apple is definitely ahead. It has the easiest system. So don't they have an app for that?  It's in the health app health. So, you know, there's every phone has to allow you to make an emergency call from the lock screen  Right. This is a requirement in the US  So Apple has a little button that has medical information on it  And I really like highly highly recommend everybody who has an Apple device use that  If you have kids if kids are going away to college soon, absolutely make sure they set it up  It takes about two minutes to do but it has your name your medical information as much as you want to put in there  So allergies blood type and as many contacts as you want to list as your emergency ID people  So it's important not only for us to set it up

Start time: 2750.40
End time: 2755.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2756.22
End time: 2766.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  right there hopefully they know about that right it's it's not as good because  There's a lot of apps that offer this it's not on all phones  There are some phones that have it in the settings, but it's you know, it's fragmented  It's Android but the trick with Android is to find an app that offers it with a widget from the lock screen  So that's what I need. Yeah, do it  Yeah, and and and they're kind of there a lot of them are buggy some of them mess with your alarm apparently  and then I looked at Blackberry and Windows Phone and they're  Not as good either. I think there's an app for for both of those that allow you to put any  Message you want on your lock screen  So again, I recommend to people put your emergency contact info there Jason how have you found anything?

Transcript:  Specifically, I mean I know I know that there are plenty of apps that do that on the lock screen like Jill's talking about the problem  There is that lollipop and beyond?  There are no more lock screen widgets  They basically got rid of that and now it's the notification stream there by default  So that helps you if you're I mean and plenty of people are on older versions of Android as we know well not too well  But yeah current versions lollipop and more recent don't have that ability. So

I remember reading a New York Times article last month that they've had something like 18% improvement in  Heart attack recovery not through any medical procedure, but because they got people to the hospital faster  That the you know, they have EKGs in the ambulance now  They can send that to the hospital before you get there so that they're ready to  When you arrive the other thing he told me and this is important for everybody to hear is if you think you're having a heart attack  You know don't drive yourself get to the hospital. He said don't be embarrassed  We're very used to this people coming in with gas and anxiety and thinking it's a heart attack. It's not a shameful thing  We're very used to it and we'd far prefer you came in  Than that you ignored the symptoms  Because it can really save your life  He told me I can't remember what it was, but every minute there's a certain percentage  every minute that goes by a certain percentage less a  Life expectancy or something I can't remember the exact thing  Anyway, we'll move on but I'm glad you made it home and I'm glad you have a good friend who was there to  Me too.

I also like Roku. I think Roku is a  interesting little company they keep going and  I like the whole category for say because I believe that  You know, I think the whole idea of television the way it was is just makes no sense anymore  I think you know, I I felt that way in 2008 and I still feel it, you know  It's finally last one week you beginning to see everybody talk about the reality of cord cutting  So sometimes, you know, it takes five to seven years for reality to to happen, but it's been fun  Like I like the iPad is a great viewing device from my standpoint. I watch MLB on that I watch cricket on it  I watch by NBA on it. So it's like I bought it's like a very small television, but  The Apple TV if it comes out it will actually push more and more people to think about  Just using that as an interface for for consuming content this week Wall Street to cut

But obviously media stocks really took a hit Walt Disney 21st Century Fox  And  Viacom  although  The CEO of cable vision said not so fast. It's not it's not that bad  We don't see he told the Wall Street Journal. We don't see a landslide of corn cutting in the near term James Dolan  Of course, he's talking to investors.

Transcript:  Leo the the key way to think about any of these changes is  We are beginning to see a whole generation  think about television not as television but  Something on demand and then you have a generation behind them who think of video only in terms of  Devices which they can hold in their hand and they can touch I think that's exactly right  And so ten years forward, you know, these guys may you know stem the losses for a little while  Do some financial engineering ten years down the line the behavior of the consumer is very different  That's when you know, it's not caught cutting. It just is a different behavior. You're not watching television at all  Yeah, and I think this whole notion that you know life's force is gonna save their bacon and live events  I don't know. We don't know like what the consumers of tomorrow are going to  You know adapt to these things or not. Like I don't know. I am really interested in trying to figure out  How people consume television in next five years to actually make a reasonable call on like what the future looks like  But this one thing is for sure the way things were  That's gone like that, you know 60 billion or 600 billion in their market cap  That's just irrelevant these companies have been sitting and doing absolutely nothing and that's why they are beginning to suffer

It was a it was like watching a pixelated video game  You know frame by frame it was terrible, but they stuck with it and they developed it out and we're an MLB household  So we use it quite frequently, but at three in the morning, unfortunately  We have actually I have to I have to start the game because I'm allowed to see the final scores  So I'm in charge of starting the game  but yeah after the fact but um  What happened was HBO hired some people from MLB who had worked on right HBO now  Was based on MLB now exactly and they said we really need somebody who has expertise and nobody had any expertise

She's not watching live programming  She's watching on-demand programming off the internet  The 21 year old won't do that. He watches YouTube and that's it  And I feel like that's really I mean you're missing the boat if you're thinking. Oh, the next thing is over the top  It as I think you nailed it. Oh, which is TV  Watching itself has changed completely and people are using mobile devices. They're not watching TV  They're consuming content in some completely different way. I

Start time: 3983.26
End time: 4012.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think what it does is it you know it basically all the economics of our  television and  Entertainment ecosystem is built on mass audience, right? Right and and we are going into  more  you know like  fractional audience over a long period of time and  There will be hits and there will be some people who will do really well with the hits like, you know  HBO and True Detective or

There will be far  The focus has to be on finding that interesting thing that people are glued to  But most of the viewing is going to be fractional  So the economics of the industry changes not from mass audience  Which is like mass audience put lots of television charge lots of money and go home whereas fractional is  Everything is just you know up for grabs. Maybe we need to be thinking really really hard about  paid content  Subscription models which are entirely different than what they are today  I think Netflix works because it is actually an interesting business model not because it has the best content  It's like and they figured out that for $10 a month  People are okay  Putting up with you know a lot of average content as long as they find something to see on a daily basis

Transcript:  In fact you're seeing really the opposite when you think about the fact that these  HBO shows like Game of Thrones or True Detective really are 30 or 40 hour movies. They're not they're not even two hour movies  They're spread out, but there are a lot of hours  We're we've we've gotten better at a long story arc than ever before we like those long stories. How about like a two-hour?  new screensavers  It is two hours  I feel like it's like good. I like it. Thank you. Oh rock on I

Start time: 4172.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I know when you start to look at some of the TV shows that are coming out exclusive on Vimeo and YouTube  I think they're breaking away from the idea of having a format at all  They say let us tell the story in the amount of time that we need  So shows like high maintenance for example, which is on Vimeo and there's a few others that have very short programs  I think that's a good experimental way to go  But I think we also have to remember that we've been programmed to  Consume content in certain blocks  So a half hour show is usually actually somewhere between 22 and 26 minutes in the US because of commercial breaks  And if you watch on Netflix, right like you'll you'll watch those 22 minutes straight through  And then there's a difference between an hour-long show on network  Which is usually about 46 minutes and an hour-long HBO show which is actually more like 58 59 minutes  And I think we're acclimated to watching in those breaks and that writers start to get used to writing in those breaks, right?  So you have 14 minutes until your plot twist and you have eight minutes of resolution  You know what I mean? So I think we have some forms that are more ingrained in our behavior for consuming media than we realize  And I would say the same thing about movies too  so you you know that the the movie studios are pushing for a certain amount of time on a movie because they know that the  Consumer going to the theater wants a certain length of an experience to feel like they're getting their money's worth  So writers are told, you know taught to pace their stories based on that block of time that they're given  So I think some of those issues are going to be harder to overcome  In new media, I think new media helps them a lot  But I think getting used to the idea that we the consumer want to have certain things happen in our story in the plotting and the pacing  Just because we've been accustomed to that's that's the way that a story is might even be biological

I think HBO has done a great job of maintaining quality and what they and  Being very clear about what they stand for. I think New York Times  Has done a good job so far, but I see that they're starting to go down this path stumbling  Yeah, that they're starting to  Miss out who they really are and why we are willing to pay for them  I think that's that's the other thing, you know the the thing which  We have never talked about or like people don't talk about in like how  storytelling it will actually  Be different going forward because the technology is different, right?  So, you know Jill was talking about 26 minute blocks of 58 minute blocks  but think about it this way today we can stop and have a  Video sync to another screen. Yep  Any time like so we don't watch like I have not sat down and watch a single movie  You know end to end like I just maybe watch 10 minutes a year and 15 minutes

What is going to happen to the medium and it is not going to be a mass medium as a result of that  and I think the most of the  The television industry misses the point about that  Completely misses the point that we are in charge like we mean the end customer is in charge of how  That's that's the beauty.

It's unintuitive  You never know what's gonna happen when you click it apps don't support it Apple supports it  But it's still unclear and it gets in the way things like clicking and dragging you press too hard  Now suddenly you're doing something completely different. I'm gonna go out in the limb and say that's a flop  And no one cares  Which proves my I don't even know what you're talking exactly proves my point. Not only is it a flop Oh never even heard of it.

They've solved the streaming issue  So Apple TV maybe with new deals maybe not  This certainly needs a new user interface. I'd love to see an iPad Pro although Pachkoski calls that a wild card  new iPhones  We won't see I don't think if Apple's true to form new hardware, right?  It'll be the same form factor, but they'll add force touch maybe a better camera hardware next year

Transcript:  But that's what's gonna happen. You know people talk a lot about fragmentation. We've got a new fragmentation chart from OpenSignal  93 different  Android  devices distinct devices  more than doubled from  2013 and  Nobody's really got the lion's share. This is the biggest one is the galaxy s3 than the s4 and the s5  and then there's lots of little little doohickeys like the HTC desire and the  iMobile iStyle and the Alcatel one touch and  But you know you can use the word fragmentation which is kind of a pejorative or  you can say this is a  Vibrant ecosystem and it's hurtful to Apple because the iteration the innovation happens so much faster  When you're putting out a new phone every few months and Apple's only doing it every every year and only new hardware every two years

Start time: 5165.91
End time: 5180.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  although I mean  Of those phones Apple is not paying attention to them. They don't care about the low end  Yeah, they're just a handful that are serious competition and right from companies that tend to put out one major new flagship phone per year

Transcript:  Samsung in fact struggling a little bit even though they dominate their forty seven and a half percent of the Android market share. I'm sorry  It was forty seven is now down to thirty seven in a couple of years still dominant  So that's the only one Apple has to and they don't even have to worry about the low-end Samsung  They have to only worry about the top of the line, right? I think the the Android ecosystem doesn't take into account

Transcript:  all the  Fasterizing brands, you know the Xiaomi the one plus the you know  Micromax and you know all those kind of  Native brands from China and India. I think they are doing their own version of Android  They're doing their own version of phones. I think those guys are going to drive this market  I think Samsung is a little bit on the back foot there right now  in because these smaller companies have like huge markets and  They're actually way more cooler than than  Than the Samsung. I think I was talking to somebody the other day  I was  you know was visiting India and came back and he was telling me that Samsung is lost its cool in all these  Asian markets, it's just not a cool cool brand anymore because it's like  Doing too many things and all over the map and it doesn't really have a market positioning  However, I think when you when you think about Apple, you know, they put out technology way far ahead of everybody else  But the things they put out are actually usable right like nobody's talking about  hacking their fingerprint scanner or their cameras doesn't have to have the most amount of  megapixels, but yet  Pictures are still coming out better than any other camera. Yeah. Well, I think you're half right

Start time: 5296.14
End time: 5308.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the Apple in fact isn't ahead of anybody else  But I think you're exactly right that when they do put out a feature it works better than others  They were they did leave with fingerprints  But NFC they finally got NFC

Start time: 5309.18
End time: 5344.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They finally touched it but the NFC didn't really work right like for the longest time right like till Apple there  Yeah, I think a lot of the time technology you have to know when to market it to people right coming out too soon  It's just a feature which nobody knows what to do with I think camera wise  I'll give you that Nokia phones had better cameras  But you know the iPhone takes a really great picture  They are making so much progress on the software inside there. You know the visual  Computing part they're doing really better than everybody else

End time: 5387.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think people know that it's eight megapixels or that Samsung is doing 13  I don't think they care and I don't even know if they care about specs or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think the the phone still works better than most phone  I'd like it just is more intuitive than other phones. I don't want to be apologist for Apple  I just feel that if you're an Android user you get a lot more  You have to jump through more hoops than you do with the app all these years later

Start time: 5416.58
End time: 5435.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple still has the best app store and there are still major apps that  Ship later for Android or don't ship at all for Android  Or the updates come along later  I think if you want the single best selection of apps not counting the things you can't do at all on an iPhone because Apple  Won't let you  Apple is still on top

Start time: 5435.24
End time: 5473.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of apps that Apple doesn't have or come to Apple after Android and that's ink that number is  Flipping it was yeah, it was Apple. I'm always assuming it's going to and I still haven't seen like it hasn't maybe completely  But I think it's on its way  I also think Apple suffers because their gatekeeper on updates to apps and I think that causes a problem  I have to not get updated as rapidly on iOS if you use an Android phone  You're getting app updates 10 or 12 app updates every single day  I know that's a little annoying in some ways  But I think it makes me feel better that bugs are getting squashed faster because you don't have to get past the Apple gatekeepers

Start time: 5473.52
End time: 5477.80

Start time: 5482.66
End time: 5514.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we just talked about the difference between Android and iPhone like a few minutes ago in the emergency  You know contact information and like apps which are there, but they're pretty mediocre  I think what I'm trying to say is that because there is a like an editorial process on the apps  Maybe that pushes the quality or like a little bit higher may forces  Companies to look at the bugs more closely before submitting to the app. So yeah

Start time: 5515.64
End time: 5563.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Still talking about the very savvy consumer, right?  Like the very savvy tech consumer knows about the differences between the app stores and maybe some of the different  Features of the camera but at the the most basic level think about a person who's just buying their first smartphone if they go with  An iPhone they have about three choices to make right like it's really simple  Models. Yeah, how much do I want to spend are these phones all gonna work for two or three years?  Great  If you look at Android you don't even know where to start like sure if you went through all the work and  Read up on all the phones  You could probably find a phone that would make you very very happy and have every feature you wanted  But the work of getting there is so exhaustive that it's easier to just say here are my three options  They're gonna work. They work with my carrier. Boom. Let's do that

Start time: 5565.26
End time: 5589.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a no-brainer very much like buying windows in the 90s was a no-brainer  And I didn't think at the time Windows was better than Mac OS  I don't actually think iOS is better than Android at the now  but I don't but I can understand exactly as you say Jill why  Normal people who don't really want to get involved in this  Warfare just say it's it's the default. It's easy. Nobody ever get fun got fired for buying an iPhone

Start time: 5590.72
End time: 5598.58

That's it. You know anything beyond that. It's just like them trying to convince  Themselves that they're better than that. I think they don't love what they do which is sell ads  That's pretty much Google's big issue is  They're good at that. They're very good. Probably the best at that  Yeah, but seems like you know Facebook is getting really really good at that, too
