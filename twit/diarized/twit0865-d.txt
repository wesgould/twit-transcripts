Transcript:  Air battles between the US and Russia that will that will definitely calm the situation then I mean you're right  You know  There's some there's an old joke from Ireland as opposed to an Irish joke  an old joke from Ireland that whose punchline is if you wanted to get there, I wouldn't start from here and  you know  Like neoliberal shock thought therapy after the wall came down created the conditions that brought Putin to power  The decision to bring Putin into the world-based order because we wanted his you know, his his gas wealth his fuel his fossil fuel wealth  Increase the presence of oligarchs around the world and their corrupting influence and also made it harder to  Effectively sanction them because now the wealth is spread it everywhere  and you know  There's just like a series of missteps and some things that weren't missteps and some things that are definitely the fault of Russian elites  And you know that I'm not one of those people who says well  It's definitely NATO's fault for for showing up on Russia's doorstep, but that didn't help either, right?  Like I think you'd have to be a weirdo to say no, no, no  One of the things that really stabilized that region was was bringing NATO up to the the Russian border that that definitely calmed things down a lot  You know, so it's it's um, it's a horrific situation and we are kind of  Like 20 years too late to have prevented it from happening  But you know as with trees the best time to have planted a tree was 20 years ago  And the second best time is now and the best time to actually confront some of the geopolitical choices that we've made that produced  This outcome would have been when we were making them and the second best time is right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All of life is like that  You know you do things 20 years ago that you had no idea would get you to be a for instance a podcaster  in the midst of the worst time ever for podcasting and  I think that 20 years ago a bunch of people did say this would happen right?

Transcript:  Do have to say I really respect all the people on Twitter that you know over the course of getting their  Epidemiology degrees and becoming experts  I  Have managed to get a war college and it's amazing. Is it the experts? Yes  Yes, I really I do I don't disagree with the premise Cory that we should have taken stronger actions of the last 20 years  I think there's a very strong argument that generally speaking our strategy has been appeasement at the same time. It's  you know, I I think you look at something like I  Just can't help but feel there's a large contingent on Twitter that is in in the press overall  That's really minimizing the risk that a no-fly zone would create if America got involved with that kind of reinforcing that and I  Just speaking for myself  Every time the subject for in the United States comes up people don't know this but Mississippi my home state has more people serving per  Capita than any other state in America  I like every other Mississippian know plenty people that served in Iraq and Afghanistan  and I have specific friends that did not make it home and  It's it's really hard because I do agree that our strategy has been appeasement overall at the same time  I'm freaking war weary  I mean we look at the outcome of Iraq and Afghanistan and it's really hard to see what concretely that we  Accomplished and I just have to be honest and say I read the New York Times read WSJ every Washington Post  It just seems like an epic cluster in every way it could possibly be a cluster

Transcript:  Oh, you know, we're in vigorous agreement. I grew up in the anti-war movement  You know, I was arrested for blockading an arms bizarre in Ottawa. I have  important feelings about why it shouldn't be easier to arrest people who are protesting in Ottawa and  I  I completely agree know that the appeasement I'm talking about is doing things like saying well  We should we should bring Russia into the WTO and then we should integrate its banking system with our banking system  And we should allow reliance on Russian gas to become significant  factor in European politics and  if we discover that all of our tax havens are being used by  Russians to launder their money to as opposed to just our own homegrown oligarchs  We should forbear from acting on it in order to protect our own homegrown oligarchs instead of using that as the basis  For shutting down tax havens all over the world and ending the kind of financial secrecy that abets corruption  So that we can strike at their oligarchs and ours at the same time. Here's I found the tweet. This is actually an

End time: 1187.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's completely let his memes are  And just starts like posting excerpts from his like tapes of conversations  Let me tell you this is a letter Nixon wrote to the first George Bush

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  George Herbert Walker Bush in 91 or 92 arguing  To put more money into aid for European for Western liberalism  Lowercase L the West Nixon says has failed so far to seize the moment to shape the history of the next half century  If Yeltsin fails the prospects for the next 50 years will turn grim the Russian people will not this is 91  He's writing will not turn back to communism  But a new more dangerous depotism despotism based on extremist  Russian nationalism will take power if the new despotism prevails everything gained in the great peaceful revolution of 91 will be lost  War could break out in the former Soviet Union as the new despots use force to restore the quote  Historical borders of Russia and quote that was actually pretty of course even a broken clocks right twice a day  But that's pretty astute actually

Start time: 1241.98
End time: 1258.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we can see that and I think what Corey rightly points out is that there have been enormous financial incentives to kind of  Whitewash going on in Russia, and it's amazing to watch shells kind of oil is still buying Russian gas. You know I mean  No one looks at oil companies to be moral arbiters

End time: 1330.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's move it to tech though we can certainly talk about what's going on Ukraine in a tech context in fact  It's really interesting to see how I  mean you're seeing  the  Ukrainian vice prime minister  Mikhailo Fedorov used Twitter  He's using Facebook to call on hackers to step forward and help the Ukrainians in the fight against Russia  You're seeing  You know all sorts of Bitcoin transfers  cryptocurrency transfers  To Ukraine it is a it is a war in a different era one of the things people have been very worried about is cyber warfare  The fear that Russia would start to attack us  And that we would attack back  there was a report which has been denied by  Biden's team that he was offered some options to  Bring cyber warfare to Russia take Russia off the internet  In fact some have suggested to I can that they remove Russia from the DNS servers, which would effectively take it off the internet  It's a very different time even than 20 years ago

Start time: 1331.60
End time: 1380.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I don't think that it's really true that  Removing the root servers would take Russia off the internet the way that the time to live on those 13 roots work  Is it would take about  Well several days for that to happen and Russia could make accommodations, right?  They could set up their own root of trust and they could you know with friendly large friendly powers like China could figure out how  To get around it  So I think mostly what it would do is just establish a future in which I can  Had even less credibility than it does now even more as an agent of American foreign policy than it is now  Which you know to the extent that that's true. It's not great and to the extent that it's perceived as true  I think that exceeds the extent that it is true  It robs it of the credibility that we actually need an internet governance  So I'm kind of on the right side of this like if it gains you nothing and costs you a lot  You shouldn't do it symbolism just isn't worth it

Start time: 1381.04
End time: 1396.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't said our mission does not extend to taking punitive actions issuing sanctions or restricting access against segments of the internet  Regardless of the provocations. I think that's fair  Of course, it was Fedorov who asked I can to take take rush off. I get it. Yeah

Start time: 1396.64
End time: 1440.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're if you're like if you're you know at the pointy end of a war of aggression  Obviously like the these fine distinctions are not the things that are top of mind  I don't think we should blame them for it  but I also think that one of our jobs as people who aren't in the fog of war is to  You know listen and then not paternalistic Lee but but you know taking into account the factors that you get when you're not  In imminent danger try and think through some of the second-order consequences and whether or not  This is worth doing and I say that as someone who wants freedom for Ukrainian people an end to Russian aggression  The the Russian troops out of Ukraine, right? I just think that it's the wrong way to get that

Start time: 1441.34
End time: 1453.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think it would get that and I also think what one of the requests Fedorov made that was responded to was that Apple  and Google  Remove their stores from Russia and they did shortly thereafter is that a bridge too far

Start time: 1455.82
End time: 1557.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm okay with that because they're not an NGO that is in charge of the Internet, right?  I and you know, I do think that there are some unexpected consequences like  You know, they're the I think if you're Russia your Russian relatives in st. Petersburg. Yeah  Yeah, and not just them but like the standard app that's used in the region for private communications as signal as telegram  Rather which has some deficits  Apparently they do have an end to an encryption for group chat  But like I I couldn't find it and neither could some colleagues of mine at EFF. Well, it's also we roll your own encryption  It's not it's not standard encryption. We just we just published a guide to using telegram more safely  In in Russia and in Ukraine  One of the things that or no it isn't they have end to end encryption a big apart and they say that they have disappearing messages  For group chat which we couldn't figure out how to turn on and they say they turned it  They started it last summer  But you know one of the things that you really want if you're in a politically sensitive  Environment is the ability to have messages just delete themselves after a relatively short period of time  So that if you're forced to unlock your phone as Russians are now being forced to do on the streets on the streets  But that that they're not exposed to that and so, you know  if you if you can't side load as you can't with an with iOS and you want to switch to something that does have better disappearing messages and  Other features that would help you not just protect yourself but protect your counterparties the other people you talk to  That's now beyond your grasp. And so it's not without its costs. I'm I think that I  Am more comfortable with cutting off the app stores, but you know for the record  I also think that it's completely wrong that Apple won't let you side load app. So, you know, there you go

Transcript:  Yeah, I do think that if you look at the history of how you know  Rose to power in Russia people don't know this but you know, he went to  He had we first rose to power. He had the television stations that were really not treating him very kindly  They actually had you know the scene in V for vendetta with a puppet that's kind of mocking  Mocking the the fictional president there that actually happened to Putin in in Russia  They have one of their television shows with the Putin puppet kind of mocking him  And what ended up happening to the person in charge of that television station is they did what they do to many people  They're part of political opposition in Russia  They brought him forward and they charged him with crimes and then as he's in jail  They went to him said look if you hand over the television station to this person's a lot more friendly to us  All of this is gonna go away  So I think you can't look at the legacy of how you know  Putin rose to power in Russia and not understand that very tight control over state media is part of that  You know for all the things we've critiqued the internet for many times here on Twitter  I do think that giving people access to information is something the internet is obviously good for so any  Move to kind of limit that it just it feels it feels like it's symbolic  But it also feels like it's gonna aggravate problems more than it's gonna actually solve it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, Eva Eva wrote it. I didn't work on and I just wrote a Twitter thread about it  This is Eva Galperin is my my colleague. She's our head of  security research  She's done amazing work on particularly defending women who are being attacked with stalker where she's the reason that the app stores have removed  Stalker where from their app stores now and she's from the region  You know more I believe she was actually born in Russia  Instead of like me whose father was born in the region  And so she has a lot of family ties and she understands the local context pretty well  And she wrote that guide to using it more safely like it isn't there is no you know  Absolutely safe way of doing it, but there are some things you should do  I mean one of the risks to Ukrainians using group chat and channels is  account takeovers  Where you know the one of the things that Russia really perfected as part of their propaganda strategy under Surkov who was who was?  Putin's you know sort of Minister for information for a long time was  Making it so that there was just so much wrong information  Flooding the zone that people gave up on knowing what was truthful altogether like Surkov for many years funded many  Opposition groups that were extremely effective at  raising  Opposition to Putin and then he announced after several years of this that some of the opposition groups that were opposing Putin were actually  Funded and controlled by him and didn't say which ones so that everyone who is in any  Opposition group now did not know whether they were on the right side and the whole idea is to just make it so you give  Up on knowing what is truthful you just assume that it's unknowable

We don't we sanctions harm everybody  I mean as you point out if they had access to the App Store they could download signal instead  They've got to figure out how to use telegram  securely  It's it doesn't seem like there's any good solution, especially  It's you know what this brought home to me  I was watching a video of I think was a  Drugstore in Los in Los Angeles where somebody just went by in the counter and started taking stuff  And they're like what are you doing dude? They just took stuff and they went and he left  He's got a mask on you can't he didn't have a gun or anything  He could just he did be intimidated and I realized how important norms are that we think we think we're safe  You know we think well, I've locked my door. I'm safe. No, that's a norm  It's easy to kick down a door or break the glass and that's just that's just a statement. Don't come in, please  It's a norm and we rely on norms and when somebody like Putin is completely willing to bypass norms  We're like those drugstore clerks who go.

I had a tweak of fairly viral last week and I  Buy all of my knives through through Russia actually  it's this guy in Russia, he's a traditional blacksmith and  he goes through and he he hammers the ingots my hand and and  Refines it and carves the handle out with it's just absolutely beautiful process and his whole living is  Making these hand-built knives and selling them on Etsy and I got this really really emotional  Letter from him along with all customers did last week and he was saying look  I know what these sanctions that are about to be announced in Russia that  My entire business that I built here is about to be absolutely destroyed and dismantled  You know, we we get by on this on basically sales to the rest of the world  And you know, he begged everybody to go ahead and place orders while they could  so he would be able to basically use all of that money and  Send basically a bunch of rations to the Ukraine  He talked about how he felt tremendous guilt because one of his workers had actually supported  Even though as a teenager the annexation annexation of Crimea a few years ago and  You know just really he talked about how he'd been arrested for that and how he himself expected to be arrested any  Any day now and I wanted to know what y'all think like, how do we feel about you know companies like PayPal?  like facilitating stuff with that seat to kind of  Not get around these sanctions but helping you know the individual Russian people  That are going to be inadvertently harmed by these sanctions  No matter how we do it like if these sanctions are going to be harsh enough to actually, you know have consequences  Yeah, I don't know the end game.

Transcript:  I mean you were talking about norms and their importance and one thing that I that I've been thinking a lot about is kind of  American political journalism in the era of Trump and how  norms based reporting standards  We're showing to be a complete crap in the context of someone who was willing to break through all norms  And so we're not in fact, people who break the norms win

Transcript:  But but to what Brianna just said about sanctions and their impact and so forth. I  The lens the rich I'm trying to view individual decisions by companies and governments when it comes to sanctions is whom does it impact?  And then how much and so in the case of the Internet the core was talking about earlier. I  Agree with them  I don't think it would be useful to try to disconnect Russia from the Internet because it would be ineffective and it would also harm  Individuals much more than the state so that's kind of how I'm trying to think about what's effective versus what is essentially kind of political  Greenwashing but in a political context versus an ecological conduct something like EA saying no more Russian teams in our FIFA game  Yeah, I don't really care. What will want EA is like the evil empire of the video game world  It's like good job guys. You're slightly less evil this year, but like to me that that's just  Posturing versus taking actual action. So the PayPal decision has much more weight to it  Yeah, right. So that matters more impacts more people and then therefore we should really think about it  Um, but just to make sure that I clear about this  Here for for your game Ukraine opposed to Russia get them out and so forth. So I'm not going to be sympathetic

Transcript:  Again, I you know, I would say that if you wanted to get there, I wouldn't start from here, you know  Think about how but that doesn't help Cory. That means it's too  I get it. I get it  but again the right time to have done this is 20 years ago in the second best time is now and if you think about  how many different  regions domestically and abroad that  pose these kind of chaotic problems for a  decent-carrying pluralistic solidaristic society are also places whose economy is  Defined by a hole in the ground surrounded by guns, which is you know oil natural gas  Mineral extraction and so on, you know, they're there I  Think that there is a political  Current that runs through economies that are defined by extraction because they don't really need to have  Everybody kind of pulling their weight in order to enrich the richest people like you you don't need you know  if you think about say Finland right where where  you know when they switched from from  Like a pretty you know rural  Resource-based low low intensity economy to a high-tech economy and Nokia went from making rubber boots to making phones  They suddenly in order to like thrive as a nation  Needed to have a lot of educated people  Who could who weren't just chasing their next meal and it could stop and think and be creative and do all that other stuff  Whereas if all you're doing is digging holes in the ground  And then shooting anyone who comes too close to the hole while you get whatever was in the hole out again  You just don't need everybody to come along for the ride. Yeah, and you know, there are exceptions  You know Norway doesn't look like that Scotland doesn't look like that  but the at home and abroad so many of our resource extraction regions are are  really politically sick and  You know we're on the buy side of what they're selling right and so  We have delayed a green transition a renewable transition for a long time  It's been really bad news just for you know, our children's future and our own future, but it's also been really bad news  Geopolitically right like and and it's not like it's a surprise that you know, the Saudis aren't great  Political allies to have you know and and we could have we could have done something about the necessity of making Saudi Arabia happy  20 years ago and we should have  To save the planet but also to like save our politics

Yes  No, and I was just trying to make a joke  By the same token just to be really clear. I think Putin's style strongman politics are downstream of a  Economy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I

Transcript:  I just went to add on to what you were saying Cory  I I saw a stat that really really surprised me coming out of Russia  I think it's linked to those kinds of extraction economics that you were talking about. Yeah, Putin is currently 69  the average age that many Russian men live to is  Basically a little bit north of 60 which really surprised me and a lot of Putin's base of power  Actually ends up being women a little bit north of 55 because they look at Putin as somebody who will  basically  ensure stability  Whereas you know their husbands or the society around them because of those extraction economies, you know  They fell into alcoholism or they didn't get health care and died of a preventable disease and you know  It's that extraction economy has literally  Taken the stability of their their relationships in their lives away  And I think that that's part of Putin's success in staying in power is kind of reinforcing and saying look stay with me  I will give you stability. I have order. Yeah, I won't sure your pension will stay in place  So I think that that's kind of the flip side of this  You know even today as we're recording this visa and MasterCard have come out with some really really strict aggressive policies in regards to Russia  They're undoubtedly going to you know, it's going to disrupt that kind of  Social order that is keeping him in power  So I I do hope that maybe some of these actions by the tech companies can  Basically disrupt his his basis of support

I think it does destroy the myth and so I wonder if some of the dynamics that she was discussing  Will become unspooled by what's going on today? And that's why I am NOT trying to say, you know, no distinctions  No to aggressive corporate actions. Just let's make sure that they're targeted at  What matters versus just kind of what looks good on Twitter

Transcript:  There's a fairly brief period though in Russian and I'm no expert on this strikes me  There's a very brief period in Russian history  Going back 500 years where you where the normal person has had any say in what's going on has had any prosperity even after  The fall of the Soviet Union. There was at least a decade of intense poverty and and difficulty  I remember being in st  Talking to somebody saying, you know, it wasn't so bad when I didn't have to worry about the rent  You know, I yeah, sure. I couldn't I had no choices about my work or anything  But at least I didn't have to pay the rent and you know, I pay stuff was provided for me  I think there is some nostalgia for the Soviet state. It's only a brief period of time and then my wife was saying well  Okay pre Soviets. What was it as well as it was czars. It was it was serfdom  there's only there hasn't been a long history of  Of people being able to live their lives  Without being under the boot in and in Russia and you know in that period of

Transcript:  Kind of neoliberal shock therapy after the wall came down the mortality among men was so high, you know  Working-age men was so high and it was mostly alcohol and violence related  It's really hard to overstate how destabilized the country became and of course there have been multiple crashes of the ruble as well  So whatever wealth people did manage to save was wiped out repeatedly and then there was just rampant gangsterism  so my great uncle and aunt my great uncle ran was the curator of the pop-up museum, which was the equivalent of the Computer History Museum and  they got a little money from my grandmother and opened a dry cleaner and  One day they literally got a phone call from a guy who said hi. This is the crime  Gang the Mafia  Your location is very good  It's now ours and if you ever show up there again, we'll murder you and then they didn't have it anymore  Right. And so that kind of instability  combined with you know, massive wipeouts of whatever wealth you saved and  Completely  you know unstable and and  Unreliable pension system really I mean has people in a bad place and you know  It is one of the things that paves the way I think for strongman politics  You can see parallels to  the rise of Trump and people's concern about instability and and  The insufficiency of the social safety net and just feeling insecure. It's feeling like their kids and their own lives are bad

Transcript:  Conceal which is living standards and I'm thinking about  The United States into the the Trump era if you will as Corey just pointed out Russia into this current era and then also China  In the last 15 20 years what happens when living standards start to plateau?  it does seem to be that you end up with a strongman type person either getting to power or  Taking advantage of a chart of distraction what's going on?  And so we've seen an enormous crackdown in China in the last couple years as they're dealing with population issues and a lot of  Other problems as well Russia kind of capped out because their oil economy didn't have legs to grow forever  And so now we're here having Putin kind of shake things up and then we had Trump in the United States based on what Corey  Pointed out earlier.

Transcript:  Yes  I'll say first I'm a guinnet. I'm a guinnet  All you have to do is look at that fire in Ukraine that almost created another Chernobyl to know that nuclear power is not designed  To survive everything. Okay problem number one second. We get a huge amount of power from the Sun  Every day there are very good technologies for converting that into every bit of energy we will ever need  I don't think there's any reason to flirt with something that is potentially dangerous  When there is there are so many good choices in renewable energy right now  I understand nuclear has the one benefit of zero emissions, but I don't think that makes it the right way to go  That's just me.

Transcript:  I'm generally pro. I think that  Yeah, one of the things I saw running from Congress is I was really surprised that there were a  contingent of people that were really really really anti nuclear power  Just just as a blanket statement and would not vote  here in Boston based on any other issue and  You know to me, I think if you really drill deeply on energy policy  All of it except for renewables gets really really messy very very quickly  Do you know who's opposed to fracking in a really aggressive way?  Puddin because so much of the it undermines natural gas exactly  100% so, you know, I think the reality is sometimes when we talk about politics  We want to wave our magic wand to pretend we can create these systems from the from the ground up  I think rather than that  It's a series of singles and doubles that kind of move us in the policy direction that we want to go  So to me the question is, you know like here in Massachusetts  We use a ton of natural gas to heat our homes would move into something at nuclear be  Be a step forward from an emissions standpoint. I think so  So I'm in favor of anything that moves us in that direction  Though obviously as Leo was pointing out a pure green energy policy would be much better

I don't think that it's  Insurmountable to build a system to manage and regulate them safely  I just don't trust the system we have to manage and regulate it safely and in part  It's about when the case of nuclear about the actual history of nuclear like so the recent and long-run history of how nuclear is managed

So it presents all of these things as engineering  Parameters like here are the number of photons that strike the earth every day. That is your maximum theoretical solar  budget right here are the ergs exerted by the  Moon on the earth that is your maximum tidal budget and then here's how much carbon we think we can have and here's what we think  Happens with each half degree and how much carbon gets you and like here is the most theoretically perfect airplane  And how much energy it needs and so on he's like you just need to move the sliders around  You have to decide what your priorities are and then you come out with an answer

Maybe you guys can put it up here  It's all Griffith who's you know, lovely chap is the one the MacArthur Prize  He wrote a book called electrify that came out last year about a clean energy transition and although he favors nuclear  he says that  It's politically too hard to make happen  And so we should do a green energy transition without it and then he says it's possible  So he says it would be easier with with nuclear except for the political hurdles  And he says that you know as between like convincing people that they're wrong about nuclear and saving the planet from catching fire  We should just focus on saving the planet and we don't need to convince people about nuclear to save the planet  So it's a it's a very very good book. What's the name of it again?  It's called electrify an optimist playbook for our clean energy future and I I paste it into the chat  I don't know if you can get that which chat did you paste into that zoom chat?

I'm gonna I'm gonna take a break and and we'll figure it out, but we will post we'll post it in the show notes  Anyway, I am so thrilled to have you guys. There's still lots more to talk about fact  We've really barely scratched the surface, but this was a great conversation and actually something that I've been trying to understand myself  So I'm glad we could talk about this Cory. Dr. O is here  His his website you've got to subscribe to his newsletter pluralistic dotnet. It's a lot of fun  It's great reading at dr. O on the Twitter  Alex Wilhelm from a tech crunch at Alex on the Twitter and  Of course Brianna Wu who's no longer space cat gal. She's actually using her name on the Twitter like a grown-up  executive director of rebellion pack  Dot-com Elden Ring speedrunner  We'll talk about that later  Our show today brought to you by Nereva. We're getting back to work. It's so cool  In fact in a couple of weeks, we're gonna have an all in studio  Twit for the first time and I think a couple of years  Maybe you're starting to get back to work. You've got your your video conferencing room  But there's still some concerns  You you want to have good audio for your conferencing because there's still some people working from home probably always will be  Maybe you still want to have some social distancing  So you could put in a traditional conferencing system. First of all hugely expensive. Why is it expensive?  Well, you got to have you got to design it. You got to bring in engineers to measure and design it  There's all these mics and speakers. You got to put in DSPs  It is a complicated  Thing to do a traditional conferencing room  And by the way, even after you install it it cost you because you've got to have it recalibrated all the time  Look, the industry has been ready for some time for a better way of doing your conferencing a better way of audio and conferencing  And that's Nereva Nereva created the revolutionary  microphone mist technology  It's it's like a sound bar. In fact, you can see it on the screen if you're watching the video  It looks like a sound bar. It's got one or two  integrated microphones and speaker bars  You put in one or two integrated microphones speaker bars in a room depending on the size of the room

You can face any way you want  Everyone can be heard clearly everywhere in the room meeting and class participants. Just talk move naturally  Socially distance if they want there's no microphones to clean no wires  Everybody's hearing everybody  It actually transforms the conference call and thanks to continuous auto calibration  Your rooms are always ready with optimized audio  Nobody has to come in with a decibel meter and measure or anything and the installation you could do yourself if you wanted to  It's a 30-minute DIY job. If you ever put in a sound bar, it's that easy. That means big savings on time and cost  We just have Burke do it. That's that's all and the management you'll love this your IT department will love it  Anyway, you get an Arrava console  Which gives you the power to monitor manage and adjust the system  Anywhere you don't have to go to the room. You have to go from room to room  So if you have many rooms this IT will love it  Look ask yourself  Do you want to go with that old-school system that really doesn't work that well and is very inflexible or do you want to try something?  Modern do you want to go with a costly?  Complicated traditional system or make the leap to simple and economical  You got to take a look at Nereva save money get better sound  Everybody's happier and you are  Ev a Nereva dot com  It's so easy to do go look at the website. You'll see Nereva. We thank Nereva so much for supporting  our show this week in tech Nereva  dot com I  Was I was telling you before the show Brianna I wanted wanted into Michael our 19 year old's  Game room and he's playing Eldon ring on the PlayStation 5.

And and when will there be when will there be that game that everybody wants to watch?  Maybe it's back for blood. The neat thing about these zombie games is the co-op mode, right?

End time: 3804.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So on your on your eSports point  I think we've already reached the point of kind of eSports maturity because one thing people kind of forget is how old League of  Legends is now League of Legends is a game that I played in college and now I'm going bald  so like it's been around for a minute and  And the way the way that I think about it is it's kind of like the NBA like the NBA is an enormous deal  I have friends who watch basketball religiously. I'm on group chats with them  They send memes that make no sense to me and they're rabid fans about it  And if you don't watch basketball, you have no idea and somebody it's kind of established some people know about it  But like no one watches it

Start time: 3862.78
End time: 3865.90

Start time: 3866.68
End time: 3920.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of my point that if you look at fighting games the problem with fighting games is they've gotten more and more and more  Complex over the years and if you ever watch an esports broadcast of Evo, which is essentially the  Super Bowl of fighting games. It's like who's the best player that year?  You almost have to have a PhD in fighting games to understand what they're talking about when it comes to like frame advantage  And things like that  One of the things on twitch that I think  Esports have really missed the bar on is that the most popular people that stream games on twitch are very  interesting  Personalities so it tends to be less about this very very high level play and it's more about these interesting  Personalities or your girls and hot tubs in some cases, but more about the people they're actually bringing you the content

Start time: 3921.18
End time: 3943.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's one form of esports would be twitch or the let's play content on YouTube that kind of right  Here's a picture of Evo being played in front of a live audience  Right for some reason this to me seems more like what it you know in an arena  What an esports but I guess it doesn't have to be that way does it?  I mean we were by far more NFL hours are what spent watching an NFL on at home and on a screen

Start time: 3944.44
End time: 3959.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  The problem I think with these sports in general is it's so stratified. It's so niche  Oriented it looks like the MOBA games like League of Legends or Dota 2 seem to have a very  They seem to be well suited to eSports  I guess because you have teams who can compete and you can see the teams and you can have personalities  But I think it's stratified together. Yeah, sorry Leo  Well, I just I think that that's the problem with the gaming in general is that the console gamers  You know the keyboard guys don't like to what do they call those controllers? Is that what they call them?

Transcript:  I was gonna say just isn't this the normal  Lifecycle of a game like I'm just thinking of Dungeons and Dragons, right?  Which just went through this, you know period of increasing complexity increasing complexity and then a kind of collapse  When they refactored the rules because they just realized that it's too hard had to yeah  The only way to be a D&D player was to have been a D&D player for 20 years  And they they were starving their pipeline and I just wonder if that's not  You know in the nature of all of this stuff that it just gets more esoteric a bit like, you know  if snowflakes are falling down on a snowbank, you know little bits of complexity and  Each snowflake is no big deal  But eventually the whole thing becomes so unstable that you have an avalanche and then you get a new stable  Configuration in the form of something very simple again, you know, so here's the here's the counter argument chess hasn't changed in a thousand years  You don't play three-dimensional battle chest  Okay

Transcript:  Some games have I don't know cuz they're perfect or what but they  It's interesting. I thought chess was gonna be over 20 years ago when a computer beat the world champion  Shortly thereafter there were there. It was easy to find on your phone a  Chess game that no human could beat. I mean, it's really gotten to that point. They're now  Just you know chess games with ratings well over  3,000 and no human is that high even Magnus Carlsen. So  And that has not killed the game interestingly. We found a way to coexist with the robots  We let them coach us and we work with that

Start time: 4097.90
End time: 4111.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's closer to like Super Mario the original SS SMB on NES, you know  Like this is a good game, but it's still religiously played today by speedrunners because of the historical importance

Start time: 4111.86
End time: 4123.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you made it a new game with the speedrunning right? That's a different 100% Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  So you're playing the same game, but it's a different goal. I I think that in chess what has happened

Start time: 4123.12
End time: 4141.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not a chess expert  but I what I've heard has happened in chess is there is a new kind of play which is when a human and a  Machine learning system play against another human in a machine learning system. They call it the centaur play  You know where you're half person half machine and that that apparently makes for a really challenging and interesting game

Start time: 4142.64
End time: 4194.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it. I have not seen that I mean, you know, I we just had the world chess championship, which was between two humans  Couple of months ago and that was played  So in fact, there's very strict rules and it's a real problem in chess of cheating with a guy goes up and goes to  The bathroom looks at his phone that comes back in place. But  So there are very strict rules to prevent that from happening  nevertheless a lot of the preparation almost all the preparation and  A German play and stuff is done with the kind of human machine interface  The machines are very very good at finding the best move  But it's not often it's often not an intuitive move or a move a human would make  It's it's really interesting actually to watch this happen  It might give us some insight into what the future  Holds for AI in general and an AI human interaction in general.

Yeah  No computers ever had good hair in the history of computers  But he brought personality brought pizzazz to it if you will and I think that's helped chess grow because personalities combined  Hear me out personalities combined with skill based sport are what drives  You're exactly right

Transcript:  And writing a piece of metal down. I have to say I beg to differ on whether computers have ever had good hair  so  In the old days, you know when when I was a smoker and my ex had a long hair main coon and  All of that was ingested into my mouth  I would open it up once a month and remove a kind of  nicotine stiffen dreadlock  That was an inverse mold of the inside of my computer  For certain values of good hair that was pretty good hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fair enough. Um, I did on the points about rules getting more complex inside of a game and having that make it less fun  I think the NFL is a great example of this because now whenever a player makes a catch they run 40  Oh, it's to see exactly where it's crazy. It is so boring. Yeah, so yeah

So the referee is no one's making value calls  Yeah, essentially if you make value calls the sports very different  So like an extreme example, this is like competitive drifting  Which is all just judged kind of like how well you did and like skating and so forth chess is kind of the other end

Start time: 4328.72

Transcript:  I want to ask and really get you guys to weigh in on this because I have I've really been struggling with this  So if you look at democracy overall  Democracy is really struggling  worldwide and there was an Atlantic piece that really went into detail about kind of the tools that  Authoritarians are using around the world to kind of you know subvert democracy and slowly take it over and a real  commonality with those tools is they all involve the tech industry to some degree whether it's you know, manufacturing consent or  propaganda or mass surveillance or  all these different tricks and I I'm going to ask you guys so do you think that I  Have long been of the opinion that we should have to get to Corey's like we should have done this 20 years ago theme here  But we should have had discussions about how the things we were built were going to affect the society around us  20 years ago and I kind of think what's going on in Ukraine right now is is really an ultimate example  of  How the lack of foresight in the tech industry is is fundamentally putting democracy at risk? It's pretty human

Transcript:  Are you willing to give up that's the much my question like cuz Leo you're describing it because stuck with electric cars and they had  Very short ranges and right sure. She was expensive for more expensive back then and also that power has to come from somewhere and we would  Have burned quite cold to generate more power for it  So would that have helped and also the the internal combustion engine is incredibly useful bit of technology that we've gotten a lot of  Benefits from costs. Yes  And so when Brianna raises her very very fair point and I think was well said my fear is that if we began to be  More cautious there's a risk of becoming overly cautious and I know that I'm taking that the capitalist side of this  So I'll take the stick for that but like  One I don't think we can look far enough to really see to I don't think  Society will slow down enough in a capitalistic democracy setup  Which is the only way that I can kind of think to run things and three I think you wouldn't be able to kind of figure  things out so

I mean, you know, Cory did a great church, you know cause-and-effect chain  Over the past 20 years, but that's an all in hindsight  There's no Harry Seldon out there yet who could say well, I see where this is going  And even if there were the political will to forgo  the benefits of the you know of  fossil fuels or whatever  Certainly is like we don't have the political will to hardly anything  Yeah, we know the world is about to be engulfed in flames  The latest IPCC report is dire

I've this is why I tried to end the last segment with something positive  like the return of Western liberalism and  The greening of America, but I guess you guys really want to go down that right the rabbit hole to spare  I think Brianna raises a really excellent point and and I think that's a really good point

Start time: 4689.72
End time: 4716.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Excellent point and and I I think that the only way to to tackle it is to break it up into different sub questions  Cuz like the should we should we have thought harder about what we were doing with tech?  Obviously the answer is yes  but like which parts and what role does tech play in the disintegration of democracy is something that I think  You can't just use the unitary phenomenon of tech to analyze that you have to actually break down different functions

Transcript:  So like let's say social media. Let's say Facebook

Start time: 4720.64
End time: 4970.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not so I would say that like there are three questions about Facebook and other forms of social media  So the first one is what does targeting do?  the second one is what about group formation and the third one is what about persuasion and  Persuasion is the one that I think we lean on the most and is the least credible the least plausible  So the tech giants go out there and they say we have invented a mind control array to sell your nephew fidget spinners  If you pay the premium that we charge for surveillance advertising  We promise that we can change people's minds and bypass their critical faculties  And then there's a certain kind of tech critic who goes yeah that mind control rate that they invented to sell your nephew a fidget spinner  guess what Robert Mercer stole it and made your uncle a QAnon and  And I don't think that there's much evidence for it  You know  I think we see Facebook doing things like they did this experiment where they they exposed 60 million people to a stimulus they predicted would increase voter  Turnout they got 300,000 people to vote which sounds very impressive more than they thought would and it sounds very impressive until you realize that  It's a 0.39 percent effect size and elections are not decided by 0.39 percent margins  But even though that's not a very convincing piece of evidence that Facebook can alter our  Conduct it is in fact very compelling evidence that Facebook is run by the kind of donkey that performs non-consensual  Psychological experiments on 60 million people and they shouldn't be running a goddamn lemonade stand  So I'm not all that worried about the persuasion part which leaves this other question  Which is if it's not persuasion if it's not that we're bypassing people's critical faculties  How is it that anti-democratic and other odious ideas spread?  And I think that that is the function of targeting that you can find people  Who are because of their material conditions predisposed to believe?  Conspiratorial accounts of the world and so I don't think that that's like that they're like genetic fools  I think that it's like if you've if you've lived in a region that has been heavily destabilized you've experienced serious losses  You're traumatized you don't trust the institutions that were supposed to protect you because they failed you then you are in fact disposed to hear  explanations for what's going on that don't  Include a necessity that you believe that those institutions are well run when you know for a fact that they aren't and so I think  Targeting is a thing that you get with advertising and I think that it is a way that that all of this stuff  Has been very salient in our politics and then the final piece is group formation, which is kind of like targeting  We are now at this moment where if you have a minority or fringe view  You can find other people who hold that minority or fringe view and in many ways that's amazing, right?  We live now in a moment in which things that were illegal and living memory  It's now considered a shame and a stain on our moral character that  We ever thought that they were wrong, right?  like homosexuality or smoking pot or you know a whole long list of things that that  We've had a complete reversal of our views and the way that we got there was not by people who held heterodox views standing up  And demanding to be counted  It was by people being able to speak their truth quietly to other people who they thought would listen and forming groups quietly in  Private so that they could then stand up and speak their truth together  And you know if you're a kid who's never heard the word trans, but you know  There's something different about you  You can type some search terms into your favorite search engine and you can find the words for who you are  Right and you can acquire the vocabulary and the community to describe it and you can go out and do it now  The same thing is true. If you believe that Jews secretly run the world  And join those people right and so that has also been incredibly salient to our political fortunes  But in a different way and in a way that I think is more of a mixed bag  And so I would say like, you know in terms of like the Mary keep kill of these three things I would kill  Targeting I would basically just make fun of persuasion and I would really lean into  Understanding and refining group formation and and trying to figure out ways to put your thumb on the scales for forming groups that are socially beneficial

Transcript:  There's something to that but you know, I don't know how you distinguish that from like I'm really interested in carpentry  So I watch a carpentry video and then I discovered that the kind of carpentry I'm interested is in joinery  So I watch one of the suggested joinery videos and pretty soon you're building bonfires  Well, it's pretty soon you're like looking at Japanese nail less joinery and then there's one kind of joint and then you've joined an esoteric  Community of people who just care about this one joint like I don't see how that's very different from any of the other so-called  Radicalization that's fairly benign though. I mean, but it's the same thing, right?  It's all it's doing is it's directing you down an esoteric pathway  From a very broad category to the narrow one that you're more interested in and I don't know that it's persuading you so much as exposing  you

Transcript:  I was just gonna say I think that generally speaking not talking to you specifically Cory, but I think there's a kind of  Idealism that has has really permeated the tech industry where we kind of tell ourselves that these things we build are neutral  and that it's not having long-term consequences and kind of wash our hands of it and I  really did used to believe that and  I just I've really come to believe that we've we've been information  Idealists when we need to be information realists the whole time and I I feel like  What is going on right now is a really solid example of that. Yeah, you talk about like  Pratt's regulating or tweaking the the edges around the algorithm. I don't know what you know, what?  Institution is supposed to bring those changes to the forefront  I think the core thing that's kind of rotten here  If you really want to get down to centrality is is the culture of the tech industry where we we don't have a sense of morality  Or ownership over the things that we build. I do think the engineers we don't have  Ethics that we think about the same way that a lawyer or a doctor  Might tend to think about that. It's good in many ways, you know, you can go out you can build an app  You can ship it. You don't have to worry about without any licensing that opens many doors  I think the dark flip side that we've really  Kind of just said we don't want to think about or hold ourselves accountable with is that there's a the things that we  Have built are increasingly really destabilizing the world is certainly destabilizing the democracy here in the united states  And I I just I I wish we had thought about this much more. It's clear twitter is a lot more fun without the russian trollbots

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think we're mostly in agreement there, you know  I'm all for thinking through ethical precepts when it comes to your your technological choices  What i'm specifically saying though is if you like me think that the tech giants are corrosive pathological liars  that it would be  Pretty weird to assume that the only time they're telling the truth is when they claim that their products work really well  And given how thin the the evidence is for for that those products working well, right for for for persuasion working  Well png dropped its hundred million dollar google ad spend and saw a zero percent change in their sales  Wow, so if that's the case, right if that if if it's just a con  Which I think it it is and I think one of the ways in which the tech giants are corrosive is that they're con artists  then  it is not  doing the tech industry's job for them to  Discount the power of algorithmic persuasion  It in fact is striking at the heart of their business because all of their money comes from the faith-based belief  Among advertisers that they can do algorithmic persuasion  Well, I think it's time to do a little ad before we go

Transcript:  I just want to say I don't agree with you cori and this is why one of the big projects we did rebellion pack over  The last year is we went out we got the voter list  And we did a project where we wanted to get people to go vote people that had not  voted before in a primary people that only registered to vote for donald trump  And we went out and we specifically targeted them. We found out really  Excellent information on what motivated them to get to the polls. We showed them pictures of schools in their neighborhood  And we really precisely and algorithmically tailored  what they saw  about the issues  And and served them ads that were just really really dialed down and created to appeal to them  I then ran those ads to them with a control group and an experiment group  And then I went and saw who actually ended up going and voting  In the actual election and while I don't know specifically who they voted for I have actual data  I can show you this that shows repeating those ads to people over and over  Objectively made them far more likely to go out and vote. So, um, I just don't agree with your summation of the data  And the studies there

Oh not another diet  We're constantly bombarded by this.

Transcript:  So what happens?  Is that eating is there's a lot of psychology in why you eat. It's not always for hunger  It's not always for energy. It is often and certainly in my case for emotional satisfaction  Uh, I do a lot of what they what noom calls fog eating. So noom is a psychology based approach  That helps you change the way you think about food think about health. It doesn't say change your lifestyle  In fact the weirdest thing when I first started doing it. I told my coach you have a coach you have an app  By the way, love the app you have little lessons. Uh, there's a there's a uh, a food log  Which is a very important part of it. You also have a group  So there's a lot of support around it  But I told my coach I had a hot dog last night and I was so surprised that my coach said that's great  I said, wait a minute. That's a bad food. She said tia. I love you tia. She said that's there's no bad foods in new  It's all just food  Right, and that was huge for me

Transcript:  Well, that's the best part when I joined it with you  The number one thing that hooked me in was I saw a candy maker in a commercial say he eats candy every day  And he's maintaining the way he wants and I like my sweets. So I went okay  So what's bad for me? Nothing's bad for you. Everything is moderation. It's your personal choice  You get to choose why you're overeating  Yeah, maybe see that's the thing everybody's a little different. Well for me, it's like stress eating ghost eating. I tend to be  Less mindful when i'm stressed out, but my most part i'm not aware of it. I just stuff my mouth  Yeah, but this is it's easy and nothing's off limits. So everything is your choice  You get to make choices every day  And I have been maintaining my weight for a year now and i've told everyone it's easy  I have like 10 friends that have lost weight on newm and they love it  And I don't think i'll ever stop just because it keeps me accountable newm does not believe in restricting what you can or can't eat

Transcript:  What newm's doing is is giving you the knowledge and wisdom you need to make informed  Underscore informed choices that help get you closer to reaching your goals. They're using  psychological  Principles like cognitive behavioral therapy so you can better understand your relationship with food build sustainable habits  And this is there's ups and downs. That's why newm says it's about progress not perfection  Seven the good news is 75 percent of newm users finish the program  Uh, not everybody's gonna lose 80 pounds like bryana did but boy when it I mean it works  It really works. It's it's completely grounded in science  They have published more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles to inform users and practitioners  And scientists about what they're doing how effective it is  It's empowering. It's not stress inducing. It's not guilt. There's no guilt  There's no feeling bad because that just makes you eat more. You know that we all know that  Uh, you know fear of ruining your whole program with one off day newm helps you get back on track  Do you decide how newm weight fits into your life?  Not the other way around the the the readings are quick 10 minutes a night. I  Got more than you. I don't know why lisa you'd be done and I'd still be doing my well, that's cuz I'm on maintenance  So I get like oh, that's why that's why I just love this. I love them. I'm about knowledge  I love knowing why I'm doing it and that helps me  Eat more healthily. I and I have really changed my habits start building better habits sign up for your trial  I don't know how else to say it you're bombarded with these, you know diets and so forth.

That's right  Don't even it's not like Frank ate a pizza at the movie the other day and I just had no desire to eat that whatsoever  It's it's just it's it's it's building a habit and changing the way the things that you have  You look great.

You know, no one's gonna go use, you know, like the freeware versions of it  My automatic can't you you can but the problem is it's so poorly maintained  It just is not a good. That's interesting. So so my point here is  We all agree Apple can do the hardware for this  But as far as getting 3d professionals to bite the bullet and in and go all in  And develop things for Apple. This is a really big lift  You're asking them to know Swift you're asking them to go through and start learning  Apple's like graphical API's which are it's just not a workflow that is the rest of the industry standard  workflow, you're really asking people to move over into Apple's walled garden and  Ask yourself how successful that has been with the games Apple is bringing to market go look at Apple arcade  They've got some cute stuff there. It's fun. It's a certain floor of quality  I'm happy to pay for it every month, but there's nothing there that's gonna compete with  Elden rings, right which is built using a more traditional. Is it on unreal? What is it? Or does it have its own engine?  I would guess it's unreal just looking at but I don't I don't know offhand  My point here is apples walled garden is going to be a barrier to getting widespread  Adoption from the very professionals they need to build content for this is so that explains something

Yeah way before the best of them was Fido Fido net  I ran a Fido BBS with not one, but two phone lines in the in the mid 80s and  and in fact we were doing an early version of a  Global messaging system called echo net on top of Fido net where it was kind of a store-and-forward mail system  And it was really interesting exciting times.

And he would just have to explain that like although the conversation is happening in your living room for you  The person who's having that conversation with you is not in your living room  Like you you just need to think read back to norms  You need to rethink your normative framework for this discussion that we're having

I wrote a demon down. I'm still convinced. It was the first  multitasking program ever written for the Mac  I use the vertical blank interval when the  Electron gun goes from the bottom to the top of the screen to start dying again  There's a brief few milliseconds that the computer can't do anything that you can grab and say stuff the  ATT command into the motor one character at a time  So it's stuffed the command and it's tough the phone number in and then it would stuff the dial command and then every  Vertical blank 60 times a second would check to see if it was a busy signal or if it was ringing and there was a  Hayes command for I got through and then would make a big  Got through  It was called Q dial. It was purpose-built. It would only dial my bbs, but  What's that?  Nevermind forget, you know, so let's talk about the framework laptop this poor kid here. You never heard of a guys. I'm 32

Transcript:  So in the old days  So this is actually really relevant to the discussions we have about things like Facebook today about whether we should like break them up  Or just try and make them behave themselves  So for 68 years the FTC and the DOJ tried to break up AT&T and AT&T kept hitting these new leases on life  by  Offering to try and solve the problems they created  So they would like do universal service to make up for all the co-ops and small businesses that they put out a business with predatory  Conduct and and one of the things that that would happen is every time they would become more  Central to safety and security is they would get  More power to control their competitors and one of the things they got was the right to decide who could plug things into the bell system  So the first layer of this was they had the right to control mechanical coupling to the bell system  And they went after a company that sold it was called hush a phone and they sold these cups that went over the receiver of  Your phone so that you could talk into them like this  And people couldn't read lips or hear you and they argued that by making a plastic cup that fit over your phone  You were endangering the Bell system and thus America's public safety and security apparatus  They lost that case  But they retained the right to control electric coupling to the system until Carter phone came along and Carter foam was a gadget for  ranchhands and what it would let you do is plug a walkie-talkie into your phone with an acoustic coupler and when your phone rang it  Would transmit it to a walkie-talkie on your belt when you were out in the barn or out on the range and they argued that the  electric coupling of the  Because there was a way to detect that it was ringing and take it off hook that the electric coupling was itself  Another danger to the system and once again that the courts told them to go to buzz off and that  Opened the door for modems answering machines PBX's  Just like all kinds of things that we plug in the sports sports illustrated  complementary football shaped phone all of those things because prior to that  Their subsidiary Western Digital was the only company able to make phones and they were able to do all kinds of really abusive things  Like you couldn't buy a phone  You could only lease it and then over the course of your lease you might pay for that phone a hundred times and as late as the  2010 there were still customers like old people who were still leasing a Western Digital phone that they'd had for 60 years and  Paying like ten dollars a month to lease a phone whose retail value at that point was less than one dollar  You know and and and they were still making money on on this  So yeah  it was Carter for was this turning point that ended all kinds of predatory scams that were endemic to  Having a regulated monopoly instead of you know breaking it up and making it weaker so that other firms can compete with it

Transcript:  He's a really nice person  Like in real life. I'm I could not say a single bad sentence about him I  I do think it's worth  Pausing in thinking about what the consequences of this are for the rest of the industry and we have authors here  So I don't want to like explain how the book industry works for the audience  You know you have really big names that sell a ton of books, right? You've got the Stephen King's  You've got the James essay Corey's  They are the tentpole people that put out a product and you know  It's gonna make enough money that the the publishers and the editors and all the other people that work in book publishing are  Able to you know make more bets on smaller books most of which are gonna fail to make any money  Whatsoever and at the core what you have here is one of the most independent names here  One of the most successful names here that say you know what I'm gonna get around the whole publishing  Industry part of this here. I'm gonna you know I'm gonna print the books myself. I'm gonna pay for the warehouse  I'm gonna ship it myself, and I'm just gonna eat the entire you know I'm gonna  Vertically integrate the entire process and get this out and keep more of the money  Yeah, the truth is that the Brandon Sanderson's of the world are able to negotiate a much better deal than someone who?  May not have a successful track record in in publishing  Already and I just worry that in a future where everyone does this  What does this mean for the entire publishing industry overall?  I think it would be very bad for it  So you know where read like authors on Facebook that are just really bitter towards Brandon it comes across as sour grapes  He's a he's a fantastic author that delivers for his audience and deserves all the success in the world  I just think it's worth saying that the people that work in publishing which are overwhelmingly women  This is an industry that Amazon has been wildly successful at  stripping the profits from it more and more people are working from lower wages and  You know the advances for starting authors are getting lower and lower, and I think this trend is gonna accelerate that

Transcript:  I'm gonna get Corey's comment on this but before we do I should explain because I don't think we've explained  Brandon Sanderson during kovat was busy scribbling away and wrote four novels in the last two years  went to Kickstarter  Started a Kickstarter to buy copies of these books and various swag boxes  Planned to get a million dollars over 30 days within a day. He had 15 million  He's up to twenty four point eight million and twenty four days to go  and of course except for the  Cut the Kickstarter takes that all goes into his pocket  So that's all minus his production costs and what he'd cover a cost to print the book and so forth  So it's a pretty interesting thing  But what about Brianna's contention that that undermines that the if these tent poles pull out the whole thing

Start time: 7859.56
End time: 8048.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Collapses, I mean I I think that there's it's definitely the case that large publishers  Benefit from having these winner-take-all authors under their under their wing  But you know as an author I think the thing that  presents the largest risk to negotiating leverage and our ability to do well is is not  Whether or not large publishers have access to tent pole books  It's concentration in the industry overall and up and down the supply chain. So there's one distributor left, right?  They bought out their their major rivals. So it's just Ingram. There's one major online bookstore  There is one major national broken brick-and-mortar chain there are only four major publishers left  And then in other parts of the sector, for example in screenwriting  There's there's four major super agencies that all decided that they were going to start taking big chunks out of their writers  And using something called packaging fees that sparked a four-year writer strike that just just ended  Successfully with for the writers and I think it's that lack of competition. That means that you just can't shop around  I mean definitionally when you have a  Buyers market right when there are more sellers than buyers  Buyers don't have to work as hard to attract the sellers and acquire what they want  And it's true that those tentpole authors can write their own ticket and it's always been the case that those tentpole authors can write their own  Ticket, I mean nominally all writers get the same royalty rights  They are standardized across the industry and across publishers  But the reality is that big name writers will often get paid an advance that is impossible to earn out  So they're being paid in advance against the royalties  They'll eventually earn but the publisher understands that they will never earn out that advance what they're effectively doing is a backdoor  Higher royalty rate for those for those writers  So it's always been the case that those big writers have had extra negotiating leverage  But for little writers, I think the thing that that gives the most negotiating leverage is just having more places to sell your books  And you know, there is some empirical basis for this  So my co-author on this book choke point capitalism that beacons publishing in September is a great Australian scholar called Rebecca Giblin  She's copyright scholar and she worked with the Australian author society to do the largest ever empirical analysis of  Publishing contracts where she got anonymized publishing contracts for some really large  appreciable fraction of all the books published in Australia and kind of in modern history and  Was able to use those as a data set to really empirically trace the change in  authors advances and in the royalties paid out and and you know things like how many other rights you have to sell to sell your  books or whether you get to keep your audio rights and sell them separately or what have you and  She found you know that that the strongest correlate of declining fortunes for authors is market concentration  Not you know the profitability of the firms. In fact, the profitability of the firms is  Moves inversely to author compensation because as the firms become more concentrated they become more profitable and they pay lower advances  So it's it I don't think that simply making the firms more profitable gets authors a better deal  If we're gonna get authors a larger share of that money the firms have to be competing for the authors

Transcript:  So the word the word you're looking for here is monopsony  Which is when there's a concentration in sellers rather than buyers  That's right. And you know doctrine for 40 years has been that we don't have to worry about monopsony  We just have to worry about monopoly and monopsony effects are much more sharply felt the models show that  When when there's a buyer that accounts for as low as 10% of a single sector that they can start distorting  The whole structure of the sector and so, you know when you think about Amazon with with 40 to 50 percent of trade book sales  And 90 percent of audiobook sales through audible. They really are able to squeeze everyone  I mean audibles embroiled in this audible gate scandal now where the independent authors that  Had signed up for audible and in many cases were locked into not selling anywhere but audible  Now because one of them is a forensic accountant and got sent some real royalty statements by accident and not the fake ones that they've been sent  They reckon that more than a hundred million dollars has been stolen from independent authors that way stolen  Just in wage theft pure wage theft just just just miss accounting for royalties Wow, because you have to take their word for it  That's right.

It's a bit like the BBC  Hoping that you will have a separate BBC app for all your podcasts  Audible has achieved a situation in which if you want to listen to audiobooks from someone else  You have to have a second app  You can't just take your audiobooks and put them in another app the the way that you could it'd be like if you had  To have both pages and word on your Mac in order to read word files, you know

Yeah. Yeah  so yeah, I've got a lot of experience up and down the board, you know more than 20 books and  You know, I I really think that  The hardest thing for an author right now and this is something my agent says every time I talk to him is  There's just not that many places to sell your books. And so if you don't like the terms that are being offered by your publisher  Chances are they're the same as the other three publishers the other three major publishers  But if they're not and the other would the other publisher has slightly different terms won't take your book isn't interested  You're out of options and you know, there's a bit of solidarity opportunity here because if you're an editor and you don't like your working conditions  There's only three other employers for you, too  And so, you know that there's there's a degree of solidarity here between writers and editors

Yeah, and then the publicity and PR and just the best use of my time  So I did a short story collection called with a little help  that Frank did the cover for  That did pretty well, I mean a short story collections are not going commercial concerns  The most short story collections draw advances of you know, a couple thousand dollars and sell a couple thousand copies  They're not they're not a big deal. It's not a major moneymaker  although it's a thing I quite love and buy a lot of and and read a lot of and so with this one I made about  But it took me as much time as I would have spent writing a novel that would have made me mid six figures  So it just wasn't it wasn't worth it, right?  It would it was a it was a lot of work for a modest amount of money  Whereas I could have done  The same amount of work and gotten a much larger amount of money and you know paid for a year my kids college tuition

Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know the I think back to what Brianna was saying earlier  I think the people who were early advocates for Internet freedom  Get a lot of stick some of it fair some of it not about not pondering  Whether just connecting everyone to the Internet would be good for it  Yeah, I you know, I think people like people don't start organizations like EFF if they if they think it'll all be fine  So I think that you know, there were certainly some people who were worried about the long-term consequences  But what I think we all did miss was that antitrust law was dead  You know that that Reagan the last the last hara of antitrust law was breaking up AT&T in 1982  Microsoft with 95% of the operating system could not be broken up  And you know, it just went downhill from there and now you know  the web is five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four and  It's it's not it's not because that was inevitable. It's because we took a policy choice  to allow firms to grow by buying their competitors and  By using access to the capital markets to do predatory pricing to prevent third parties from entering the market  And as a consequence they were able to build up these things that venture capital is called the kill zone  Which is all of the businesses that big tech is in and all the businesses next to those businesses and no one will invest in those

It's going to be so much better  We're going to democratize wealth creation across the world and you look at you know, the way they do it with uh,  Biden what is it called? Uh robin hood flow. Yeah, robin hood all these forces wage inequality is getting worse  You look at the game industry. It's like when steam came out you're like, oh now we're not going to be  tied to these publishers and you can buy a game for wherever and indy people can come forward and make games whenever they want  And we look at how much you know smaller b-level games are made are making today as well as indie publishers and oh actually  The entire system is getting worse. So i'm just saying there's a pattern of us  Oh, yeah into things and thinking about very idealistically  Fast forward 10 years later and everything like the kitchen's on fire

Start time: 8515.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So i'm just saying and what I what I would say is that's completely right and I would go even further and say that  It's not just that we failed to understand that this would happen in tech  But that it would happen across the board as a result of not enforcing antitrust law  Which is why there's four giant shipping companies  Who no one can regulate which means that when they just try to realize economies of scale by building bigger and bigger ships  Eventually one of them gets stuck in the suez canal and when that happens they socialize the losses  And they privatize those gains and you know  We have one company that makes all the eyeglasses in the world and they also own every  Eyeglass retailer and the largest lens manufacturer which makes more than half the lenses and the largest insurer  It's a an italian french conglomerate called luxottica esselar  And there's like one cheerleading league that is price gouging every cheerleader and there's one wrestling league  There's two brewers and there's two spirits companies  And there's you know, four giant finance companies that are able to structure whole economies. It's across the board  And so, you know again back to this thing. What did tech miss?  I think the thing that tech missed is the thing that a lot of us missed which is that when we removed the  When we removed the things that stopped firms from growing by access to the capital markets  We created a dynamic  Where if rich people would give you money  You could just end up owning a whole market and no one would compete with you and rich people like that idea  Because once you did own the whole market you could extract monopoly rents from your customers and monopoly concessions from your suppliers

I do think that centralization  Of corporate power is an issue  The thing that I get sad about is just the fact that there seems to be absolutely no redress for it  Yeah, because congress is effectively owned by different corporate interests and um, it's an embarrassment to the system  However, and i'll just say this again  I am a capitalist and I don't see a better way to organize things other than fighting back as best we can against  Centralized corporate power and against the perversion of democracy by money.

I think that like if they would just promise that algorithms would promote  You know trump content forever  Uh, then then you know, they would lay off facebook and twitter and they'd be done with it  But you know the the the there is like there are six amazing  Focused structural reform bills going through congress. The best one is the access act  The digital markets act is in the trilogues in the european union. I even the chinese cyberspace law  Uh breaks up big companies requires them to allow interoperability and also prohibits them from blocking interoperability  Which is also something in the dma  It's it's pretty dope i'm going to i'm going to a conference in brussels that charles river associates is putting on  at the end of the month that um with a bunch of these people  including like vestager who's running this in europe and  You know, they're charles river associates are the 900 pound gorilla the monopolist if you will  Of providing economic support to antitrust cases and you know there they've figured out which way the wind is blowing  It's pretty amazing

It's so good  Yeah, I mean graber he coined the term, you know  We are the 99 percent and he wrote bullshit jobs and he wrote um, uh debt the first 5 000 years  Really incisive anthropologist anti-authoritarian and then wangrove his his collaborators are really accomplished. Um,  Archaeologist we we lost graber during the pandemic. He just he died after he finished the book  Yeah, just after finishing it we were on a live cast together just a couple of days before he died it went so fast for him  and but it's what a what a legacy that he's left it is such a  challenge to the idea that there are inevitable ways that humans end up living and that really like the historic record really supports that  There's every arrangement you can imagine has existed over extremely long time scales in relatively stable ways including ones that would you know  Make you want to take a bath and ones that would make you think that there's no way humans could be that good and egalitarian  and kind and and  anti-authoritarian and um and that therefore it's a choice right like there's nothing inevitable about any of our social arrangements  We've had technology and then we thrown it away. We've had technology used it one way and had technology and used it a different way  um, there's no there's no  Determination about living in cities or having agriculture or having steam power or having a certain kind of metallurgy or  Living close to people who are different or living far from people who are different or living on a horizontal landmass or vertical landmass  All these things that people have said inevitably determine how we live  Just turns out that we live however, we choose to live and that it's really like their human agency  Um is the final determinant of the caliber of our society and it's the most hopeful message for this moment  Especially and it's so beautifully written. They're so smart so funny and so brilliant

Yeah whole civilized the regions that we thought never had settlements  We're finding evidence of of settlements going back thousands of years different multiple different distinct  Civilizations with different patterns we're able to understand a lot about them and and that's I mean, that's a science and technology story  But it's also an anthropology story and an archaeology story. It's fascinating  Really amazing and yeah, they take a lot of aim at uh uval and they take a lot of aim at steven pinker and at um  jared diamond and guns germs and steel and they just say that these these just so narratives  That basically say we are in the world that we were inevitably going to be in and and kind of  There's no there's no choice and really kind of you should abandon hope of changing it  um that those are that those are wrong that like  Everything is changing everything is up for grabs if you want a more perfect world and you could imagine it  We could probably make it happen  It's just a matter of figuring out how to get other people to buy into your vision  But there's no there's no inevitable collapse or no inevitable fracture line that will tear it apart
