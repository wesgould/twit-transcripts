Transcript:  I love the word crack-a-lackin. And we've got Patrick Norton, host of AVXL. Hello, Patrick.  Hey, pleasure to be here.  And we've got Norm Chan, co-founder of Tested.com. Norm, you're one of the hardest working people  I know in tech, so I'm happy you could join us.  Oh, thank you so much for having me.  We've got a ton of news this week. I don't know what was going on in the tech world,  but things just started piling up and Apple had a bunch of news. But I wanted to start  with the biggest thing and probably the biggest news for all of humanity, which is the first  round of pictures from the James Webb Space Telescope. And I assume you guys have seen  these things. And by this point, by the time you're listening to it, you've probably heard  it explored all over the place. But I did want to take a chance to take some time to  hear what you guys thought about this first set of images. I'm a space nerd. I grew up  when I was a kid, I would go to the library and just check out every single massive space  photography book. And there were pretty much all Hubble images. So I guess I'm a Hubble  kid. But it just kind of got me back in that place of thinking of my place in the universe  while watching these things. What did you guys think of what we've seen from James Webb  so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never know if I can trust NASA because you see what they released to the public and it's  always so photoshopped and they do post processing on it to like enhance the saturation and all  of that. And don't get me wrong, everything they released is beautiful. It's awesome.  We're talking Star Trek motion picture vibes of like the whole universe out there. But  there's always like a small part of my brain that's going, okay, but what degree of this  is like artists interpretation? Is that too cynical? Am I being too cynical?

Start time: 254.10
End time: 292.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that is probably a good thing we're noting too, because when I was a kid, I did  not realize like how much processing even went into some of those Hubble images as well.  All right. But that is worth noting. There is a lot of data we've gotten here as well.  There was what some spectrum data from an exoplanet. I don't have the specifics in  front of me, but we learned that it has the first of all, we kind of knew it already had  water, but it has clouds. And that was kind of an interesting thing for astronomers to  hear. So yeah, clouds on exoplanets. So we are going to learn so many things. Patrick,  norm. What did this base? Did this the space images blow your minds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  easy to find. Yeah, and that's the one where they kind of show like I get I get where Brianna  is coming from. But part of me is like, there's two places I have any functional, like remaining  ability to have any sort of sense of suspension of disbelief. And one of them is watching  movies. And the other one is like looking at space imagery. So you know, this was kind of  like, wait, is this the difference between the data that's coming in that they're enhancing  and just the idea that it's that much better to use highly sophisticated technical terminology?  You know, I'm just going to be delighted and be charmed. And we'll see what rolls out of it.

Start time: 358.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stream. Those are always fun to that was much more fun than the press conference. And I think  a little bit of anticipation following it, you know, having one window with the TV one window  with the science Twitter and everyone freaking out that was brought as much joy, almost had that  vibe of like, you know, of rocket launch, right? The anticipation we knew things were going to  turn out. All right. It wasn't like in the very first Hubble blurry images that they had to  correct because there's no shuttle that's going to go up there. But the to see the they were so savvy  with releasing those direct comparisons and now people have now done you know, animated gifts to  show transitional it's it's enhanced. It's Star Trek right there in the astrophysics lab and  Picard saying enhance and we're actually getting these, you know, much sharper, much higher  resolution images. And that's not even taking into account how fast that they can actually  capture this. So just the order of magnitude in terms of efficiency. That's super exciting.  And the fact that this is going to be rolling around for 20 years that we're going to get

Start time: 416.60
End time: 482.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  images like this. That's super cool. And yeah, it is the I think it is the amount of work and  data that this thing can spit out because this these images, which are some of the most  astounding things we've seen, including the deepest look into into deep space we've had  looking at the galaxy cluster smacks 0723 looking at light from over 13 billion years ago,  close to the formation of the universe. This information, this is one week's worth of data.  This is one week's worth of work. So just imagine what we're going to learn as this thing  is is going to be trucking for hopefully 10 years, hopefully longer. There was already  a meteoroid strike, I believe on one of the mirrors, and they were still able to,  to, you know, get some really usable data and dealing with that. There is no way to fix this  thing. If anything goes wrong, it isn't like hubble, like you mentioned, Norm. So we're all just like  hoping and praying now that James Webb kind of kind of keeps going and produces more interesting  data. What are you guys looking forward to seeing from this? Because this is like, you know, this is  humanity changing science we're getting from this machine.

Start time: 484.82
End time: 523.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think all of us like the thing we're most interested in is our nearby planets habitable.  Are there signs of extraterrestrial life? I mean, like insights into gravity. I mean, all the things  we do this, this big, bold science for that you really need, you know, government funding to,  to, you know, basically advance, advance humanity. I mean, I think that's what we all want to see.  I have to admit, like when I'm, when I'm reading some of the coverage of this, and you hear like,  according to astronomers, this is like, this indicates water is in this nebula. I'm like,  how on earth can you tell that from so far away? But I will take their word for it,

Start time: 523.54
End time: 572.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because I don't have a PhD in astrophysics. Yep, we were getting a lot of spectrum readings,  which tells us a lot that's from what I know. You all. So I also co host the gadget podcast,  and we had a great guest on to break that down for us, Lisa Grossman. So she covers a lot of  space news. So you can hear more details there. But in terms of broader things, like, I think we  are expecting more information about exoplanets. And to me, that's really exciting, right? Because  conceivably, these are things we could visit once we get some faster space travel, and it could tell  us a lot more. And it is wild that we only we've only known that exoplanets have existed,  or at least have proof of them since like the mid 90s. Right? So it is just sounding like how far  we've come in terms of that data. It's all just beautiful stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I'm really looking

Start time: 572.62
End time: 634.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  forward to just kind of the, the most maybe second level effects. You know, you're talking  about the Hubble photos that we all maybe growing up saw in, in textbooks. And I don't know if  textbooks are what kids these days have. But there is going to be no page. Exactly. Right. So  it's not like there's no page with a PPI, it's gonna be dense enough to cover these images. But  the kids today, they can they can enhance as much as they want, because of how they're going to be  learning about space. And same with like, you know, writers and storytellers, and how there's  this wonderful virtuous feedback loop of like the stuff that comes out of research and what NASA  provides can help better inform and, and change the ways we consume astronomy through maybe  pop culture and science fiction, right? You know, like, like how black holes represented,  for example, in science fiction today, all changed the past 10 years based on new information. And I  can't wait for the writers of Star Trek to take all this data into account and come up with creative

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we could get all sorts of things. You know, there's a, you were talking about like, will we ever,  I think extraterrestrial life is the thing and that a lot of people are excited about Brianna.  And, you know, like that, that is something I've talked to a lot of scientists and people working  in space news as well, like journalists, people are still excited about that. Like it is like the  kid in them is coming back out because of this. We will hopefully be able to detect all sorts of ways  to see if we can find the life on any of these exoplanets. We can't tell if they're intelligent  or not, but potentially signs, potentially methane, potentially something. Let's hear some alien farts.  Let's, you know, detect some alien farts and that'll tell us a lot. We've got a lot of news to,  you know, let me, let me just sit here. Let me see.  I'm just laughing.  To move on from alien farts.

Transcript:  I'm reconciling, I'm reconciling like unprecedented levels of interstellar, you know,  gas between the stars and, you know, the alien fart humor that you just dropped.  And I'm just sitting there and I'm like, well, if any telescope is going to do it.  Webb's going to do it. I'm seeing the pictures here.

Start time: 731.36
End time: 794.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And speaking of alien farts, let's, let's talk about what's happening with Elon Musk,  because that was a big thing. That was a big topic during last week's swit.  And, you know, I feel like the, if the aliens are watching anybody on earth,  they're seeing what Elon Musk is doing. We've learned more about his crumbling,  you know, Twitter deal or the deal that he's, he's slowly trying to back out of.  So listen to the last episode of this week in tech for more on that.  But this week, we learned that Twitter is suing Elon Musk for saying that he's going  to be backing out of the deal. There's a lot of coverage about Twitter workers saying really  nobody's in charge right now. And last I saw the last news that I saw is that Elon Musk's lawyers  are now saying they're trying to block the quote unquote warp speed Twitter trial over his $44  billion deal. I am frankly tired of talking about this man and what he will or won't do.  But you know what we have? This is news. This is news. And maybe we can like,  put a pin in this for a while. What do you guys think about these latest developments  about the Twitter deal and Elon Musk?

Start time: 795.02
End time: 939.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy. I have so many thoughts about this. You know, I, first of all, I really think that  all respect to my friends that work in media, but I think the analysis of this has gotten  way too complicated in many ways. Like look, Tesla stock is in the toilet. It's down by many  measures. His, you know, his, his net worth is worth 30% less than it was when he initiated this  deal. And I think it's straightforward at this point for him to complete this deal. You know,  $54 billion is an astronomical sum of money. And the amount of Tesla stock that he would have to  sell to do that would, would just be more than he wants to pay. You know, he tried to get Silicon  Valley to fund it by going to them and making some really wild promises about, you know, how  the, the number of users was going to increase with his plan. Things that just, you know, even  VCs they're looking at and go, this doesn't seem tethered to reality here. You know, this is a man  that respectfully, I think has played very fast and loose with the rules. If you read the lawsuit,  you can read like it's the most human readable lawsuit I've ever seen in my, in my life. It  talks about Elon Musk just being cavalier and destructive and how he's conducted himself,  which is part of why, you know, Twitter shares have really been damaged by this whole fiasco.  So I think this is very straightforward. You have a billionaire that no one has ever really said no to.  And you have him running head first into the situation with the Chancery Court in Delaware,  which I'm sorry, they move fast. They don't have trials. You have judges looking at this thing.  They don't even have opening statements in that court. And Elon Musk is, I believe, going to find  out the hard way that these contracts actually mean things. Now, I do think at the end of the day,  they're going to reach some settlement. I don't think it'll be one billion. I think it'll be  closer to five or $10 billion. But you know, this is a man like if you look through the history of  how he's run Tesla, and how he's made promises on everything under the sun from Tesla supercharger  networks to full self driving cars to even funding Tesla at earlier periods where they were in a  cash crunch. He's just had smoke and mirrors there. And I think he's finally going to get a

Start time: 939.54
End time: 962.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reality check that is is is eminently called for. Brianne, I think I think you have a really good  point. It does seem like he this is the way he's kind of lived his life. It seems like he's a board  billionaire. And you know, everybody has toilet thoughts. Everybody tweets on the toilet, right.  But when it's Elon Musk, it's like, it is business cat. I think I should buy a Twitter, you know.

Start time: 964.70
End time: 995.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes me wonder what echo chambers are like, like, you know, there were reports of when he  first made that offer of, you know, other billionaires egging him on feeling like, like,  you know, it was in their political interests to do so. And so he has the voices in his head,  the voices on Twitter that he finds pleasure in interacting with. Certainly it sounds like the  bots were something he like, it affects him because, you know, that's that's what the that's what  propagates whenever he tweets. And I don't think buying Twitter is going to

Start time: 995.70
End time: 1002.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's probably a large part of his following on Twitter, too, you know. So the thing he's  complaining about is the thing kind of helping him to seem like a thought leader. Yeah.

Start time: 1003.30
End time: 1034.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think they're gonna throw him in jail, right? It's going to be a  settlement of some kind, maybe more than he wants to pay. But it's about how he's going to spin it  to make it a grievance or make it, you know, make himself the victim in this and that kind of  reinforces his acolytes and his followers and the people who back him. So I think in some way,  he's going to come out on top, you know, kind of reinforcing the messaging he wants to put out  there. But I'm happy that he's gonna be parted with at least probably a billion dollars at some  point. I don't think he had the judge he wanted either. Yeah, I mean, there was a breakup deal,

Start time: 1035.64
End time: 1074.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the breakup fine that I think was in the initial deals around a billion, right? So  we don't know what this is going to end up being. But for me, the main takeaway is that man,  Twitter's board and Twitter's leadership just really kind of were jumping on this deal  immediately, right? Because it did seem a little too good to be true. But the speed with which they  just kind of gave up on it. And, you know, what's his face? Twitter CEO Dorsey was just like, Yeah,  I'm out. I'm done. You know, or at least like, it seemed like everybody was quick to pay out rather  than like stand for whatever Twitter is supposed to be. I mean, when you look at like Tesla stock

Start time: 1074.40
End time: 1159.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  price, right beginning of 2020, I think it's $86 a share. And, you know, at its peak, it was like  1200, you know, in the 1220 $1220 $1220 a share, you know, now it's dropped to $923 a share,  you know, the market capitalization of this company is like $750 billion, which is kind of insane.  It is a huge astronomical number. And, you know, this is a guy who already got smacked down by the  SEC for his tweets, I think in 2018, you know, where he literally has to have security lawyers  run certain posts he's supposed to put on Twitter, right? You know, I mean, the SEC is already kind  of like, No. And, you know, remember the SEC, I feel like the SEC could say no a lot more in a lot  of different areas. But this was so egregious, that they actually were like, you know, we're going to  put down a fine that would be really, really skull crushing if this guy wasn't worth billions  already, but it's going to be a big number that people are going to notice. And, you know, then  he turns around and it basically felt like, I can't say that word on a family podcast, but I will say  blank posting on Twitter. And then it kind of went from blank posting on Twitter to, you know, you  know, you were saying like, we're like, you know, a whole bunch of people dogpile on like, Yeah,  do it, do it, do it, hit him, hit him, hit him, buy it, buy it, buy it.

Transcript:  Some are more obvious, everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 1163.32
End time: 1372.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I hope you don't mind me saying, you know, my engineer friends who have worked for Tesla  and some of his other companies, there's a very consistent story that you hear with Elon Musk,  that basically he will wander into your department and he'll be like, guys, I've got this great idea.  Let's do A, B and C. And the engineers are just like,  okay, sounds great, man. And then they just kind of wait for him to go away and then go back to  doing the product that they're actually developing. This is a story I've heard repeatedly. I did with  fact check just one thing very briefly. I think there's a really common misconception that Elon  Musk can just pay $1 billion and walk away. That is not the case. So he waived his due diligence  on this particular lawsuit as far as going through and looking at all the financials,  making sure it sounds he actually way he was moving so fast, he waived his right to do that.  So that $1 billion fee is only if both parties agree to it. At this point,  Twitter's stock, what is it now? It's $34, I believe it's somewhere around there from a high of,  you know, it's gone down a lot. There's a lot of material damage to this company.  So there's really no reason for Twitter to insist on that $1 billion fee when they are entitled to  so much more. Just one more really, really important point that I want to make, and I hope you  don't mind me sharing a personal story on this. So what I find so interesting is if you read  the lawsuit here, they go into great detail about why Elon Musk is like, he's immature,  he's handled this badly, he's conducted himself in ways that hurt Twitter publicly,  he has not acted in bad faith. Let's sell him this thing that we've built, spent decades building.  It's really ironic that I think of Twitter as a social media network that is really essential  for the public interest, right? So much of the conversation, especially around journalism,  is set on Twitter. And you know, you have the board that is trying to sell it for ultimately a lot of  money here. This is the personal story. A lot of my money is invested with Vanguard, which happens  to be one of the top investors in Twitter. They held a ton of stock. And when this news was  announced, I called them up on the phone and we've got enough invested that they'll take our call.  And I'm like, guys, I told them the story of GamerGate and all the work that I had done with  Twitter trying to improve trust and safety issues and harassment on the platform. And I'm like,  you guys are really going to destroy all of this work that I did if you sell it to this person.  And their answer was ultimately, we're going to do whatever we need to do to make money in this case.  And just think that's so sad that I'm not an anti-capitalist kind of gal, I'm not socialist,  but I think all the incentives here are not really aligned with us having competent management of  Twitter. I mean, how do you all feel about that? Absolutely take that point. I think that

Start time: 1373.00
End time: 1440.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Dorsey has said as much, right? There's he kind of his views of Twitter, which is kind of  blown beyond what he originally created for, but it's woven into the fabric of how we communicate,  right? And as a social network, along with all the other ones, like have become these essential  services for communication, but they're all at odds with how they make money and that they all  private companies and I don't know if that can ever be reconciled. And it feels like regardless  of how this lawsuit ends up like Twitter as an entity and as a service, like is going to be  worse off for it as it kind of is losing its relevancy. It kind of, you know, and it's,  I think fundamentally more important than like a tick tock, which is increases relevancy,  because of text versus video and the benefits of that. But you can see the audience shifting away  from Twitter and, but as it becomes more important for the people who make the laws and  who enact policy and who kind of run the world these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. It does seem like just existing as a public company is incompatible with  doing the right thing at times. Like what is right? Right is just making money, I guess.  Go ahead.

Start time: 1453.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. If you're a publicly held company, right is what maximizes shareholder value on a quarterly  basis period under discussion, right? I don't think there's anybody in this panel that's going  to look and, you know, come up with a long list of companies that made strategic long-term decisions  to benefit, you know, their customers and the product over not getting sued by a minority  shareholder, right? That's life in the 21st century with the publicly held bills in business.  It was funny because when Brianna, when Vanguard came out and started talking about Twitter,  I remember being like, oh my gosh, there's an adult in the room and they're pissed.  Right? Because I mean, literally, Twitter started speaking about this, or excuse me,  Vanguard started speaking about this and like, wow, Vanguard's got a huge amount of money tied  up here and they're really irritated because, you know, the stock value is going berserk.  On one hand, they can make a whole bunch of money and on the other hand, you know,  this could end up damaging Twitter. And to kind of look at, you know, it's, you know, anybody who's  worked for a venture capital funded company or any of a number of companies, you know,  in the Silicon Valley AuVoir where there's moments where you're like, we have a product,  we have a plan and, or if you've watched from the outside, you can be like, oh wow,  so that was going to be this really cool standalone thing and now it's a subset of an ad on,  you know, an app on some corner of Google or it gets purchased and disintegrated by Mega Company  X or they had a chance to sell out and management runs and then something else happens. And I think  for a lot of people, they were like, you know, they were in the Twitter minds, they're managing,  they're grinding through, they're dealing with all the issues. And then all of a sudden the  possibility of maybe all of those shares, you know, vesting and being worth way more than they  expected any time in the near future, like just sounded great. And, you know, I can also totally  see if there's, you know, any kind of, you know, acrimony internally in Twitter and direction that  as soon as people are like, Elon's going to come in and he's going to do all this stuff, and that I  can totally see internally all sorts of splits just starting to happen. And, you know, as somebody  who worked at a company that went through like multiple rounds of layoffs, you know, aligning  spending with a possible acquisition, I'm thinking of tech TV at the particular moment, it is really  hard to deal with morale where people are like, are we getting bought? Are we not getting bought?  Did the stock value just tank? Is the stock value going to be okay? What is going on here? Who's  going to have this? Did everything I do like, you know, Brandon put it, has everything we've done to  try to make this a less toxic place about to get flushed? And it's messy. And I don't blame  Twitter at this point. I can totally see them being like, we're going to maximize shareholder  value, Elon. Get your lawyers ready. Yeah, this is ugly and annoying and it's just gone on way too  long. And it's going to be really interesting to see how you know what how this happens. I always  love it when people are like, you know, we picked a fight. Let's move the fight to February next year.  Can we move to a couple years from now? Let's just delay this. And it's like, you know, you know,  Brianna Collins like, yeah, the courts have no time for your agenda. Good luck.

Transcript:  Maybe it's really interesting if you actually look at the legal team that Twitter hired here. I mean,  they are not messing around. And this is why, like, if you read all the expert legal analysis  of this, if you're a betting woman or a betting man, I mean, you know, Twitter absolutely has  the stronger hand here. And I understand Elon Musk need to save face and to say, you know,  this is about bots. This is about blah, blah, blah. And he can s post to his heart's content here.  But the bottom line is that contract is, is, you know, it is what it is. He decided to forgo  due diligence. And I think he's going to face some consequences here. Unfortunately, if it's I hope  it's a settlement. And can we can we have a discussion about this? Like, you know, when  Jack stepped down, like, as CEO of Twitter to go focus on Web3, which is a whole nother discussion,  you know, can we just admit that Twitter's new leadership is not the best? I don't have,  I do not have any confidence in the way the ship is being steered right now. The people I know that  work there don't have good things to say. And frankly, I think it's time for a new CEO and  maybe even a new board after this whole saga is over. Because I think they've had a hard hand  dealt to them. But I don't think they've played it well. Yeah, it seems like we are we are going

Transcript:  to see like a fundamental reshaping of whatever Twitter is. It is sad because I think we've talked  about this before on Twitter, like it is among the social networks out there right now. I think it's  the one closest to like, I don't know, showing us the full the full depth of humanity in a certain  sense. Like I've always thought of Twitter is like the way they talk about in the matrix, right,  just sitting down watching the code fall. And sometimes looking at Twitter is like, Oh, this is  just everything on earth at once. It's probably too much. And it's super toxic at times. But,  oh, man, have I made friends there? Have I learned a lot from Twitter? Like it is the thing that  keeps me tapped into the world. So you know what, hopefully, hopefully what you're saying is true,  Brianna, and I hope we get to reshape Prague, Agarwal is an easy. Oh, and yeah, I don't,  I've not heard good things. I know some people who work there as well. And things just seem really,  really rough over in Twitter land. So we're, you know, we're hoping things work out for the people  there and the people who are staying there. Anything else you guys want to add to this,  to this whole mess? Because I just want to talk about Elon Musk anymore.

Transcript:  It's, it's kind of hard to kill off in that. I mean, because Norm, you called out TikTok and,  and, and, you know, on one hand, there's, there's certain things where I can be like, you know,  contractor videos showing wiring, tree toppers, you know, technique for, you know,  tuck pointing brick, man, I am all over TikTok. But there's a lot of people whose information  who give me information or give me leads to articles to read that I get on Twitter that I  just don't really see, you know what I mean? Like do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,  you know what I mean? Like, yeah, it's not a show. It doesn't have to be a show. Yeah. Micron,  you know what I mean? Like it's, and it's, it's, I don't, I don't necessarily want to consume video  about this. Even super clever short videos. I just want to read, you know, this and decide whether  or not I'm going to get deeper into it. And that's been a challenge, I think overall media, right,  is so many platforms. Like, you know, it was like about 18 months, two years ago, I remember  reading things like our audience has demanded more video content and in response we've created,  you know, and they, they fire a whole bunch of the writers and they start producing video. And  yeah, I get it. They're responding, you know, the money in video looks better than the money  in banner ads and they have to move and they have to keep people, you know, paid. But on the other  hand, you're sitting there like, oh gosh, now I have to wait for a video to queue and launch and  get through the opening and oh goodness, you know, they're using the microphone on their laptop and  they don't have any treatment in their room and they don't have anything on the walls. And now  I'm hearing the giant echo and I just want to hear about what's going on with this thing. And  so I think it's all going to be messy. I think Twitter, I mean, people have been predicting the  death of Facebook, tweens are not on Facebook, teens are leaving Facebook because their parents  are there. And it's like, man, that Facebook just lurks there in the corner, like a gigantic  supermarket chain, like, yeah, yeah, we're dying. But they just, I think if I look, it's just going  to go on for a while. And if I'm completely wrong on this, feel free to mock me in the future.

I know many of us want Mastodon to happen. Mastodon is  not going to happen. It's just not going to happen for mass people. I'm sorry. I wish we lived in a  world where normal people would put up with bad UI decisions. Like I saw on majority report this  week, like someone came in and God help him. He's an engineer and I love him. Like he's doing  Linux stuff back in the nineties. And he's like, we're going to start these federated communities  and we can link Mastodons together and overcome Facebook. And I'm like, that's like, like,  that's how network effects work. Bless your heart. It's like, it's like, it's like free and open  source people. And, you know, when I ran for office, I believe in free and open source,  but it's this free and open source people that believe all software is going to be free and open  source.

Transcript:  Devendra for filling in for me. Leo Laporte here. Yes, I know I'm on a boat, but you know what I  brought with me on my boat? I brought with me my iPhone SE with Mint Mobile. You better believe it.  I love Mint Mobile. In fact, I hear from people all the time about how great Mint Mobile is, the  best coverage, the lowest cost. And now with the Mint Mobile Modern Family Plan, every line starts  at 15 bucks a month and you only need two people to get started, two lines to get started. You know,  those big wireless providers, they, you know, they're not human scale and they forget families  come in all shapes and sizes. That's why Mint Mobile decided to continue to shake up the wireless  industry with their brand new Modern Family Plan. Doesn't matter how big or small your family is,  you deserve to save on your wireless service. 15 bucks a month. What do you get? Well, you get  unlimited nationwide talk and text plus high speed data delivers on the nation's largest 5G  network. It's amazing. And it's the best rate whether you're buying for one or a family.  At Mint, families start with just two people at two lines. Now, what you should do is look at your  current phone bill. After you get over the shock, looking at that bottom line, look at how much data  you use every month. Then you can choose a Mint Mobile plan that's right for you. They do have  unlimited plans. I think for a lot of people, you're overpaying for data. You're paying for  data you'll never use. And Mint Mobile's Modern Family Plan is nice because you can mix and match  data plans. So mom might want $15, dad gets the 8G plan. I might want the 15G plan. You get to choose.  You can bring your own phone with Mint Mobile. In fact, they, unlike a lot of other carriers,  they'll send you a SIM for free. You put it on the phone. Now it's a Mint Mobile phone. You keep  your contacts, keep all that information on the phone. You can even port the phone number over.  So you have the same phone number. They also sell phones. That's where I got my iPhone SE for a  really, really good price. I think Mint Mobile is transforming the wireless business and I'm a big  fan. I tell everybody about it. Switch to Mint Mobile, premium wireless service, starting at  $15 a month. The new Modern Family Plan, a great deal, starting with just two lines to as many as  you need. Get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month, including the Modern Family Plan at  mintmobile.com slash twin. Mint, like that minty fresh flavor you get when you get your new phone.  Mintmobile.com slash twin. Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month. And I'm not kidding. For most people,  that's how much they pay. Look at your current wireless billing compare. You won't believe the  difference. $15 a month. Mintmobile.com slash twin. We thank you at mobile for your supportive  this week in tech. Now back to Devendra and the gang.

I wish  it were mastodon, but it feels like the the RSS revolution failed, right? With Google reader dying  and with kind of, kind of like having a way to sift through all of our media, I feel like Twitter  became the thing that was both information, you know, dumping on you. Plus you can actually chat  with people and, you know, make connections with people. I don't, I don't know what it looks like,  but I will certainly miss it if it if it leaves.

Later this week, have dinner with my husband and I just, I've made so many  friends like professional acquaintances there.

Transcript:  Yeah, part of me is curious about every social network, you know, for it to kind of succeed,  needs to find a way to have that reach to be shareable, right? I think one of the reasons  TikTok is so successful is because it's so shareable. They made it easy to build a link to  people just kind of swipe, swipe, swipe, consuming, consuming, consuming. And I'm less  interested about, you know, what percent of Twitter users are bots, as opposed to what  percentage of Twitter users are using in a way to find connections and meet new people and actually  engage or just want to click links and see links and consume content, which I know we all want to  do. But I think that's kind of that's that that feels like the thing, the push and pull  of the future of Twitter.

Transcript:  Well, it's funny, because YouTube, I was gonna say what YouTube is today is not what YouTube was  three years ago. It's not what YouTube was five or eight years ago, right? The the way the algorithm  pushes things is radically changed into the duration of videos, the type of videos they do.  You know, TikTok has already started to add longer videos. So it's going to be interesting to see how  that impacts and how their algorithm changes what you see and what you expect from it. Yeah,  I think it happens with every platform, you know, I would, I would, I would probably pay a monthly  fee to Twitter if they would just let me see everything in the order it was posted. Right?

You should not have to, you know, I would pay any amount of  money for that Twitter blue I thought was, you know, it debuted before Elon like announced it,  or tried to get Twitter, right? I was one of the people that subscribed to it because I love  Twitter, I want to give them money. But what are the things that they offered you for that? They  like some some ad free versions of articles from box. I love box media, I would love to pay Fox,  but that's not worth the money. And the basically a fake edit button where you can take back a tweet

Let's let's move on to another  platform that's having its own issues, folks. And that is specifically medium. Evan Williams,  the CEO of medium announced that he is stepping down from his role. He's, he's going to be replaced  with a new CEO. Medium felt like the company that should have been like the logical extension of  Twitter, right? Like, if short thoughts are good, long thoughts should be better, right? Except I  still don't think medium has any clue what it is. It seems like when ever Williams had several

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  clues. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Changing. Well, this is a guy who Yeah, this is a guy who, you know,  basically made blogging practical and then blogging was too long. So Twitter happened. And then I  think it was just like, well, maybe this is out of control. And I can actually handle following  100 people and getting 273,000 tweets a day. So I'm going to have long, thoughtful, engaging  content. And then I'm going to change the plan every couple of years, every 18 months, every six  months. I mean, you read some of these articles, and it's brutal, because it was like, and then we  did this, then we did this, and we did this. And mostly, it's like, as somebody, you know, who's  written or created video for, you know, it's just like, and then we did this to the content creators,  and they did this to the content creators, and we did that, we're going to pay you by, you know,  and it's kind of crazy when you look at some of the models, they were, you know, oh, if you get a  clap, you'll get paid. If you get more claps, you'll get paid more. And it's like, does anybody  know about the claps? I even, I don't think I ever saw that.  Sanyam Bhutani Are we Tinkerbell fairies over here?  Jeff Sarr Yeah.  Jeff Sarr You know, if it gets me paid, make me a Tinkerbell fairy. I'm happy. But, you know,  I don't think anybody ever got paid or it ever scaled in the way they wanted to.  Jeff Sarr It's kind of had a luncheon by Substack, right? I mean, and the whole direct audience

Because you kind of difficult to go from  free listening to asking people to pay, which is only the only really sustainable model at that  scale to Spotify, which started as a paid model and did direct negotiations with with with the  rights holders. I think it's the same thing with, you know, medium starting for you get the big  audience, right? But it's kind of long term, not necessarily sustainable, where Substack, you start  off with the paid model, and you can start small and grow from there.

Transcript:  Sanyam Bhutani It is. It is just funny, like I  reporter friends of mine, multiple ones of them actually have run into Ed Williams,  especially back when he started medium, and they would talk to him about it. And he'd be like,  uh, they'd be like, How's it going? And he's like, I don't know. You know, like, I don't know what  this company is. And that was, was it 2022? That was a decade ago. And it seems like they are still  kind of having the same problems. It is weird. The medium is essentially let's let's, let's make it  easy for people to write on the internet, as if yeah, blogger or WordPress or literally any other  tool didn't exist. So I don't know, do you guys have any love for medium at all?

Start time: 2681.36
End time: 2796.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I do. You know, maybe y'all haven't. Well, you wouldn't like come across this, but medium,  I have a soft spot in my heart for them just because every time there's a like, a big tech  event in San Francisco, there's always like a secret meeting for the women in tech like over  at medium that they'll hold, which I've always appreciated. I mean, that's very valuable space  during something like WWDC where you've been able to get contacts. So I've always been deeply  appreciative of that. Yeah, Norman, I do agree with you. This the difference between starting  with a paid model and starting with basically a blogging model, which everyone out there will  let you do. I think if you want to get to the really core thing going on, I think this is  something, you know, like y'all should be upset about, which is how hard it is for writers to make  money with the basically ad duopoly that's going on, you know, Google and Facebook.  Yeah, we have people like the human race overall is reading more than we have ever read before,  you know, just as a matter of time and hours and material, we're spending more time doing it. But  the amount like content creators are being paid for a CPM keeps going down and down and down and  down. And I see medium is trying to be a good steward of that saying, look, we're going to try  to like make a page, make it readable, make it easy to use, make it easy to link, and just running  into that reality that, you know, Google is going to keep and drain every last dime that they can  and keep it from themselves. So I really see it as like a victim of these larger market forces  that I think is bad for journalists and writers, in my opinion.

Start time: 2796.92
End time: 2814.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's not like it's not like I have issues with medium as a company. I wish it was  more focused, but it does speak to writing is hard, being a journalist is hard. It's media right now  is incredibly, incredibly difficult. Anything else you guys want to add to the medium thoughts here?

Start time: 2815.36
End time: 2885.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love how readable and how well presented that stuff and there's certainly incredible value to  that user experience. But I think it maybe kind of ties the thoughts on like TikTok is, you know,  of course, at first glance, my reaction as an internet old is, you know, this is scary,  this is new, this is different, it's too noisy. But there's a lot of credit to be given for how  those creators are taking advantage of those platforms and understanding the nuances of how  to create content for those platforms that I don't want to dismiss. And they put just as much  effort into finessing their content for those platforms. I think the same way works for texts.  And I love texts, you know, love reading the index ability of texts, I think isn't something  that video is going to be is going to be able to approach anytime soon. And it's been a problem  for video. But you know, one thing I think about in terms of like SEO and poor CPMs is how, for  example, like recipe writers, right, how they have kind of leveraged their format and finesse  their format to work with, you know, and kind of the unfortunate realities of poor CPM and  Google dominated landscape to survive and make money. And it's kind of a form of its own.

And it is really interesting to see like a whole new  medium, whole new medium, kind of form in real time too, because people are just learning about  it. So there's something exciting about TikTok. But it's also like, if you guys remember so many  of the like, some of the early Black Mirror episodes, I think like, was it 10 million merits?  Like one of those really early ones, that idea of super poppy, super like a platform where you  always kind of have to perform in a sense, TikTok is also like the distillation of all that. So it  is both like really compelling and kind of scary to me. Yeah.

Transcript:  has to be on it. But I also laugh because a friend of mine has a couple of nieces. He was like,  I went on TikTok and I was horrified. You know, and it literally sounds I hear Alec Guinness's  voice in my head, a villainy of, you know, a high of a villainy and scum, scum and villainy.  And I was laughing because I was like, I was like, I watched like an hour of, you know,  construction DIY and some diesel stuff on there earlier and a whole bunch of nature stuff. So  it's all keyword based. What exactly did you start searching on a TikTok that led you into this?  You're feeding it, right? You're feeding it. Yeah. Yeah. You're feeding the wrong wolf here, man.  You know, and that's what so, you know, TikTok is a really surreal place and that it really feeds  you what you want. And, and he was just, he was just kind of, I could actually feel him sort of  like leaning back on the phone, kind of horrified that he was actually responsible for generating  the, you know, if you clicked on this, you get this, you get more of this. And it's just the  way it works. They don't really care which creators are out there unless you subscribe to them. It's  all about keywords and stuff. And, you know, it, and it was, but it's like, it's, it's interesting  to watch, right? Because at some point, I think the rule of thumb at this stage is like, if the  olds are on there, then it's dead or, or you just happen to be a bleeding edge old. And it's, you  know, I, I enjoy a lot of videos in there because it's, it's fun to watch electricians show off what  they do and how they do it. And it also allows me to look around my house and go, oh, thinking  even more so than I was, you know, before watching, you know, 150 tick tock electrician  videos, but it's, it's, I mean, it's curious, right? It's also painful because, you know,  Brianna, you mentioned like, you know, the CPMs dropping through the floor. And in the last time  I saw it, I think tick tock is playing like what two to four cents, you know, for every thousand  views, like a two cent CPM, a four cent CPM, if you're part of the tick tock creator fund.  And so, you know, yeah. And so a lot of people are like, okay, I, I'm going to crash this very  broad net using YouTube, tick tock, anything else I can use. And then I will try to feed them towards  some platform where I can actually generate revenue, whether it's t-shirt sales, Patreon,  you know, Mike crafts, whatever it is. And it's been really curious to watch how this has evolved  over the last few years or the last couple of years. So I'm liking this idea. I'm going to

You know, while we're talking  about tick tock, like there, there were a couple of stories that we saw come across the feeds this  week. There was a report that nearly half of Gen Z is using tick tock and Instagram for search  instead of Google. They're just searching for videos instead of I'm not surprised.

Transcript:  I'm going to Google's own data. Yeah. This is just like, you know, how Facebook was the internet or  is the internet for certain parts of the world. Like they don't see beyond, you know, the confines  of what people are posting and linking. And this not, I'm not surprised about that at all. And I  think it speaks to when you say we talk about established publications or internet olds, like  us like, you know, afraid to move into the platform. There was just VidCon last month and,  you know, it was all tick tock sponsored and tick tock focus. And you had outlets like  Washington Post talking about how they curate and create their content specifically for the  platform. It's all very familiar about, it feels like 10 years ago when everyone was afraid to get  on a site like Twitter and now it's just normal. Amazing. So this was a Business Insider article,

Transcript:  right? They say 40% of Gen Z prefer searching on tick tock and Instagram. And part of that's  because if, you know, 90% of your time online is spent in tick tock or Instagram, you just search  inside of Instagram or tick tock, right? You know, and I will be honest with you,  if you're searching in certain subjects, it feels like the results you get on Google have  gotten worse and worse and worse over the last couple of years, especially, right? Because the  Wirecutter laid out this model where, you know, I search a lot for stuff in technology, around  technology, and there's some third parties that have come up for tools to sort of, they seem to  sort of scrape Amazon and create this word salad that becomes, you know, the top 10 projectors you  want to buy this summer. And, you know, and so places that have SEO and revenue challenges  are suddenly becoming, you know, our experts have picked the top 10 projectors you want to buy this  summer. And it's like Rolling Stone. And like, I got nothing against Rolling Stone, but I'm really  not looking at them to tell me that I need a, you know, like their third result was like a $200,  720p, you know, double A battery powered projector that could light up a 200 inch screen, right? And  it's like, all of this is this is this is false all the way down, right? And it's, you know,  and I'm looking at them like they literally are scraping all these different like, you know,  the lies from the vendor, the questionable reviews that are showing up that may or may not be,  you know, advertorial, and creating a guide and you're getting so much of this in your Google  results. I can also see people like, I just want to see really pretty pictures of whatever. And they  go to Instagram, they just search straight. It's like the people you know, who, who don't really  have the internet, they have Pinterest. And I have nothing against Pinterest, except that I don't  want to log in there. I don't want to spend a lot of time there. I don't want to deal with their  interface. But boy, you know, if you're searching for certain kind of home goods or paint colors  for your house, man, Pinterest is going to be filling your Google results. So I can totally  see why there's probably a whole category of Jen whatever that you know, does it 40% of the searching

Transcript:  in Pinterest, right? You know, it's, it gets even, it gets even wilder, because there's another  report from TechCrunch, kids and teens are now spending more time watching TikTok than YouTube,  which has been true since 2020, June 2020. Apparently. So according to data compiled by  the parental control software maker custodial. Let's see here by the end of 2021 kids and teens  were watching an average of 91 minutes of TikTok per day compared with just 56 minutes watching  YouTube. So that's just according to custodial platform. It's still that is, that's something.

Like, imagine like Stack Overflow, but it's TikTok, right? Like,  having memory flow issues need to get the garbage collection to come. You know, there's some  Unreal engineer to like a dance there to explain it. I like this. Everything should be TikTok from

Transcript:  here on out. Everything, everything should be TikTok. So maybe that is the future of media.  I don't know, according to my daughter, it is because it's the app she demands like right  before bedtime. So right before bath time and actual story time with physical books,  she eats a little snack and we watch just like, you know, 10 minutes of TikTok is one of her  favorite things to do every night and just to see her being raised on it. And my complicity in that,  I, you know, I'm still working through that guys. There was actually rolled out some features. Go

I mean, I'm thinking like my habit  as an adult of like, today is Sunday, Sunday is the day you sit down, read the New York Times Sunday  edition, right? Like, as you get older, your desire for more sophisticated, like experiences,  I mean, I'm not saying this to be mean, I'm saying like, I'm thinking when I was your daughter's age,  like I read a lot of Calvin and Hobbes books, and it's not to say I don't enjoy those today, but,  you know, your brain grows and you yearn for more sophisticated content. So

Start time: 3417.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just not sold on the idea. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the problems of our world right now could  probably be solved with Calvin and Hobbes philosophy. You're right there. You're right there.  I mean, talking about what's sophisticated and what's not, I want to call it a quick feature  that is, that is also going to start rolling out on TikTok, content filters, and maturity ratings  in a pledge to make the app safer. And that is one thing I noticed is that it is, you can go  into like restricted mode, which I try to do when I'm like going through feeds with my daughter,  and she's three and a half years old, you know, so there is, there is like, really excessive stuff  on TikTok. There's scary things are like scary little short videos, there's a lot of swearing  and violence at times too. And it's really hard to control against that. So even with the restricted  mode, we still get swearing, we still get some like creepy videos that I don't want her to see  before bedtime. So hey, more controls for all this content. I think I think that's something  everybody will want. So yeah, maybe your TikToks are going to get a little your TikTok experience  is going to get a little cleaner. Maybe we'll get more ways to watch them on bigger screens to you.  I think was it Samsung TVs or LG will like one of the companies has rolled out a TikTok app.  Maybe that is something we'll start to see more of too, because it's going to look awful on a  wide screen TV. But at the same time, I it's really hard to share TikToks. If it's not just  me and my daughter, you know, if my wife wants to join in, then we all have to like crowd around  the phone. So after a certain point, I don't know, that's gonna start hurting that platform.  But yeah, somebody on the chat, by the way, I lost your name. But somebody pointed out that,  you know, Twitter, Twitter killed vine and vine was basically proto TikTok. So it also kind of  shows you that the bad decision making has been going on for so long over at Twitter.  Imagine if vine was allowed to flourish and grow into, you know, an actual forest of content.  It could have it could have like, yeah, been a bigger thing before TikTok ever,  ever actually succeeded. So yeah. Any other thoughts on TikTok and what you guys are  enjoying on the TikToks? Like Patrick, I'm glad you're liking the the DIY stuff and the  really technical stuff. My daughter loves watching people build things. There's a guy who builds  fountains in China. And every TikTok is just like two minutes of him just like laying out the brick,  put it putting down everything, putting down the cement and like she she loves it. She just  watches them over and over again. What would you yeah, what are you watching, Patrick? It sounds  like you have a lot of fun things. Patrick Paulyar

Transcript:  for me? No, it's it's funny, right? Because for you, for you, my boys. For me, it's, it's been  interesting because on one hand, right, you know, Brianna, I have a I've a majored in literature.  I love to read books. I read a lot of novels, but in certain areas, part of me really enjoys  sophisticated television and part of me just wants to tune out. It's been fascinating. It doesn't  show up so much on TikTok, but on YouTube, there's amazing maker videos and watching people do the  technique at close range and figuring out how they're using tools, especially for sculpting  and modeling with TikTok. The quality varies immensely in with well, not so much in the quality  of the video, but but the actual like, sometimes you get like, I'm Bob, and I'm building a retaining  wall. And you're like, Oh, Bob didn't put down any gravel and he didn't tamp it. There's no drainage  and that retaining walls going to tip over and collapse on his really cool car. And in other  cases, you actually have professionals that are seasoned or it's like I said, a lot of stuff that's  fascinating for me is watching people who are trained professionals showing off what they do  and how they do it. And in other cases, you know, it's really fascinating watching kettlebell  exercises. And then I hear from a friend of mine who is a certified fitness instructor, like, yeah,  you got to be really careful who you follow. Cause some of those people have no idea what they're  doing and you're going to rip your hamstrings loose from your body. And I was just like, Oh,  okay, this just went from being an amusing entertainment to I'm going to end up in, you know,  occupational therapy. And I don't know if I like that concept. So it's hard, right? I'm, you know,  mostly right. I'm just happy my kids aren't on TikTok and I don't have to figure out the whole  safety resources for teens because apparently no one under age years looks at TikTok, right?

Transcript:  from our sponsors. I got to tell you every time, you know, in the past, I've gone on a cruise,  it's been eat, eat, eat, gain, gain, gain. This time is going to be very different because Lisa and I  use new weight and we love it. When we decided to lose weight, it's, it's, it's, it's usually not  just about the number on the scale. You want to lose weight for health, for looks, for variety  of reasons, whatever your reason is, new weight is there to help you. It's not a diet. Don't confuse  it with a diet. New weights, a psychology first approach that empowers you to build more sustainable  habits by helping you understand why you eat, why you have the behaviors you have so that you can  be in charge of what you're doing. I, for instance, am a fog eater. I don't even notice that I'm  eating and Noom taught me to slow down, to enjoy every bite, to turn off the phone and the TV,  stop looking at the newspaper, really to enjoy what I'm eating and it made a huge difference.  But everybody's different. Lisa has a different model. In fact, it was really, really cool because  I started doing Noom more than a year ago and Lisa said, I'm going to help you. She doesn't need to  lose much weight. She's, she looks great, but she said, I'm going to help you. I'm going to go on  Noom too. She loves it. She did in fact lose about 10 pounds, looks better than ever.  Noom weight has helped more than 3.6 million people lose weight. And just like me and Lisa,  every journey is different. Her lessons are different than mine. Your personalized lessons,  depending on your goal, the amount of time you want to spend with the lessons, it's based on  scientific principles like cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT. It really works. It's kind of  profound. And there is no bad food in Noom. And I love this because it isn't a diet. I remember  the first time I, I thought I fell off the wagon, you know, I ate a hot dog and I, you get a personal  coach, which is nice as well as a group. And I went to the coach and I said, I ate a hot dog.  And she said, yeah. So I said, well, that's bad, right? She said, there are no bad foods.  There are no bad foods. They don't believe in restricting what you eat. Whatever your health  goals are, the flexible non-restrictive program focuses on progress, not perfection. And one of  the things I learned from Noom is you can't feel deprived. You won't, it won't work if you feel like  I'm giving things up. You don't with Noom. You can choose your level of support from five minute  daily check-ins to personal coaching. You get to choose. I love my coach. Lisa loves her coach too.  Progress isn't a straight line and off days, totally fine. Noomweight helps you get back on  track with gentle support or whatever you need, the kind of support you need. And by the way,  this is totally grounded in science. Active Numbers lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks.  I lost more than that. 95% of customers say Noomweight is a good long-term solution. I'll  vouch for that. And I can tell you when I come back from the cruise, you'll see it works  because it's going to be easy. I'm really thrilled about having Noom to back me up on this trip.  30 peer-reviewed scientific articles published by Noom to inform users, practitioners, scientists,  and the public about how they do it and what the effectiveness is. So they have the science  to show that it really works. And I'll tell you what, I know it really works because it does for  me and it does for Lisa. Stay focused on what's important to you. You've probably heard about Noom.  You've seen their TV ads. Just take it from me. I've used it for more than a year. It really is  amazing. It transforms your relationship with food in a positive way. You don't feel deprived,  feel really good, really healthy. Noomweight's psychology-based approach really works. Sign  up for your trial today. Noom is N-O-O-M. So go to Noom.com slash twit. N-O-O-M. Noom.com slash  twit. Sign up for your trial today. You've probably been thinking about it. That's what  happened with me. I saw about five ads on the TV and I said, yeah, I probably should try this.  And wow, but in every diet in the world, this is the last one. It really, really works. Oh,  it's not a diet, but you know what I mean. All right. Now back to the show. I've got to get to

Transcript:  the buffet. Thanks, Leo. Hope you're having fun on the cruise. Be careful with that buffet bar.  This week, we learned about the Uber files, which is a trove of 124,000 documents,  company files delivered to The Guardian. And it was shared to a lot of media organizations around  the world. And it was also revealed that Mark McGann, a career lobbyist who led Uber's efforts  to win over governments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has come forward to identify  himself at the source of that. I'm reading from The Guardian here. The Uber papers basically show  that, especially early on for the past decade, basically, Uber was a relentless company when  it came to growing and expanding to different territories. They would basically ignore local  laws and do all sorts of tricks to really just get themselves up and running in these countries.  I was kind of heads down on reviews and stuff this week, so I didn't really see this news blow up.  But also, I kind of felt like we probably knew a lot of this stuff too, right? Like as Uber was  growing, I was there reporting on Uber and other companies. Like a lot of people were talking about  how this company was just flouting local laws and really just kind of bling its way into the  marketplace. Brianna, I'm sure you're somebody who's looking at this from the political side  of things. Did you have a response to the Uber files or was it just the stuff you assumed they

Start time: 4024.22
End time: 4163.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  were doing all along? No, it's certainly not what I'm assuming they were doing all along.  I mean, there's a pattern in the tech industry, right? We saw this with Facebook, we see it with  Twitter, we see it with all these large companies. And I don't want to upset anyone here, but I'm  going to tell you what I really think. When you build institutions and you have sexist hiring  practices and women are not involved from the beginning, you have products that are dangerous  to everyone that is not a very specific kind of person. And you know what I'm talking about there.  It is not a surprise to me at all that, you know, I read Super Pump, I mean, I saw the mini series  that the same guy that promotes this frat boy atmosphere to this company did not take safety  seriously. Look at the bottom line here. We're talking about not really doing background checks  on drivers. We're talking about trying to wipe this, sweep this under the rug when women are  sexually assaulted or raped or kidnapped in an Uber. And it's exactly like the succession plotline  where they're just trying to hide it here. And this is a pattern in the tech industry of building  these tools that are just flat out dangerous. And I really, I have to say this is my honest opinion.  I have spoken up, I have run for office, I backchanneled with these companies trying to  get them to make better policy. And I've really almost come to the conclusion that until it is  more expensive to do the wrong thing than the right thing, we're going to have this kind of  destroying machine just continue to exist hurting people. So I am cheerleading the women involved  in this lawsuit. I hope they make it so expensive for Uber to behave this way that they will do the  right thing. And we'll do real background checks. And we'll put cameras in cars, which by the way,  would help drivers too. There are plenty of drivers that get abused by bad passengers  and do the hard work that they clearly don't want to do.

Transcript:  You're referencing a separate story to Brown. So there is a story about Uber facing a lawsuit  by women for sexual for their sexual assault claims. It's a group of over 500 women. So yeah,  we're waiting to kind of see what happens with all that stuff to to what you're saying it does.  The thing that kind of kept ringing true to me is that I've been covering startups since,  I don't know, 2009, like since I officially started working, you know, for tech, tech  journalism sites. And the thing I kept seeing over and over again, it is it is growth at all costs,  but it's also like these these huge VCs, it's the VC firms pushing these personalities to  basically grow as much as possible. A lot of them were really into the bad boy entrepreneur  kind of idea. And that's what Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, you know, represented. But  at the end of the day, it is the VCs kind of pushing these guys to scale and do whatever it  takes right to to kind of get there. So this is like the Silicon Valley problem, like in a nutshell,  everything that's happened here, we're seeing from the Uber files.

And this is business model where it's  ride sharing, where, you know, the their workforce are not their employees, employees,  like they're relying on a system that of people who are kind of like they have no interest in  helping the company, right? They are both their customers and their drivers are like there's no  loyalty, there's no incentives except for money. And that doesn't that's not a good business,  like they're struggling right now because of that. It's not very sustainable.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was, you know, Uber seems to be so messy in so many different levels.  The thing that kind of was fascinating was watching all the money that was being spent on prop 22  in California. It was like Uber 52 million lift 49 million. You know, it was just remember thing  like this is not a very nice law. And this is, you know, incredibly astroturfing situation. And I  have, I've known several people who have sort of cycled in and out of Uber. And I don't think I've  run into any of them that were like, gosh, this is a great company trying to do things. And,  um, you know, this is just, you know, I, you know, I, you know, there are some people making a living  on Uber. You know, there's some people that cover Uber, where they're describing of, you know, what  I can only, you know, euphemize as financial shenanigans they do in the way we report things  and how, you know, the continuing sort of saga of, of Uber. I don't know, it's just it's part of it,  you know, is part of the culture of, of VC is like, okay, we want to, you know, 100 to one return  on our investment and you have to be everybody has to be a unicorn. And no business can be  reasonably sized. It has to be huge because apparently so much of the venture capital world  is run like, you know, a 1970s record label where it's like, we're going to, you know, throw 11  things against the wall. And one of them is going to give us that hit we need to pay for the other  10 bad decisions we made. And, you know, this is, I don't know, it's, I don't see any, I don't know  how Uber ends up going anywhere positive, you know, and maybe that's just, you know, it's,  you know, it's, it's, it's nice to be able to get an Uber in places where you used to not be able  to get a cab, but even that's become kind of a failing thing in terms of, you know, the availability  of rides or the functioning of the system. You know, and, you know, Brianna, I'm a five foot 10,  240 pound guy who played rugby with a 17 and a half inch neck. I genuinely don't get threatened  in Ubers. I did have a cab driver once when I tapped on his window in New York City in the  battle days, pull out of 38 because he didn't realize he was sleeping, which was, you know,  memorable, highly unusual, but it's, you know, I don't think they've taken anybody's safety  seriously. It took a, you know, I mean, it's always one of the things where it takes all of  this horrible press and then they give an inch and all of this horrible press and then they give  another quarter of an inch and it's frustrating, right? And it's frustrating what they're doing  to the drivers. It's frustrating the gamification of the system. You know, it's, if you've ever sat,  you know, in an Uber where somebody has Uber going and Lyft going simultaneously, and they're kind of  flipping back and forth between the two, trying to figure out how to make a living. I don't think  anybody wins. Yeah. Yeah. It would be nice. It would be nice to see places being punished  for making bad decisions that hurt everyone. And I think, you know, gosh, think about how all the  changes that were made in the financial community after the financial markets crashed in 2008.  And then I get really sad and I stopped thinking, yeah, they really paid a price there. Yeah. Yeah.  And it's frustrating.

To get to a point to push  to the brink where there are either economic or political consequences, real people suffer in the  real world. And that's not a workable system either. Yeah. I just think my message here is

Transcript:  it's more limited than like a boil the ocean, like, let's make it so VCs are nicer kinder people  that build better companies. I have a very specific action item here, which is the congenital sexism  problem in tech, where I would remind you women leave tech careers at a rate of four times that  of men, right? It is it's brutal. It's really bad. You know, that has consequences. You're not  just talking about a woman that's not going to get her shot to be CEO of a company or make it up the  career ladder. You're talking about the outcome of that of a company like Uber, which is serving  as public transportation all across the world in a lot of ways, leading to these outcomes of kidnapping  rape, sexual assault. And I can tell you it's a very, there's a very specific kind of fear that  I think a lot of guys just are fortunate to not have to think about when you're in an Uber and  like the guy starts flirting with you or something, right? Like you're, you're instantly on guard.  You're instantly worried. Is he driving me where I think I want to go? Like, am I, it's just a whole  set of things that's very, very important. So my message here is, you know, tech,  if you have women involved in the decision loop on these things, I think you would have problems  like safety and cameras and things like that taken far more seriously. And that's why I would

Transcript:  continue to advocate in the tech industry. Thank you. Thank you for that, Brianna. And I agree,  the safety thing is something they need to work on. But the other thing we haven't really mentioned  here is just like their strategies for kind of a flourishing and, you know, spreading across the  world. I don't know, it was like a thousand years ago, but if you remember the early 2010s, when  we had these, the war of the cab apps in New York, there were several going on, including like one  of the first ones, Uber did not discover this technology of like, you know, GPS assisted a  cab location. There was a company called Halo, which I believe was an Israeli company that was  also trying to launch in New York at the same time. There were a bunch of these companies. And  from my reporting back then, and just from what I can remember, it really came down to Uber just  bullying these companies, you know, out of every single city. I remember one day, I think Halo was  celebrating it and that was spelled H I L O H A I L O. They were celebrating like, you know, their  launch in New York, and they were popping champagne. I walked into their offices because  they were next door to our co working space. So that was convenient. But there was also news  that came down immediately that a judge had halted their service. So I don't know, I don't even  recall why that was happening. But a lot of companies had trouble starting, especially in  a city like New York. New York was also special for Uber because it wasn't anybody that could just  rive it, right? You had to have a I believe a cab license. So New York fair little better than  others. Yeah, I'm a Dalian. That was it was just seeing these companies and like we're seeing the  long term effects of these companies just kind of taking over the world, and nobody really stopping  them and a lot of people criticizing them along the way. But I don't know, like every time I'm here  on Twitter, like I talked about like, we need better regulations for companies like Facebook and  the way they're like intersecting with our lives. When a company like Uber is just doing the stuff,  broadly across the entire world, I don't know what are the actions other than entire come,  several countries getting together to kind of act together and fix that with their own regulation.  But it's tough to get countries to do anything together. I don't know. Have you guys?

Transcript:  For sure. For sure. It's just like the competing companies, the other like there were a lot of  stories about the dirty tricks they would do, like basically call, I think it was a call lift  rides and cancel them like they're all sorts of weird, dirty tracks that they're doing. And  I don't know how much of it just comes down to like, is anybody like is any of the blame on the  VCs who are pumping these companies up and basically giving them the money to, you know,  go bribe or lean on political allies across the world? Do the VCs have any responsibility for  this? I don't know if we've ever really asked those questions. I don't do enough business  reporting to kind of tell there. But I don't do you think VCs deserve to be kind of have the fire  under them a little more when they're pushing companies to grow and scale like Uber is?

And if you're  on the board, you do have certain fiduciary duties, right? For oversight and things like that.  I think with these dirty tricks, like my first thought is where are the regulators? Where are  the people that see these things coming to light that then are knocking on the door of the board  and saying, look, you have a legal responsibility to do due diligence here. How did you not know  about this? And I think bringing civil and maybe even criminal charges in certain positions,  I think that's the way to go. You know, I think overall in this country, not to be American  centric, but we've gotten far too lax at prosecuting white collar crime. And I think that's something  all across the board, Republicans and Democrats would love to see more of that.  So I would love to see our local prosecutors to worry a little less about marijuana convictions  and prosecuting those cases. Let's go after fraud. Let's go out to corporate America some more. Like

So I know how I mean,  Brianne, you're working in a progressive pack right now. Right. So it is you're advocating  for a lot of what people want. But I keep looking back and thinking like, oh, man, these companies,  you brought up the financial crisis, Patrick. Yeah, they really paid the price. You know,  the airlines. Yeah.

Transcript:  Brianne Wiltes Yeah, no, I mean, it's not funny at all. But I'm looking at this list of Uber  funding rounds, you know, and several years in, it was obvious that this was a company  that was that was, you know, really aggressive. I'll put it that way. You know, and you look at  it's like, well, you know, I mean, like, it's, you know, you know, 2.8 billion, 3.5 billion in 2016,  and, you know, like 1.8 billion, you know, obviously, 7.7 billion, I think, in one secondary  round in 2017. And this is staggering amounts of money, right? For especially when you kind of  think like, going back to the to the to the days of, you know, well, brick and mortar is dead, and  we're going to take over and we lose money on every bag of dog food we ship, but we're going to make  it up in volume and just being like, you know, you look at the logic of the money, and there is no  gateway. And, you know, the it would be nice if the people that are hurling money at these companies  would actually be like, yes, we would like you to have some women in senior management positions.  More importantly, we would like you to listen to what they are asking for in the process of creating  this project or this product. And we would like you to behave. Because the other thing that you  run into so often, all over the business spectrum is, do it, we'll ask forgiveness later, do it,  we'll throw the lawyers at it. Because, you know, nobody really pays the price for a lot of this  stuff. It's messy, and it doesn't seem to be getting a lot better.

Transcript:  It is for me, like, this is another story of like the the grow at all costs, and doesn't really  matter what the consequences of your actions are. So I'm glad the Uber files are out there.  Hopefully, we'll start to see more reporting out of them. And Uber has not, they have basically  kept saying, I believe, like, when the the new Uber CEO came on and Kellanick was ousted, they're  saying their behavior was better. But that doesn't really explain how they were in the past. But you  know what, let's move on to a happier story and a story I think a lot of people are looking forward  to hearing about the MacBook Air M2 is officially out. The MacBook Air M2 is sitting right next to  me right now. And you could check out my review over in gadget, I gave it a one of the highest  scores I've ever given anything, I gave it a 96 out of 100. So I really like this computer.  It is astounding. It is everything the 13 inch MacBook Pro was not, or at least what really  disappointed me about that one was that it was just the old case. This thing is great. I just want  to confirm it here on Twitter. If you're looking for a new Mac computer, you want the new M2 chip,  you want new hardware, you want a new design, you want a slightly larger screen and a thinner case  and this computer feels like magic every time I hold it. So I wholeheartedly recommend this thing.

Transcript:  Are you guys excited for the MacBook Air M2? Well, I mean, I bought I bought a 13 inch M1  last year, which is by far the best computer I've ever had. So I'm not in the market for this  particular machine. But I was actually worried that you weren't going to promote your own story  on the show this week because I was so excited by your review. I wanted to ask you, like you've had  the chance to play with this. I think many of us looked at the specs of the M2 Pro, which is,  you know, it's really, right, right. The updated one, you know, the touch bar and all of that.  Is there any reason to your mind for someone to buy that that that M2 Pro with touch with the touch  bar over the air because your review makes it seem like there's just no reason whatsoever to do that.

Start time: 5128.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I reviewed the MacBook Pro 13 as well with the M2. And my conclusion is that I don't  know who that computer is for. It is so baffling. It is such a weird computer because, okay, the big  difference from the M2 Air is that it has fans, it has an active cooling system, the air is entirely  passively cooled. So that means thermal throttling. That means, you know, processor throttling if you  push that computer too hard. But so the MacBook Pro can deal with heat better, can do longer term  work. But it's the old case. It is the case that they've been evolving since 2016. It has only two  USB-C ports. It doesn't have an SD card slot. If you're charging that thing, you're using one USB-C  port. It has the old screen. It has, you know, kind of all the other old stuff. Meanwhile,  I reviewed the 14 inch and 16 inch MacBook Pros last year. And those things are incredible. Those  things are like exactly what pro users have been asking for for so long. And what I discovered is  that basically if you spec up the MacBook Pro 13 inch, and just like align it with the 14 inch,  which I think is like a better computer overall, this the price difference for like a computer  with 16 gigs of RAM, a terabyte of storage, you know, like the good hardware you'd recommend  for everybody. It's only like a $300 price difference. So at that point, just get the  14 inch MacBook Pro just spend a little more and get the computer with a promotion screen and actual  ports and so many things. So yeah, I railed against the MacBook Pro 13 inch quite a bit in  my review that one that I give that much lower score. I hope I wasn't too unfair, but I certainly  felt like Apple was being super lazy with that computer. I don't know if you guys had the same  thoughts on that. It's just a baffling. This is one I think was it John Gruber wrote about this,

Start time: 5235.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that it's it could be a they're a victim of the perception of pro versus error and,  and the bad experience a lot of people had with how you know, in their mind, the association of  light and thin is underperforming and which was sort of the case with the straight up 11 inch  MacBook that they did write that they discontinued when they were back on Intel.  And now there's in their second year of their M line chips. And it's a hard thing for people  to understand how responsive it is and what a big sea change it is from those Intel space system.  So for a lot of people, maybe when they're shopping, they just see the word pro. And it's  a peace of mind thing that they're like, okay, yeah, even though it's fundamentally the same  performance. Yes, it has the act of cooling. But they're willing to pay that for, you know,  for whatever reason, it's a marketing thing, or it's a cognitive dissonance thing where they feel  like you're getting the better value out of paying the pro, which is why reviews exist, which is why,  you know, we're having discussion and people should know that there is no reason not to get  that air version of the M two at 13 inches, which is the same spec and both of those have the the  slower 256 gig SSD base model. So it's not even like storage. Never, never buy the storage people.

The real question is, do you if you're doing any sort of work, if you're doing a lot of video  editing or video or 3d encoding or something, 3d rendering, the air is still a good computer,  like it'll be fast, it just won't be as fast as the pro m two. And if you're doing a lot of that,  then don't get the air at all. Get the get the 14 pro. Yeah, I was gonna say that was my question.

Transcript:  Did you run into any throttling? Because part of me is like, if you're editing video, you need the  fans because I have a friend of mine bought a surface pro. And he's like, do me a favor,  run a benchmark on this because it's driving me insane. And I had like, this is a couple years  ago, and it was he was like, I'm delighted with fan list. I'm like, here's what's happening. It's  throttling down. And when it throttles down, it's actually considerably slower. You know, he had the  you know, the the the core i seven 32 gigs of RAM, a brand new processor, this beautiful machine.  And it was running vastly slower than my core i five, three years old or half the memory system,  because my laptop had a fan and his didn't and the thermal overall just crushed it. And it's it's  funny because I've been circling around MacBooks again for the first time forever, because a friend  of mine who does a lot of processor reviews is like, yes, I have, I have a $3,000 desktop video  editing system. And my wife's new $1,500 laptop crushes it. Yeah, one is, you know, Intel Windows  platform, the other ones, you know, the MacBook. And, but I was curious, did you run into anything  other than like super challenging video rendering or 3d? Did you run into any of the throttling or  any heat issues? Or was it mostly unnoticeable? There are some things like it because it's

Transcript:  passively cooled. If you're doing a lot of work, like there's a point where I was downloading  like a handful of steam games that actually run on Macs like shout out the Tomb Raider. So I had  like five games downloading was like 500 gigabytes of data just coming into my computer. And then  started to feel warm. So it was feeling warm on my lap and felt warm on the keyboard. But  that's fine. I'm totally used to that on laptops. And it wasn't like warm enough to burn me.  In the Cinebench multi threaded benchmark, I did notice that it was dipping lower than the  M2 MacBook Pro. And then that's what I expected. You know, that is a harder core video,  it's trying to like, you know, mimic video rendering or video processing. So  that's the heavier one. It's a little slower, but still really fast. It's still faster than  most of the Intel systems I've seen. So if you're doing a handful, like if you're doing like a home  movie once in a while, like every month or so, I don't think it's a it's probably that big of a  deal. If you're doing it as a daily work type of thing, then yeah, you shouldn't be getting the  air. You know, if it's if your job is video editing, then get the pro but get the right pro.  Get the 14 or 16 inch and I know they're ungodly expensive, but at least the 14 inch is a  new design and a much better overall computer than the 13 inch. Yeah.

Transcript:  It really makes me wish I'd gone up to that the 16 inch MacBook when I bought my M1 last year,  because I have to tell you like an air for like throwing in your purse and just going around town  and then a pro to really do your work on. That is a good combination. I've done that a lot.  I'm curious, like the actual M2 itself, do you think I mean, can you look into the future and  just guess that when Apple eventually puts out those M2 pros for the 14 and 16 inch, I mean,  do you think that like a full real version of it? Do you think that's going to be enough that  people like me that, you know, dropped like bought that new MacBook last year that we would have

Start time: 5528.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  enough there to make it worth upgrading? I mean, just from what I've seen on the M2 so far, this  the M2 over the M1 is a pretty like minimal bump, right? Overall, it was like an 18% performance  improvement. Maybe the pro and max chips and the ultra chips like whenever those arrive, like those  will probably be faster. But if you look at my benchmark numbers on on our in gadget review,  the M1 pro the M1 Max are still much, much faster than the base like M2 as it is. So if you bought a  14 inch or 16 inch MacBook Pro now, like it would still be much faster. You could wait like maybe  we'll see it by the end of the year. It's really hard to predict anything with Apple. But those  things are so fast right now that I wouldn't be surprised if they waited till spring or something.  Right. There is there's just like a lot of like delays happening across the industry. And I don't  know if Apple is going to push for that. Or if they're going to focus more on like there's rumors  of like an iMac pro or something coming back. And that was like a disaster. You know, that was an  ill advised upgrade back around 2017 when that came out. But yeah, it is a tough place to be if  you don't know. I guess if you're trying to upgrade and you don't know if you should wait or not,  and you need a computer right now, I say just buy what's out there right now. If it gets closer

Transcript:  to the fall, then just sit tight. Yeah. Yeah. There were phones. Go ahead. I was going to say,  you know, it's their target user. The most people of understanding who are buying this are looking  at these are students. Right. And they're buying a system for every four years or something. Right.  The system you're going to spend fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars on should last you four  years. And it's very interesting to think about how we think about phones and how people are.  And I'm on an upgrade plan for a phone, so I'm excited for a new phone every year. But I don't  certainly don't think of a computer that way. So the thing with Mac books and computer systems in  general is I'm kind of looking for that sweet spot of when is it going to be the best, not only value  for what I'm paying for now, but I'm not going to feel like I was shorted two or three years later  because of something, a big sea change in design or efficiency. And that's where it feels like this  M2 system is a nice sweet spot because it is a chassis change. There's maturity in their  arm based OS and native support for it. And like you said, like 20 percent improvement feels like  the natural year over year. It's not going to be the massive jump that the M1 was over the Intel

So all the lessons you guys gave us back then like aim forward, aim forward when  you're when you're specking up. So the thing I used to tell students and, you know, honestly,  professors at the college I was working as like aim for a four year lifespan with your machine.  And I looking at the macro pro 13, it seems like it's already four years out of date. It just like  physically compared to all the other hardware Apple has. Like, yeah, it was basically the design  from four years ago. So you don't want to get that computer, folks. But you know, we're going  to be talking more about some other Apple news.

Transcript:  Now, back to Davindra. Thanks Leo. In other Apple news this week, we also got our first  public previews of their next upcoming operating systems, iOS 16, Mac OS Ventura, the new iPad  OS and Watch OS 9. I've been testing Mac OS Ventura and I wrote a preview over it in Gadget as well.  And I have to say, I'm glad I have a time, I have a platform to finally say I hate the OS X dock.  I have hated it since 2001. It is awful. And it is really nice to see Apple explore new ways to  manage your windows on Macs. And for Mac OS Ventura, that is Stage Manager, which is this  left-hand side screen that lets you cycle between your four most recently used apps. You can group  apps together. It is a very nice way to jump back into different windows and different apps.  And so much better than the dock. I hate the dock. I'm glad the dock is gone. Have you guys seen this  thing? Because Stage Manager is also going to be an iPad. So it's also going to kind of change the  way multitasking works on iPads too. Are you excited about what's coming?

Transcript:  I'm not completely sold on it because I'm not personally used to it yet. But I completely agree  with the sentiments in your piece. You know, Doc, I think that some Mac users like myself are so  used to the bad paradigm there that you don't even see it anymore. And I think people don't  understand just how much better window management is overall, over on Windows these days. So I think  it's by far the weakest part of this. I have to tell you, basically, I guess my mother-in-law,  we bought her a Mac. She's a librarian. And, you know, I'm trying to teach like an 80-year-old  woman to use Mac OS. And she just flat out could not figure out the dock and how to click around  on things. This is not someone uneducated. Like this is someone who worked as a librarian  through most of her career. So I'm psyched to try this. But I'm not completely sold on it yet,  because I think the paradigm that they've made just seems like it would make more sense on iPad.

Transcript:  But I'm excited to try. For sure, for sure. And I do want to point out, like,  I think even Apple realized the dock was kind of a problem. Because in 2003, they unveiled Expose,  which is that feature that lets you blow up all the windows and see everything running or Windows  for a specific app. And since that came out, it's now part of Mission Control. I need that in every  Mac. I cannot use a Mac without being able to blow up the windows because I never want to touch  the dock. But, Norm, Patrick, any thoughts? Do you want to get anything off your chest about the dock?

Transcript:  I'm a Windows user, so it's Alt-Tab, Windows-Tab. I mean, that's what I've been using. I like  Expose, and the multi-gesture way of getting it. I'm really curious about Safe Manager for iPad. I  know there's been that controversy about limiting it to the only newest iPads and whether that's an  actual necessity and how performance hungry it is. But from a design standpoint, is this,  from your perspective, places where Mac OS and iOS start to merge and you see a future where  that's kind of how they're going to design these features going forward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. It does kind of feel like that. I mean, I'm the weirdo who keeps saying,  why does Mac OS still look like it did in 2001? Fundamentally, the overall shape of it and the  basic thing is what it looked like when Windows XP came out and then the Mac users start throwing  things at me, so I just shut up. But it does feel like that idea of being able to share features  between iPad OS and iOS is kind of one way for them to kind of change the way Macs are going.  It is funny though because just talking about the MacBook Air, right? That thing weighs 2.6,  2.7 pounds. It is really, really light. And then I remember that the iPad Pro 12.9 inch  with the new keyboard, the Smart Folio, weighs more than the MacBook Air. And that just made  me think, I don't understand Apple's portability push or argument here for the iPad Pro because  now the Air is actually kind of outdoing the iPad Pro. It has been for the past two years,  but it's even more so with the new M2 MacBook Air. Sure, they're sharing features. I think  at least it's one way for Mac OS to evolve. Like now you can auto hide the dock,  just Reliance Stage Manager for moving between apps. You could still use ExposA. You could  basically pick and choose whatever you want. I just feel like the dock is kind of the worst

Transcript:  enough time on Mac OS right now. I think they're kind of reaping this whole,  the line they've drawn between a touchscreen and not touchscreen. They want to have their cake and  eat it too. Or they want people to buy multiple devices. They're not going to put touchscreens  on MacBooks because they want you to have an iPad as well. But for a lot of people, and they had the  whole ad campaign of children saying, what's a computer? Because their computer is an iPad.  They just know their computer device is an iPad. But as complexity increases on those,  you're running to limits of what touchscreen only input can do as great as touchscreen is.  And that's why people have to buy the keyboards and the folios as expensive as they are.  And eventually they got to choose. Are they going to make the Mac more accessible? Or are they  going to make the iPad more feature full? Or expect people to keep on buying both? Because  iPad users are going to always want to ask for more features. And Mac OS users are going to  want to ask for just easier ways to get through the complexity of it.

Transcript:  I don't know. I don't think there's any evil Tim Cook rubbing his hands together. We will never  bring the touchscreen to the Mac so we can sell our iPads. I think there has traditionally been  a lot of fear in the Mac community that this kind of crossover between basically iOS and Mac OS  was going to make Mac OS less of a professional tool. I think that it's a fair worry to have just  because one is, as you say, it's just straightforward. It's something children  can use. The other is like a professional environment that many of us have been using  for our whole careers. I think especially with the unified stack, both of them being on the same  architecture now with Apple Silicon, I think that ship has sailed. And what I think is so ironic  now is Apple spends so much of their time like, oh, we're going to make this so elegant. We're  going to hopefully get rid of USB type A ports on your machine to make it more beautiful and  easier to use. But if you actually look at the window management of any real Mac user,  it's a mess. You've got like over in your notification tray, it's going to give you five  updates you need to install. You have random windows all around the screen. Some dock thing  is going to be jumping up and down. It's an absolute disaster. So I do think for professional  users, it's time to come in there and try something like stage manager. But you're really  dealing with a very different kind of user there. I mean, John Syracusa, I'll never forget reading  some of his Mac OS reviews back when it was OS 10, talking about his anger that he couldn't get it to  snap over to the same pixel on his MacBook every single time, no matter what he did.  Like you're really dealing with the kind of OCD kind of person here. So we don't like change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just how we are. You know what I linked to a Syracusa review also in my preview piece,  because his original review for OS 10, OS X, I don't know, you know, the name has changed all  over the place, but he points out the same dock issue. Why it's hard. You know, it's tough. Like  say you had multiple Safari windows open, right? And you had other windows on top of your Safari,  and you need to go back to that one specific one that has your Gmail tab or something. The way you  do it with the dock before expose and everything is you have to click on the dock or command click  on the dock and then look at the drop down, try to figure out which window among the drop down it is  and then click that and Windows XP was far uglier in 2001. I think it was XP by that point.  It was super ugly, but it's click one button on the taskbar. That's it. I just look at the taskbar  and click down. I know keyboard shortcuts are thing, but I also don't want to like tap, tap,  tap, tap, tap. I want to like just move and click because my hands is on the mouse more.  So, you know, I'm glad I'm glad I had support back then from John Syracusa.  There was one other Apple story this week that I think a lot of people are reading a lot into.  Apple announced that they're ending their consulting agreement with Johnny Ive,  their former design leader, because he went off and started his own thing. And everybody was like,  don't worry, he's still going to work with Apple. And now they've agreed to stop working together  according to two people with knowledge of the agreement. End of an era, I guess. I don't know  if you guys have deep thoughts about this, but I have I have my frustrations with Ives designs  too. Like I blame him for losing a lot of the ports and things like that. Yes. Well, I have,

Transcript:  I have a lot of thoughts on this. Like I think in some ways, Apple design has gotten much better  since I've is left. And I think the 14 inch M1 notebook is a really good example of this.  I think clearly, I've pushed many Apple designs, like for minimalism over pragmatism,  a really good example being that infamous scissor keyboard design, which is the charging cable

Transcript:  I think in some, I think there's a really good argument that that does it's gotten better  in many respects since he left. And you know, the reporting goes on to say a lot of Apple people  were a very curious what he was being paid $100 million to design exactly, and be very frustrated  that he seemed to their allegations that he kept poaching key people from Apple's design team,  which just seems like not good. On the other hand, I do have to look at like what Apple's  been putting out in the last few years. And let's, let's be honest here. There's a lot of lack of  whimsy with what Apple's been putting out. Like it's all really good industrial design. But if  you're looking at the, you know, the new iPads or the MacBooks, there's nothing out there that's  really groundbreaking the way that, you know, the trash can Mac pro, which, you know, not a  successful pro computer, but certainly a stunning design. I mean, we're thinking about this over on  rocket that the most interesting thing Apple's really put out in the last three or four years  was that the, the air pod, the air pod max, what's the overhead headphone things.  Yeah. The case exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like a bra. That's the most interesting  thing that they've put out in a long time. So I think it wasn't interesting because it was

Start time: 6604.28
End time: 6683.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna say it wasn't interesting because it was positive. It was interesting  because it seemed to have the worst of an extra accessory without doing any of the things you  expected the accessory for. Right. I mean, I, you know, there's, there's part of me like,  you know, there, there was Johnny Ive and Steve Jobs and then there's Johnny Ive after Steve Jobs.  And there was things like, you know, I just, I don't see, there's a lot of things I can see  happening that maybe they would have been exactly the same if Steve Jobs hadn't designed hadn't  hadn't passed. But I look at like the Apple watch and you know, the big the the watching the  interface on that and how it came out and there was buttons and there was a, you know, there was  the knob on the side. And I remember being like, this just seems to be the worst of every possible  world on an interface. And, you know, and I will also be like, I am so over the obsession with  thinness and the removal of ports. And I feel like a lot of, you know, what's happened is that,  you know, as Johnny Ives maybe hasn't been like, we must make everything thinner to the point where  it collapses if you pick it up. And if you need a port, you're obviously doing everything wrong.  And, and, you know, I'm with you that Mac Pro was gorgeous, you know, fundamentally useless for the  way people actually use Mac Pros in the real world. The other thing I'm over with, Patrick,

Start time: 6684.02
End time: 6729.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sorry to interrupt, the other thing I'm over with is also just singular designers being credited with  with everything. Because even, you know, under Johnny Ives, it's a whole design team. But when  you have the idealization of whether it's one designer, an engineer or a founder, you know,  being the person the consumers are associated with and put on pedestal, when it's yes, they  provide the guidance and it's their direction. Ultimately, they might make the decisions.  I like not knowing necessarily who are the design leads at Apple and just evaluating the products  as they are. And not having that hype of the Johnny Ives, you know, carefully  scripted commercial that plays at every keynote. Right. Absolutely. You know, a friend of mine

Start time: 6730.82
End time: 6812.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was saying, was asking me like, you know, who would who would Steve Jobs be without Johnny Ive?  And I kind of think the more interesting question is, who would Johnny Ive be without Steve Jobs?  You know, like who would let him just like go wild, buck wild with these designs and give him  full rain and full power to do that. It was a fortuitous meeting between two, two very specific,  you know, aesthetic designers, because jobs was kind of a design mind too. So just like a weird  thing, hard to hard to tell. And I don't know what Johnny Ive is going to be doing next. But I will  say, I'm really excited about what Apple's doing next. Because at least they're going to look a  little more interesting, be a little more different. This MacBook Air M2 just really gives me hope that  that they're leaning back into functionality. Although this thing has a headphone jack,  and I'm looking at those like those little middle meters, you know, above and below the headphone  jack. And I'm sure some designer at Apple's like, if we just take that out, this will be  even thinner guys, could have the thinnest MacBook ever ever made. And that's something they did with  the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro does not have a, it doesn't have a headphone jack. So it could,  they could easily end up doing that. Who knows? Yeah, I guess we'll see. I guess we'll see. I  guess exciting times for Apple. Honestly, I'm interested to see what Johnny Ive does next as  well. Yeah, any deeper thoughts about the Ive era? I guess this is truly the end of the Ive era, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that there was a headlines that said it best, like he made the entire tech industry  care about industrial design. And, you know, Norman, just to bounce off of your point,  I completely agree. He is over credited, you can read books on him. And it was a team of people  working with him, structural engineers, material engineers, a lot of what you made Apple so  successful is really new composite metals that they made. Johnny Ive is not a metallurgist,  so, you know, it's, but his legacy was making the whole industry care more about design.  I would actually, I would go the opposite way though. I would challenge Apple to start  highlighting some of their other talent in the design world at this keynote. It's something  we don't talk about as much today because Apple has gotten so much better at it. But, you know,  it was, it's recently, it was 2011, 2012, Apple would never have women speaking at WWDC  or at these keynotes. It would be one dude after another, all generally white dudes. And, you know,  they've gotten a lot better at letting other people kind of represent the company. I would  love to meet and know some of the people working on the design team doing this really interesting  work. Who's the person that fixed the keyboard, bring them forward? I will praise them. I mean,  find out that I will hear some of these stories, like, promote them and let, let someone else,  like, be a fable for the next generation of Apple the way that they kind of built up Johnny Ive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would really like to see that. I would totally like to see that too. And certainly we are seeing  in these new betas, like we're seeing all sorts of new design ideas too, right? There is  continuity camera, which is I think the single wildest thing I've seen from Apple in the past  decade, right? Like of here is a thing you put on your MacBook and you put your phone on the thing  and your phone is your webcam, which seems like both an admission that your, their webcams are  terrible, which they, they're not that great, even the one in the new, in the new MacBook Air,  but also that, you know, this is a really confusing thing. I still haven't gotten it to work in the  beta OS's I have. I have to do some reinstalling probably, but is that a thing you're interested  in doing or is that just like a weird idea somebody had and Apple's just like, Hey, go for it,  which I feel like was never a thing that could have happened before.

Start time: 6959.86
End time: 7059.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that's it's fun. I was going to say, because everybody's webcams in their,  in their laptops are atrocious. There's incredible physical limitations. You know,  I'm still just grateful that Dell finally went, you know, we can give ourselves three millimeter  at the top and bury the camera there. Cause really, you know, it was like how much nostril  cam can anyone take in one lifetime? Right. And it was just, you know, people are also realizing  a lot of people realize like, Oh, my webcam looks like crap, but my iPhone looks great. Why can't  I use these together? And I think that's the kind of aesthetic decision that would have been like,  no, no, no, no, no, no. By the way, you also hold your iPhone like this. And if you hold it with  four fingers, you're using it wrong. Anybody remember that? Like, you know, we didn't test  this with normal people. And if we did be told them the way they held their phone was wrong,  because really who holds their phone with their entire hand when you can hold a, you know,  thousand dollar device with two fingers and have it work. Apparently I'm still a little  bitter about that phase, but you know, I think it's a smart decision because, you know, yes,  I have a, you know, I have a four micro four thirds camera in here. I have a decent lens on it. I have  lighting in here. And the reality is, is there's a lot more people who running Mac hardware that  have an iPhone than there are people who want to deal with doing an HDMI interface, you know,  to a camera with a semi-professional lens. And, you know, everybody's got their phone with them.  So it seems smart to me. It seems thoughtful to me. It seems to like very acknowledging the needs  of the community because a lot of people would like their video to look better. And it just so  happens your camera's got a pretty bitching or your phone, I should say. Yeah. It has a pretty  bitching camera inside of it. Oh, it's a phone too, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. It reinforces the

Start time: 7059.78
End time: 7104.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fact that the phones have become more and more imaging devices first. The killer app is the phone  and they've put so much R and D into and even gone to thicker phones because of it. So they can  facilitate the better cameras. The feature I'm most curious about related to that is how they're  making use of the wide angle camera to warp a downward angle view, kind of like how, you know,  a car is with their wide angle cameras can create almost control and like view around you. And then  the imagery we saw from the keynote of that was, I think, too crisp. I was not, I was very skeptical  of how that would look because if you look at the edge of even their ultra wide camera, if you start  warping that, like there's only so much clarity you can get. Yeah. I haven't got to work yet,

Start time: 7104.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but some YouTubers have, I believe Dave Lee, Dave 2D on YouTube has been doing some testing with that.  And it does look like his fingers get super long and stretched. But if something is flat on the  table in front of you, you do get a really nice, like very pretty clear like overhead camera view,  which again, who thought of that? Like I need that story. I need that background of like,  where did this idea come from? Why did it like get all the way up the chain of command to being  shown and being a shipping feature in the US? Just kind of a wild thing for Apple to do. And I had  the opportunity to ask Apple like several times and they're never going to give you specifics,  but they're like, you know, we thought this would be a cool feature. The one thing I will say,  other than being like kind of annoying to set up, I wonder how many people are going to miss  having a phone to fiddle with when you should be paying attention to video chat. So that's one  thing that could be working against this feature. Not that you guys are doing that at all during  this show. But you know, that is the thing we've grown used to having a second screen in our hands  or nearby, letting go of your phone a little bit just for better video quality. I don't know if  that's going to end up making it like less useful for a lot of people. But yeah, we will see. And  actually something related to what Apple's going to be doing soon. I want to talk about next,  but let's let's have over to Leo for one more word. Could I just say something about this?

Transcript:  Because I go ahead to weigh in on this. No, it just seems to me like, you know, Dr. Dre,  like soul beats because he was able to think about a segment of the market that everyone else  was not thinking about at that time, which was headphones. And he was right about that. There  were people that wanted to have colorful headphones, like there were sneakers,  that just the tech market completely missed. There are two separate companies out there right  now that are understanding. We're all doing video chats all the time now. People want better cameras  here. I would note that, you know, Norman, you and Patrick both have some really nice setups with  depth of field there, which I'm very envious of. I need it. Yeah, there are people out there that  want better solutions for this. I am certainly one of them. My setup is I end up just using a  cheap Razer Kiyo, you know, like this $100 camera and some good lights. I think that there's a lot  of innovation that's possible here. I think long term, you know, people are not going to like attach  their camera to their MacBook in a, you know, it's just not an Apple-y solution long term.  But I think that there is a growing market for better video broadcasting equipment out there.  I hope Apple is going to fill that, but someone certainly should.

Transcript:  Hello, everybody. One more time. I want to interrupt. One more time, then I'm going to  go get back on the boat. Thank you, Devendra, for doing a great job for me filling in. It's nice to  know that Twitter is in great hands. I want to tell you a little bit, kind of a story. When I  talk to people, especially young people, about savings, look, I'm close to retirement age,  and I've got a nice little nest egg. And I learned early on that the key to saving for your financial  future, and that doesn't just have to be retirement, could be buying that first house or putting the  kids through college or even just getting a car. The key is long term wealth building,  designed to weather any market condition. Look, stocks go up and down. That's part of the deal.  That's how it works. But if you're smart about it, if you know what you're doing,  you don't let that bother you. You can build over a period of time, a great nest egg for yourself.  Wealthfront is the way to go. It's a financial services company. They've been around since 2008,  and they were founded with one goal in mind to make building this long term wealth delightfully  easy. Now, if you go and look at the stock market, you probably don't like what you see.  The people who freak out at this point, the day traders, the buy and sell, buy low, sell high  people, those guys are going crazy right now. But what you see is really a matter of perspective.  With Wealthfront, you're investing with a different vision, focused on long term wealth,  designed to weather these up and down markets, even the one we're in now.  This isn't anything unusual. This is part of the cycle. But with Wealthfront, you get a pre-built,  diversified portfolio that spreads your investments across more baskets. You know what I'm saying,  maybe not the most felicitous way to put it, but it spreads your investments across,  diversifies it. It's a time tested way to build long term wealth and weather whatever volatility  happens at the market at any given time. In fact, really now is a great time to get started in  Wealthfront, probably the best time ever to get started in Wealthfront. The trick to wealth is in  timing, not when you get in, but time, how long you're in. So if you're young, especially,  I want you to pay attention to this. By automating your investments, it makes it easier to do the  thing you must do, which is every paycheck you invest regularly, regardless of the ups and downs.  They call it dollar cost averaging. And it's a discipline that's so important that makes such a  huge difference. If you want to invest for the long term, while the market is basically having  a clearance sale, this is the time. But keep putting it in, right? Don't just go, oh, and then  stop. Wealthfront makes it really easy every paycheck to invest a little bit, invest a little  bit, answer a few questions about your risk level and your future plans so they kind of get to know  what it is you're looking for. They will personalize a portfolio built for the long term. And really,  that's it. Except for you're going to get a $50 bonus to start your nest egg right now if you sign  up today. Wealthfront voted the best overall robo advisor by Investopedia. Half a million people  have been building their wealth with Wealthfront. $27 billion in managed assets. Start right now,  get a bonus. $50 when you start investing with Wealthfront today. Go to Wealthfront.com slash  twit. Don't put it off. That's Wealthfront.com slash twit.

Transcript:  Oh, that's so much fun. And you know what, folks, another thing Apple's working on that we haven't  even mentioned yet is AR glasses. There have been a lot of rumors around that. And you know,  who's a great expert on that stuff is Norm Chan. I know, Norm, you've looked at a couple things  lately that could kind of hint at like what Apple's thinking about and where this entire  market is going. You looked at the mojo or is it moho augmented reality glasses and the hands on  you did hands on with the tilt five production AR glasses. I remember you talking about that  while back. Can you give us a preview of your coverage of that stuff?

Start time: 7675.36
End time: 7790.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, those are interesting devices. I think neither of those are exactly what Apple's  been doing. Their first generation AR glasses probably akin to what, you know, MED is doing  with their project camera glasses and pass through AR for productivity. Get those in  the hands of developers. We don't know when that is. But the two devices you mentioned that I got  to check out recently at the augmented world expo are novel uses of AR. One out in the world now in  tilt five and one far out into the future probably tilt fives company created by Jerry Ellsworth.  She was previously at valve. She's amazing engineer, done a lot of awesome hacking with  video game stuff in the past. And this company, a technology she really has been working on for a  decade is AR glasses for tabletop gaming. So the idea is you wear these tilt five glasses, they have  Pico projectors built in two of them and they essentially represent imagery for your eye. But  as opposed to blasting images into your eye, they blast out into the world and hit a retro  reflective surface. So this game board they have that was tracking markers on around the edge of it.  But the material, this gray material, essentially it's kind of the same material that maybe your  stop sign that you see on the street is made out of. So when you shine light at it, it comes  exactly back 180 degrees back into the light source. And so if you have the projector,  where your eyes are, they do a little bit of bouncing around the glasses, they go out toward  the game board and they come back at you. Then you get stereo images that are augmented reality  images. And they've worked with a bunch of developers over the past couple of years,  video to create video games, you know, essentially your, your tabletop DND, your, your, your, your  a bomber man, marble madness, all sorts of those types of games. But you can play them  asymmetrically around the table remotely. And the effect is really stunning. It's really fun.

Start time: 7792.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's great. And does tilt five work well, even if you're wearing glasses,  like that's always the issue with me. I don't know if you were contacts to test these things norm.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. For the video, I took off my glasses, but they're prototypes. It's  because there's not perfect alignment needed with the headset and your head, you can very easily just  put them on the big sunglasses. And they do work over even even big classes. And yeah, they've  created some technology to, to generate like a third person view. So you can do like Twitch  streaming while having some type of mixed reality view so people can see, you know, the dungeon  you're crawling through. And that controller is really neat because it's a hybrid, almost like a  Wiimote style, you know, one but on its side works as your standard gamepad, really clever ideas,  and their discourse is full of amazing developers creating fun things using their SDK to use as

Start time: 7843.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're shipping to Kickstarter backers. You know, I mean, so you're a game developer. Yeah,  yeah. You sound amazed by this. Well, I'm interested in this. I've long thought that  the AR had a better chance to catch on than VR because from a game development point of view,  you have to get so specialized when you're developing things for VR, like things like  optimizing your draw calls from the center of the screen so you don't have nauseousness.  Thinking about different movement paradigms is one of the reasons why it's so incredibly expensive  to develop VR experiences, which is sad because there's very little of a marketplace to actually  sell games. Everything I'm seeing here in this video, Norman, tell me if I'm wrong here. This  looks like it's being made with the Unity. Is that correct? I believe so. And yeah.

Start time: 7899.36
End time: 7929.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the lower cost overall. Yeah. Yes, lower cost and lower performance overhead needed.  They're doing reprojection, basically doubling up the frames or tripling them up in the headset  itself. So the projectors are running at 180 hertz. But Jerry says that a lot of the developers  don't even need to optimize as their first pass. They can run it at 30 or 60 on Intel integrated  graphics and it'll run smooth. The production units actually prove that out. Yeah, that's really

Start time: 7929.42
End time: 8033.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interesting to me. You were talking at the beginning of this about how the signs are there  that Apple is bringing a VR product to market, AR product to market rather. And I just tell you,  someone that works with their SDK, it's the writing is so on the wall because you don't  look at Apple leaks. You ask yourself, like you follow the state of the union and see the direction  that Apple has been going with basically their developer tools. It was not that long ago. The  only thing you had was SpriteKit for building games. And today you've got SceneKit and the  3D tools are far more sophisticated. I think most of us would agree the pipeline of Apple's vision  of plugging powerful graphics cards into your Mac and connecting a monitor to it, that ended up  being a technological dead end. But I see this and I just see a more tenable development pipeline to  get it out there. And I think that's the really core problem. Magic Leap, I think failed,  not because the idea is bad, but that despite all the money they spent on it, they didn't bother to  develop something that did something better than what you would get on a screen.  And I think if you're looking to sell hardware, you've got to be able to get developers to be  able to work with it in a cost efficient way. And this just, it looks like a flat out better  solution to me. Yeah. Can you tell us anything about the contact lenses too? Oh yeah. And then

Transcript:  but go ahead, Norm. But they're smarter. I think magic leap now shifting over to not consumers  because they may had such a big push, probably in the VC problem. It's so much money put into  it that the expectation was that they would be a mass market consumer product. And you had all  these wired covered stories and they put all their money, not necessarily into SDK or developer  relations. And they did have that, but into solving a fundamentally hard optical problem  in trying to promise optics that would solve this conversion accommodation conflict. And  from what I understand or what the assumption is going into whatever Apple is going to do is  I don't think they're going to necessarily try to solve the optical problem. They might do a  pass through solution, a pass through video solution, which is what Metta is doing with  their headset that they're hopefully announcing later this year. But those contact lenses. So  this company called Mojo vision. And what they've done is they have a prototype, they say feature  complete contact lens that has a 0.5 millimeter micro led at the center of it. So it's a 280  pixels wide monochrome right now green color. But in that the contact lens, they have this display  as well as radio and most of it's actually battery on that PCB, which will then relates  essentially some of you wearing your neck like a relay for compute. So no heavy processing.  That's all happens on this wearable, but wirelessly they would transfer imagery  with a user interface they design and the field of view, it's 15 degrees field of view. So they  describe it as like a spotlight. And what I was able to try is a handheld version of it, not plugged  into my eye, but I think I could hold on a stick and then move it around. And as I moved around,  yeah, you could I could read text clearly in this, you know, 50 280 pixel wide circle,  and kind of move it like a flashlight around to hover over icons. And it's not head look,  it is really eye looking, because it's on a contact lens. So as I move my eye around, as  the person who will be wearing this would move their eye around, it would be tracking them with

Transcript:  you know, you get you get so attached to certain brands because they're softer, cleaner, or even  disposable lenses that something like that. And you think about things going wrong and having  electrical components near your eye. I'm just you don't want your contact lenses to overheat  or explode. Yeah, I just I'm not doing it. I'm sorry. That is absolutely. That's how I feel

Transcript:  about it too. Exactly. I don't wear glasses. I don't like putting things in my eye. I've  heard horror stories. You know, my wife's had contact lenses rolled to the back of her eye.  So presumably these are Oh, it just sounds like I don't I don't want that to happen. It's wireless  here. So like, how would you fish that out? And there's the whole cleanliness of it, right? Like  this isn't going to be disposable, presumably, whenever they guess this gets to market, it'll be  expensive custom fit for your eyeball. So it's you know, it's gonna I know glass contact lenses  in the past have had irritability. So yeah, I'm not sure exactly.

Transcript:  I have to ask Norm, I saw this when they they first went public back in like 2020 at CES or  CES 2020. And one of the things they were talking about a lot was the idea that that folks with  low vision or vision impairment, they were working on solutions to help people to sort of augment or  create the the, you know, the ability to see better, or at least to be able to discern objects and  rooms and stuff. Are they talking about that at all? Or is it almost kind of entirely a heads up

Transcript:  display conversation from them now? I think for I think it's a heads up display, because it's  fundamentally they're using the same types of contact lenses on their outer and inner shell,  they can do corrective lensing. So you can people could wear it as a contact lens. But from I think  their business purpose, they want this to be for medical fields, probably military, wherever people  would have their hands busy, but need to have some type of heads up information. And the user  interface aspect of is really interesting, because even though even as fast as our eye tracking might  be, and as responsive as it might be, like imagine if you had a full UI, but you could only see a  circle of it at once, like you would need some type of indicator of when information was being  updated in the periphery, or be extremely familiar with that UI to not, you know, I don't  want to have to mouse over or look over to notice that there's a icon in this right corner or left  corner, which is kind of how they're designing it right now. I will say the the smart contact

Transcript:  lenses in the new Batman movie is like the one thing that really irked me about that movie.  It's like you have contact lenses recording video, how's this working Batman? Where's it being  stored? What's charging it? I'm kind of right there with you too, Norm, like the the ickiness  of it. I've never gotten contacts, just because I think early on, I think I have a stigmatism,  and it was hard to get contacts to work with that. Now they work, and I'm just like too grossed out  by the idea. But I also test enough VR headsets where I'm like, I am I going to get contacts just  to better test VR headsets? Because I guess I have to, because it's the world we're living in. I don't  know. Thankfully, some have glasses insert, so I've been able to use those. Yeah, I think there's  one more story I want to dive into real quick, because we are rounding the end here. But FCC  chair Jessica Rosenworcel announced she is aiming to increase the broadband standard in the US from  25 megabits per second download to 100 and upload from three megabits per second to 20 megabits.  And I just want to hear your quick thoughts, guys, and Brianna, especially too, because you're  actually working in the political sphere, to kind of see like how this thing would work, or

Transcript:  would it even ever pass? I don't know. I mean, this is why a lot of what I wanted to run for  Congress is, you know, the Science, Space and Technology Committee in the House is just  criminal, like look who's serving on here, look at their qualifications, the people making your  tech policy in the United States. It's a joke. You read this, it's like, yes, of course, we've got to  do this. The question is, if like, you know, our broadband duopoly is actually going to,  are they going to fight it in court? Are they going to fudge it? You know, we've seen so many  false promises about this, just up and down the line, like I could get in here and talk about  you know, AT&T and Verizon, their false promises when they get dragged before Senate subcommittee  about not screwing over consumers so hard. I want to see this, obviously, do it, make it happen.  There's no reason for us to have this level of terrible internet with what we pay for it in the  United States, which is remarkably more expensive than other countries. Mandate is the only way

Transcript:  yeah, go ahead, Patrick. No, I was going to say is one of the interesting things about traveling  around RVing before we settled in St. Louis was seeing, you know, we would look at towns and be  like, oh, they have DSL within, you know, a finite distance of a particular switch. And it was amazing  to see there were some wireless, you know, over the air wireless plans like the one I had when I  left California. And it was funny because there was a startup they did their first group was in my  town. I lived in Alameda. And I was like, gosh, I don't know, should I trust this? And I was like,  okay, I promised myself as soon as anybody had a better deal than Comcast, I was gone. And I was  thinking like, I was trying to think of a single reason to stay with Comcast. And the only reason  I could come up with was this company could not deliver any internet. And it was amazing because  I went from like 70 ish up on the promise to 100 and three to eight or three to eight up and like  70 to 100 down and a cap and complaints to unlimited data, symmetrical speeds, considerably better  speeds, and I think a 40%, you know, cutting the cost. That company went out of business,  but other things have come up. And it's been amazing for me to see like, I can totally see  they're going to fight this tooth and nail 20 megabits up. That's ridiculous. You know,  we only give people a fraction of that now and they're miserable, but they're still paying us.  So why should we change like, you know, or maybe Comcast, I just remember like Comcast, you know,  going to do a merger and the call for response on that, they just got their asses kicked so hard.  People were calling people who never get political are like basically calling their local Congress  critters to just talk smack on Comcast. And so yeah, should they do that? They absolutely should,  you know, but they should also figure out ways of making this actually happen in the real world.

Yes, I always want all techies to get together,  because we can match like I feel if you got every techie in the universe together,  we can give some of these people their $10,000 that they want to pass terrible regulation on  this.
