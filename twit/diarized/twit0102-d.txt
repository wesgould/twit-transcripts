As soon as I heard you back on Buzz, I said, you're coming back on Twitter.  How long good you have a baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just about three and a half months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How's that been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In March.  It's been pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy or girl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy.  Name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Eli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great name.  His full name is Elias, in fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's going to Yale, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he has a dignified Ivy League kind of name for when he's a little bit older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Eli, Yale is Eli-Hugh, but you couldn't name a kid Eli-Hugh these days.  That would be too weird.  Elias is fine.  Thank you.  Eli.  I like it.  I like it too.  I have a little year.  I wish I'd known I would have brought a little Yale sweatshirt back for him.  You got to start him young.  It's true.  And also here from the Chicago Sun-Times.  Who was your alma mater, Andy Anotko?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Scenic, Troy, New York.  You went to RIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gateway to Schenectady.  But that's a great technical school.  That's like the MIT of the upper New York state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, much better than SUNY Stony Brook.  Their computer science, they were still doing Pascal when we were doing like Objective Pascal.  Oh.  You were way ahead of the game.  How embarrassing.  You made fun of those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's get to the stories.  Of course, the big story this Friday.  This Friday, the iPhone finally emerges from its cocoon.  They had a funny picture on Boing Boing.  Did you see this?  Apparently they changed the, they got a new hand model.  A guy with really big hands to make the iPhone look smaller on the Apple site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I absolutely love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think if Apple had a sense of humor, they'd color that new hand green.  Ho ho ho.  The iPhone.  Sorry.  Sorry.  We exposed the model to gamma radiation, but the phone is perfectly unchanged.  Just to show you, you know, it's built for punishment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that's, I don't know, I guess that's fair play in the ad business, but didn't they  think anybody would notice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it may be fair play in the ad business, but it's the changing the photo  that's going to get some obvious attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Too bad they can't change the hand to make the battery life look longer.  I don't know how they would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Now, apparently they're now saying they're swearing that you'll be able to talk for eight  hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would be amazing because typical smartphone usage is my, my N95 is a four hour talk time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Five hours.  Eight hours seems ludicrous.  Well, or, you know, you'll be able to surf the web for three minutes or talk for eight  hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said the, the movie time is seven.  Now remember when the manufacturers give battery time, I don't know, I usually divide it in  half.  Nevertheless, it's still longer than anybody else's published times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like, you get like eight hours of surfing time.  So long as it takes you like six hours to read the New York Times front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John, have you recused yourself from all iPhone coverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, you know, the problem I've had is that because I was critical only based on the fact  that people were praising it without seeing it.  I find that to be offensive.  I agree.  And then I ended up being like the guy on CNBC.  They keep dragging me back to do a, you know, be the anti iPhone guy.  iPhone hater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the official basher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the official basher and I'm getting fine.  Now I'm kind of getting sympathy for, you know, the whole project and I'm kind of rooting  for the thing.  I'm looking for a prediction.  If, if for no other reason, just to make it, you know, cause what, what, you know, we had  all these smartphones all the, all this time and then nobody's cared much about them or  they didn't, they rejected them actually, especially the Microsoft ones.  And you know, I have these, is it possible for Steve Jobs to just waltz in and become  the hot phone, you know, worldwide because everybody else is just out of touch with how  to even do a phone and they're all phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did that.  He did that with the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well all he really has to do to get a huge success is develop the first smartphone  that actually works as advertised.  I mean, I love, I love my windows mobile smartphone.  I think it's the nicest smartphone ever made, but still at this moment, it won't get my  mail until I pull the battery and restart it, which is a recurring problem.  There are many times when I wanted to flicker a photo.  Well, because, because unfortunately I have, I get to use every single smartphone that  gets released.  It's the best of a bad bunch is what you're saying.  I get to see a single smartphone that just keeps working, but at some point you're not  going to find yourself taking a picture that you then can't email someplace because for  some reason it lost its connection.  Which one, which one do you like?  Which one do you have?  I really like singular sells it as I think the 2125.  It's a folding like Star Trek.  It's an HTC phone.  Yeah.  HTC Star Trek.  Yeah.  Because I really wanted a phone that was like that, but in a, in a folding format because  it protects the keyboard, protects the screen.  But that thing is huge.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's no bigger than, it's no, it's a thick, larger than a razor.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing, by the way, we should mention about the iPhone, which is the crazy idea  of putting a glass front on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the other news.  Along with the new battery, they're going to replace the plastic.  A lot of people complained that the iPod scratched.  So they're going to put tempered glass on it.  Why is that crazy, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  You see, I mean, I guess it's, I mean, there's one glass in your ass is what I'm always thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well I don't think you'll want to sit on the iPhone anyway.  I mean, this is going to be a precious device.  You'll probably cover it in gold, carry it in a special leather pouch that might attach  to the inside of your coat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about you, but I have on occasion shoved the phone in my back pocket.  Sometimes you just want to go somewhere.  You think you're going to remember it's back there and you're not going to sit on it.  You know, I mean, there is a thing called butt dialing.  It's termed that for a reason because people sit on their phones and they're calling their buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the one thing we're sure of is that the iPhone will not butt dial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Unless you've got a very tiny finger tip on the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may not dial at all.  A little baby butt.  It may not dial at all.  Or a template butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You might have a bunch of boils back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the glass compared to the plastic, ew, is not a bad idea.  But I do wonder about whether it'll make it a lot heavier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, glass is heavier than plastic, absolutely.  So is this going to be some big...  Also more reflective, right?  I mean, that makes it a different...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how does the touch work on the glass?  Is it got some sort of a coating on it?  Is there like a...  Yeah, I wonder if that's true.  Is there a matrix across the top?  I mean, how does it work?  Is that...  Aren't the palms glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you look at a real iPhone, you don't see any sort of matrix.  You don't see any sort of microwaves across it.  It just looks like clear plastic or clear glass.  And even back in January, I was trying to goad them into outlining a scenario in which  my iPhone would get really, really scratched up.  So I'm saying, so I'm not going to need a slip case for it.  No.  No.  And then I showed them my absolutely filthy...  I usually wear it when I'm at a trade show.  I wear this gun belt that has a couple of pouches on it for my camera so I can keep  recording devices handy.  And it's like it's army surplus.  Inside, there's no coating.  There's no nothing.  It's just like really ragged canvas.  I said, so I could drop the iPhone in here and carry it around.  You're telling me it's not going to scratch.  And they said, nope, it's not going to scratch.  It's harder.  It's going to be harder even than an iPhone.  Maybe it'll be a sapphire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe it'll be sapphire.  And did you believe them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they had a lot of denial about the iPod scratches too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they said it didn't scratch for like the first month.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They swore up and down that it was not...  I don't know what people were seeing, but it wasn't scratching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No scratches.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not here.  What you try to do is you try to back them into a corner where they're either faced with  out and out, bald faced lying to you or telling you the truth.  You don't want to put them in a position where they can, you know, Clinton you out of, well,  you know, you didn't understand what I said or you didn't ask the right question.  Depends how you define scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, Andy, you're writing a book on it.  iPhone fully loaded due in October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They say there are 100 iPhones in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know at least one's in the hands of a journalist.  Mr. Walt Mossberg has one.  He got one on the 12th.  Do you have one, Andy?  Steven Levy's got one too.  Steven Levy's got one?  Yeah.  Do you have one, Andy?  Alas, I do not.  And you would tell us if you did.  It's not a non-disclosure thing.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be cagey and evasive if I did.  As a matter of fact, if I didn't, I would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Scratch your ear if you have one, but you can't tell us.  No, see, I used to be cagey and evasive about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, just last month I was doing an iChat appearance at a user group and  they were bugging.  They were certain that I had one.  I just wasn't showing it to them.  So just in frustration to move off of it to back in January, because I was on TV like  eight times in one week and I had to make, I made myself a fake looking, a fake eye.  iPhone.  I printed out the picture off the website at one to one, pasted it on a foam core.  It looks good.  Like, if you don't look at it, it looks good on TV.  And so, of course, I held it up to them and said, oh, it's the iPhone.  And because the devil was sitting on my shoulder, the back of it, I pasted the same screen,  only the landscape version.  Now in magic, there's this thing called the paddle move where you can pretend to show  people both sides of an object.  But by doing the special little move, you're not actually showing them both sides.  So I do, I use the paddle move to make them think that I was tilting it and the screen  was interactively changing.  Oh my God, that's sophisticated.  And at that point, exactly, at that point I was like, oh, I probably pushed this too  far.  Actually, you know, you can, you can take, you can take a Kodak 610 black version of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the 610 camera or even the seven, I think it's a 705, if you can get a black version  and you can run a movie on the screen that looks like, you know, that shows all the iPhone  things.  You'd have to, of course, coordinate your movement to the iPhone.  And you, but the cool thing about both those cameras is that they, as you change the, you  can move it, you know, horizontally and it will flip the screen and you can turn it upside  down, it'll flip the screen.  It keeps flipping the screen around.  So it has that same effect.  So you could be like turning the thing around, flipping the screen and fingering the thing.  Well, I was actually playing a movie and convinced somebody it was an iPhone.  I think that's how they made the commercial, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Giant hands.  So, so Levi's got one and Walt's got one.  I think that's so you think there are a number of journalists, John, who have have one.  Do you have one?  I would think if those two guys have them, there's got to be another half dozen at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Pogue's got to have one.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, basically.  Anybody seen that have one?  Anybody who's a big, you know, a big fan of the company probably has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, what it comes down to is the top of the pecking order are people who have an  international base.  And that's the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the International Paper Record.  They're definitely going to get things first.  Next level.  Next level.  New York Times, yeah.  Next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pogue's not really with the New York Times.  He's a contractor.  Markoff doesn't have one and he's with the Times.  Ah, Markoff, you'd think would have one.  They wouldn't.  He can't have one because he's covering it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So that he's not reviewing it.  He's covering it.  They do have rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have stupid rules.  That's a good rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm sure we're all going.  Well, no, I know John won't, but the rest of us will be somewhere waiting in line on  Friday the 29th.  Veronica.  I'm in line right now.  You won't be, Molly?  You're going to let Veronica do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also know I have no interest in the iPhone.  I mean, I have a professional interest in the iPhone, but I do not want to buy one.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to play a little game with you guys.  This is called iPhone headline predictions.  So the iPhone comes out Friday.  We'll see headlines in all the papers and the websites on Monday.  What is your, what prediction do you have for these headlines?  Now I'll give you my prediction.  iPhone more Newton than iPod.  That's my prediction for Monday.  I think people are.  So Andy, you have a prediction for the iPhone headline for a week from Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unfortunately, a comic strip called PVP online already stole the best headline possible.  Scott Kurtz.  Scott Kurtz.  Jesus has returned and he's a phone now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, Scott Kurtz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Molly, what do you think?  Will they love it?  Will they hate it?  Will it be kind of medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the headphone, the headline will be iPhone sales, not as brisk as expected.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Six hundred bucks.  Two year contract.  We now.  I got the headline.  What's the headline?  John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the headline?  Man killed an iPhone debacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might be right.  Fingers crossed you can't buy that sort of publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My headphone is so lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you, can you, I mean, I can't think of a consumer product introduction, except maybe  the PS3 that's anywhere near this kind of intensity.  It's unbelievable.  Windows 95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Windows 95 was just like this.  It was?  No.  Oh, they had the big banners off of that tower in Toronto.  They had lines.  People that were being covered all the 11 o'clock news had a bunch of guys lined up sleeping  in front of the stores.  It's the same thing.  It's just a bunch of bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was wondering about is like how, how many people are really going to be  in line for the iPhone?  Because I think that the audience, the potential audience for the iPhone seems to me to be  smaller even than the audience for the PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree.  I mean, it's Mac, Mac users first.  I mean, we don't even know how it's going to work on Windows.  You have to get it.  They've told us you have to get iTunes to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember that there were people who were waiting in line to buy the Newton message pad and  that cost $799 and was a totally unknown and unproven product.  Back then.  I think, see what I find interesting is the, the, the 6 p.m. launch time.  On the one hand, I think that this might be brilliant because they want to make sure that  local news can get live coverage of people lined up for the iPhone.  On the other hand, if you release something at 6 p.m. on a Friday, historically in the  news business, that means that you want to announce something after the stock market  closes before anything can possibly affect trading.  I don't think that's the reason why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that is the reason why, Andy.  I'm sorry.  Are you shorting?  Are you shorting Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm not shorting anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be too much of a hassle.  The fact of the matter is that they want to do this after the market closes on a Friday  so that, so the weekend can, you know, in case something weird happens, so the weekend  people would calm down instead of panic over the weekend and kind of reanalyze things and  then on Monday you won't have any kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More like so Apple has a chance to respond to anything that's starting to spread.  Remember how quickly they were talking about clamping down rumors about the AT&T service  plan, clamping down on rumors about the battery life being only like 90 minutes or something  like that.  That was a really quick response on their part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And probably so they can get a handle on bug fixes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it does, it does feel a little rushed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's what I'm being told right now is that stores, all the stores, AT&T and Apple stores  will close at 4 p.m.  FedEx will arrive between 4 and 5 with the phones.  They won't have the phones until then.  They'll open at 6 and there will be a forced firmware update that the phones as shipped  do not have the most recent firmware.  There'll be a forced firmware update on the phone before you could take it out of the  store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet there will be three or four forced firmware updates over the course of the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, probably over the year.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've said that they will announce data plan pricing and availability before the phone  ships on the 29th, so at least have some time to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now that's just from, you know, here's something that I've noticed about this.  The reason they're doing that is so they can get some more news out.  Don't forget this phone was supposed to come out on the 15th or something along, you know,  during the developers conference.  Post-account.  So they had all the public relations machinery ready to go for the timed for the 15th or  whenever.  The timing is now off by two weeks.  So they got to come up with the bogus.  They're stretching.  Yeah, they're stretching.  They're filling.  Exactly.  Which is why the glass front and all that.  That makes sense.  You don't think so, Andy and Ika?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't buy any of that.  For one thing, for one thing, the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Molly's fallen over or Eli just took the phone.  One or the other.  I'm not sure which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I really don't buy any of that.  I do think that there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to be happening in the  first week.  If if if we only get like two or three major patches within the first seven days, that's  going to be, I think, a very, very short stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I didn't have to review this thing.  I would not be buying it, but I do have to review it.  So I'll be in line.  Well, we have to review it.  I have to.  I'm in the next day.  I'm going to go on the radio and say, yeah, well, the iPhone's out.  We'll see what it's like as soon as somebody else reviews it.  I have to say something about it the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's always that's always good advice.  Anytime you're buying new technology, particularly when you're buying an Apple product,  because Apple, Apple is not a company that that stays with one build or one mechanism  or one way of putting things together for all their hardware.  Every time they come up with a redesign, it's not just new features.  It's not just new hardware.  It's also a new method of assembling the damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got a new I got a new headline.  Record number of eBay listings for iPhone on Monday.  There you go.  I think I think that every headline you're going to see is you want that one instead?  Well, no, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I do think it's going to sell out.  But I absolutely I can't I don't think maybe that the response to it will be as kind of  universally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do have I do have the winning headline.  And if you want to if you want to pay me five cents for every person who uses this headline  or a variation of it, you'll be out of business and I'll have a million bucks.  What is it?  It's a variation on I was right.  I called it.  Whatever I said, people who said it was going to suck.  Yes, indeed, it sucks.  Why you have to use your finger to dial things instead of just simply letting it hover in  midair and barking questions at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, for all the attention the iPhone, my cat's glaucoma is now gone because I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  put in my iPhone added and it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you so much.  God bless you, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you guys seen the the parody of the Microsoft Surface on Break.com?  Yes, I have.  I have to play it.  I have to play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your computer will be a big ass table with pictures of other people's kids all over it.  Instead of actually playing with your kids, you could just look at video of them playing  by themselves.  You'll smile knowing you only pay ten thousand dollars to do it.  And if your mom has ten thousand dollars laying around her house that she has nothing to do  with, she can get one too and then you can send her a postcard for free.  That's the power of Microsoft Surface.  Now consider this.  Instead of using one of today's more popular compact devices to get directions to where  you're going, why not use a device the size of a small car to do the same job?  In the future, getting tanked with your friends is going to be a whole lot more fun because  you'll be sitting at a table that makes something cool happen every time they bring you a drink,  which you'll want to do over and over.  Instead of interacting with actual human beings, you can just order your food right at your  table.  If you've still got any credit left on your card after you buy the table computer, why  not think about a new phone or two phones?  That's when you can do some really cool stuff.  And remember all that money you spend on iTunes to get your favorite songs?  Get ready to do it again, but this time for your new table computer.  The future is here and it's not an iPhone, it's a big-ass table.  Take that, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And credit to SarcasticGamer.com for that.  That is, I have to say, very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is clever.  Although I think the big-ass table looks kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It looks cool, but you wouldn't buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I wouldn't buy an iPhone either.  There you go.  I think they both look equally cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had one thing right.  If that thing's ever at a bar, that's going to be quite cool.  You think it's glass or plastic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has to be glass, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does it interact with vomit?  It better be plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what you're missing, you actually have to go to...  It has to be Lucite.  You have to go to SarcasticGamer.com to see the video.  Of course, when they put the...  They're just re-narrating the Microsoft Surface video.  You put the glass down and it knows the glass is there.  You put a phone down and it knows the phone is there.  Finally, Microsoft has their own Knowledge Navigator video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's exactly it.  That's a cool thing.  That's a cool video.  Please spend the money on actually building something one-tenth this cool,  even though I know you're not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're talking about the famous, what is it, about 1988 and 1989 Apple video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, under Scully, this one.  He had his picture taken.  I think he actually had this made so he can have his picture taken  It's the fold-out one that turns into one big, actually one big 11 by 17 Surface.  It's got a guy with a bow tie in it.  Some twerp and a bow tie says, you got mail today, Stephen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should I read your letter for you?  Your mother called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that was it.  All right, let's move on.  I think we've done enough iPhone news and gosh knows we'll know everything by Friday.  It's just fun to watch.  It's interesting to watch all the hype.  Apple's certainly done a good job of getting the attention.  We'll see if they've done a good job of building the phone.  Time will tell.  In the age-old TV trope, only time will tell.  Michael Moore said, steal my movie, last time he put out a movie,  and this time they took him out his word.  Sicko, which won't come out until iPhone Day, June 29th, is already on YouTube.  It's been there for a week.  And well, I guess they pulled it down, but it was up on YouTube and it's on all the BitTorrents.  He says he doesn't care.  He's just glad people are watching his movie.  Some say it might even be his idea because there's stuff shot in Cuba.  He's afraid the US will interdict the movie because he's violating the ban on Cuba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interesting.  There's a new way to protect your movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I would put it past him entirely.  There have definitely been rumors for a long time that networks have done similar things  with shows that they kind of wanted to pilot on a sly or build buzz for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, Michael Moore was on the Sunday morning shootout with Peter Guber and Peter Barth  discussing this issue about the Cuban footage, and they actually tried to confiscate the movie.  He tried to take, when he took it to Cannes, they almost kept him from getting it into the show at all.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The US government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of surprises me because you can legally go to Cuba if you're a journalist.  Or you're on a cultural exchange.  There are mechanisms whereby you can legally go to Cuba without worrying about it.  A lot of people just go there as a kick and they go through Mexico or Canada.  They have a special procedure where they give you a visa that they remove from your passport  because if the US sees any stamps from Cuba, you get fined.  Well, actually there's a lot of events that also take place in Cuba, like fishing tournaments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's okay for you to go there as long as you don't spend any money there, as long as you have special documentation.  But don't dare make a movie there, I guess.  Now, what's the source on the idea of the government trying to confiscate the movie, especially at Cannes?  Michael Moore.  Okay, there you go.  I rest my case.  No, I'm not saying I'm saying that, you know, I'm not even saying trust but verify with Michael Moore.  I'm saying say, that's nice, Michael, and then do your own research.  Well, it could be Bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, he does have a bone to pick, let's face it.  But I like it, it sounded good, it's believable.  Of course, you know, he has a promotional machine.  I agree with you 100%.  The guy's like a, you know, I mean, we find out much many years later that he could talk to Roger Smith at GM and much of that movie was a bunch of BS.  Oh, interesting.  There's a whole expose on that.  He apparently had a lot of footage, but he created this phony documentary that he could never get a hold of the guy.  In fact, they had meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he spoke to him twice, once before he started filming, once on a different project.  Oh my.  There was a group that was making a documentary on Michael Moore that was not out to get him, but they started to get, they started to have the terms of the movie dictated to them by the way that Michael Moore's people were, you know, were dealing with them.  So that's why that hit the press like about two or three months ago.  I mean, I spent a lot of time researching Bowling for Columbine and I interviewed a lot of the people that he interviewed and I was doing fact checking all the way through it.  And I actually wound up getting, having an email exchange with Michael Moore.  I'm saying that I don't believe anything in his movies until I verified myself or someone that I know verifies it.  That's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't argue with it, but I'm just telling you, he's the one who said that and it could be a promotional BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like Harvey Weinstein also said it, says that the US government is attempting to impound the negative US Treasury, but is the Weinstein Company, one of the movies though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not a bad, not a bad thing to happen to a movie. Remember when Banned in Boston meant that movie was going to sell some tickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think there's some laws against pretending that the government's doing something that they're not doing.  So it'd be interesting to see how this shakes out.  Unless you're the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The government can say that as much as they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop pretending!  Those government guys are outside my door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess I wouldn't be surprised if Michael Moore made it up, but Weinstein does seem pretty detailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they had to reroute it to Canada.  The information in the incredibly super top secret release that he put on his website was that he sent a negative of the film to Canada for safekeeping just in case the government decided, as retribution for Fahrenheit 911,  they're really, really angry with him for helping Bush get elected.  Don't ever forgive him.  Boy, that hurt, boy.  You know, I'm like, okay, that's very, very nice.  I want to keep, I want to miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I can see that Andy Anatko is no fan of Michael Moore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and I fear we may be veering into distinctly non-technical territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, we'll move on.  Which is fine.  According to a user at UbuntuForums.org, he was able to get an Ubuntu installation of Linux to validate as a genuine copy of Microsoft Windows.  I love this.  There's a video of it.  I mean, I suppose he could have faked the video.  He used Wine, you know, the Windows emulator, and IE for Linux to actually say, hey, I'm Windows.  And the guy, and Microsoft said, sure, go ahead and download that copy of Windows Defender.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's true.  But it is funny.  Windows, you know, we're all for security, security, security.  And something waltzes in as a fake and just waltzes out.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the thing that hurts even more is that even Microsoft admits, I can't remember what the number was, but something like one in 20 legitimate Windows users still get dinged by Windows Genuine advantages being pirates.  I think the actual number turned out to be something like five million.  It was a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like really a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I've had a run in with the, you know, once in a while I've changed a hard disk or something, and all of a sudden the machine decides to tell me that this is no good and I can't use the XP, whatever, anymore.  But they do give you a phone number to call, and it's always been resolved, at least for me, within five minutes.  You just tell them, you know, whatever it is, they give you a code, you punch it in, and bang, you're back in business.  It's never really been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hi, this is John C. Dvorak.  No, no, they don't know me from Adam.  Yeah, these are people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These people are in Bombay.  They do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But still, it does rankle, doesn't it?  I just had an update.  I took an old Dell laptop out of storage and had to update everything to get it working right, and it validated just fine, so props to Microsoft.  But even though I'm like, I have to prove to you that I have a right to use the software that I purchased.  Oh, how interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what rankles the most, I think you're right.  Why do I have to do this?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mother of me.  You go to Linux, you won't have this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, sir, may I have another...  Thank you, sir, may I have another...  Teenagers, according to the register, prefer mobile phones to sex.  Actually, it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sex is definitely involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a mobile life survey from Carphone Warehouse, so maybe you could sit at the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they keep on vibrating, maybe that helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One in three people would want one million pounds to give up their mobile,  and those aged between 16 and 24 would prefer to give up sex for a month  than to do without their hands.  Actually, you know, I have given up sex for a month to keep my cell phone,  so I don't think that that's so far...  Your wife plays hardball.  She says, it's me or the cell phone, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then again, I've seen your phone, it's a Nokia N95.  That's not quite so hair-brained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would give up a lot for that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm very happy with this phone, and you know, if you know what to do with it,  if you know how to treat it just right,  the battery life actually will get you through a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My darling, I can't get enough of your phone, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Baby, baby.  New Wi-Fi distance record recorded by Emano Pietros Nolli.  He's president of the Escuelo Latinamerica de Redis,  which is the networking school of Latin America,  a Wi-Fi link between computers in El Guila and Platillon Mountain in Venezuela.  382 kilometers, that's 238 miles.  He wasn't using a Pringles can, I don't think.  Got three megabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who cares? This is like bogus news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, I'm giving you a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is clearly...  It's not even real Wi-Fi when it goes that far,  so they have to disable that, so now it's hacked.  All right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to ask the hackers to go outside.  Quick, no, another three miles into the woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We almost got it. We got some more bars.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And far, far away, yes.  All right, this is actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, how the heck did you get a tan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I buried the lead, I apologize.  The real big story of the week is Terry Semel stepping down at Yahoo  or being pushed, I'm not sure which.  Did we talk about that last week?  No, we haven't talked about it.  Semel, in fact, it happened on Monday, so we couldn't have talked about it.  And it was the guy brought in from Hollywood to turn Yahoo around,  obviously, and John, you've been very critical of Yahoo's strategy.  He didn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wrote up this here and there,  and I actually wrote about why they should get rid of Semel  and submitted it to PC Magazine a couple of weeks ago.  You were right.  And so now it's going to come out in the magazine,  it looks like old news, so it's going to make me...  which I find annoying, but I have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why you should do more netcasts and fewer columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been saying this after it happened too, but  the point is this was a stupid idea from the beginning,  but the interesting thing to me is the fact that he walked out of there  besides his $71 million a year that he was making  and he apparently only showed up two or three times a week  if he was ever there.  Oh, is that true, really?  He was really hanging off.  Alleged, but anyway, according to Market Watch,  he kept cashing out the whole time he was there  and he walked away with...  in stock, he's cashed out over $680 million with the stock,  more than anybody else in the company,  and what this says to me, the guy gets brought in,  he doesn't really do anything,  he's credited with saving the company,  but he got in at the bottom,  so a monkey would have saved the company.  I think we can prove that.  for doing nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can prove that everything you say is true  because Eric Schmidt, his rival at Google,  has shown great leadership at Yahoo!  and will be much missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We love that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come back, Terry!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, anyway, you can't fault the guy for  taking advantage of a bunch of dummies,  but that's what he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  38-year-old Jerry Yang back  on top of one of the original Yahoo! founders.  He's going to run...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry's the one who brought him in.  Oh, really?  There's another article, by the way,  in 2003 in Fortune magazine,  when Jerry came in,  he didn't know how to use email,  he never surfed the web.  His email was done,  his secretary would go to the computer  and print out all his email,  then give it to him,  he'd scribble notes,  and then she'd go finish,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  which I thought was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's the system I'm using these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very effective.  You just basically have banned an email,  but that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So everything added up to this being just a big joke  and it was amazing that he was there as long as he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was at Warner Brothers,  he was a Hollywood type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a big shot in Hollywood.  And that's what Yahoo! started doing,  where they had Tom Cat and Nicole Richie  and Paris Hilton coming and going.  Oh, yeah, that wins the geeks.  When your biggest press is a Tom Cruise visit  to the Yahoo! campus,  what are you spending money on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And acquiring a lot of companies that haven't turned...  I mean, they have a great portfolio.  They've got Delicious and Flickr  and it just goes on and on,  but they're not turning a profit here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they've got good revenues,  but Google is just killing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  16% falling profits in the first three months of 2007,  I think that probably really did it.  Right, as things are booming.  Yeah, it shouldn't be going that way.  Of course, the stock price is probably the real reason he's gone.  While Google's well over $500, they're down at around $25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because they're in media company territory.  Google has managed to tie all of the weird things they do together  with this idea that they're either organizing  or creating a giant advertising network,  whereas Yahoo! doesn't seem to have that focus.  in addition to trying to be utilities and advertising network  and they just need to quit buying things for a while  and figure out what they want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no coherent strategy.  What is her name, Decker, the woman they brought in as president?  Susan Decker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Susan Decker. Do you know anything about her?  The CFO. She's a bean counter.  She has a very interesting background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody needs to count beans at Yahoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you really check her out though,  you'll find that her background is in M&A.  Oh, we talked about this before.  That's right.  So they brought her in, she became the CFO  and she's the president,  but because of her background,  to like, you know, I don't know, sell off parts of the company,  merge with somebody else, buy somebody else,  be bought. Not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Weird rumor floating around that Google might buy Apple.  I love that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just kind of one of those drool rumors  like along the lines of Apple will buy Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. I'd like Apple to buy Nintendo,  but Google buying Apple's Cuckoo.  Apple's Cuckoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and you're contracted to submit something to the website  but you just don't have anything.  And you just say, wait a minute,  this blog post I was about to write,  what if I just delete the words,  wouldn't it be cool if from the lead paragraph,  hey, look, it's a newest item.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can go home and get waffles now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  which keeps going around too.  Do you think though now that we,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that one is that Microsoft admitted  that they had been in talks.  I think that one was a fairly credible...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Talking about something, yeah, we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That at least was in the Wall Street Journal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and not Mashable.  That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I've said this before, but I was also dubious  So my idea, or my track record on these short-term predictions  has not been good recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty hard.  Well, the solution is usually ask yourself  but still not very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you mean like the AOL Time Warner merger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that, okay, that was fueled by money.  That, you know, quickly vaporized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's even worse.  I mean, I think at least both Google and Apple  don't do exactly the same thing.  Right.  I don't see any connect, any way that Microsoft  is doing it in that sense.  They're both, you know, kind of in this,  except for the operating system part of it.  Well, no, because, you know, MSN and Live Search

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and all these other net services  are just not getting as much traction  as they should be getting  I really think that, you know, again,  and we're firmly in the realm of rumor,  but I could see Microsoft saying,  look, let's just buy the portal technology we want.  Let's just buy the search technology we want  and call it done and move on.  That's kind of what Yahoo does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And buy the user's loyalty, too.  by getting eaten by a bigger fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess Microsoft's the top of that food chain.  if they do it that way.  It's like, let's take our good,  let's take in, here's a Cadillac company  decides to buy, you know, some,  the YouGo company slapped the Cadillac logo on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Do you think MSN Search is the Cadillac

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's going to exaggerate?  Maybe I should have said a Renault or a 2CV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, they're more on the...  Really? You like it that much better?  No, no, I'm saying that's kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they're the same.  I don't buy that at all.  They're parallel tracks, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a Google Apple Nexus, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, Eric Schmidt's flashing his iPhone.  YouTube is now...  Yeah, Eric Schmidt is on the board.  Yeah, YouTube is now for sure on the iPhone.  I just installed the YouTube update to Apple TV.  Never mind.  I don't understand why that Avril Lavigne video  is the number two most...  37 million downloads.  I'm trying to figure out what's the appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that reminds me.  Thanks for the reminder.  I ran into this guy that...  I forgot all about this, too.  This is embarrassing.  But I ran into this guy.  I'm not going to go into too many details,  any video system, especially YouTube,  and he's going to describe this.  Why is this getting so many numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I believe this, because I can't see any reason  why that should be the number two video.  I mean, it just makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he can game anything.  I said, well, help me out here.  He says, yeah.  I said, well, let me find something.  I just like somebody gives you this opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially when there's so many other great videos on YouTube.  There's a 12-year-old kid in Fresno  and then that video gets ignored.  It's all gone mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd rather watch.  It's funny to see this.  The video really is bad quality,  so when you blow it up to a 50-inch screen,  it really doesn't look so good.  But at least if you squint  and you get far back from it,  at least you can watch it.  Apparently, they're going to do H.264 for the iPhone.  That's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I'm just concerned about  to the whole library.  It's not the permitted videos that are cool.  It's the ability to see tonight shows from 1981  that are just lost forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't you think?  Because they're re-encoding their library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For sure on the iPhone,  But on the Apple TV, it's not.  On the Apple TV, it's not.  It's actually taking the top most watched videos  just like you would see on YouTube.  So you can see a lot.  Viacom stuff, all the stuff that's on those lists.  How do you have time to watch anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's watching stuff now.  We're just not being very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's actually true.  I'm sorry.  I thought this was an interesting story.  The head of the US Air Force Intelligence  and Surveillance on Thursday said,  data available through online mapping software  like Google Earth is a danger to security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said, you can't undo it,  but he says it's really, it gives,  it's huge.  It's something that was a closely guarded secret  not that long ago.  Now everybody has access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what?  Yeah, I mean, add another one to the list.  I can look over the Albany, Berkeley area thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they still got big ditch where a big Target story is.  No, it's not completely up to date.  Not up to date and that's nonsense.  I mean, these guys are just freaks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that people like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It may not be all the way nonsense.  They're freaks with guns.  Yeah, exactly.  They want to keep you in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although it's probably somewhat reasonable  that you could use it for strategic planning  in a way that is not desirable.  How about just sending somebody over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and walk in the area?  I mean, come on.  The aerial view is very helpful.  Google Earth, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not like it's valueless.  It's just that I find it hard to really take  these sort of complaints seriously.  I was at the MIT flea market on Sunday.  These are the sort of conversations  you have at the MIT flea market.  I met a guy who had to give a presentation.  I shouldn't give any details,  but at an office that you've all heard of  for a person in the military  and he was setting up his presentation  and he had to get a password  to activate the console  and he just guessed and said 1, 2, 3, 4  and of course it was the right password.  It worked.  Three minutes later, people with guns  were asking him who the hell he was  and what he was doing with the computer  but it's like, you're worried about Google Maps  and you're not willing to change your password  to something that you would not use  on a tourist or vinyl-dipped luggage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you believe Ocean's 13,  those three minutes were enough to break the bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Darn it, he gave away my luggage combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you a spoiler.  There's no kissing in Ocean's 13.  My wife was very upset, Molly.  There's no kissing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got all these good-looking guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and there's no kissing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of each other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, of girls or anything.  There's only one woman and it's Ellen Barker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's kissing.  So this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I get out of the house, away from the baby,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need to find a kissier movie.  I'm going to get a kissier movie, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to get to the 10 most hated words  on the internet.  This is from Buzz Hell Loud.  No kissing, riboflavin'.  But it does explain why there were  844 breaches of the Department of Homeland Security computers  in 2005, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Andy, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've got bigger problems.  That's a huge problem  and they're being grilled in Congress right now  once they admitted that.  They're not pure computers, however,  they admit that some classified leakage may have occurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does the Department of Homeland Security...  My password's not a little less correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ...infection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys are like 13.  Why does the Homeland Security Department  have any unsecured computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, a good point.  This is unbelievable.  They found on DHS machines password dumping programs,  multiple viruses and spyware,  computers containing IRC bots,  and firewalls.  I'm sorry, I said leakage.  I think it's a funnier word.  Classified data spillage, actually,  is the word for spillage  is the technical term.  They plan to spend $332 million on security in 2007.  Oh, what a scam.  A third of a billion dollars!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  103 of us get together and form some security company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could be a consultant for the Department of Homeland Security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is what lends color to every time I hear about  these massive government conspiracies  and these massive plans.  The government consists of tens of thousands  of individual people,  some of whom just screw up.  I don't think that this is a problem of one failed agency  or one failed policy.  It's that there are so many little offices  that some of them follow the rules,  some of them don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I worked in a company that did SEC filings  where you could not get onto any part of the internet at large.  Everybody's worked for a company  that won't even let you check your email.  If that organization existed,  that says, I'm sorry, you can't get to a website  that's going to pop up and auto download

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  or from Gator or whatever.  Well, how about this?  Officials have taken 1,500 accounts offline.  No classified information, but they got in.  That's an inside job.  Well done, lad.  It's humiliating.  It's got to be humiliating.  This is stolen from Buzz Out Loud, Molly,  I admit, the 10 most hated words on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't even there for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good. Perfect.  I know. Perfect.  UK pollsters have completed a survey  on the web's most hated words,  the abominations that threaten to turn English  into a long series of utterances at the top of the list,  the word folksonomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, God.  I'm with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Buzz Sphere.  Even blog, people don't like.  Neticat.  Blook. I don't know what Blook is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Vlog.  Don't you remember?  Don't you remember twit 57, John?  The twit that will live in infamy.  I was at a Jaiku party on, when was that?  Tuesday.  It was really fun.  And somebody came up to me and said, twit 57.  I was there.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  everybody what vlog meant.  Over Macho Grande.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll never be over Macho Grande.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like cookie.  Cookie?  Wiki?  Wiki?

Transcript:  become the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  management at a certain company that remain unnamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like Wiki.  I don't mind the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it because, you know, WikiWiki.  It's the WikiWiki bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ars Technica suggests some others.  Ajaxify.  Web 3.0.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Crowdsourcing.  See, I use that a lot.  I like crowdsourcing.  roll.  Podcast.  on the twit network.  They've been just really great.  I am an audible subscriber.  I know you are too, Molly, for years.  I've read hundreds of books by downloading them from  audible.com and putting them on my iPod or other MP3 device.  The nice thing is you can get those books back.  I have some great kids books too.  There's some wonderful...  You'll see Molly in a couple of years.  Boy, for travel, it's great.  So both Molly and Andy have books to suggest.  They're a little book club portion of the show.  You'll have to pick one.  for free at audible.com slash twit.  Now I have to make a couple of caveats here because I played  with it and I made a few mistakes.  First of all, it is U.S.  only.  anytime in the next two weeks.  you owe nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when you do that.  I have a suggestion too.  I'm sure everyone's raving about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nixon and Kissinger.  Is that on audible?  You know, I read a book on audible and by the way,  I've read them.  It's not listened to.  Do you say read or listen?  I say read.  But there's a great book on Nixon and Kennedy that Chris  Wallace wrote, not Chris Wallace,  Chris Matthews wrote that is fantastic.  Did you know that Nixon and Kennedy were best buddies  when they were in Congress and Nixon made a contribution  to Kennedy's campaign fund.  Really?  They were both junior congressmen  and really liked each other, respected each other  quite a bit in the 50s.  But it's a fascinating.  I'm sure it's like this in Kissinger.  I'll have to read both.  So that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's your recommendation, Annie and Natko?  This is one of my favorite books on tape ever.  I actually bought it originally on tape for $1.98  at a salvage sale because it's a great book.  It's going to be like funny stories about Shatner,  but it actually was one of the best books.  I actually wanted to buy the real book  and reading it to get all the parts I missed.  Not I Kirk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, it's To the Stars,  the autobiography of Star Trek's Mr. Sulu  by George Takei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and he's totally cool now again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, read by George Takei  and that's part of the grandeur of this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think so too, that this Takei is too good.  That's the only reason you're like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's because I must have listened to this book

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  all the way through like three times.  It's in your brain.  about Shatner, but it actually,  he starts about his childhood  as growing up,  his role as an actor,  and then being politically active  in the growth of LA.  All right, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to do a contest here  and this is so good.  Who is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Listen closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fans flew in from all around the world.  The convention was a tribute to Gene Roddenberry,  the creator of Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, what's your guess?  and the real guy who was that was  is that Anatko, you've got to slow it down just even more.  It's not quite mellifluous enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Her singing was sublime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the drinking game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every time you hear him say the word sublime,  you take a drink, take a shot of Jäger.  You'll be on the floor in like 40 minutes.  But you're saying it's a good book too.  It really is a good, compelling book.  Again, not only did I buy the book on tape,  because I wanted to read.  But this is also the abridged version,  but it really is.  It's like three hours long.  It really is a very good book.  To the stars, the autobiography of Mr. Swain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there is Dirt Against Shatner,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so don't be disappointed there  So Molly, what's yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really enjoyed listening to Al Franken's Lies and Lying Liars.  Oh, I listened to that too.  Because he reads it.  So it's read by Al Franken,  and then he's got all the three new stories  I know, I didn't, why do I have to go after him?  Come on, he has a good headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He is so funny, and you're absolutely right.  When he reads it,  you hear his voice, frankly,  when you read the book, you hear his voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do, and so then to listen to it is outstanding.  And he has a bunch of the actual media clips,  like clips from the Rush Limbaugh show  and clips from radio.  It's just a really rich listening experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very good book to listen to.  Here's my impression of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty good, huh?  Yeah, not bad.  Yeah, especially when you talked over it.  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're like a ventriloquist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, you got me.  I have to learn that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got me.  These are, you can pick one, not all three,  because you're going to want to hear all three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should subscribe to Al Franken.  You should subscribe to Al Franken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should subscribe because he has unlimited books or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, here's the audible.com slash twit.  They have a number of subscription policies.  I don't know what you call them,  but the $14.95 you get a book a month plus additional credits.  And then there are other levels you can subscribe.  It's kind of like Netflix where you get,  but the nice thing is you don't send them back.  How many books a month do you get up, Amali?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do the yearly plan because I think it works out to 12,  I guess 12 books one a month.  But it's like a little cheaper than the $14.95.  I was doing two a month for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I drove in, two hours a day.  Yeah, I started it when I was commuting too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually had to downgrade the plan  also very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, but long.  And it's 50 hours.  That is worth 50 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so worth it though.  And I had to downgrade my plan because I was spending so much time on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's so true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting to me, I think people overlook is  the poor announcer, he has to talk for 50 hours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, 50 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know how many hours of podcasts I do every month, John C. DeVore?  Well, yeah, but you could talk forever, Leo.  I do well over 50 hours a month, so I have no sympathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think you should get some contracts or you could do some books.  I know, and then Leo and I should compare our favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my favorite readers,  I have my favorite narrators that I always look for books that they do.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You start to become a fan of the narrator,  He does a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if he does any more, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, yes, there's quite a few.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've heard George Takei and a couple of the different Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He does.  Outstanding.  That would be great.  Oh, now, see, this ad has gone on way too long.  See, I've just been looking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  there's three more books I want to recommend,  books we were talking about before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've got it.  You can come back, audible.com slash twit.  Pick a book, you get it for free.  You'll subscribe to Audible.  you'll want to download some more.  They're just wonderful.  Thank you.  We do thank Audible for their support.  I love books.  That's how it works.  But that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, it's so fun to talk about books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I enjoy it.  I see another podcast.  I think you might be right.  The Leo Laporte Book Club.  We're thinking about, Audible maybe this.  I don't know if they would do this,  how they have the picks section.  They should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do a show.  I could come up with like five, just browsing,  now I've found like six, I'm like, wow,  they got The King of Comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, The King of Comedy is on there.  Then I christened the Hotel Hotel.  I can't finish that sentence.  A proposed amendment to the current copy protection license covering DVDs  would ban all DVD copying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That'll solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What an interesting idea.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The amendment is formally referred to as the unknown specification amendment.  It's being considered by the Content Protection Advisory Council of the DVD CCA.  If it's enacted, it would become binding in 18 months.  It's an amendment that would be adopted,  I'm confused, adopted by the CCA.  Yeah.  Which is, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a front for somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The front has come at a time when at least one network is already experimenting with  the ability to allow backups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the reason this happened is because of the DVD jukebox,  which won its case, right?  They defeated a suit by the Copy Control Association,  because they copied the DVD.  It's not going away.  It's in the machine.  So what's the problem?  Anyway, if the, I'm not sure what happens if the CCA adopts this.  Yeah.  Does it make it law?  I mean, what does it mean?  Does it mean you go to jail or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They come knocking?  It's Blu-ray and HD DVD who are worried,  were already working on a final spec for legal copies,  for managed copies of Blu-ray and HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, stuff along the lines of the old dat tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be, you know, heavily DRM'd, but  but it's, they're working it into the AACS.  There's another rabbit-roof, friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I got to take off.  Yeah, me too, actually.
