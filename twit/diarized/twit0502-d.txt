Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's made the world a far better place and he has contributed hugely to it  I have some issues with anybody who says that somebody else's choice of technology  Makes them a prisoner and that the real way not to be a prisoner is to use the same products that you want to use  So I do that's his full full on a little bit at his notion that anybody who's using  Software that doesn't meet his standards as a prisoner  Having said that he's made my life better.

Transcript:  Linux wouldn't exist without the GNU project Linux was a kernel Linus Torvalds wrote the kernel but without  Stuff on top of the kernel you got nothing and almost everything in most modern Linux  This is based on GNU and it's fact kind of funny because I just got my learning GNU emacs book. This was Richard Stallman's  proff I think really first well-known program was emacs and  And to this day still widely used by hardcore geeks everywhere  But we but Linux which means if you use Android you owe a great debt of gratitude to Richard Stallman

It has to always be GNU Linux  That's his that's one of his

Start time: 635.20
End time: 639.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 640.75
End time: 697.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Anyway, amazing guy and I noticed this New Yorker article refers to GNU Linux throughout  So I have a feeling that they signed the writer and to sign the waiver  Only Richard Solomon say okay New Yorker you could do a profile of me, but you gotta call it GNU Linux  That's this is a man who's pure of heart. Yeah, you're a purpose  30 years ago this month GNU  The GNU manifesto was published I thought we'd mention that as we began the show  Let's see  You know, I've been out of town for a couple of days did anything happen this week anything important Windows 10 is coming out this summer  Although as Paul Thurotte quickly pointed out summer could be any time between June 20th and September 20th  So they had originally say Windows 10 would be this fall  But it still could be in a way, you know late

Start time: 699.63
End time: 704.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2015 did they ever actually  Assume fall. I think they said fall didn't they they said yeah

Start time: 705.56
End time: 715.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the most important thing about it was actually the story that Ed did about the fact that Microsoft's gonna  You know make it available for free even outside of China

Start time: 716.62
End time: 744.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna basically say even if you have a pirated version of Windows will allow Windows 7 or 8 will allow you to upgrade  Yeah, Windows 10 for free  version any version now actually that really does make it any version because if you're running Windows 95 just steal a copy of Windows 7 and  You can upgrade  This is this is you know Ed you've been covering Bill Gates and Microsoft for a while  This is a dramatic shift from the Bill Gates Microsoft

Start time: 745.82
End time: 777.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, it really is although they're basically what they're trying to do here is just get out of the paid upgrade business  except among enterprise customers they want this to be basically your last Windows upgrade ever and then  Once that happens, you're just on a continuous servicing model and they say it'll be you know, it'll be free  You'll buy Windows  It'll just be included into the price of a new device that you get but any upgrades updates new features and everything  Those will just those will just appear through Windows update no more

Start time: 779.06
End time: 801.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No more paying for upgrades. I assumed more that it was and maybe this is hand-in-hand with what you that  It's really to reassure developers. Look, we're gonna catch everybody up  We're gonna make sure that them because right now  The majority of Windows user I think still use XP. Isn't it still more than  Seven seven but XP is a significant

Start time: 802.60
End time: 802.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Start time: 804.02
End time: 825.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what Microsoft would love is to tell developers look everybody's gonna use Windows 10  They're gonna use this which is good for developers because there's a unified development  System so you can write for any Windows 10 device  Right once it works on Windows phone works on Xbox one. It works on desktops. It works on tablets  Is this not a message to developers

Start time: 825.86
End time: 965.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a plot I think that's part of it but this is also a platform play, you know  I mean that they they want that platform. They want the Windows platform to remain  You know the largest single computing platform in the world, which it  you know Android is is  Creeping up and you also have Chromebook Chrome making some progress  And I mean the thing is they want and they want Windows as a platform to remain relevant  They are it is big. It's significant that they are, you know  Giving up this sort of honeypot of software upgrades, you know, they that's what's made Microsoft Microsoft  They extracted all that value out of the PC ecosystem turned all the PC makers into  you know low margin providers of hardware and they extracted all the value out of that ecosystem by  Making people pay for Windows making the the providers pay for Windows and making users pay for you know Windows upgrades  but you know that that ship has kind of left the the the station or left the port and you know  I think that like, you know, I was saying they're essentially giving up on that upgrade, you know that model  Enterprises will still pay for upgrades because they'll pay for software and that's gotta be the bulk of the revenues  That's where a lot of the money is. Yeah, but the the for for consumers  They will and small businesses too. They will no longer have to pay for Windows  To have the platform, but you know the trade-off that Microsoft's, you know  Making there is with by having that platform be ubiquitous then they can make money off of a software store  You know the way it same way Apple does off of selling you software through the store of selling  You know also media  Movies and TV shows and books and those kinds of things, you know  They can make their cut off that so but in order to do that  You have to have a really big platform the bigger your platform is the more widespread it is the more money you can make  Off of all of that stuff and so that's the trade-off  For something like this  I mean the thing is is you know  Can you trade that that platform the platform has to get bigger and bigger and bigger and more widespread to make up for?  You know all those sort of pennies that you make on those transactions  You have to you know make up for a lot of software licenses that you're no longer kind of selling but that's what?  You know, that's my interpretation of where they're going with this

Start time: 966.18
End time: 968.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of telling they did this in China too. This was at Winhek

Start time: 969.54
End time: 990.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In China, there's something to back up a little bit there too. It's something you said Leo that I want to  Amplify a little bit you you you said, you know doesn't XP still have a lot of usage  If you include China it does  Yeah, there's there are hundred those users never paid for it, but they're using it, right?

Start time: 990.70
End time: 993.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right there are hundreds of minutes so, you know, there's all sorts of

Start time: 996.12
End time: 1055.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Squishy  Wiggly not very accurate statistics floating around about which platforms and which operating systems are being used  But when you get big numbers for Windows XP in general that is counting the  The pirate population in China now  There are also a lot of enterprises in the Western  In the Western world in the developed world, but for the most part those companies are paying fairly hefty support  Contracts for the right to continue running a no longer supported operating system, but XP is it's it's shrinking very very quickly  And Windows 7 right now the whole thing with Windows 10 is  To prevent Windows 7 from turning into the next Windows XP and having it in 2020  Nobody ever upgrades  Yeah, that's what that's all about. So XP is actually has more market share than Windows 8 and 8 one together

Start time: 1056.96
End time: 1109.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is I don't know this  There's a lot of different measurements. This is from net market share. This is probably close to the actual  Percentage is 55 or 56 percent Windows 7  Or 56 percent Windows 7  19 percent XP  10% 81 only 3.558 which shows it  In a way that the test that Microsoft did of getting people from moved to 8 to 8.1 was a success  so maybe they they sense there that they could do better by the way Mac is is  Next at 3.55 percent. So it's kind of way behind their Windows Vista 2.11 percent  and Linux one and a half percent  So unless you close Android, this is on the desktop  so so you're gonna so by by giving away Windows 10 and not caring whether you're  upgrading a pirated copy

Start time: 1111.02
End time: 1116.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You move they do care, but they're kind of grudgingly saying they will give it to you, but you're still a thief

Start time: 1117.98
End time: 1120.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1121.84
End time: 1128.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, what do you mean? Actually most of what I know this I know about is like my reading Ed's piece  Maybe I should talk about and what's the story here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Previously, well, first of all, this is the first time that a major  Whole number release of Windows is going to be released through Windows update. It will just show up  In fact, that's bizarre that and well it worked but they're doing it right now with the with the preview  You can you can sign up for the insider program on Windows 7 and the Windows 10 upgrade  Will show up there in Windows update and on the systems that I've tried it on the update takes about 20 minutes to complete  I know on a Windows 7 machine. It's very very quick and and it's been generally pretty accurate  But they they don't they want to make this a friction-free  Experience so precisely so that they can move as many people as possible into  into this world and  And if you start putting piracy checks and things in there, then you add friction  So they'll just make it, you know  They'll make it a an update and and there it is and you get it and and I think I tweeted something this week  You can have your Windows 10 but you're still a thief and bastard of a pirate yard

Start time: 1207.96
End time: 1226.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this is this the dialog box you're talking about it says this copy of Windows is not genuine  It does not pass genuine validation to get all Windows updates and downloads reserved for genuine Windows. You must validate  But that's that's okay. So that's Windows genuine advantage. That's the thing you get. I've gotten that message many times on

Start time: 1227.00

End time: 1265.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't know. No, you won't know you won't know anything until this is actually officially  released but my prediction is  That there's not that it's simply going to be an update if you're running Windows 7  Windows 8 or Windows 8 point 1  Or Windows 7 or 8 point 1 it will it will just update there won't be any questions you'll aside from

Start time: 1266.94
End time: 1280.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 1350.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been working. I've been working on a piece exactly like that where I think they should they  Basically and it's the message in this post that you pointed to  Earlier there Leo, which is that you know  If they really and truly are serious about moving people there just make this an amnesty program for  foreign non enterprise customers  Yeah, just you know  It just and as and as part of the agreement at the end when you click  Okay on the license agreement that you didn't read part of it says that I agree that if my system was not proper  licensed before that I will I  Will you know abide by this license agreement going forward? Yeah, you know, yeah, I should do something like that. Yeah

Start time: 1352.72
End time: 1405.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a precedent for this though, that's what that's what Apple did with iTunes match in effect  iTunes match you pay 25 bucks  Will match everything in your library  It doesn't check to see if it's pirated or not  If you as I did downloaded a lot of stuff from Napster in years gone by I was young and dumb and I didn't I needed  the money  and  And it's in your library will automatically match it and replace it if you ask with 256 a kilobit AAC  licensed versions  It's kind of like that. I expect that Apple went to the music industry and said look  You're never gonna get money for them these guys. They already stole the music  Yeah, would you like 25 a portion of 25 bucks make everybody honest moving forward?  Is it is it kind of is that analogous to what's going on here? Absolutely?

Start time: 1406.30
End time: 1435.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's very it should be very close to that  It should be you know somebody I was really hoping that in the with the new leadership at Microsoft that somebody would  Sort of throw away the old  licensing  Gobbledy-gook and complication at least for consumers and small businesses and just replace this with something simple  Yeah, no, and they still have an opportunity to do that now on Wednesday

Start time: 1435.36
End time: 1489.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this on Windows weekly, but the next day Paul Thurotte  Published a piece on his website throughout comm saying sorry Microsoft is not giving  Free Windows 10 to pirates now the original quote came from Terry Meyerson the the guy in charge of Windows 10  He had told Reuters quote. We are upgrading all qualified PCs  genuine and  non-genuine to Windows 10  But then Microsoft issued a statement and this is the current  Statement we've always been committed to ensuring that customers have the best Windows experience possible with Windows 10  Although non-genuine PCs may be upgradeable to Windows 10 the upgrade will not change  the genuine state of the license  Right, so you're not made whole by this. You're not suddenly genuine

Transcript:  No, no, well first of all the word genuine is just such Orwellian  Crap speak  It makes me angry every time I hear them talk about  Genuine Windows because as Harry pointed out  you know you can have a  Perfectly you you could have paid a great deal of money for a shrink right copy of Windows  You can install it on your computer  You can do everything you're supposed to do and then through no fault of your own  Something comes up and says this copy of Windows is not genuine and that's yeah  Just in that's just a distortion of what the word means, but what they're trying  The lawyers got involved in this at some point and they took over the word genuine and distorted it into this weird  Weird thing now now Leo the the the timeline of this was it was an article  Earlier in the week then Microsoft is this does that statement and Paul wrote that article and then my story from yesterday the one that you  That we have on your screen. Yeah, actually has some additional details on top of that  This is typical by the way for when you cover Microsoft, right?

Transcript:  So if you go through here, so so first of all back in January  Terry Meyerson stands up and he says  We're gonna give a free upgrade to Windows  for everyone with Windows 7 or when to every customer with Windows 7 or Windows 8.1  and then there's a footnote and it says some editions excluded and  We have checked on this and the editions that are excluded are Windows RT, which is dead. Yeah, and and  Windows Enterprise editions which are only available for volume license customers who pay for software and you will continue to pay for that  but  But  But everyone else according to that January statement any customer with Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 will get this  Well, then this statement comes out this week and it starts talking about the consumer free upgrade offer. Oh  Wait a minute. When did consumers get dragged into this?  When did we start distinguishing between consumer versions of Windows and business versions of Windows?  Do we have a surprise coming later this year interest when they go? Oh, I'm sorry. You have you have you have Windows 8.1 Pro  That doesn't have the free upgrade that has the $10 upgrade and you know, this is just more of this they start  this they start with this message of this wonderful thing and  Then the exceptions start being added  all along the way  And the other thing here where they know they nobody ever said they're going to give a free upgrade to anyone what they said  Was we will allow the upgrade to proceed on any system genuine or non genuine right using using their language

Start time: 1680.24
End time: 1692.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of and you point out in your article. That's what it is. That's what it is now, right? That's not new  It's not really new doesn't make it genuine and you still but now are they gonna abandon the Windows genuine advantage checks?

Transcript:  It's confusing. Here's a copy of Windows. Oh, you can't use it though, but we did give you a free upgrade  Is that what they're gonna do? Are they gonna 30 days later say oh, by the way, it's not genuine

Start time: 1715.38
End time: 1728.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's still break in and sue you if they felt like it  Yeah, I think their biggest issue is not individuals stealing Windows  It's PC makers who steal Windows so not the big guys but smaller guys

Start time: 1728.66
End time: 1733.56

Transcript:  I see this little little shops who install one copy of Windows and 20

Start time: 1734.62
End time: 1741.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some companies who do that so it's not you and me not that we do it  But if we did steal one copy of Windows, that's not a huge issue

Start time: 1741.92
End time: 1745.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1745.36
End time: 1757.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't know it in fact Microsoft always said we're doing you a favor by we're letting you continue to use it  In the days when they didn't let you continue to use that they still said we're doing you a favor by telling you that  The PC you bought has a pirated copy of Windows on it

Start time: 1758.98
End time: 1835.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's one of those things all of the windows genuine dialog boxes say you may be a victim of software victim, right?  Victim yeah, you may be you may be we don't blame you you could be a victim. I have no problem with  Microsoft continuing to  enforce  Piracy restrictions on the people who sell new PCs  And and don't you know with a copy of Windows installed in it that they haven't paid for but the reality is  That more than 90% of the copies of Windows that are sold are coming on PCs from big companies like Dell  And HP and Lenovo and those OEM still licensed windows on those those OEM still those OEM still licensed windows  Pay for it they and they pay for OEM royalty licensing where they the stuff is automatically activated  And you never have to see a product key  And there's there isn't even a sticker on your PC anymore. There's just a little hologram on the power supply  Or or somewhere so they're they're getting away from that and and so really that the addressable audience of pirates that we're talking about  Here now is the dying community of white box builders nobody  Very very few people buy white box PCs anymore

Start time: 1836.82
End time: 1948.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't make sense. It's there there a lot of times are more expensive or you know  They're not as powerful or that kind of thing. Yeah, those those little  Shops that do that kind of thing mostly integrators that are serving small businesses and local communities, you know  It's there's just not as much of a need for it as there once was in the same way that there aren't as many IT  Departments out there and the IT departments are much smaller because people don't need their hands held to set up their machine and learn  How to log in and you know stuff like that most companies are assuming that the hot people that they hire now can handle  You know can get an email or get a set of instructions and a PC and figure out you know what to do  So I think that the bottom line is a lot of times with this genuine advantage stuff in today  It ends up hurting the people that play by the rules more right you end up  you know if you have a problem with your PC and  All of a sudden that genuine advantage thing causes you you know a bunch of headaches  Even if you bought a genuine copy like Harry was saying earlier  And so yeah  Microsoft really should move away from this especially if they want it if it appears that their goal is to get windows on as many  Machines as possible and to sort of you know winner a platform  Game and to be a platform that's going to you know continue to be you know relevant and ubiquitous  Then it behooves them to you know to move away from this type of thing  I don't know that it ever did them much good. I don't know that it ever helped them  That much maybe it you know  caused a few more people to buy licenses or that kind of thing but  It seems as if it's been something that has hurt them  You know more than it's helped them and complicated the windows experience more than it's actually you know caused more people to buy licenses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's really been in Microsoft bones as long as there's been a Microsoft to be really paranoid  There's that letter Bill Gates wrote to the community and yes in 76 or whatever  Where he says you I'd love to hire 20 great programmers to work on software for Microsoft  But I can't if you're gonna continue to steal your software

Start time: 1974.08
End time: 1978.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, it's it goes back to the very beginnings of the company. It's so true. So true

Start time: 1978.96
End time: 2008.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hasn't it hasn't changed in that but see this is the question though  And so to get back to the the beginnings of this conversation  How do we parse now? What's what is this a new business model for Microsoft or maybe it's not?  Microsoft has muddied the waters your thesis that is that they said one thing and then the lawyers got a hold of it and  Forced him to backtrack  Is there an intention on such an Adele's part to bring people back into the fold and move forward or not? Oh, absolutely

Start time: 2009.10
End time: 2066.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean the the the interview that Terry Meyerson did with Reuters  the entire discussion  the word the key word in that was  Reengage  with the hundreds of millions of users in China who are using Windows XP  but never paid for it and  Are not getting updates and not the don't feel  Comfortable thinking about getting new Microsoft services because they know they have pirated copies  so the word read the word was reengage and the idea of reengaging with pirates is  Is actually a good one it it leads invariably to  to amnesty for  You know people who violated a business model that you're ending and then it opens up all sorts of new opportunities for the future  But we're not gonna know how it plays out for a couple months yet

Start time: 2067.04
End time: 2084.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I think they're it's definitely a new direction, but but like it goes back to the DNA of the company  it's so  Antithetical to the DNA of the company as Harry was saying that it's just gonna be kind of it's gonna be growing pains for them  To get there. I don't think they can't just it's just gonna be hard to throw clear communication is apparently antithetical

Start time: 2085.28
End time: 2096.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2098.02
End time: 2104.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know it could be I know that for any for any announcement that they make  I'll probably get five or six columns out of it as it changes

Start time: 2105.96
End time: 2123.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More well and this this this most recent column on zdnet is a great  example of parsing the Microsoft message and  And what you say in the headline, I guess that it's that's potential licensing mess is probably the one takeaway  Yeah, get from this although

Start time: 2123.94
End time: 2140.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's actually if you scroll down on that scroll down till you get to the the bar chart down there you go  I think there's the story  In a nutshell of why they need to face the reality the cost of Windows Vista back in 2006

Start time: 2142.84
End time: 2164.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was a hundred launch day on launch day $150 to consumers $250 to business  Windows  seven  $50 on launch day and they that went back up, but it started at $50  Per license to consumers $100 to business  Windows 8 is now sub $50 for ever for business and free to win. Is it free?

Start time: 2164.24
End time: 2170.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was it was it was 40 bucks and anybody got the pro same for everybody. Okay. Yeah, so

Start time: 2170.70
End time: 2178.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so there's a clearly a downward a downward line and  That it would make sense that the next price point would be free. You can't get much lower than 40 bucks

Start time: 2181.07
End time: 2185.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's certainly the case with every other  Platform right

Start time: 2186.48
End time: 2196.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, but there are no other comparable platforms. You could point out OS 10, but Apple sells hardware  So they don't need to make the money on the OS plus there's this kind of built-in license. You can't run it mobile devices

Start time: 2204.13
End time: 2241.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, the point is that regardless of how different the the models may be, you know  Once upon a time Microsoft  was  Involved with 90% or more of every computing device that was sold on the planet today with mobile devices and  tablets and of  And servers running free operating systems  They have maybe 15 or 20 percent of the total market and among consumers at least  This is the only one where they still expect you to pay for upgrades and that's that's not gonna happen

Start time: 2242.23
End time: 2274.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Windows just in general  I think there are so many people out there who are basically looking for reasons not to upgrade their Windows PC in a way  That's somewhat unusual  So when they heard there was no start button in Windows 8 that was a reason not to do it  Any cost is a reason not to do it and with Windows 10?  I think Microsoft or the best of their ability is removed every argument that might pop into somebody's head  Not to get it  Which is a great thing to do overall even if there are some  It's still pretty sticky for them to do but it is they're trying to do the right thing  Is it the case?

Start time: 2274.96
End time: 2279.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the case though that most end users never thought they paid for Windows because they never bought a copy of Windows

Start time: 2279.46

It is good dad because it means that there's it there's renewed interest in what Microsoft's up to and  It is meaningful for business for sure  And I guess people's consumers still buy windows obviously  So that it's gonna matter to consumers does it I  Guess I live in a bubble, I don't know very many windows users

End time: 2480.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I you know, I asked the same question in my post there  Do they really think that they're going to be able to charge for it? Yeah after a year  I mean basically anybody who is motivated to upgrade an existing  PC or device running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 is going to do it in the first year because it's free  After that first year, the only people who are going to be left are people who deliberately chose  not to do so or a  small number of unlucky bastards who bought  Something that has been sitting on the shelf  At you know their local Walmart or wherever and it's still running Windows 8.1 and they take it home  Oops, and they discover that oh wait, it's I have to pay

I gotta tell you Jason Heiner from Tech Republic CBS interactive  We've got the technologizer Harry McCracken from fast company  Ed bot from zd net all of them be covering windows and enterprise for years and they know this subject  Let's keep talking but first a word from Citrix go to  Meeting anybody who works in business, especially in modern business where people are distributed all over the world  Not just your colleagues, but your customers know that meetings no longer sitting around a table in a room  The way to meet of course from the comfort of your computer or your smartphone or your tablet with go to meeting  You can share the same screen.

I  Love go to meeting and that's why I want you to sign up for 30 days free go to meeting comm  Click the try it free button friction free meetings. Wouldn't that be nice?  Go to meeting comm try it free  Today and for the next 30 days you'll be hooked  And we thank Citrix those good folks at Citrix for their support  Windows hello  That's another thing Terry Myerson talked about it win heck. What is Windows? Hello, Harry

Start time: 2622.74

Start time: 2635.84
End time: 2642.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2644.32
End time: 2648.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2649.32
End time: 2665.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like and if you've opted in yeah, yeah, so you have to turn it on obviously  You could still have it be that you have to type it and this all I believe all flavors of it involve special hardware  Which are not standard equipment on computers currently. So all Microsoft's doing is saying hey, we're gonna make sure it's in the OS

Start time: 2665.68
End time: 2667.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2681.26
End time: 2687.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it could be used for two-factor too, right? I mean you could yeah, so there's a second part to this passport

Start time: 2688.56
End time: 2698.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is interesting which is passport in Microsoft's continuing  Quest to reuse every product name they've ever used

Start time: 2699.44
End time: 2705.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Passport was their single sign-on solution, which I was really high on but it never took off and it was and then it became Windows

Start time: 2705.96
End time: 2747.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Live ID and then it became the Microsoft account that you have but so the passport  Component of it is really interesting because you'll have a so if you have a Windows 10 device  It can be  enrolled  essentially with your biometric information so that the the the cryptographic  Hardware component at the heart of your device the TPM and there's a virtual layer on top of that  That's you know, I'm gonna securely store this  But it's basically going to say this device and your biometric information together  Will allow you to sign into online services and an online

Start time: 2749.08

Start time: 2752.84
End time: 2802.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Windows hello logs you onto your PC. Yeah, the passport thing  provides a secure form of  authentication and and it uses the Fido  Standard interoperates with the Fido standard so it doesn't have to be nobody has to  Do anything with Microsoft servers or anything like that?  so the idea is  You could have a picture of my face and try and use it to sign in as me somewhere  But that's not going to work because you don't have my device and if you have my device  But you don't have my biometric information. You can't it's the combination of those  That is that is essential and so they what they're trying to do is make  Is finally make two-factor authentication something that mere mortals can use

Start time: 2804.58
End time: 2813.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will they do it good luck  Because you gotta get OEMs to put expensive hardware into the computers. That's the card where it's already there. It is

Transcript:  Will we see will it be and if it's face recognition? Well, Microsoft said you can't just use the camera  You've got it has to have infrared sensing. It's kind of more like the Xbox one camera the connect

Start time: 2838.64
End time: 2849.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the same technology that they've been using with connect. Yeah for a long time  So there are both there are liveness tests with it, right and there's also  tests that

Start time: 2850.26
End time: 2857.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You make no mistake. We need two-factor authentication. I mean we need it in the worst way, you know, so many of the the  The breaches and things that are happened is, you know poor security in so many other in so many ways  But but passwords still are you know, the weakest link and you know, we need to factor  And so this is anything that pushes it forward is a good thing  so I think you have to look at this as as you know something that's needed and  The the question is how well it's implemented. Can it move the needle?  Can it get a lot more people on it more quickly and like we've talked about it's the largest platform out there  Even though it is only now as I was saying 15% of all computing devices where it used to be closer to 90  It's still you know, one of the biggest  Chunks and so if it can move this forward in a meaningful way, you know, it makes the world more secure.

Transcript:  Nine years ago Ed Bott wrote an article. Why does Microsoft Passport suck?  Good news you can recycle that article Ed  Who'd a thunk it too isn't that funny  That's the other passport that's the single sign on and it was a disappointment because it could have been things  Yeah, so Fido I for some reason I get the sense of Google's they're not behind it, but they're involved with it, right?  Oh, they're a they're a big part of it. Okay  Yeah, so that's good news because it needs to be a standard that everybody gets behind right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's also and Visa and MasterCard and almost all the banks are involved with with Fido  And so this is something where if you can put it on Windows devices and you've already got  Samsung and Apple devices that have touch ID you have that they can add  this same basic type of authentication and  And you can and and if you have people doing this  There are no more passwords anymore at least for those transactions  There's no there's no password being stored on a server that can be stolen by some guy in the Ukraine  And there's no password that that you are typing into your laptop  When you're sitting in a coffee shop that can be stolen by a guy who's hacked into the Wi-Fi access point if you you know  this is all really  Well tested cryptographic technology  There's no reason why this can't work and work well and sooner than anyone expects

Start time: 3006.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's gonna look a lot like touch ID does right now with the  Apple pay right so  In fact, here's this is from the Fido Alliance site the password experience password less experience would be you want to make a transaction  You've authenticated to your hardware for instance with a touch ID on an iOS device  Then the success and it's done and then the two-factor adds additional  Some sort of additional dongle or some other device I have no that

Start time: 3036.70
End time: 3054.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's simply where you've gone through a process of enrolling that device, okay  So if you have an iPhone or  Or a Windows phone or or whatever it has  Some it has a cryptographic. I see by it's once it's right got it

Start time: 3055.48
End time: 3081.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So once you've so authentication is really one of the central issues in in computing not it's for payments  But it's also just for logging into a website we didn't have pass passwords a hundred years ago  So maybe to get into a speakeasy  sword fish  But but before that I mean really nobody had passwords  So this is only a recent problem created by the web and I boy I would love to see it solved

Start time: 3102.26
End time: 3149.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that'd actually be a three-factor if you have biometric  It's multifactor authentication. So so, you know, so basically imagine  You know the the nightmare scenario for a Hollywood star  Who has their you know, their picture is everywhere and their password gets stolen  but if the only way into their  shared their their secrets they don't want to share  Is with a device that has been enrolled to them  Then the fact that you've stolen their secret and the fact that you can place a picture of them up in front of the camera  You know, you've got to have their device too  And at that point you've got multifactor authentication which that works pretty well

Transcript:  Good news, this would be great now our friend Steve Gibson has created this  Thing called squirrel, which he's really big on which eliminates passwords logging into websites  But and it's it's similar. In fact in some ways is maybe more elegant than Fido  but the fact that you've got all these companies back and up Fido seems to me this is  Even if there's a better solution out there  This seems like this is gonna go and not a moment too soon. I  Might add. Yep. Yeah, I  Have a YubiKey  That is Fido to compliant. I'm not sure what that means or how I use it  But it's one of those USB devices you plug in there and I guess that would be a form of authenticating

Start time: 3197.34
End time: 3235.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The YubiKey works with LastPass  Yes, that's right one of the one of the biggest I've used that before and  Yeah, so basically, you know, you're traveling somewhere and you go to a hot spot in some dodgy place  And you want to have LastPass authenticate you in somewhere  If someone's stolen your LastPass password, they can't  get into your  your store of  Extremely valuable passwords unless they have that USB key and then when you take that USB key away  Whatever you entered on that PC is no longer useful

I'm sure we're not we're not done with that  this was a story and I want some clarification on this Ed bot because I  Could swear that two or three months ago  On Windows weekly. We said Microsoft is going to read is going to use project  Spartan is going to replace Internet Explorer and it's going to have a new name  But for some reason this week every blog in the world published this here's Tom Warren and the verge  Microsoft is killing off the Internet Explorer brand.

Transcript:  There was a question. I think I think they said it in a more a clearer fashion that so do it  Oh, okay  So they were thinking about it before I think when they first showed Spartan that they did not say and this thing will definitely not  Be called ie I see and now they've said that Spartan will not be called ie  although they're not saying what Spartan will be called right they haven't come up with a name yet and

Start time: 3330.40

Transcript:  Anything with the ask brand name. Yeah  On it  You know there's that but but the more the bigger part of the problems with web compatibility  These days are websites that are just written and tested because they assume that the entire world runs on Chrome  And  So you show up with another browser  Whatever it is even if it's opera which is running on a on a rendering engine. That's very similar to Chrome  It's it's a it's web kit, right?  It's actually they're running opera these days is running on blink really which is  Google's fork of web kit  Right and and and yet I've run the latest version of opera and I've gone to websites that fail  because  The the developers I mean basically Chrome is now the new Internet Explorer

Start time: 3417.52

Start time: 3429.96
End time: 3455.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, who write websites, you know, they use chrome, right?  Again, it's sort of like windows if you write there  I think large parts of the world where the market share breakdown is different  I also feel by the way that nobody really knows for sure  What the market shares are of web browsers because if you look at the three or four biggest companies attract this  They're radically different and they have different people in first place  Right and with some of them Firefox looks dead and then some of them Firefox still looks like it's doing pretty well

Start time: 3483.30
End time: 3497.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The devil's in the details. It's hard to do  Sometimes when I put together websites, I've suddenly noticed they don't really work in IE hardly at all because I forgot to check. Yep  And then and they may not work well in Spartan if I forget to do that

Transcript:  Well, Mike, I mean for the last god knows how many years Mike with every new version of IE  Microsoft always says the big news is it standards compliant, right?  And we're not going to assume the world is going to tweak everything to work in IE anymore  But that mantra has been going on for seven or eight years or more  And unless they actually adopt web kit or blank there will be some technical challenges

Start time: 3523.10
End time: 3590.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but there so the thing about web standards is first of all, there's two standards organizations  You know, I can't forget there's W3C  IEEE? Are they responsible?  And what and what WG I think or something somebody in the chat room will correct us on this  But there's basically two standards organizations, but the reality is that  That web technology is moving so quickly  That that basically the stand by the time a standard is declared  It was already adopted  12 or 18 months earlier and so the de facto thing now is does it run on Chrome?  Have you tested it on other things?  You know put it into production  And if people complain about it, we'll fix it if it's a big enough market for our company to pay attention  To this group of people who are who are complaining about it  You know  So that I mean that's the reality there that the standard is that it's a standard  The standards are these days are de facto not actual declared standards anymore

Transcript:  They have to be careful because they don't want to give anybody the impression  That windows phone is not a viable platform all by itself  Although I think everybody's already got that impression  They are so I do like the strategy that microsoft has and I and I like it as a company that wants to do software  You know, we want to do our own apps  And it would and the question about what should we do a windows phone app?  That's a tough one because while I want to support our uh, our windows users and our windows weekly viewers  We know how small a market windows phone is  But microsoft solves that conundrum a little bit by offering this universal platform  Where we could develop for windows  desktop not really well  We could make one app that's metro  That's xbox. You know the thing that makes it compelling is if it would run on the xbox which apparently it would

Well, it's not complicated and it's also immediate consumption right platform  The uh product right that works on a device. That's this big  Uh, or one that's uh, you know a a 50 inch we've been kept off of xbox one because

Start time: 3908.10

End time: 3999.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the argument was that uh at some point  The you know, they decided they were no longer going to support it  They they just they it wasn't economically viable for them. The market wasn't big enough and they said at some point  It's going to break so rather than wait until we do an update to our back end  It causes it to break and then we have to go oops to our you know, however many  Thousands or tens of thousands of windows phone users that are let's say sorry  We broke it and we're not going to fix it  Uh, they said we're we're just going to pull it from the store  I think they gave a month's notice or something, but they said we're  Rather than have this break unexpectedly. We're going to have it break right?

Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with another issue. There's another issue about the universal app story that doesn't work  Which is that all of those?  pcs  Will fully support web apps which is where so they'll just say if you're using a pc  Why should we build a a universal app that will only run on windows 10?  Right  When we can just say go open your browser and go to chase.com  And sign in and we'll send you your two-factor code and you can do anything you want to on the web  You know that that becomes and then with you know with an iphone or with the android platform  You've got enough tens or hundreds of millions of users  That you can build an app that has additional capabilities like you can take a picture of a check and deposit it  And such but those are the sort of unique  Capabilities that you get with a mobile app that you don't need on a pc

Start time: 4107.30
End time: 4164.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I have to say that even the android apps for some banks  Are pretty much just thinly veiled skins to browser interactions. It's pretty obvious, right?  Yeah, I mean so why not just do a browser browser based app  Especially if you can make it secure make it work. Why not?  What's the disadvantage? All right, so I know I was all excited about the universal thing, but you've poured water on that one  That's what I do leo  Sling tv one more microsoft story, then we'll move on sling tv comes to xbox one  I'm actually this is really more a story of sling tv, which I think is growing in power  and is is really the first time we've seen a lot of  Uh traditional cable channels go over the top  especially espn  I think sling tv, you know, this is kind of in in in the  under the  shadow of apple apparently making moves we think

It's um  Right now it's only on playstations and only in I think new york chicago and philadelphia  But it's another over-the-top service. It has 85 channels  It has richer functionality than sling tv because it has a cloud-based dvr  Oh interesting and on demand and it's coming to the ipad. I think sony is saying it will come to other devices  and it's  I wrote about and I said it's the closest thing so far to cable tv for the internet  Because it's really comparable and even the pricing

So I talked to the folks from sling tv and  They acknowledged they had some problems with it  uh  Walked they they've they now appear to have fixed all those setup processes. And so I was able to use it last night  um, and and so while it has some really appealing  things to it, I I one of the things I did I turned on one of the the uh  ncaa games last night, uh and said oh, this is great and uh, and then I discovered uh, first of all  You can't uh pause  oh  uh

Transcript:  Yeah, it it is it is exactly like live tv  Apparently some of their channels  Will offer uh up to three days of back content that you can that you can watch  Uh, but even there it's up to the content provider whether they're going to allow you to skip commercials or not  uh, whether the the the uh fast forward and rewind buttons will work  When it worked for me last night the picture quality was just superb  It was really really really good and then all of a sudden at a very crucial part of the game  It just started freezing up  And it would go for 10 seconds and then there'd be some guy standing there like this with the basketball leaving his hand  And then it would and then it would start up again and and I don't know what happened  I had to see the scoreboard to see what happened  uh, and so  So and you I presume that's very good internet. I mean the skype's looking good. Yeah, this was this was a wired, uh full  Uh, you know full bandwidth 50 megabit connection. So there wasn't anything there. I think it's just you know, we're still in  even though cord cutting is finally starting to happen and and uh, and starting to really hurt  cable and satellite providers we're still early in the  Technology days hurting them enough  It's gonna be messy  Uh for a long time and there's an entire generation of people who are just gonna say, you know what screw this i'll watch  Whatever's on my computer.

There's a lot of tension in um, you know with these solutions, but  Uh, at least it's finally happening at least it's finally there's going to be some options this year seems like 2015 seems like it's uh,  Has the potential to be a little bit of a watershed year in kind of course.

He wrote some time ago  Cable tv is socialism that works  Subscribers pay equally for everything  And watch only what they want  to the benefit of everyone  Any grand vision apple or any other tech company has for television is likely to sustain the current model  Not disrupted directly. All right, think about that. We'll talk about what what that means and whether you agree in a moment  But first we have a word from harry

I mean really let's face it guys and gals too. I guess  It's just not fun to get up every morning and shave razors are expensive. They run about four dollars a blade  If you shave every day, you're spending hundreds of dollars a year  On just razor blades  And you gotta they're locked up. They're worth so much. They're locked up in a cabinet at the drugstore  Harry's has decided they want to make this better. They want to make the shaving experience. Hey, it's not going to be fun  But it's going to be better. Actually, you know what? It might even be fun harry's sells high quality razor blades at about half the price  of those big brand names because  And I love this when harry's was this is silicon valley mentality when harry's was started a couple of years ago  They said where's the where are the best razor blades come from? Well, there are only two two factories. It's out both in germany  So they bought one  They said yeah. Well, okay. Good. We'll take it. We'll take it. We'll take a factory, please  So now they control the production of this factory they engineer for performance for sharpness  And they ship them free to your front door because they sell direct to you  They can sell them for about a half the cost  Of the blade you buy in the drugstore that is nice factory direct because they own the factory  By the way, if you're going to go to harry's.com take a look at the kits because that's how you get started  You need the harry's handle  And now here's where they could really take you for a ride, but they don't start take a look at the truman  This is the the base model you get three blades a gorgeous handle and a variety of colors you get there  Either their foam or their cream  You know what? They both have their partisans. I like the cream that comes in a tube  But some people say no, I prefer my jipper for a gel so they have the choice  And for fifteen dollars you get all of that plus a travel holder, which I really like three blades the handle  The the gel or the or the cream?  And for fifteen dollars, but i'm just make it even more affordable if you want a nice metal, uh, uh handle  You can go out and get the winston, which is the next one up. That's twenty five dollars  You can even get it engraved with your name  Harry gives me a clean coast close comfortable shave  And I have to say it does make shaving a lot more pleasurable  And I love the cream, but you got they even have a new moisturizer which you'll like  Uh the and and once you buy the kit the the starter kit you're going to get those blades you can say  Every month every other month as needed  automatically  refilled  So here's the deal.

Don't don't even expect to change the structure of television  If that's your plan  Because it's it's these incumbents are so entrenched and they have so much power  They're not apple can't come to them and say let's change this all this fall  This fall apple's been trying to negotiate these these things for years with no success  Yeah, why all of a sudden are we saying it's going to happen in the fall?

I think they see it as a business  I do think long term it is a business for google  They know the internet they know that everything they do on the internet contributes to their bottom line  And they know that the cable companies are the lead that you know that that run this now the companies that run this now  Are you know the least liked companies um in america like as an industry it it uh, you know  They like blow like lawyers and and uh, you know journalists  um, and so

There's no doubt  I mean the the whole system that the whole economic system that we live under in the united states is based on competition  And you don't have real competition, you know, then that's what we got  Things have problems as we've gotten the internet realm and you know, I do tip my hat google does all kinds of crazy weird things  But I do tip my hat to them for what they're doing in fiber. I think they you know have made the right steps  They're not doing everything right, you know, we've written about that too. And in some of these things they talk a big game about  Helping out little guys and giving you know free internet because they'll give you a free they'll give you free internet for  um a  You know in those google fiber areas you get a much more cut rate, you know speed  But they're they talk a big game about that about rolling it out for free  But in order to do it for free there there are weird obstacles like you have to get to prepay  um  For like your your uh some of your equipment and things like that and and then it becomes  So it becomes cost prohibitive to the kind of people who um who could really benefit, you know from this kind of thing  And so, you know, they they they've got plenty of kinks to iron out  Um, but in general, I think they're they're on the right track and it is going to put pressure on the comcast of the world  To do kind of upgrades to back to what I was getting at was ed's point was  You know, they're gonna have to invest more in their networks to keep up with google fiber  And that's ultimately a good thing and that 97 profit margin is going to go down

We'll move into your community  Anything else we're not interested right? Uh, we'll just leave we'll go somewhere else. And so they're basically cherry picking  places where uh  And and it's economically rational for them to do it if I were running the business  I would do it exactly the same way but they are cherry picking the places where they can run the business exactly the way they want to  a second thing  That I saw that it seemed to be a dot  That deserves to be connected here was the thing about at&t  Uh, and their uber service were remember they were offering if you pay us ten dollars more  We won't sell your personal information. Yes, I remember that  Uh for advertisers, right you remember this so  so while I  Genuinely admire what google is doing to bring high-speed internet to large parts of the country  It is also profoundly in their economic interest right now. Yes  They only get information about you when you're visiting a site and you are signed into google  And that site has google services like adsense or google analytics. I want google to know more about me  When they own the fiber  You won't have a choice of whether they know more about you  Literally every single packet that comes from your home through google fiber  They will know about and so that's you know, and if you're happy with that, that's great  But it's something that I think we should be we should be aware of aware of and talking about that

You know, why does nashville have it in memphis and here in memphis?  We don't have it and then that will put pressure. I think that's their um, that's their game that they're

Let's say that I you know, I happen to like to follow the horse races  Uh  And my employer, you know  I i'm I apply for a job and the employer finds this in my internet history  Which is available from google and they decide no no we we've uh  Your profile matches with people who are unreliable employees.

It's not it hasn't caught up  But it will and if you can store the information then you can analyze it and so that is worth being worried about that is worth  Being concerned about and it is stuff that we should talk about and encourage sort of public debate

I feel like a uh  There's probably lots of ways people are gathering information about us that we aren't aware of anyway  Yeah, uh  And uh, I feel like I get value out of google and it's somewhat in google's interest  To not sell stuff to insurance companies because they want to keep getting information  And as soon as these these these imaginary harms because they're currently imaginary happen  Uh, your your concern is it'll be too late to turn back the clock  My point is if this does happen then we just then people are going to say oh crap.

No, no, no  We could get we could get lost in this but go to  I'll pick on my own site right now. You're a freeloader ed  If 100 people were like that it wouldn't work  Go to zdnet.com and well, that's that's the argument that the advertising companies make is that the internet won't work  If if you don't allow us to collect every single bit of information that's out there and what i'm saying is  uh disclose  Give us choices give us transparency on the amount of information that's out there and stop  uh indiscriminately collecting things

Transcript:  I don't think storing it. I don't think ed is a problem because people were all worked up about ad blockers destroying the web  And it never happened because even though nobody uses a fairly large number people use them  It's they're still a small minority  And uh and the business model still works if a small minority of people aren't seeing the ads and but it's unethical to me

Transcript:  One of the reasons it comes up because i've been in this kind of debate with some people  This week, uh, because we're doing our annual survey. So one of the things the only thing we do  Is we do a survey every year  It's completely opt in and we invite you to do it at twit.tv slash survey where we try to get a better idea  Of who our audience is what your interests are what shows you listen to?  none of that  Information goes the the only information that goes to advertisers is percentages  Uh, we don't even keep track of who answer, you know who you are or anything like that  But even if we did that doesn't go to advertisers, but what goes to advertisers is you know, whatever 78 percent of  Twit listeners are males with an income of 150 000 or higher  That's the only kind of information that goes to them and they want to know that information because they want to get some idea of  Who they're advertising to although frankly  I don't I think the only thing that bottom that really matters to any advertiser is  How much is it going to cost and how much money am I going to make?  Yeah, as long as the number the second number is bigger than the first by a significant amount. They're happy  Yep, and uh, but they kind of you know  I think it's make work. They you know, the agency's well, we can give you a chart  It shows you who you're buying and what anyway  That's all we do and in fact if you'd like to take the survey, we'd appreciate it twit.tv slash survey  We do that once a year just so we get an idea of  Uh, and some of this actually goes back to programming  We pay attention to what you're interested in what you watch whether we need to do video and audio and stuff like that  And if it's too long or too invasive, you don't need to do it. It's quite all right  That is not part of the deal  However, the more you watch the happier we are if you missed anything this week you missed a lot. Let's take a look  previously on twit

We're going to release this in four forms  um  Paperback hardback audiobook and ebook and so we also have to pay somebody to do the layout of the book  You know and and that kind of thing so so to and we raised enough to cover the basic costs  Of you know doing the book so that we can uh so that we can self-publish and we can sell directly to  Our readers and you know, we will sell through amazon and other um, you know outlets  But we're also selling it. Um, we've opened pre-orders.

Transcript:  All right. We're gonna run real quickly pwn to own in vancouver  The big cansec west security conference. They do this every year. I feel like it's a little sketch  the  teams of security researchers  Collect all year collect exploits, but they don't reveal them to the companies or to the public  Because they want it to be their secret advantage at pwn to own there's a chance to win a lot of money. In fact  a south korean researcher on thursday  Jung hon lee his team he was by himself, but his online name is lucky heart  won  225 thousand dollars and a couple of laptops  By hacking internet explorer 11 and google chrome on windows as well as safari on os 10  They use these exploits usually chained exploits a variety of different exploits all chained together  all chained together to own  those systems  After the event is over the way it works that you probably know the contest sets up 64 bit versions  Of the top operating systems with the top browsers  And then the teams go at them  And the first and if you can hack it you win the laptop and some cash  His attack on google chrome earned him the largest payout in the history of the competition for a single exploit  He got 75 000 bucks for finding a chrome bug  An extra 25 000 for a privilege escalation to system  another 10 000 for  hacking the browser's beta version  110 000 on chrome alone  Then another 65 000 for i.e. 11 and 50 000 for safari  The reason I think it's sketch is these guys are coming up with exploits, but don't reveal them until after the event  So you're incenting people to find exploits I guess in the long run you get them  I just worry that these exploits will become public knowledge before coupon to own  The final count for vent vulnerabilities  Five flaws in windows os 4 and i.e. 11 3 each in firefox adobe reader and flash player 2 in safari and 1 in chrome  So basically there's no safe platform you can be hacked on the platform
