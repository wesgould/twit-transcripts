Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any relationship to AOL and TechCrunch or just? I mean, they used to own us. But not anymore. They don't. We were spun out. I don't know if they own a piece or not. I'm not really privy to our financials.  But so it's a standalone. So he can say this doesn't work there right now. So go for it. AOL retains a significant portion of that. That's Peter Rojas. He knows founder of Engadget.  I worked a little bit on the spin out. Is it like the Angel G or Buffy? I'm not allowed to comment on such interesting things as that. So I pass. That is oh that flow.

Start time: 189.44
End time: 199.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a spinoff. Today is also Buffy's 20th anniversary. Is it really? Happy birthday, Buffy. It seems like it was older than that really. 20 doesn't seem that old. So it came out in 1997 on the WB.

Start time: 202.40
End time: 211.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the W. Wow. That's a throwback itself right there. I feel like you were watching that all last night to celebrate. I mean, I was watching Buffy when I came on. Girl power.

Transcript:  Welcome Peter. What are you doing these days? We talked about this last time. But just refresh my memory. Yeah, I raised a venture fund doing seed investing. Your own fund? Well, with partners. Is that ROJ.AS? Is that where we'd find that? No.  I mean, you could. But it's with BetaWorks. BetaWorks. That's right. We talked about this. I'm just kind of coming back. How big is your fund? I can't announce that yet. Are you going to say? Remember, you're talking to Crunchbase at this point.

Start time: 239.78
End time: 270.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just just me really. But now I'm hyper curious. Yeah, we can talk about it later. Okay. Technically, I'm not allowed to say. Nice. I think I've probably already said too much according to the SEC. You guys can talk about this offline. Oh, there's SEC involved. Yeah.  Yeah, and Alex can, I think vouch for the there's a lot of rules around what you can say around raising new funds. Solicitation and so forth. Yeah, the job is actually no, I'm not soliciting soliciting solicitation. Read the prospectus carefully before you listen to Peter Rojas. That's the bottom line.

Transcript:  Well, if I had money, I'd be an LP for you. So, you know, I can't even just say nothing. Just bling your eyes. What's LP? Liquor Pal? Exactly. Okay. It's a limited partner. Okay. Hey, calm down. This week, contingence is on the air. I mentioned you, Flo. Thank you, Florence. I am also host of all about Android. Great to have you. You are bearing in your hands. Something returned from Barcelona. Can I talk about it? Yes, actually, I didn't get to go to Barcelona. Unfortunately, you didn't go to the Congress, but you covered it.  interesting low price smartphones, but then get nearly the attention. The 3310 did. They run Android now. Yeah, which is also. Yeah, they're not actually made by Nokia. They're made by former Nokia engineers who went next door, literally next door and to a new company. But they had to wait a few years after they sold the smartphone business to Microsoft. I think it was was it a three year lockout or five year lockout? But I think it's expired now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, this is on the up and up. But I think when that sale

Start time: 359.00
End time: 372.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  happened, I don't think anyone expected that when that lockout ended that they were going to go back. Yeah. Well, that there wouldn't be any Windows phones, basically. Nobody wants Windows phones. And so Nokia, which, by the way, those Lumias were great phones. Yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 373.00
End time: 418.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's probably right to buy them. They've they've gone back to making smartphones as well as candy bar phones. But these are less expensive phones, probably for the developing world, I would guess. But they are for for Android phones are nice. They're made of, you know, gorilla glass and they're all aluminum.  Well, it's also the Nokia brand carries a lot more weight outside. Absolutely. So I'm rooting for them. I'd love to see them succeed. They also announced, as we mentioned, the candy bar 3310, which has snake on. Did you get to have you played with that yet? I want to buy one. 51 bucks. Why not? That's your burner phone. Yeah, that's a good one. That's a good idea. Tell us about the G six. This is LG's flagship. Yes, this is LG's flagship. You know, Samsung didn't announce anything big this year at MWC. That's coming March 29. They did.

Start time: 419.00
End time: 439.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did announce the tab s three at MWC, which is a new sort of the iPad Pro to the tab. I got up early for that announcement. You did? Yeah, we broadcast it much to my disappointment and chagrin because it wasn't much. It looks just like an iPad. Right. And it looks just like a giant metal tab s two. Yeah, with this really nice stylus.

Start time: 442.18
End time: 486.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to hear you clearly. So show me the LG G six. It's pretty. It's really pretty. This is a glass back. Now, curiously, it's got like different layers. It's got different gorilla glass around it. They're doing all that stuff now. Yeah, which is interesting.  Samsung might have started this with the with the s seven probably. Right. I mean, me. Actually, I'm not sure about that. Possibly. So five point seven inch LCD screen, quad HD HDR capable HDR display. Is this the one that's a three by two, two by one aspect ratio? So that was one thing I kind of intrigued me and I thought it's a little taller than normal. It's narrow. Even the screenshots are very narrow. And the idea was that you would then be able to use it with one hand, but it's still a five point seven inch phone. You can use it with one hand.

Start time: 487.00
End time: 516.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't use this as one hand. I mean, I can't. I thought it would look a little bit odd, but it doesn't look too tall. It looks I mean, it's pretty. It's a phone water resistant IP 68 rated. So you can take it with you into the shower for up to half an hour. Fingerprint readers on the back. That's what, of course, a lot of phones are doing. And a home button. It still has a physical home button. Well, the back is the home button. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Not the home button. It goes in. It's a power button. Yes. Oh, that's really strange. Yes.

Start time: 517.00
End time: 546.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you turn it on and off from the fingerprint reader. And that's how you take your screenshots as you hold the back and then it's weird. I mean, it's beautiful. Yeah, it's really pretty. We're really at peak phone, though. It's very hard for any of these companies to do anything that's at all interesting. We're talking about now little tiny slivers of distance difference. This has like the iPhone seven plus two cameras. One one super wide one normal. Both are wide. Both are sorry. Both are 13 megapixel. One is wide.

Start time: 547.00
End time: 586.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the front facing camera is five megapixel with 100 degree lens. Oh, that's pretty wide. Yeah. So your face will look a little but you'll be able to fit in a bunch of people. So USB C 3,300 milliamp battery pack. Isn't it really now just Samsung and Apple and who cares about the rest, at least in the U.S. and least in the high end market. There's a lot of market for 400.  People like the LG phones, though, like the G two and the G three sold really well. And then the G four and the G five were kind of very different concepts like the Sony said that they were enthusiast phones like the Sony fans love their experience.

Start time: 586.36
End time: 601.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sony had new experience. Everybody else goes, well, that's very ho hum. Same thing with the LG's. The LG fans love them. Everybody else goes, well, it's not it's hard to distinguish that from a Samsung, frankly. It looks a lot like an S seven the square seven.

Start time: 631.86
End time: 691.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. LG has 10% of the smartphone market right now. Oh, that's not going to happen. U.S. or globally. This is top smartphone OEMs from comscore us 9.6% low end and mid range phones. They saw a lot of them at like the MVNOs. But globally, what I thought was interesting was if you actually there was a report was a Gartner just put out a report. It was the company it's Oppo. Yes, love Oppo. Which also, they kind of sold it. But  Spun out one plus. But then also there's um, there was like a third, there's a third brand under there. Oh, I didn't know that. They were cagey about one plus. I want to say museum, museum, which I can never use a museum. It's a Chinese smartphone brand. This is why I'm glad I have a computer in front of me. The company BBK. They also own. They also do Vivo. Vivo. I don't even know that. Yeah, that's some overseas. So for Americans, there's

Start time: 691.68
End time: 721.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a lot of brands that we don't really see. Yeah, like blue is very popular around the world as a low cost Android device. We have it here. But how many people you ever see carrying a blue? No. Well, I forgot the LG made phones before this conversation. So really? Yeah, I live in the iPhone world. I mean, I just buy a new iPhone every two years and it works out great. And they're pretty good. And I'm happy. And I see no real reason to change. Maybe I should. Maybe I'm being ignorant pixel. Okay, why? What's the best? Okay, what's the best? I carry a pixel.

Start time: 721.62
End time: 811.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great. I love the pixel to carry both. I carry an iPhone 7. Yeah, I carry both. And a pixel. Yeah, I care. I think those are that's the best Android and iOS devices. Pixels pretty pure. You don't get all these fun little things. I was mentioning before the show that I just ordered the HTC U Ultra, the one that's so pretty, pretty gorgeous. And it has a second screen at the top with extra little icon there. I mean, they're stretching their push to find something to make them get that with the V 20. Right. And stopped.  So what's so I think we can stipulate at least in the US flagship owned pretty much outright by Apple and Samsung. The rest are small. Yeah. How about in the budget phone? Because there's still a big market for sub $200 phones. LG I mean, Motorola announced their G five. Yes. What do you think? Did you see that? Did you talk about that at all? Yeah, I mean, it's a metal mid range phone. It's a cheap. It's 200 bucks. It's 200 bucks. I mean,  I've always been a fan of the Moto G's and their great mid range low end devices. And then if you really want to go cheap to Nokia 3310 for 50 bucks, $51. But I believe that one's only 2G though. Yeah, it doesn't. It's not a data phone. No, no, that's fine. Because it's not a data phone. It's a phone phone. You don't need 234 or LTE. Because what are you doing? You're not certain they do have a browser, but I don't know why. They that's it. They have snake. You don't need LG. You don't need data for snake. You don't need data to make phone calls. You don't need data

Start time: 811.64
End time: 828.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for text. No, you have to keep checking in to authenticate your access. I'm sorry. Snake is an online only game. No pirating your snake. We want to improve the experience of our customers. We made fun of that. But remember back in the day of flip phones, there were app stores that were DRM.

Start time: 828.18
End time: 841.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're terrible. And I was in the Verizon V gas store. I'll never have access to those apps. I remember that there was Blackberry stores. Speaking of Blackberry, we should will be will be in trouble if we don't mention the key one. Oh, what is the key one?

Start time: 842.04
End time: 859.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the new Blackberry phone. It runs Android. Make it bigger for you got a keyboard. It has a keyboard that doesn't slide in the spacebar. Okay, it's productivity focused. Does it run Twitter? Yeah, well, then I'm Android. It's a full Android.

Start time: 860.10
End time: 872.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a full Android. It's seven. The things you care about are so different than what I care about. Fingerprint readers and this. I just want to tweet. Like if my phone only tweeted, I'd be like 85% happy with it. The problem with the most recent Blackberry.

Start time: 872.58
End time: 899.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The peak, which I think was the yes, which was just for Twitter. And there's one for email too, right? There was these mono useful. And they were trash. No one bought them because turns out I'm the only person who wants that. Did you have a peak? No. Even you didn't have a peak. It was adorable. It was it wasn't it was a device. No, it wasn't a phone. It was just a Twitter device. They sold two. There's one for one for doing email and another one they sold that was just for doing Twitter. Yeah, I'll pull it up. I carry both peak internet webmasters.

Start time: 902.78
End time: 953.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I carry both for email and Twitter. Hold on. Here's a headline. The Twitter peak is so dumb it makes my brain hurt. Thank you 2009 Gizmodo. You're welcome. Back in the day, still some spice to them. Look how cute that is. I mean, I kind of want to take it home and, you know, marry it. I bet it doesn't even work anymore. I bet it doesn't. I bet it support. It doesn't. The Twitter API no longer. I love the disclaimers on this actually. Service plan no longer supported by manufacturer. Oh, that's a bummer. It doesn't even have Wi-Fi. We don't know if or what.  Full recharge under two hours. I love it. They're so proud of that. This is really quick guys in 2009. That's how far we've been though in the last eight years. It's incredible to me. I can't believe there's 34 customer reviews. I think we got one in for review and I was just three stars actually pretty generous.

Start time: 955.66
End time: 964.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the keyboard on the new Blackberries is not the Blackberry keyboard we love. And that's part of the problem is you're giving him a physical keyboard, but it's not a good usable.

Start time: 964.40
End time: 971.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I haven't played with it, but people that have got hands on with it in Barcelona said I had the priv and it was very hard to type on. And it looks like the priv.

Start time: 972.96
End time: 1008.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had hands on with it at CES actually. The key one. Yes. And it feels like a traditional Blackberry phone. Oh, it does. Some people want that.  The keyboard definitely is tiny, but it reminds me of when the Blackberry got a little smaller and they were making them in seven colors at Verizon. I actually don't know what model number that was. I think it was the bold.  But it's a nice, it harkens back to those glory days. It has a nice rubbery back. I'm kind of interested in it. It's really nice. Can you type faster on it than you can on an Android or iPhone?

Start time: 1010.72
End time: 1021.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a learning curve. I had a physical keyboard. I used to carry a Blackberry back in the day and I could type really fast on it. Probably faster than I can on a virtual keyboard.

Start time: 1021.24
End time: 1026.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I used to be able to type so fast on T9. I could do that with my eyes closed in class.

Start time: 1027.38
End time: 1034.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very disappointing. According to CNET, the 3310, the Nokia candy bar will not work in the US. It doesn't have the right frequencies.

Start time: 1035.56
End time: 1058.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But can it still play Snake for $51? It can. Think of it as a Snake machine. That's fine. It's like the Twitter machine, but even better because it still works.  There's actually an app that emulates it, by the way. I really hate to go down nostalgia lane. My mom had one of the old Nokias when I was a little kid and I would play it in the car and she'd go to the grocery store.  And I have so many awesome memories of that game. She left you in the car? Did she leave the windows cracked? I wasn't like four. I'm not that young. Calm down.

Start time: 1059.20
End time: 1066.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember playing that incessantly. She put a sign in the thing and said, the kid's okay. Just ignore him. Or hopefully the kid's not okay. Please don't break window.

Start time: 1067.06
End time: 1078.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I think it's fun to see the occasional throwback in tech that actually hits the mark and makes an improvement on something we all know and love. I like that a lot.  Which I think is the Blackberry KeyOne. Okay. Well, in that case, buy one, review it, and then tell me about it.

Start time: 1079.26
End time: 1086.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought the Priv and I kind of regret it. The Priv was not Blackberry's return to greatness.  Well, that's what I think the KeyOne probably isn't either.

Start time: 1087.94
End time: 1092.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it was, well, but the difference is that the Blackberry Priv was done by Blackberry Blackberry, not by...

Start time: 1093.87
End time: 1096.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, who's doing the KeyOne?  Well, now it's TCL and Alcatel.

Start time: 1099.38

Start time: 1104.75
End time: 1108.39

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1112.92

Transcript:  I think this is why I still use iPhones, because I'm lazy.  I don't have to think about any of this stuff.  I will tell you that.

Start time: 1129.84
End time: 1131.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, people are like, oh, you know it's Apple.  Alcatel's phones are pretty great.

Start time: 1132.06
End time: 1134.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1136.02
End time: 1154.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When my iPhone broke and I needed a phone in 45 minutes, I bought the Alcatel Idle 3, I think.  Yeah, you did.  I got it in 45 minutes from Amazon.  I think Nokia is...  And it was great. 200 bucks.  Was it Amazon Now?  Prime Now, yeah.  Prime Now, I think.  That's still magic to me.  I dropped my phone, stopped working, I'm like, okay, I need something new.  And I literally have some...

Start time: 1167.00
End time: 1189.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Lucent, which was AT&T's Bell Labs, sold to Alcatel, which then became part of Nokia.  So, that's really confusing.  Actually, what it shows you, does it show you a mature industry shaking out and merging  and reconfiguring?  That's what happened to TV.  Yeah, and it happened to PCs.  Yeah, that's right.  Think about all the consolidation in the PC market right now.

End time: 1243.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but they do make some money.  It's just a very low margin business.  And the thing is, they essentially get given the business for free, because Toshiba, for  example, they're losing money on it.  They want out.  They just basically give it to them.  Oh, okay.  That's what happens.

Start time: 1255.44
End time: 1263.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it can't cost that much.  And if you can pick up eight points of market share, you can push your suppliers a little  harder.  Okay, I can see that.  But it's not a huge move in terms of profit.

Start time: 1263.44
End time: 1277.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it's a move that happens at this stage of a market where the business is essentially...  The product's a commodity.  And you have legacy players who are not making any money that want to get out.  This happened to automobiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I wonder if they'll just fold or if they'll say, well, let's sell the brand.  It'd be interesting if Nokia acquired all the low-rent brands, leaving the high-end  market to Samsung and Apple, but saying, we'd like to dominate...

Start time: 1366.05
End time: 1399.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.  Because almost all of these phones, almost to a phone, they all had...  Except for Samsung uses its own chips.  But in the US, even they use Qualcomm chips.  Apple was single sourced on Qualcomm, but they've started to be nervous about that.  So they're using Intel as well to their detriment.  They're not as good as Qualcomm.  For the chipsets.  Well, it's all a system on a chip, right?  You get the radio, you get everything, right?  Yeah.  Apple still makes its CPU.  Yes.  Everything else is Qualcomm.

Start time: 1415.10
End time: 1435.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, the story was in the iPhone 7, they dual sourced their radios, Qualcomm and Intel.  And the LTE radios from Intel were so much slower than the Qualcomm chips that Apple admitted they had seen those.  They slowed down the Qualcomm chips so there wouldn't be an obvious inequality.  So you don't get the better stuff.  Everyone gets the same thing.  They throttled them.

Start time: 1436.38
End time: 1444.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one way to handle PR.  But the thing is, with this next generation of LTE, which people are going to start to call 5G, but it's not.  It'll be 4.5G.

Start time: 1445.30
End time: 1449.39

End time: 1466.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that?  We went through this before and we survived.  Because it's a marketing term, it's not a technical term.  Exactly.  Well, there actually is a technical definition for 5G.  As there was for 4G.  And what happened was, 5G finalized.  They have defined it as...

Start time: 1466.28

Start time: 1473.01
End time: 1486.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they defined it as a gigabit.  So, for instance, at Mobile World Congress, DTE had a gigabit phone that they were showing off.  Which was to show off the capabilities of what phones will be able to do once 5G becomes available.  So it's the same stuff we do now, but faster?

It's in...the Snapdragons are in watches.  They're in tablets.  Actually, this one's 821.  It's the older 821.  We will say 835 based.  In fact, I think the S8...

Start time: 1587.63
End time: 1617.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  821 is a very credible chip.  It's interesting that the dominance of Qualcomm can hurt these companies.  But it's just obsolete.  The 810 two generations ago was so terrible that a lot of phones had to throttle it.  They were heat problems.  It hurt the entire Android market for a whole year.  There were a lot of terrible phones based on the 810.  It was a bad year.  It shows you how dependent the market is.  I'm sure these companies would love to see a second source.  So if they have an 810 situation, once again, with Qualcomm, they could go to Intel or someone else.  But no one else is there yet.  It's really a Qualcomm's market.

Transcript:  As long as we're in the phones and we're going to move on.  There have been leaks, quite a few, of the Galaxy S8.  They announced an event on March 29th in New York City to show this.  I think at this point we know probably everything there is to know about the Galaxy S.  I can't imagine there'll be much new.  There's going to be an edge version.  There's an S8 Plus as well, which will be 6.2 inches.  I'd be very curious.  It really seems like we've all decided that 6 is too big.  That 5.8, 5.7.  People are complaining now.  They want bigger?

Start time: 1696.32
End time: 1706.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That phones are getting too big and they want smaller.  Yeah, that's what I think.  The iPhone SE is a nice sweet spot for a lot of people.  They really like the iPhone SE because it was...  It depends on the bezels though.  Also true.

Start time: 1708.36
End time: 1713.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is 5.7 inches and it doesn't feel...  It has to do with the size of the bezel around it and the thickness of the phone.

They will continue to support for the micro SD cards, which is good.  But nobody is doing removable batteries.  That was the last phone I think.  For a lot of Android diehards, it's going to be a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you want to get better battery life, you want to get more battery in the same space.  And by eliminating the packaging, you can get better battery life.  The sad thing about the S8 is Samsung continues along its path to duplicate what Google has already done with Android.  They have a new virtual assistant named Bixby.  Just what you always wanted.  One more thing to talk to.

Start time: 1807.72
End time: 1821.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they realized that they needed to have something in their house.  Bixby.  But it does remind me a lot of Samsung's earlier efforts to say,  Oh, we've got to have our own app store.  Everything.  Their own app store.  And then they launch these things and then they're retrained.  Yes.

We have no plans at this time for a Chromebook Pixel.  So I'm not sure whether that means he got in trouble or if they're really not doing it.  He also said that they're working on a Pixel 2 for later this year.  We don't know when later.  Probably October.  Right before the iPhone.  That's what they did.  It'll be a year old in September because they announced it right before the iPhone.  So that's the time to do it.  And then today I saw a new rumor that there might be a low-priced Google Android phone.  They won't call the Pixel.

I actually think that it probably will be a little bit like Facebook where you had this big pop, people got excited, and then they have a slow down earnings or growth doesn't shape up as quickly as possible.  And then it drops.  And so maybe I'll buy it when it drops.

Apparently there's as much as a billion dollars in shorting going on right now in Snap.  There's a lot of people betting, as you will, that that pop will go away.  They were saying that they were going to...  And you'll help me with this because you're the financial guy.  Sure.  They were saying initially that the IPO would be 14 to 16 dollars.  They ended up opting for 17 dollars.  Which means they took a lot of money off the table.  For the founders, each took 300 million dollars for themselves.  You have quarter a billion and 300 million.  I forget the final number.

End time: 2465.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean I don't have the article in front of me  and I read it a week or two ago.  But essentially,  Jeremy took...  The entire seed round was done by Lightspeed.  And he put some terms in it that I think  gave Lightspeed the right to  I think block any future investment  and also take 50% of any future rounds.  And so, what happens is...  So they could have had more and more and more of SNAP.  So what happens though is that  when you go to raise more money  the later stage investors say  I can't invest in those terms.  I need to be able to take 50%  three quarters of this next round.  I'm not going to give you money if that's the terms.  And so, Evan at that point was  pretty angry and so they came to some sort of  accommodation with Lightspeed.  Lightspeed didn't continue to invest.  Well, it killed the relationship.  It killed the relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The numbers did not go down, but the growth did slow.  I think the changes that they made to Instagram  definitely blunted their growth.  I think that, again,  it's one of those things that's really hard to say  where this goes.  I do think that there is,  in a way, a lot of people,  especially a lot of people in the media world,  have an incentive for Snapchat  to become successful.  For no other reason, it's a counterweight to Facebook.  Now, whether that happens, I don't know.  It's a counterweight to Facebook.

Part of that is a lot of people thought,  and I try to argue against this  because my kids use Snapchat,  but a lot of people thought it was a sexting tool.  The kids are just sending naked pictures of each other.  That's why they like Snapchat because they evaporate.  And I knew even then it wasn't  because I watched my kids using it.  And I was like, oh, I'm going to use Snapchat.  And even then it wasn't because I watched my kids using it.  And they said, no, no, no, no.  This is how we like to communicate with our friends.

Very much so.  Better than anybody else right now,  except perhaps maybe Apple.  But, you know,  I think that they've figured out a lot around  designing user experiences that people  don't even realize are augmented reality  when it comes down to it.

He points out that Apple has a whole bunch of people,  maybe a thousand engineers  working on augmented reality.  But what is that going to look like? Not a clear phone.

So when I'm supposed to Snap, the most I will ever have,  and this is going to say something about my metrics,  please don't write this down,  is I'll have 200 max people look at my Snaps  per Snap.  For Instagram, because I have way more people on Instagram,  I've had a longer time to build up that base,  and I have a lot of people who have been following me  from different publications.  How many Instagram followers do you have?  Tens of thousands.  I have more than a thousand.  Oh, that flow on Instagram?

No.  To me, it's not even close to compelling alternative to Snap.  And yet we see these,  and maybe it's a misunderstanding,  but we see these Snaps growth slowed  because of Instagram.

Transcript:  Mmm.  We come to you on a 10 gigabit symmetric fiber line.  Did you know that?  No.  Just love seeing that.  The funny thing is, I'll just do the Fast.com test here.  None of our devices, none of our switches, none of our connectors are more than a gigabit.  But I am getting 940 megabits, very close to a gigabit on here.  Yeah, you are too.  Fast.com will tell you that.  That's the Netflix, they connect to the Netflix server.  That's thanks to Sonic, the greatest internet service provider.  Well, you're on a Mac.  What did you want?  You're on Wi-Fi too.  Yeah.  I'm hardwired.  The greatest internet service provider ever.  And I almost feel bad doing these ads for Sonic because so few of you can get Sonic.  And it's really just a mean thing to talk about what Sonic offers.  Listen to this.  They're doing residential and business fiber to the premise.  Fiber to the premise, okay.  Now, look at this.  This is their gigabit connectivity.  We kind of went overboard.  But this is what you get with their gigabit connectivity.  And it's available in San Francisco, the North Bay area, the East Bay area.  They are expanding fast.  You get a fit, besides gigabit service, internet service includes 15 email accounts.  You get a gigabyte of cloud storage, personal web hosting with a new domain, fax line service.  You also get a home phone.  This is all for one price with unlimited local and long distance calling.  You even can keep your existing phone numbers and port it over from your current carrier.  That's easy.  $40 a month.  $40 a month.  Now think about your internet service provider and what you're paying for stuff that's not even as good as that.  And by the way, no bandwidth cap.  No bandwidth cap.  And if you look at the EFF, they've got what, five, six stars, all the stars for privacy,  for standing up for their customers against government's, you know, subpoenas and warrants.  Friendly local customers support.  This is what every internet service provider should be.  Sonic's customer advocacy is paving the way for a better state of internet all over the country.  And we've got to tip our hat to them and thank them for our amazing gigabit, 10 gigabit service here in the studios.  Join the internet revolution.  Visit sonic.com slash twit.  I've been a Sonic customer for 15 years, for a long time.  And receive your first month of Sonic internet and phone service for free.  Plus, if you bundle it with Dish, yes, they offer TV too.  You'll save $120 on your Sonic bill.  Visit Sonic, s-o-n-i-c dot com slash twit.  And I love giving them a plug.  Not only because of what they do for us.  But just because I think they're really setting, showing that you could be an internet service provider  and you can do all this and you can make money at 40 bucks with no bandwidth caps.  Which is driving me crazy.  At home, I can't get Sonic.  I come to work if I really want to download anything.

By the way, they're talking about people familiar with Apple's plans.  You know who that is?  Employees?  Yeah, PR people who called...  Because the journal does this routinely.  If the Apple PR wants to send a trial balloon up or warn people that we're not going to  release this, they call the journalist.  They say, don't quote me.  It's on the background.

It looks like a restart, but what happens is the springboard, the user interface crashes,  program crashes, university crashes, but it's not like a full restart.  You don't get the white Apple and you have to wait a minute while it's starting.  There was a period of time when a lot of that happened, but that seemed like a minor...

Transcript:  You can believe Blanco.  I'm very glad that link was in there.  You can't go wrong.  Our show today, you know what I cooked last night?  It was so good.  It was a Japanese barbecue sauce on chicken.  I can't remember, it was like Yakinuki sauce or something.  I'd never had it before.  And then I used something called mirin, I think mirin, which was a rice vinegar.  And then I shredded carrots and I marinated the, I'm talking about my blue apron.  And I've got blue apron tonight.  I think we're going to do a teriyaki salmon.  Blue apron's awesome.  It's been kind of one of my New Year's resolutions to not eat out so much.  Lots of calories eating out.  You get the bread, you can't say no.  You eat the bread, that's a mistake.  You get dessert lots of times.  So we really been trying to be good and cook at home.  And blue apron has been such a boom.  Blue apron is the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country.  They deliver amazing, it's all fresh, it's uncooked.  They're giving you the recipe and the ingredients to make an amazing meal.  The house fills with the smells of ginger or shallots or sauteed garlic.  I made jasmine rice.  And they taught me a better way to make jasmine rice.  I sauteed garlic and what else?  It was something else.  And then I put the rice in and browned that a little bit.  Then I added the water and cooked it.  It was the best brown jasmine rice I've ever had.  And so once you learn these techniques from now on, I even went on Amazon.  I ordered more of that, what is it?  Yakinuki sauce?  It's a Japanese barbecue sauce.  It's incredible.  Incredible.  So you learn these techniques.  You learn new ingredients.  And you're having delicious meals.  They have two plans.  One for couples.  One for families.  Family of four.  Although we use the two-person plan and we feed our teenager too.  So they're generous portions.  But they're delicious and healthful.  And I always assumed, oh, this has caused me more, but it's worth it.  Actually, you pay 60% more at a grocery store.  Because if you think about it, they don't have as much overhead as a grocery store.  Look what's on the menu.  Pork and cabbage tacos.  Those look really, really good.  With pineapple and pickled jalapeno salsa.  Oh, man.  And you get just the right ingredients.  So I got the mirin, which is a rice wine, a very good rice wine vinegar.  But I only need two tablespoons.  So it comes in a little bottle of two tablespoons of mirin.  So you have no waste.  There's leftovers if you don't eat all the food.  But there's no leftovers from cooking it.  You don't get extra stuff.  Salmon piccato.  Oh, that's what I'm making tonight.  Salmon piccato with orzo and broccoli.  Pork chops and miso butter with bok choy and marinated apple.  We had some good bok choy last night.  It was so good.  I sautéed it in the pan with the yakanuki sauce or whatever it's called in the marina.  Vegetable chili and baked sweet potatoes with crispy tortilla strips.  Spicy shrimp coconut curry with cabbage and rice.  Look, here's what it goes.  There's no weekly commitment.  You only get deliveries when you want them.  You go to the website.  You look at the menus.  They never repeat more than once a year.  So you're always something interesting and different.  You customize it.  They deliver to 99% of the continental United States.  Check out this week's menu.  And you're going to get your first three meals free with your first purchase and free shipping.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  It's named Blue Apron because that's the color of the little blue aprons that the apprentice chefs at the famous French cooking school, the Cordon Bleu, wear little blue aprons.  Oh.  Yeah.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  I love it.  I really love it.  So we're going home.  Lisa said, should we eat out tonight?  I said, no, we got the salmon.  We're going to make the salmon piccata.

And as far as I can tell, almost all the same songs on all of them, right?  It's all roughly the same 30 million song playlist.  You know what's really interesting?  How the music industry's changed.  Because remember, it wasn't so long ago that the record industry knew that, well, we're  going to have two good songs in this band.  Let's put in an album with 10 songs.  We'll sell them the album.  We'll make more money.  Then Apple came along and strong-armed them and said, we're going to do singles for 99  cents.  And the record industry said, no.  And they said...  And Steve Jobs literally said, I don't care.  We're doing it.  And was able to force it through.  It changed the record industry.  People bought individual, bought a la carte, but they bought.  They still bought.  Then along come these streaming services.  And I've got to think nobody's buying music anymore.  Why would you?  I just bought CDs.

Yeah, but they're not making any money on Spotify.  Make better music.  So Spotify now says it has 50 million paid subscribers.  Compare that to Apple Music, which is at less than half, 20 million.

So they added 10 million subs from September 14th, 16th to today, which is about 59,000  per day or 1.78 million a month.  And then I averaged out their entire lifelong cadence from 2011 through 16, and it was 590K  a month.  But if you go back to just 2016...  Do you have a graph?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am indeed a dork.  Yes.  That's what you're aiming for.  I'm jealous.  Anyway, the point is they've managed to keep up their 2016 new paid user accretion rate.  Their acceleration is consistent.  It has been maintained.  Yes.  So they're growing faster now than they were before, which bodes really well for them.  The problem is their revenue is mostly passed through.  So about 85% of it goes to the labels.  They have to drive margin just on 15% that goes to credit card processing, marketing,  promotions, and so forth.  This is precisely the problem all the services have.  Yes.  So Spotify needs to find a way to get leverage against the labels to drive a better deal.  The problem is the labels bought part of Spotify.  So now Spotify has to beat up its parents to get a bigger allowance so it doesn't die  before it can go public.  But it can't really do that.  You know what the record industry loves?

Start time: 4985.87
End time: 5028.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They love the idea that they own this.  Yes.  And at any point they could choke it off.  If they use it as long as they get some value out of it, maybe there's promotional value.  But unlike Apple, which they cannot control, they control...  Spotify.  Spotify.  And this is the problem.  In my opinion, I've said this before, none of these independents have a chance because  Apple, Amazon, and Google don't need the revenue from their music services.  It's incidental revenue, incremental revenue.  They can keep it going for other reasons.  Spotify, Pandora, Tidal, they're living on the scraps the music industry allows them.  And at any point the music industry could say that's it.  Yeah.  Which is terrifying.

Start time: 5068.36
End time: 5087.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is actually though exactly how all of these companies are responding.  And even Audible is doing this.  They're saying if we create our own content, then we're not beholden to the record industry, the publishers.  And maybe we can somehow get a grasp on this business, make some money if we create our own original content.  Which is why Facebook is getting into TV style content, right?

If you're Spotify and you can say the only place to have the Metallica record, kind of how Tidal's been using...  Yeah, is what Tidal's tried to do.  Exactly.  But Spotify has more clout, I think, and more total heft than Tidal has by a factor of probably about eight.

Transcript:  So how long until Spotify starts buying up independent labels?  Do they have the money to do that?  Well, they borrowed a bunch of money at a very, very expensive rate, as I'm sure Peter knows, because of the terms on the debt.  If they don't IPO, the discounts that the people who lend them money get larger as time goes along.  I think there's a ratchet.  When is the clock tick?  Now.

So Spotify needs to become the YouTube for music.  But guess who's already doing that?  SoundCloud.  Can they beat SoundCloud at its own game?  Are they?  I think that's the plan at SoundCloud.  If anything, SoundCloud is going to go out of business before Spotify.  They're struggling too.  Yeah.  Alright, Spotify acquires SoundCloud and builds...  They've talked...  Ooh, that is...

Yeah, see, that's not a sustainable business model.  You mean $1.50.  No, $1.05.  That's not as bad.  But they have like the...  But I'm saying...  Snaps going public.  But Spotify, it's like 85 cents out of every dollar.  Right.  But with Vivo, they actually...  They're negative.  They're negative.  They're...  They're clogged down.  I don't know.

It's the, you know, what's good about it is Captain Obvious ad, the same ad, like four  times in the show is really annoying.  I wouldn't mind if it were four different ads so much, but it's the same ad because  they can't sell it.  You can pay to get all the ads gone.  Almost all the ads.  Yeah, that's what I thought.

I think we should talk about that.  Which of you are going to go round the moon with Elon Musk next year?  I mean, I've been asking him.  He hasn't replied to my questions.  The game of the year, GDC was this week, the Game Developers Conference.  What did they pick as the game of the year?  Don't look at the notes.  Think.  Use your head.  Use your noggin.  Use your flatulent, flaxed, flabby noggin.  Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  If you wanted to hire a new host for this week in tech, you know what you would do?  You would go to ZipRecruiter because I'll tell you what, let's assume the right, the  perfect person to host this show is somewhere.  Not me, obviously, but somewhere that person is there.  And what job board is that person on?  You know, no, you don't know.  You don't know.  There's hundreds of them.  So here's the deal.  You go to ZipRecruiter, you post it once on ZipRecruiter, it goes to 200 plus job boards  and Facebook and Twitter and everywhere.  So the chances are much better that you're going to hit that right person.  And here's the beauty part.  You might say, if you're the poor person in charge of hiring at your company, I don't  want 100,000 emails.  I don't want all those phone calls.  No, you won't get any.  You'll get zero because it goes into the ZipRecruiter interface.  And the ZipRecruiter interface is awesome.  It reformats the resumes to their uniforms so you can read them quickly and easily.  You can set up standard questions, multiple choice, yes, no, even essay questions that  you ask every candidate.  You can then review those, screen out the people who don't match and then pick the right  person fast.  All in that interface.  So fast that in a few days you'll have the best candidate.  It is the most efficient.  It's the brilliant way to hire people.  That's why it's been used by the Fortune 100, by thousands of medium and small businesses  use it.  I think more than a million businesses now have used ZipRecruiter.com to do their hiring.  We've used it.  It's great.  Still looking for that host though for the show.  Haven't found that person.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  We got a free trial for you.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for helping us with our hiring.  Game of the year, GDC.  And I agree with it.

Start time: 7132.62

Start time: 7141.54
End time: 7158.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's called Grayball like Blackball, right?  And the idea is, of course that tool is used for bad customers.  Because one of the things Uber does, you rank the drivers, but the driver can rank you and  they want to Blackball customers.  It was part of a program called violation of terms of service.  And so they don't want people who are going to violate their service.

Start time: 7161.24
End time: 7174.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the article, it says that many people in Uber's team were uncomfortable with how  it was used.  So to me, even though it wasn't always used in illegal fashion, certainly the people internally  were uncomfortable at it, it tells you how they were using it.

End time: 7249.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she doesn't care.  She doesn't...  I mean, I think at the end of the day, an investor or the board is going to make a decision as  to what's going to end up maximizing value towards an IPO.  And if they decide that Travis is net negative rather than net positive, they will get rid  of him.  But I don't think they're at that point.  Is Travis the problem?  Absolutely.
