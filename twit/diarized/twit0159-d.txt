Hey, he's about a year old, right Patrick?  11 months, 10th month.  He's the cutest baby in the world.  Ladies and gentlemen, say hi to Seamus Norton, which is a great name by the way.  Thank you.  What's his middle name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about that some other time.  Oh, is it secret?  No, actually I've been reading some interesting stories about identity theft and people don't  know that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Yeah, no, that's a very good point.  We don't know exactly when he was born.  He is wearing a spore t-shirt, which I like.  That's very attractive.  Patrick Norton is also here in studio with us, which is great because he brought the baby.  So it's nice to see him.  And little Seamus is going to be a good boy during this boring conversation, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's like, I want to start chewing on cables.  Yes, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's good tasting cables, just like licorice, just all over the place.  You can have those.  Don't encourage them.  Also, John C. Dvorak is here via Skype from his home overlooking the racetrack, a beautiful  Albany, California.  In fact, if you listen carefully, I think you can hear the bugle call for the fourth race  at Bay Meadows.  Hey, Mr. Dvorak.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  And they're a bunch of drunks who are very happy right now.  Also with us, and I'm really thrilled to have him, Mr. Patrick, I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan.  Well, Ryan and Patrick seem to go together.  I don't know what it is.  We've got a bunch of Irish people here.  Ryan Block, formerly of Engadget, and now with a new enterprise, and we're really excited  and I'm sure he's going to tell us all about it.  Hey, Ryan, it's great to have you back.  Thanks, man.  Good to be back.  So you're like the number one, what is it, number five, number one technology podcast,  number five on iTunes.  Pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, the stats change daily, but I think it might have gone down a little bit.  You don't have to tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  They also favor, not to take anything away from the accomplishment, but they also favor  new podcasts in a big way.  I've had my heart broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, a little bit, yeah.  So the way it actually works, not that I think we need to discuss it in too much depth, but  it looks at activity, right?  So it looks at basically new subscribers.  And of course, if you have a new show, you're going to have the most new subscribers that  day, you know, just statistically speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little deceiving, but it's really like the record charts, you know.  To be number one on the record charts, you have to have a new record, obviously, because  it's based on sales.  Unless you're Pink Floyd.  And heavily weighted, right.  And heavily weighted towards sales in the last couple of days.  But nevertheless, the tech podcast hasn't debuted in the top 10 in quite some time,  so it's quite an accomplishment.  I appreciate it.  Thanks, sir.  Is it, now do you pronounce it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you say it, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  GDGT, it's like the word gadget, but with no vowels.  You can call it gadget, but we chose to call it GDGT because if you say, oh, go to Gadget.com,  you're not going to get our site.  You're going to get a squatter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus there's some confusion with NGadget.  By the way, it's you and Peter Rojas.  You founded NGadget, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was one of the early editors.  Yeah, I was there at the very beginning.  Peter is technically the founder of NGadget.  He's also the founder of Gizmodo.  So Peter and I have been working together on a gadget since the very beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a pretty good heritage for a...  It's got to be a gadget site, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it is a gadget site.  And we said pretty much upfront.  And the heritage doesn't just come from Peter and I.  We wanted to extend that, and we wanted to be kind of a little bit of a new focal point in the gadget world.  So we reached out to some friends and colleagues,  and while we haven't announced the full roster of people who are trying to get involved in the site,  the first two people who we did mention are going to be on our board of advisors are my successor at NGadget, Josh Topolsky.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's still good relationships within Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and for the first time ever, at least for Peter and I, and especially for any project out there,  the editor of Gizmodo is Brian Lamb.  Which I guess he's the editorial director now.  He just moved up.  He's also on our board of advisors.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going directly in competition with NGadget and Gizmodo.  Well, maybe they're not in competition,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and maybe he wants to take advantage of the fact that these are the two strongest centers for not just activity and reportage of gadgets, but traffic.  So I can see where...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I mean, we're not...  It's not going to be a gadget blog and a gadget news site.  That's not really what we're after.  We want to try something different.  I mean, we've already proven that we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're not going to try to do another in Gadget or another Gizmodo.  You're going to do something...  Do you want to say how it's going to differ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I can't say too much.  I mean, if you check out gdgt.com, you can see a little bit about some of the things that we've said and we're talking about and the things that we're thinking about in terms of what a gadget site would be that isn't just this really hardcore news cycle.  But as to the specifics, I mean, part of that is also listening.  I mean, we want to know what gadget hounds, gadget fiends really want from their online content and media and gadget experience.  Because there is more than just gadget blogs.  And we want to know...  Oh, I agree. There's a lot to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot more to say than just, hey, here's the newest widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, at the same time, that's kind of where we've been for the last few years.  And that was part of the reason why Peter and I wanted to try something new is, you know, between Gizmodo and a gadget.  I mean, we really kind of perfected this engine, right?  And this is a news engine for the new media world where online, constantly connected, you get up to the second updates on these particular topics.  And Engadget, you know, I mean, Engadget really redefined that.  I mean, Gizmodo is good, but we kind of perfected the formula within gadget and raised the bar there.  And so, you know, now that that's done, what comes next? What do we do now?  I mean, we're not just looking to kind of dismantle and deconstruct the successes that we've had over the past four or five years.  I mean, we want to try something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not that I'm jealous, but Doggy Butt writes on the iTunes reviews.  And I thought I liked Leo's podcasts. Wow.  I loved how well you guys handle this. My iPod used to be dedicated to Leo, but now GDGT will be stealing some space.  Considering that came from Doggy Butt.  Successes don't have to be mutually exclusive.  I'm just teasing. I got nothing to lose except my Fez.  So let's talk a little bit about what's going on in the world of technology.  This was actually a good week. You know, sometimes it's a little slow, I guess, in the summertime and as September comes on.  Of course, that's when the big stories start to come out.  We've got Chrome, we've got Spore, we've got Nanos. You want to take a pick, Patrick?  Pick one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to say Chrome is the one that's really not to take anything away from Spore.  It's fabulous, exciting, but I think long term, Chrome really kind of fascinates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you installed Chrome, Dvorak?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why?  I'm so surprised. I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something fresh from John. What don't you like about it, John?  I don't think it's ready. I think there's a lot of pages it doesn't render correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe the Internet's just not ready for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is a beta, John, just like Gmail.  Yeah, but it'll be beta forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like Gmail, which is still in beta.  The tap things are cool and that's about it. So I see that as pointless.  And then when they pulled that stunt with the EULA, where they basically took all your children, I thought the whole thing was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the stunt with the EULA? Because I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the EULA, when it came out, and by the way, Google's backed down on this, but the EULA, when it came out, said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't just back down. They actually admitted, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said, our bad. We screwed up.  The EULA in its first incarnation, when this thing came out on Tuesday...  By the way, it's Google's new Internet browser, just what the world needs, a new Internet browser.  It said that everything you create with this browser belongs to Google.  You still have copyright to it, but we can do anything we want with it.  That upset people a little bit. But you know, I said even at the time, I said, look, this is just what lawyers do to protect you against things like caching.  They don't want somebody to come along and sue them, saying, hey, this browser cached a copy of my blog post. I don't like it.  But even Google said, yeah, we just... They said, to save money... This cracks me up.  We duplicate the boilerplate from other contracts, and it just shouldn't have been in there, they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wasn't buying that argument.  You were telling me that they go through all this trouble, and then they just cut and paste something, and oh, oops, oops, sorry.  Funny, it was only when the users got upset that it changed.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you ever worked for a big company before? Because it sounds like you haven't.  I've worked for plenty. In fact, I've worked for a government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I've worked for plenty of big companies, but the fact of the matter is, you know, the fact...  This is Google. They're better than a big company.  Nobody looks these things over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They paid for lawyers by the pound. You'd think they'd have enough lawyers to write a fresh and original contract for every product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I expect them to cut and paste to some extent, but it seems to me that they're just not aimlessly cutting and pasting, are they? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and in fact, you've got to ask, well, let me look at the other EULAs, because if this was cut and paste from something else, like rightly, I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In how many situations have you been in where you've seen a lawyer that would do something different than the product manager, John?  And maybe the product manager didn't double-check the EULA in whatever it was put together before it went to launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Either way, does it really matter? Because they fixed it, and they've re-wrote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying, it seems to me there's an undercurrent here that bothers me. I'm glad you guys just defend Google to the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, because it's also interesting, they also want you to basically default on the way in to send everything through Google so they can...  And it's the same thing as IE, where they want you to automatically send all information to Google so they can make the product better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think people were naturally kind of saying to themselves, you know, first of all, Google puts out a comic book.  And by the way, I got it, and it is nice. It is a nice comic book. They put out a comic book that explains why they did it.  Apparently, we're not bright enough for them just to write a paper or something. We have to have it in pictures.  But what they said is, well, we needed to do this because we want to support cloud applications, web-based applications.  No browser does a very good job of it yet. We thought we could do better, so we've done a few things that help, like having a very fast JavaScript interpreter, putting each tab in a separate process.  So if one tab crashes, it doesn't crash the whole browser. I love this ability to put icons on your desktop or your quick launch toolbar that represents, say, some page like Gmail or Google Spreadsheet or Google Calendar.  So I guess that kind of makes sense. But people were naturally suspicious that saying, well, first of all, it's based on WebKit, which is out there.  You can download it for Windows or Mac or Linux. So I'm not sure that those speed benefits are so obvious.  Second of all, you know, isn't Google's business advertising? Aren't they? Doesn't it sound like maybe they'd like to use this browser to kind of keep an eye on what you're up to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's advertising and selling information that they glean from all of the search activity and other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and now glean from their browser, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not necessarily. I mean, yes, the way they make money is advertising. But if you get to the core of that, the function there is keeping people in their ecosystem, right?  And that's how they really do it. They want you in the Google ecosystem. And so they want to ensure your Gmail experience is as great as it can possibly be and your Google Maps experience is as great as possible.  Because if you prefer using Google Maps because it works best in Chrome, because they can optimize it or whatever, yeah, I mean, the advertising that they can sell you through Google Maps or through Gmail or what have you is going to ultimately benefit them.  But as a company who lives and dies on the Internet and you have one viewport into the Internet and that is your browser, it makes no sense not to do one for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point. Matt Cutts, who works for Google, has been blogging a lot about Chrome. And one of the things he says, I want to debunk some misconceptions about, in fact, he's had several posts about Chrome.  And he said, I went to the Chrome team. I asked him, what information does it send back to Google? And it's not bad. I mean, it's nothing that other browsers don't already do.  I have to say, Matt's done a good job of defending Chrome. And I think the scenario you described, Ryan, is pretty sensible. I mean, you're right. This is Google's viewport to their products. They want it to be as good as possible.  Do you think that they want to provide a reference for other browsers and encourage them to move in the right direction? Or do they want to replace other browsers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's the former. Because if they wanted to replace other browsers and they didn't want to provide something that was usable for other companies or entities, they wouldn't have open sourced it. They would have done a closed source like Safari or IE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's based on open source. So they would have to have written it from scratch. It's based on WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not necessarily. I mean, I don't know what all the licenses are for all of the various packages that they used in Chrome. But you can take an open source project and closed source it depending on the license.  True.  I don't know if that's necessarily true with WebKit. But the point is, I mean, okay, yeah, so maybe they would have done it proprietary and not use WebKit. They could have made it closed source and tried to be as closed and competitive as they wanted to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I actually like it. I mean, I like the idea of having the search in the URL. Why have a separate search window? I like the fact that it kind of predicts what you're typing. It doesn't force you to use Google as a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember a thousand years ago when you do a question mark and type in your search query?  Yeah, you've always been able to do this.  Yeah, so it's not that rare. I'm more curious. I haven't had a chance to really load it up in one of my classic like 15 windows with 35 tabs in each window.  Right.  Because I want to...  Try to crash it in other words.  Yeah, I want to see it do everything it promises to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's blazingly fast. Maybe that's just because it doesn't have all the extensions I've put on the Firefox.  That probably is a big thing right there.  And that's one reason I still use Firefox is because it isn't as capable. I mean, I love all my Firefox extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you know one of the tricks in Chrome that I really like, I don't know how many people are actually going to use it, but I thought that it was just brilliant, is visit a site and you do a search on it one time.  And it's always looking at the URLs, trying to look for search queries and trying to figure out, okay, how can I deconstruct this and make this usable?  So it's like I went to Engadget. I did an Engadget search. You know, there's no standard search query string for that URL. It just kind of saw that.  It recognized, okay, he went to a field that said search. He punched in iPhone or whatever. And then this is the URL it got back.  It analyzed that and then gave me the ability to automatically search Engadget based on that one search I did.  That's cool. That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really cool. Yeah, it's things that you could do anyway, but it does it kind of automatically.  And it seems intuitive. It seems to kind of do it naturally in a way that makes sense to me.  You didn't like it. Why, Pat? Raya, John? Because it was too simple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's another, I mean, it's not like I hate it. I'm just saying it's not something I'm going to move to until they, you know, get it doesn't do some pages correctly.  There's just a lot of little minor things. I mean, it doesn't, I mean, I have certain tools that I use that obviously are plugins that don't, aren't going to work on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll probably use Firefox day to day, but I'll take pages like my Google calendar and use that facility to make them an application on the desktop.  And I'll be using Chrome, but I won't even know it because it'll just be a fast web based application. That seems like a good use of it.  And then I'll still use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm having those plugins. That was pretty painful. I mean, I don't use too many, but just a couple that I use not having them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a delicious plugin alone. If I don't have that, I mean, I'm really stymied.  Of course, I'm also mostly Mac, so I can't say what I'll do when it comes out on a Mac. Maybe I will use it all the time. I don't know. It's very fast, noticeably faster.  Be interesting for you to do a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm not a huge Firefox user. I mean, I do. I use it because it's the best for most Ajax things like, you know, Gmail and Google reader and stuff like that.  But it's just, even three is still really bloated and uses a lot of CPU and memory and it's just not...  Not compared to Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Safari worse?  I don't know. I've... As anybody... I'm on OS X. Firefox is excellent on Vista and XP, but I notice it just kicks Safari's ass on OS X.  I don't know if I'd agree with that.  Safari... I often have Safari using 100% of a CPU of a core on my system and not doing anything particularly complicated.  You know, and I've cleaned it, I've wiped it, I've rebuilt it, and it still ends up tying up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I would like to do is sit it down, Chrome versus WebKit, and you can do this on Windows or Mac and really see if there's a substantive difference or if it's really just that they've taken WebKit and chromed it, so to speak.  Hey, we're going to take a break, come back and talk... I do want to talk about Spore. I was playing it today.  And Ryan was at the party, which looked really, really cool.  We're going to do that in just a second, but I want to welcome a brand new sponsor to the show, Qualcomm.  Qualcomm?  Qualcomm and Gobi. You know what Gobi is?  Not even a little bit.  The Global Mobile Internet from Qualcomm, the new Gobi device. I've got to get one of these.  It's a wireless network card that's being built into new notebooks. A lot of manufacturers are using it.  And what's cool about it is it supports both HSDPA and EVDO. You can do it across multiple wireless carriers.  Interesting.  So it's no longer carrier specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a mini PCI card or a USB dongle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're actually building it into the laptop. You've probably seen some of these, Ryan. They're building it into the laptop.  So the idea is there's where the Global comes in. If you buy a Sprint card, it's US only. If you buy a Verizon card, it's US only.  Gobi is kind of, they call it the world is your hotspot multimode.  So that no matter where you go, in any geography, use the same notebook and you set it up to work with whatever works in that area.  So you don't have to carry around external cards.  Gobi, when you're looking for a laptop, you want to look for Gobi. The world is your hotspot.  Gobi powered notebooks are now available from many notebook manufacturers. Go to gobianywhere.com.  Gobianywhere.com slash products. Gobianywhere.com slash products.  We thank Qualcomm and Gobi for their support.  Have you seen any of these, Ryan, the laptops with Gobi?  Yeah, a little bit.  That's a great idea. I didn't know that existed.  That's why they, I guess that's probably why they bought an ad.  Let the world know.  So how was the sport party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I guess I was the only one who was there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not, we don't rate that kind of a fine event.  Did you get an invitation, Pat?  No.  I was mad because Kevin Rose and Veronica and a few other people got the Creature Creator in advance for charity.  I guess it was a charity thing and I wasn't hip enough to get that even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the sport leprechaun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just not cool enough. So tell us about the party.  You didn't go on Veronica's ticket, did you? You got your own invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I actually went on Veronica's ticket.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the funny story is they've been inviting me to all of their, they've been doing like a party a month.  And they've been really consistent about making sure that I've had an invitation.  And then they didn't give me an invitation to this one.  I was really confused.  And this is the only one that I actually wanted to go to because this is like the launch party.  This was like Thursday or Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was, where was it? The museum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the, it was at the California Academy of Sciences, which hasn't actually opened yet.  That's the brand new one.  I'm so jealous.  It's a brand new one right across from the DeYoung, the big art museum out here in San Francisco.  It's the greenest museum in the world in terms of construction.  It's all done with pretty much entirely recycled materials.  A lot of the architecture that they did.  I actually, you know, I'm sure I sound a little bit like a press release right now because I was speaking to their director of communications.  But I mean, you know, the stuff that they were talking about was pretty straightforward.  But yeah, like tons of recycled materials.  The way that they had architected like some of the roofs where it was like a natural heat flow kind of thing where it's a living roof, essentially a living.  Yeah, there was a living roof, but then it was like curved down and then it funneled into the building in a certain way.  So it's like in the atrium, the cool air from off of the roof would come down in so they don't have to use air conditioners in the atrium.  So it's just it was just really, really unbelievable space and very appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Will Wright, of course, the creator of Spore was there.  He's been working on this for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was there.  He gave one of his infamous Will Wright speeches, which is he's just like this interdisciplinary Renaissance man.  And his speeches are known far and wide for just being completely jam packed with like almost dozens, if not hundreds of random topics and references.  And then, you know, he and his near infinite brilliance is able to kind of tie them all together.  One cohesive narrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he has to be able to do that.  He wrote a game that goes from single celled organisms to space travel.  So he has to know everything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is he's clearly a very brilliant person, but he was not the smartest person in the room.  They had a number of astrophysicists and astronomers and scientists who I guess they'd done like a National Geographic special.  Discovery had actually no National Geographic, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so they had a bunch of people out who, you know, were really excited about Spore because, you know, these are people who, you know, I guess they felt really strongly about, you know, the concepts that, you know, you're going from single celled organisms to advanced life and stuff like that.  And so one of the people who's most known, I guess, for his opinions in that space is a guy named Frank Drake.  He did Drake's equation, which science geeks know as the equation that kind of puts the odds on intelligent life in the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He created SETI, in fact, to find intelligent life because he said there are some things out there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so like, you know, the theory there is, OK, so if there's, you know, X billion galaxies and, you know, in each galaxy there's X, you know, billion stars and for each star or star cluster, you know, there's X habitable planets to multiply that by X possible planets that, you know, might be able to have the necessary elements for life.  And, you know, you come at a number and that number is, you know, the basic mathematical odds that there's intelligent life out there.  And so he was there and he spoke and it was just unbelievable.  It was just mind blowing experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did he talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically everything I just said, except, you know, a way that is, you know, a hundred times more brilliant than anything I could probably ever come up with.  And then they did. They have like a really advanced planetarium simulator that was all done in real time.  And, you know, I mean, those things are always amazing where they show you the true scale of the universe.  And it was all I have to say is it was mind blowing and incredibly humbling event.  So did you get to play the game at all?  Just a little bit. Probably not as much as you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I played it for about 45 minutes. I downloaded it because you can get a download of it now.  In fact, they did something, EA did something really clever.  They allowed you to download it for quite a while, but it wouldn't work until midnight tonight, today, September 7th.  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  And I think it probably I don't they haven't released sales figures, but I've got to think this thing is hugely successful.  I am so sick myself of shooting people in games.  And this thing is fun, although I did create a carnivorous creature.  So I do have to eat other creatures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have eating and gnawing and tearing and rending a flesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You design the creature. You start with a single celled organism and you design it.  Well, the first choice is very simple. Carnivore or herbivore.  But then as you evolve, you get more choices as you as you know, spines and spikes and where you put eyes.  And do you have cilia for faster swimming and turning?  And as time goes by, I presume I haven't gotten I'm still in the still in the primordial ooze.  But as time goes on, I think, you know, obviously you'll make other choices in terms of civilization and so forth.  This seems like the culmination of Will Wright, the guy who did The Sims and Sim City and all of these great simulation games.  This seems like the culmination of a an amazing career.  Frankly, this is this is the ultimate game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The question, I think, and I know that this maybe seems a little bit redundant and especially given the light of, you know,  how much scientific research Will and his team did in, you know, in doing Spore.  You know, maybe it's not even worth asking.  But I mean, there are certainly themes about this that suggest intelligent creation.  Right. And and and and I know that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see it that way. You think that it's it's it has an intelligent design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I look I don't personally see it that way.  And I know for a fact, especially having seen seen them speak that they are looking at this from a purely scientific lens.  It's all about evolution.  Right. But at the same time, I mean, as a player in the game, I guess you are God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're waiting for you to pick up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah.  So, I mean, you know, in order to play the game, you have to act as an intelligent creator.  And that's just kind of a fact of the game. I don't know if that was that was something that they could even really get around.  Because if you weren't, if you're going to have a game, you got to have somebody play it.  Otherwise, it would be boring. It's just like, you know, pure evolution in theory.  Then you wouldn't be playing the game. You'd just be sitting there watching it.  You know, it would play itself right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, if you hear little spore sounds in the background, it's not me playing the game.  It's Patrick's little spore. Shameless. He was joining. He joined us in the studio and is having his battle now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. So I don't know. I mean, I think that there's something to be said for the for the fact that, you know, whether or not they like it, there's an implication of intelligent design.  But I don't personally. I hadn't really thought about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I was thinking, boy, this is really evolution here.  But you're right. It isn't random evolution. It's not.  It's guided evolution. Yeah, it's not natural selection by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I look at like the human knees and the lower back and certain aspects of society and the whole intelligent aspect of it may have been designed.  You know, and I've seen some of the creatures people have put together, carnivorous chickens with eyes on really inappropriate parts of their body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's just, I don't know. That's game. That's the difference. Yeah, it's a game. It's a game.  So far, and I've only played it, like I said, for 45 minutes, and I don't.  I'm really afraid of playing any more because otherwise this whole network is going to completely collapse.  But it's very fun and it's beautiful. I mean, it's really gorgeous.  Simultaneous releases for Windows, Mac, Nintendo DS.  There's going to be an iPhone, I guess, mini version of it.  There are going to be many versions for other phones.  Ryan, will those be they won't be full playable games.  How will they relate to what you're doing on a desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So on the iPhone, they basically it's kind of like almost a mini game that is you unrelated solid organisms, not not unrelated.  I don't necessarily know how they're going to fit it in to the desktop game.  I don't know if the single cell organisms that you create in the iPhone game somehow get transferred over and then, you know, built upon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about that, but I do know about this weird kind of massively single player architecture where you I remember a year ago when they're talking about it.  Somehow your creature would kind of float through other people's environments.  And actually, when you play the game, you see a lot of other creatures clearly designed, most of them same axis.  But I suppose over time they could I could see one that says populated with.  Yeah, and I could eat you.  And that's kind of the fun thing is you see these other creatures and I guess they're autonomous by the time they get on my machine.  But I can interact with them by by fighting with them, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know maybe coming back to wondering whether or not this will become a required, you know, teaching tool in Kansas.  I somehow doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I somehow doubt it.  John, you're you're you like to play games, but more importantly, your kids like to play games.  Are they excited about sport?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't get excited about stuff until they get a hold of it and start playing it.  They're not susceptible to pre publicity hype.  I'm very well. Yeah.  Cure them of hype.  So I'll find out later.  I well, early review.  I mean, I mean, I don't have to be honest about it.  I mean, I've you know, there's there's all kinds of things going on in the gaming business right now.  This may be the last great game because things are kind of going backwards because of the barriers to entry for newcomers with, you know, all these other games are becoming so complicated.  Unless you've kept up with them, you can't just jump in late.  And my son is very following this quite closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he want to be a game designer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, he's designed a few games already, but whether he wants to be one is another issue.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this Eric you're talking about or no, J.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  J.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got some smart kids because by the way, congratulations.  I guess we mentioned this last week, but Eric's made his Craigslist tool open source, which are there a lot of now people adopting this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  It was about I think a couple three weeks ago when he announced that he got 300 people putting it up immediately.  And then some some guy came out with some some way of using the code.  So it's he had some screwy thing where you don't need a database.  And I forgot he's going to put it online.  It is just going to be floating around.  I guess he's off to doing something else now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break and talk more about the world of technology.  Michael Moore's skipping theaters going straight to the net.  A NBC abandoned Silverlight and Mark Andreessen has a reaction to Chrome.  But before we do that, I want to mention our good friends at Visa.  The show brought to you with Visa, you know, with every purchase that you make online or off, Visa does some amazing things, prevents, detects and resolves online fraud with very sophisticated software designed to protect you when you shop.  We all have better things to do when it comes to shopping online than worry about.  Is it safe?  All the purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.  Patrick's going to take a little break and change the diaper will be this is perfect timing.  Patrick changes his diaper.  No, I'm sorry.  Shamus's diaper mentioned Visa zero liability.  You're not liable for unauthorized purchases.  We got to get a diaper changing table in here, Colleen.  That's peace of mind.  Safe, secure Visa.  We thank Visa so much for their support of this week in tech.  So Patrick will be back.  It's good though, because he'll do this during the show when he's on Skype.  And this way we can kind of we know where he is.  He's gone.  See, I still don't know, John, when you get up to baste your roast.  So as it were, as it were, that's what we call it.  So the kids call it.  So I did I forgot to mention this, but in an interview, Mark Andreessen was he was talking to portfolio magazine editor Kevin Maney at the Churchill Club in Palo Alto said that any desktop application that has not been implemented in the browser is now going to be implemented in the browser.  He was very he called it Chrome an extraordinary event.  He said it's going to make Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer completely compete actively with Chrome, ultimately boost browsers as a whole.  He says Microsoft can build good products when they want to.  And he believes the pressure Chrome is going to put on them will make IE get better.  I think that's that's certainly true.  He also says if JavaScript gets any faster develops developers will question whether they should develop and flash or silverlight or, or anything so super interactive browsers that sits on top of a super fast connection.  Now interesting things are going to happen over the next five or 10 years that sounds.  He's, he's the guy invented Netscape and wrote mosaic before that, saying this is a significant development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I, I buy it to a certain extent.  I really do.  And I really do think that, you know, clearly the movement is towards putting applications online for so many reasons.  And we don't even necessarily have to get into those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you stand on cloud computing genre?  I can't remember.  Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the big no, I don't like cloud computing guy because I don't trust the cloud.  A, I don't trust other people with my data.  B, the net slow.  C, I mean, I can go on and on and on.  It's not reliable.  I mean, it's great.  I think cloud computing is great for certain kinds of functions.  I just wrote about this recently saying, hey, there's cloud computing is fantastic when I needed like an emergency word processor or something like that.  But I'm not going to start doing my word processing on the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe not word processing, but you know, I have to say having my calendar in the cloud makes so much sense.  Having my mail in the cloud makes so much sense.  I think for the right application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I do mail in the cloud myself and it's probably better.  I mean, it's still slow.  And the calendar, I use Google Calendar because it's got a lot of features that I like.  But, you know, it's not necessary.  I mean, it's actually pretty fast.  It's acceptable, but it's kind of ugly, say the least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the thing that you're neglecting to mention is that especially Google apps have a lot of hooks for offline implementation.  So let's talk about Gmail.  That's a great example.  They have IMAP and they have POP.  So you don't even have to keep your email in Gmail.  You can just receive it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, in fact, that's how I use the IMAP capability to get it in Apple Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did take a long time for them to do IMAP.  It did.  But they did.  It's not the best IMAP implementation ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Fastmail for that.  But it's still it's IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You look at, you know, calendar.  They've got iCal.  They've got XML.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We use the Google Calendar for our Twitter Live stuff because you could subscribe to it in so many different ways.  You can have it in your iCal or your Outlook.  You can have a web-based page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, that's all fine and dandy.  I think everything you say is absolutely correct.  But then what do you do with the person out there who happens to have a Gmail account and suddenly because somebody has accused them of being a spammer or whatever, which happened to a guy just recently, next thing you know he hasn't got his account.  He can't get to his email and there's nothing he can do about it.  Your ISP can do that too.  Well, that's fine.  The ISP doesn't save me either.  That's another example of the situation where you can get yourself into trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you going to run your own mail server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to run it.  If it's only about mail, that's one thing.  You know, that's fine.  If you say cloud computing is, I mean, that's been going on for 30 years.  I mean, if you want to do that's never been considered cloud computing.  The idea of cloud computing is thin client, never really having local stuff and doing everything in the cloud.  That's cloud computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that is a definition of cloud computing and that's not the definition of cloud computing we have today.  I mean, it's a very flexible thing the way that we're looking at it, especially as we're making that transition.  I mean, we're not going to be to that very definition of cloud computing where everything is not inclined.  That's not going to happen for 10, maybe 20 years.  Who knows how long it's going to take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, Ryan, on one hand I hear what you're saying.  It's a different evolution of cloud computing, but it still comes down to if you lose your net connection, you're hosed.  Or if there's a problem with the servers, you're hosed.  And if your data is not locally held, you know what I mean?  It may not be if you're a gigantic company with 40,000 workstations and massive infrastructure in place, it's not so bad.  But I think for consumers and small businesses, it can be incredibly liberating because you have these powerful tools that you don't have to implement in-house.  But on the flip side, if there's any issue with your ISP, with your data, with your internet access, you suddenly are denied access to critical tools.  And like the whole word processing thing, there's like 32, it seems like, different startups all located within 25 miles of downtown San Francisco that are all doing competing word processing.  Well, basically like desktop suites, office suites.  And I don't know if they figure if they can get 2% of the office market, they're in good shape.  Or if it's because, you know, is there some lucrative market for online?  You know what I mean?  Where's the business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Zoho's got a good business model.  They give you a few tools free.  And then if you subscribe, you get more.  I think Zoho's a good example.  I wonder if Zoho runs better.  I bet it does under Chrome.  Is Chrome completely agnostic or does it work best with Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Chrome is agnostic, but Chrome is built with Gears, first of all, which is a great framework for taking web apps offline.  But it's also built with heavy JavaScript usage in mind.  So whereas I don't think in specific it enables anything that other browsers don't already do,  it can speed up the experience so much that it can take otherwise very slow web apps and make them seem a lot more desktop-like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of the JavaScript engine they've developed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's their thesis on things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, we actually ran a bunch of, you know, all the Microsoft apps on Chrome to see if they were going to do any cheating.  And they were very, they all ran fine.  It's almost as though on these major apps they actually went there to make sure they worked okay so nobody could point the finger.  But let's, you know, there was this other topic that you were talking about, which was before you start on Andreessen.  I've lost my train of what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark Andreessen of Netscape saying this is a, you know, a red-letter day in browsers.  It's going to force Microsoft and Firefox to do a better job, be more standards-compliant, be faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically everything Opera's been saying for the last five years.  Yeah, but Opera ain't Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I have to say that.  In fact, I think, I remember I heard Opera, the chairman of Opera, not so thrilled about Chrome.  He wasn't too crazy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Opera's never really thrilled about anything but Opera.  I think it's safe to say.  I mean, it's funny though because we look at Firefox as having done this extraordinary job of forcing Microsoft to step up or at least try really hard to step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just as AMD made Intel step up, the competition's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but now suddenly we need Google to take out a small open, well, maybe the small isn't the right word.  Mozilla ain't small anymore.  Not anymore anyhow, yeah.  An open source organization and Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because Mozilla makes most of its money from that Google search window, right?  I mean, that's a big profit center for them.  And I often wonder if some of the reason for this is just get some of that money back from Mozilla.  Use our browser and then we won't have to pay Mozilla so much money.  I don't think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the story that I had to go to the Twitter thing.  I didn't know this, but NBC dropped Silverlight after all that promotion and all the Olympics and everything?  Yeah, so here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you try to watch football on Thursday on NBC, on their website, they had it, but it was flash.  And I guess the point they made is during the Olympics, 40 million people had to download Silverlight.  Silverlight just isn't ubiquitous.  And they said 98% of our audience has flash.  We're going to go with flash.  We're not going to make you download Silverlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to know the backstory on this because Adobe does a lot of work to push people back to Adobe.  And I can see Adobe doing things like, oh, cutting the maybe.  No, but like Adobe, on one hand, yeah, the adoption rate on flash is certainly higher or flash availability on the desktop certainly is higher.  But it's not like it's that hard.  You know what I mean?  The Olympics comes once every four years.  The Olympics is done.  40 million people have downloaded Silverlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it went the other way.  I think Microsoft came with that black bag of money to NBC and said, you're going to use Silverlight, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how come they didn't keep coughing up the money is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there ever an amendment made by NBC that said we're going to use this permanently?  I mean, I think that I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they made a deal for the Olympics and that was it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was always my impression is, OK, we're going to do this for the Olympics.  You're going to pay us a boatload of money to most Silverlight through this particular channel on this particular date and time.  And then when that's done, we're going to do our thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I guess the point is when they do their thing, they go back to flash.  Unless, as you say, Patrick, Adobe came to them and said, whatever Microsoft pay you will double it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Adobe could just, I mean, Adobe's got the tools in place.  They've done some pretty incredible things in the last couple of years with really stepping, because the flash video was a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, we're right now.  You can watch us on flash video.  Yeah, but I'm saying like it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really a big difference.  Two years ago, it was still problematic doing simple things like I'm not even talking like color gamma.  You were trying to do DLTV.  Yeah, I mean, simple things like AV synchronization was highly problematic.  So they've gotten a lot of that solved.  They brought in a lot of talent to help them think of video as not a strange offshoot of Photoshop, but as an actual art and science with a long and trans history and broadcast.  And that's certainly true.  They have a lot of broadcasters.  They bolded.  Well, they bought.  They remember Play.  And Play became another company and that company, they basically, they acquired that company.  No, God, no.  That's the core of the people who are improving.  The smart people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now the TriCaster we're using is kind of a descendant of Play, too, right?  This is basically NewTek's.  This is the video toaster, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually, that was before the fork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, before the fork.  Yeah, Play basically is a fork from NewTek or Play was basically a fork from NewTek.  Right.  They're all related somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so that became the GlobeCaster and the other one became the TriCaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's, oh, so there is another competing unit called the GlobeCaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Globe, it's, John, let's not even try to explain this one.  Do you like my live control surface, Patrick?  Isn't this cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  It seems very familiar.  This is something new that NewTek is releasing.  It's a USB control surface for the toaster, but it is.  It's just like a regular switcher.  Well, they've had one out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just a much more detailed one.  Oh, they've had this before?  Yeah, they just had one with considerably fewer effect buttons.  Can you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have, I'm sorry.  For people who are listening, they're going, what is he?  What is he?  What is he?  What is he talking about?  I'm making, I make this sound.  Oh, I froze it.  OK, never mind.  It wasn't, it wasn't good.  Sometimes you can do too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, let's move on.  So let's get, wait, wait, wait, before you do that, let's finish off the thing here.  I mean, is that mean Silverlight is toast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because Silverlight, I mean, Silverlight's, it may be toast at NBC, but Silverlight is  primarily their Flash competition.  Microsoft's going to keep pumping money into it.  That's what it's going to come down to though, because Microsoft's done this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've said, oh, the great new thing, and they haven't pumped money into it.  They kind of lost interest, drifted off, and the things died.  It's happened many times before with Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  They lose interest in a lot of stuff.  They lost interest in Microsoft at home.  They lost interest in Microsoft at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think it's up to Microsoft whether this survives or not.  That's all it's up to if they can, if they're committed to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's an alternative development platform to Flash.  How big that business needs to be, is the end of the mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of the opposite of flex though, I mean, of air, right?  Because air is to take Flash stuff, put it on your desktop, and really Silverlight,  really the thing that's interesting, Silverlight, is the Windows presentation layer encapsulated.  Right.  So you can essentially take the desktop to the web.  It's really a tool for making cloud applications.  If it's going to take off, that's where it's going to take off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is the cloud really the future, or is this just like,  what is this like the fourth time in the last 15 years where stuff has swung server side?  You know what I mean?  Well, we always make the noise about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that computing has to catch up.  Internet, everybody has to have high speed internet.  It's got to be reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got to be available all the time if you want to go mobile.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if we're ready yet.  I think we're a lot closer than we were 15, 10, five years ago.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a trend in the wrong direction personally.  But let's go back to this thing, I mean, and I'll continue with that theme,  and it's stupid for me to keep repeating myself.  But I still want to get back to the Silverlight issue.  Well, I thought Silverlight...  Which part of it?  Well, I thought one of the things about Silverlight was that it was scalable to HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, everything's scalable to HD, John.  If you have enough bandwidth at the server, or excuse me, the content delivery network,  and more importantly, you have enough bandwidth at the end user.  Delivering HD is easy.  Delivering economical HD is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can kill... I can increase the quality of this stream in flash without going HD  and kill 90% of the audience.  I can go to H.264, I can go to 1.5 megabits, nobody will be able to see it.  And it's still not high-def.  I don't know, what would the bitrate have to be for real high-def?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The current rule of thumb for calling something high-def in a live stream is around a megabit.  Nobody can do that.  And it's high-def in the sense of 720p-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was 10. Is it down to 1?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're missing... I made something a little too semantic.  The current video standard... that people are referring to as high-def when they're advertising the quality of their video...  Vimeo does high-def, right? That's what you're talking about.  All these companies online that are currently doing high-quality, high-def...  It's like high-def-initious, it's near 720p, it has a bandwidth rate that is considerably smaller  than anything... it's like an order of magnitude smaller than broadcast and considerably smaller even than satellite delivery in most cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it has to be. Even a megabit, people say, well, I've got my Fios or my Comcast is doing 20 megabits,  but it has to be a pretty consistent megabit and you can't slow it down with anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also expensive as hell to deliver. It is incredibly expensive to deliver this stuff.  And that's a bigger issue, John, than whether or not the application can support it.  It's whether or not anybody can actually afford to throw this stuff out into the cloud and still make enough money off of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the spots are going down constantly.  Yeah, but...  You're paying upper bandwidth is a fraction of what you were paying a year or two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that much of a fraction and the problem is when you're scaling video up, you tend to need a content...  I'm going to go pull my child off of the hard drives over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's just the hard drive for next week's show. Don't worry about that.  Hey, he's good at getting those out.  The stream that we're sending right now is half a megabit. It's 564 kilobits.  It looks pretty good. It's 16 by 9. I think the quality is pretty decent.  And it is a quarter of a gigabyte an hour per user.  So we have, say, 2,000 viewers right now. That's 500 gigabytes an hour that the CDN has to put out.  It's outrageous. I don't know how they can afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. It's definitely going down, but I don't think quality bandwidth or content delivery is going down fast enough to keep pace with what people want for the quality of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this, Patrick. I'm going to zoom out the video that we're sending out right now.  People can do that. There's a little pop-out button on the video and go to full screen on it.  And while it's not, I mean, frame rate is much lower than 30 frames a second.  It's certainly, you know, the color isn't as rich and so forth. But it's not awful considering it's half a megabit a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, you just qualified it there. It's not awful. It's certainly not unwatchable.  It's not unwatchable. But it ain't high def.  I'd certainly watch the Olympic Kayak Competition in this video format if it was the only format available to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's certainly below broadcast standards, below NTSC broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know, Ryan, like the whole bandwidth line is I've heard that constantly, but, you know, video is expensive, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm definitely not arguing that point.  Okay.  Look, you know, we just launched our new media stuff this week and we put out a podcast and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you doing video or just audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right now we have a video show. I mean, we have an audio show. You know, we're looking at video stuff and it's impossible to do.  It's impossible to do gadgets without video at some point, right?  Yeah, people want video.  But yeah, you know, I mean, like, you know, Patrick and I, we use the same content distribution network for he uses Rev at Rev3 is, you know, we're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need a bit of gravity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, I mean, the costs are way low, but I mean, there's still real costs associated with it, especially, you know, if you move away from audio and you go into video.  I mean, it's just, it gets really expensive really quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The great understatement.  Is that the Jane hat?  I just sent him a Jane hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You look good in the Jane hat.  Terrible cunning.  Terrible cunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's interesting.  Also, the one of my one of my favorite lines is, is, is, you know, people are always telling you how fast bandwidth prices are decreasing.  And it's almost invariably a ISP of some sort or a content delivery network CEO of some type.  It's something about all the prices are dropping precipitously.  Well, they are.  Because they want everybody to commit to the business so they can sell the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then they raise the price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And well, no, they're not going to raise the price, but the cost is dropping a lot, especially when you realize a lot of the cost is being compared against some of the, you know, original CDNs that we're getting.  Unbelievable amounts.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A fraction of where it was a couple of years ago, you know, if it was a hundred dollars per gig a couple of years ago, and now it's a fraction of that, which is ten dollars per gig.  That's still a lot of money, right?  I mean, you know, fraction is a fraction, but proportionally speaking, it doesn't necessarily make it economical always to do this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's certainly getting economical more better faster.  I mean, fast enough to the point where where, oh, I can't even think of the name of it.  The guys who brought you Skype, the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Juiced.  Juiced just killed their desktop client.  They're going all web.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's like, you know, I mean, like everybody was like, yes, juice is going to solve the problem, even though it didn't seem to work mathematically for anybody other than the juice developers.  In terms of the bandwidth that was available, upload versus download, it almost seems like, you know, juice major advantages don't seem to have played out.  You know, I think what happened is just looked at Hulu and said they're killing us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do we need a desktop client?  But I wonder what Hulu's bandwidth bill must be like.  Yeah, they must be losing a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're only running what a few like an ad at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I mean, these are short little ads.  I can't imagine they're making money.  I remember something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hulu is essentially a skunk works for NBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just NBC, by the way.  Yeah.  A lot of it.  All revision three.  Most of it's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have NBC.  Universal is essentially the people that are footing the bills.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fox for for for when you put your stuff on is Tixilla on Hulu yet.  I don't know.  I think some revision three stuff is I wonder you don't pay them for that.  Right.  They just carry it.  You just valued content.  I think partner is the is the is the phrase that's used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A distribution partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's I think Hulu has been I was not at all positive about Hulu when it came out.  I said, who's going to sit and watch this on the Internet?  Yeah.  Patrick raising his hand.  In fact, I just saw a study that's in the last two years.  Internet video viewing has doubled more and people are spending more and more hours all the time watching this stuff on a screen on computer screens, which kind of surprised me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or they have home theaters or some other device connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how many do you think is that?  How many people are actually doing?  Well, that's a great question.  I think more and more sitting on their laptop with their laptop in bed or somewhere on it and watching on the laptop.  But I mean, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's you know, that's the other thing is waiting for sort of and this is probably somewhere.  Ryan's got a much stronger idea than I do is somebody is going to come up with the right device and it may simply be, you know, your local cable company.  It's going to be a good Internet video access device that's cheap enough that everybody will want to buy it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So far, cable companies were smart.  They would try to do that.  But there are a couple of reasons why the cable companies are not going to do that.  Right.  Smart.  It is because it helps them upsell Internet access.  Right.  So it's like, oh, yeah, of course.  So totally.  First, they have the Comcast is just capped Internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't want to upsell Internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to sell premium services.  They really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So first, first they have content distribution deals, which basically states that they, you know, they need to do their very best effort to make sure the channels get, you know, as much play and as much as possible.  Right.  So there's there's that.  And that's a big thing.  I mean, if you are networking, you're making an agreement to get your channel and Comcast, you know, it's a two way thing.  You have to make sure that you're providing Comcast good content and Comcast in turn has to do everything they can to make sure that you get the best distribution that, you know, people can't pirate your stuff and and so on and so forth.  So there are those agreements as well.  Yeah.  But then on top of that, I mean, you look at the cable companies, they have like such a weak technology infrastructure.  It's just unbelievable.  And I mean, you look at Comcast, they've been promising a rollout of Tivo's Tivo software on their regular DVR boxes.  So you'd be able to upgrade your DVR to Tivo.  Right.  Sounds like a fairly simple thing.  They've been promising this for years, years, and they still have not been able to manage it.  You know, part of the blame falls on Tivo there.  But, you know, don't look to the cable company for innovation.  Right.  Is all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then who you look to, Verizon?  Well, Apple TV, not a particularly successful product launch.  But I love my Apple TV, but the people who use it love it.  Voodoo.  No, I own one.  I love it.  Voodoo.  Great, amazing selection of content.  But, you know, flop.  But, you know, the incredible.  Popcorn?  Flop?  Popcorn's not a flop.  Popcorn's.  And the reason why.  Popcorn got a.  Oops, sorry.  No, no, go ahead.  I was going to say popcorn got an inadvertent amount of coverage for the size.  It's tiny.  Popcorn is a true geek's product.  Right.  That got way too much coverage because there are a lot of geeks in our world.  Cool.  Yeah.  Cool.  Neat piece of hardware.  He really likes 750 gig hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has a passion for hard drives.  I think we've got a little Patrick in the making.  You don't have a little baby sledgehammer, do you?  Good, because I don't think we can handle that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you know, the reason I think a lot of these devices come out and they're not super  successful is you have the content world garden.  And if you're talking about a device whose only job is to give, you know, to move content  from that device to your television, any kind of world garden is not going to do, you know.  And that is just the way it is.  The only ones that work well are the ones that have some sort of interface to the outside,  you know, regular normal content channels.  And that, you know, that's like TiVo, right?  TiVo's first objective is to be a good cable DVR.  So you've got cable card, you've got QAM support, you've got, you can hook it up to your cable  and get your regular television channels.  And then on top of that, they'll do downloads and they've got YouTube and stuff like that.  But first and foremost, it is, you know, the regular content means of distribution.  So when you look at like Apple TV, yeah, I mean, they're going to do a little bit better  now that they've kind of revamped that whole experience and added movies and rentals and  stuff like that.  But by the day, I mean, look, if you can't watch, you know, say Hulu, which is free content,  and you should be able to watch that directly through Apple TV, you can't watch that,  then there isn't really that much of an incentive, you know.  I mean, there's free and then there's paid.  And if you're going to paid, there's no reason why you should have to separate free.  Therefore, it's not going to be easy to get people to buy this gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When this little guy starts watching TV in 10, 15 years, it's going to be a very different landscape, Patrick.  I mean, he's he's going to not be won't be watching on a TV in the living room.  You think my kids don't ever watch a TV in the living room.  They watch it on the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's an interesting thought, right?  Because broadcast my the first cable channel I saw was HBO in our apartment building when I was five.  It was a single channel.  It was a separate box that did nothing but deliver HBO to I think channel.  It was a separate box.  Yeah, it was.  Wow. There was no cable television in the world.  And you know, we're in that wasn't that long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was 30 years ago, 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, and then there's 70 channels by the time we got cable in Pennsylvania when I was in 85.  You know, satellite delivery comes not too soon after.  You know, there's 400.  I think there's 400 digital channels on Comcast in San Francisco or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearly in 15 years, you're going to see massive changes.  I guess the question is, where is it going to go?  It's got to go to the Internet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the that's the economic, you know, technical analysts are correct.  And they kill it.  Yeah. And yeah.  And you know, the Internet's going to break under the load of video, which is a hilarious concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I agree.  Yeah, we could talk about that for quite some time.  And no, but so, I mean, I don't know.  It's tricky. There's a lot of content.  And I think it's hard to argue that the premium viewing experience tends to be on your HDTV from your couch.  Right. I mean, it's just it's it's the most comfortable.  It's the most immersive experience that you get consuming content in your home.  And I don't think that that's arguable.  So, you know, the question that becomes like, well, how much more tempting is it to get free content really easy when you're already sitting down at your computer or, you know, bring your computer to bed or what have you and doing the Hulu stuff.  So at that point, you have to be like, OK, let's get Hulu on the television.  You know, we're back to step one, which is the TV networks putting their video online so you can get it back on the TV.  I wonder, isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an irony.  You know, basically that's called IPTV.  But the other thing is how much I want to stop everyone here.  How much TV do we really need to watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As much as we can before we collapse, John, preferably from revision3.com.  Do you agree with Clay Shirky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then I should plug Mevio.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think, do you agree with Clay Shirky that we've been watching sitcoms basically as a way to his new book is Here Comes Everybody.  I think it's Clay Shirky, right?  And his contention is that we all watch sitcoms because we're just trying to adjust to the information revolution in the same way that Brits drank a lot of gin during the Industrial Revolution.  It was an narcotic.  And now we're all coming out of basements having drowned our sorrows in Gilligan's Island and I Dream of Jeannie and we're ready to start creating stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you feel that the information revolution started in the early 60s with black and white television with Gilligan's Island?  It kind of did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mass media certainly did.  Mass media comes pretty sad.  Well, that was an information revolution.  Mass media starts with Gutenberg.  Yeah, but I mean, television was really, it was really an information revolution in that sense.  And certainly, you know, computing started in the 60s in business.  I think you can make that case.  But an interesting case anyway.  Well, it's interesting.  I don't think my kids watch nearly the kind of, well, of course, they watch a lot of YouTube and they do watch Hulu.  They watch as much as we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's definitely, according to every survey I've seen, John, the younger kids watch considerably fewer hours of television compared to their parents or maybe even their oldest or eldest siblings.  But they're also replacing it with online activity, internet activity, the time they spend on Facebook and MySpace, video games.  Well, there's a lot of screen time.  Nobody denies it's screen time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just more interactive screen time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's to bring it back to what Ryan was saying is maybe, you know, if your primary audience is the 18 to 24, which is to say like 12 to 18 year olds, maybe it goes from the optimal consumption area.  It goes from being a lean back, a 12 foot, a lean back environment in the living room.  And in the next 10 or 15 years, it does become small screen delivery.  Although, you know, cell phones as your center for media consumption works in Japan.  But I don't think it's ever going to work as well as in the United States.  I like that term lean back.  Because lean back versus sit forward.  Lean back versus lean forward.  Lean forward is your notebook, your desktop PC.  Lean back is your living room environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're leaning more forward than back these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that with us, this group here, we're leaning sideways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seamus is bouncing.  So what are you having a good time on the ball or do you want to go back to data?  Well, he wants to go back to data.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He always thinks don't feel bad.  He did the same thing with his grandmother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to talk about Google's new satellite.  Did you see that?  They launched a satellite.  And now I'm afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who did they put in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Delta II rocket carrying the GOI-1 satellite lifted off at 1150 a.m. Saturday.  A super sharp Earth imaging satellite launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base to make Google the highest resolution of any commercial  imaging system in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to love it.  Like when a company gets to the point where it's cheaper to launch their own satellite than to pay for higher quality image satellite imagery.  Slash. This is also could be proof that Google is a front for Dr. Evil and it's really filled with lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technically, GOI owns a satellite, but it will be used for Google Maps, Google mapping.  You'd be surprised how many.  Quite investment in map application.  Say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quite investment in an application for maps.  I mean, let's like let's really think about this.  Google Maps is great, but that is a huge investment for maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's GIS is what this is all about.  And there is a lot of money in GIS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's GIS so much as the incredible amount of revenue that's possible through mapped searches and how easy it's becoming to integrate that into cell phones.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't disagree with that.  Having location based services, having a great map application is so super valuable, especially, you know, because once you start learning where people are at, targeted advertising becomes way, way easier.  And I'm not going to argue that fact.  The fact that I'm arguing is like you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for a satellite.  And that satellite takes, you know, real nice high resolution photos of the actual real world.  But that is not an essential component of a good map application.  In fact, how often do you use the satellite view?  I mean, I don't know about you.  I use it as like the secondary view.  And I'm mostly doing my viewing in Google Maps or whatever application I'm using for maps in the street mode view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be curious to see how much it did actually cost them versus the company that launched it.  I would be curious if they had exclusive imagery.  I would really, I still haven't been able to figure out.  And maybe I just didn't read the right part of the article, the actual resolution they're delivering it at.  No, they never said.  Because the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we know spy satellites, the government on spy satellites are much higher resolution than anything launched commercially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, there's some pretty amazing commercial stuff, but it's not like down to like, you know, sub meter, you know, much more than like.  I'm trying to.  CIA's are sub meter.  Yeah, but I can't buy CIA imagery.  Don't get me wrong.  Landsat 7 is great and it's free and it's available to anybody with a web connection.  But there's a big difference between Landsat 7 and commercially.  You know what I mean?  Of course.  You know, if I want to see the inside of a Nat's ass from space, yeah, I'm going to see if I can call in a favor at the NSA, but I don't think it's really likely to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not going to scale to CIA photo analyst for many years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the inside of a Nat's ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I was recently in in in a very rural part of the world and the whole Nat's ass metaphor came up terribly.  Sorry, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moose hunting by any chance.  Any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a strong believer in the Second Amendment because it was put next to the First Amendment for a reason, but I do not hunt moose.  No, I don't care.  You ever try to pack out a moose?  Do large animals.  Yes, they are.  If you can't drive to where you're hunting moose, I don't want to be involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break when we come back.  I want to get the the panel's assessment of the churro ad, the new churro ad from Microsoft.  They're getting the churro business.  Apparently we'll find out about it.  Just at a cost of three hundred million dollars.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  But before we do that, I do want to give you a brand new offer from audible dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Half the fun is like reading.  It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But as they get older, when they want to start to read them themselves.  No, no, it's always fun.  I wish my 14 year old would let me read to him still.  But they often want to mix when I get about three or four, you can play these audio books for them during nap time and stuff and they love it.  That's kids audible.  But audible dot com slash twit to is the special deal right now.  Get the platinum plan.  Get two books yours to keep no matter what.  And what we've given you a lot of recommendations.

And you're about to enter that room and mayhem.  Yeah, he's pulling himself up.  He's going to be walking pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, he's actually already started taking steps when we hold his hands.  Oh, he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The dog is not thrilled.  Babies are cute.  But this baby is the cutest baby you've ever seen.  He is so sweet and very good natured.  Yeah, he's pretty chill boy.  He's chill.  Be chill, baby.  Audible dot com slash twit to.  We thank them for their support.  All right.  It was on Thursday Night Football, the NFL opener, but you can also go to Google and see it.  Jerry Seinfeld, a $10 million man, $300 million campaign by Microsoft.  We thought it was a campaign to respond to the Apple switch ads.  It was going to be some sort of Vista campaign.  But apparently Microsoft's working on I don't know what some sort of chewy centered computer.  Did you watch the ad?  No, apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have a link to it on the blog, devorek.org slash blog.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they're trying to do a sitcom.  There's no selling it at all unless you think selling shoes or churros is this sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, somebody pointed out that it's an ad about nothing.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was a show about nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you can kind of see it as a metaphor for a couple of things.  For what?  And I think that the metaphor is there.  OK, so I'm going to preface this by saying, and I haven't heard this very much, but I actually like the ad.  I enjoyed it.  Oh, but that aside.  So, OK, the ad takes place.  Seinfeld sees Gates in like a discount store.  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me play a little bit of it and just stop me if you, you know, if you want to say something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And John, let us who are experiencing it for the first time enjoy it in its full glory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Full screen.  And I should.  Are we hearing it yet?  Let me see if I've got the.  Yeah, we're hearing it.  So let me go back and start this over, because I think you really have to understand what we're seeing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, make sure Patrick sees it from the beginning.  So it's Jerry Seinfeld.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm going to leave the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry's in the mall.  Jerry Seinfeld's in the mall and he's walking by a shoe store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it's your shoe circus quality shoes at discount prices.  Why pay more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so that's the first metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shoe circus quality shoes for less.  Why pay more quality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it doesn't necessarily cost as much as the competition, a.k.a.  Apple.  OK, so that's a metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Ryan, this is going to be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm telling you where I see this.  OK, so let's play some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So wait, I think I think Ryan may be on to something.  It doesn't mean the ads any good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, OK, this is good.  He's going to.  Ryan, were you a literature major in college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're going to deconstruct this for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will do my best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now Bill Gates is in shoe circus.  He looks up at Jerry Seinfeld.  I'm good.  Seinfeld offers immature.  Is the churro mean anything?  Seinfeld humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The left one's a little tight.  They'll stretch.  Is that your toe?  No.  What is it?  Leather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is that your toe?  No.  What is it?  Leather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I'm hearing in like the it'll stretch, it'll stretch is like, OK, so is this right  for you?  No.  Well, but it can be like you'll get used to it over time, right?  So that's kind of I don't know.  I mean, I know that some of this sounds like, you know, we're not going to diss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just that's good.  Let him finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually fascinated by this.  What I'm what I'm hearing there is like, look, you know, like, don't go with something that  you're not necessarily comfortable with just because it seems like, you know, that's what's  getting sold to you.  You know, with leather.  So leather implies quality or the higher end choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not necessarily talking about the circus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're talking about windows.  Right.  So right.  And windows is the metaphor for the shoe circus is a metaphor for windows.  They're saying that, you know, you can still get high quality and pay less.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even if it doesn't fit, you can stretch it.  Let's let's let's get to the stretching because I found this kind of erotically charged.  This is a conquistador.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They run very tight.  You get the other one.  You know what I do?  I wear them in the shower.  Clothes in the shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's never you're dressed and you're clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a classic Seinfeld line, by the way.  Ever wear shoes in the shower.  You're dressed and you're clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's that's a joke.  I'm not I'm not reading into that.  No, it's a class.  It's Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I think Seinfeld has seen his day.  I don't I think that sense of humor is not funny anymore.  It's old.  The door go about your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a 10.  Ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See how that feels.  So Seinfeld as shoe salesman.  That's a 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that conquistador?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The woman says, is that the conquistador?  She's looking in the window.  She doesn't recognize Seinfeld or Gates, but she knows it's a conquistador.  Guess what, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, is your time.  You want to talk about a shoe conquistador?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know.  I mean, again, I'm not trying to read you say the way.  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think that and I'm serious here.  I think Ryan's onto something I never consider.  I mean, I didn't think of this crappy commercial as a Boonwell film.  But on the other hand, it's deeply Freudian.  But on the other hand, let me preface this with two thoughts.  One, if Ryan's right, and he may well be with this interpretation,  this makes the commercial even all the more worse by being so damn pretentious.  But I'm still fascinated by this interpretation because I think you may be onto something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're a minute in, by the way.  This is a long commercial.  So this Hispanic family is looking through the window.  The mom says it's the conquistador and the father says they run tight.  Father also eating a churro.  He's also eating a churro.  So that's appearance number two of the churro.  Bill Gates flashed his clown club card, which, by the way, prominently features Bill Gates mugshot.  This is the picture.  If you do the comparison, go to the smoking gun, look for Bill Gates mugshot.  He's wearing the same sweater.  Yeah, that's his mugshot.  That's when he was arrested in Arizona for speeding.  New Mexico, I think.  New Mexico, that's right, yeah.  I think it's interesting that they put that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially since he's been a member since 09 on the card.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it 1909?  Wait a minute, that's, wait a minute.  Let's go back there.  That's not an expiration date?  Oh, that's an expiration date.  Oh, it is, I'm terribly sorry.  I thought it was a member since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's hard to see.  It's a little bit blurry.  It's my American Express bias.  My apologies.  Member since 09.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should have said that.  Member since 81.  Member since 81, that would have been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you get with that card?  Big top points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big top points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ryan?  Again, you know, I think some of this is just amusing.  Maybe I have just like a dumb sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I think, you know what, I think you're not going into it enough.  I'll bet you big top points mean something in some symbolic way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ego gratification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll apply some cryptology to that and see if I can actually put that.  No, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it means, okay, I think this represents, we're saying that this represents the, the  Kinkistador is the Macintosh, right?  You choose it not because it fits, you choose it for the status and big top points are what  you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes?  Well, no, because he's excited about the big top points, right?  So I think, I mean, that's just, it's kind of a statement on customer loyalty.  It's like, you know, look, we reward you for customer loyalty.  We may not be like the flashiest store in the mall.  Which clearly big top.  Big top.  Right.  But, you know, they want to reward their customers.  They want to give something back to the people who are buying their product, you know, and  then, whereas it's arguable that Microsoft hasn't really done such a good job with doing  that, I mean, it's also arguable that with stuff like Vista SP1 and things like that,  they, I mean, they are making a commitment to improving their products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Back to the ad.  They're walking out of the store now.  Apparently Gates and Seinfeld have decided to move in together.  I don't know why they're walking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can imagine over the years you've mind melted your magnum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute, by the way, both eating churros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't notice that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Both eating churros now.  It's something, they went, well, they went back to the churro stall and they got one  for Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there some sort of homoerotic aspect to this commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Why does everything with two guys on a screen have to be homoerotic?  Look what they're holding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're holding these churros.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can really see how John's logic skews on these things.  I mean, it's always erotic.  So I mean, I don't know.  Look at, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Jerry Seinfeld, wait a minute.  Let's just go through this again.  Haven't used that word for 10 years.  Jerry Seinfeld walks by a shoe store, sees Bill Gates in there, helps him choose shoes.  Helps him fit his shoes.  Fits his shoes, feels his foot up, then says afterwards, and we have to fill this in, let's  go get a churro.  They go out and get churros.  And now he's walking Bill back to the car.  I ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it gets worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, here comes, this is by the way, I think the coda for the whole commercial.  And I really want to know what this means, Ryan.  So please listen carefully as Seinfeld addresses the richest man in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I imagine over the years you've mind-melded your Magnum Jupiter brain to those other Saturn  ring brains of Microsoft.  I have.  I'm just wondering, are they ever going to come out with something that'll make our computers  moist and chewy like cake so we can just eat them while we're working?  If it's yes, give me a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adjust your shorts.  Just adjust your shorts.  And then what does Bill Gates do?  Then he shakes his ass.  He shakes his booty.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now where am I being like off the wall with my interpretation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is this ad about?  Okay, now finally, finally, this is the, we've gone a minute and a half into the ad so far.  This is the only appearance of any Microsoft logos, signs, signals, anything in the whole ad.  Here it comes.  The future delicious and the Windows logo.  And the Windows logo is literally on the screen for two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's be frank.  There is no better Microsoft branding except the word Microsoft than Bill Gates.  I mean, come on.  I thought he was retired.  Yeah, but he's also incredibly associated with the brand that he created.  You know, he's the most well-known philanthropist in the world.  He's the most well-known technologist in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, finish your, that's fine, but let's finish this interpretation where you kind of stopped us dead in the middle of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually, I kind of followed that through.  Although, towards the end, right, like there was a little bit where it just kind of, you know, I think it's kind of playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it got a little surreal, I think, to keep interpreting.  That's the Boone Well part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I definitely like, I saw the narrative going a little bit off towards the end.  And I don't necessarily know that there's some real interpretation in Bill Gates kind of wiggling his butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's safe to say that this is not some plea to keep shareholder, you know, expectations high in the wake of Bill Gates' departure.  I don't think that's necessary because everybody knows he hasn't been running the business.  I don't think consumers really care who's running the business.  They just want their computers to not suck.  You know, is this like the sign that they're going to bring a shopping network and green stamps to Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's just to me as an end, the thing that I think that they're trying to address, I mean, clearly they've touched on a few things.  You know, you've got the the kind of, you know, quote unquote, hoity toity kind of, you know, ethos of the Mac audience that I think that, you know, they kind of tend to play up in the in the PC versus Mac commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is for the lunchbox crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, maybe a little bit.  You know, you got that.  You've got the the price difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it was for the lunchbox crowd, you don't use Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't understand the choice of Seinfeld at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The system customizability aspect.  So you got a lot of these themes about Windows, but I think at the bottom line, the end of the day, what they benefit most doing is making Windows seem friendlier.  And that is the thing that they have the biggest problem.  Is it is Windows better or worse?  Isn't you know, is it the right choice?  Is it friendly enough, you know, to kind of handle the things I need to handle in my computing life?  Or do I need to look for something friendlier and easier in the Mac?  And I think that's what Apple's been driving really hard.  And that's what Microsoft wanted to do here is they wanted to present this commercial that makes, you know, Bill and, you know, the consumer experience in general,  which is the metaphor here is a metaphor for consumer experience.  They want to make it friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we agree that this is this is the beginning of a much longer campaign?  I mean, I think they're going to do this is the beginning of a much longer campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the shareholder should head for the exits.  And let me say this other thing about this symbolism that you keep bringing up.  All I'm saying for the symbolic aspect of this thing is I'm now associating Windows Vista with cheap shoes and churros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And vaguely and boxer shorts.  I don't know.  It's I have to say, they're going to spend three hundred million dollars on this.  They paid Seinfeld ten million of that.  It's clearly I mean, just got to be 16 episodes, right?  I mean, where they're going to move in together.  Seinfeld is going to eat cereal.  There's going to be a payoff at some point where perhaps.  OK, I'll give you a prediction.  They go to the apartment.  There's a Mac there.  Bill Gates asked Jerry, do you use this thing?  No, I never could figure it out.  And they throw the Mac out the window.  I think there's more here.  That would be good.  I think there's a setup.  This is a setup for what is going to be many, many more episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that's definitely possible.  I think that, you know, as a minute and a half long commercial, it has to kind of stand on its own.  It doesn't stand on its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes no sense at all.  It's not a really good book.  I mean, yeah, we're talking about it.  They got a lot of press for it.  Yeah, but it's all naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of press for what?  For ways to interpret this.  Then, yeah, it might not stand on its own very well.  When before I actually decide, OK, well, what's the meaning here?  Why would they spend a minute and a half of nonsense?  Even then, you know, I just kind of tried to look at it for its entertainment value.  And, you know, me being like an old Seinfeld fan and I love Curb Your Enthusiasm.  And I personally think that, you know, that kind of irreverent humor is still good.  You know, I like the commercial.  I just liked it for what it was and not even necessarily looking at it, you know, from an analytical standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe if we don't look at it that way, but look at it in terms of views,  it is one of the top viewed videos on YouTube.  People are talking about it.  They put it on the opening game of football.  It means a lot of people, you know, 30 million people saw it.  I just wonder, 30 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess what's interesting, right, to take a step from deconstruction  and moving to reader response theory,  where the efforts of the creator don't matter, you know, what are people carrying away from this  other than Microsoft apparently has so much money.  They don't invest in satellites.  They invest in really random mini television.  That's what I get at it.  No, you know what I mean?  Like, I mean, can you imagine if you turn this in, you know, Ryan,  and your lit professors would savage this?  You know what I mean?  Very likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's that?  Although my professors probably would not have approved of me going in the gadget journalism  either, so you know, you've got to do your own thing.  Look, I wrote for magazines before I ended up in television,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so I've twice peed upon all that was sacred from a lot of my college professors  because they thought magazines were a low excuse for the use of the language.  I'm with you there, but I just look at this and it's like, whoa,  it's going to take a lot to tie this in this.  Look, I mean, it's not Joycean material here, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, we're not talking about like interpreting Ulysses.  I mean, this is...  I'm not talking about interpreting Ulysses.  I think it's higher brow than most commercials if you want to look at it from an interpretive standpoint,  but it's, I mean, this is nigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think sophomoric, given the resources they had available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree.  I think it is totally sophomoric, high brow hardly.  I mean, yeah, maybe if you could take that interpretive aspect that you were using, Ryan,  and take it right to the end and have everything nailed down,  but you started off with a pretty interesting interpretation,  but then there's too many loose ends.  So now I'm like going back to the fact that I think the ad totally stinks,  and I have a prediction, which is I think they're going to kill this campaign before they get to the punchline.  Let me ask you this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The LA Times said,  There are English subtitles.  They say, what are these rich guys doing shopping at Shoe Circus while the Third World looks in through the window?  I think the LA Times...  That's a good point. I like that.  He's kind of savaged it.  The Latinos are pressed up against the glass, fascinated by the action inside,  but they do not appear to know who Gates and Seinfeld are.  Are they too poor to own a TV?  Do they represent the yearning Latino hordes trying to get in on the American consumerist dream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually, that's a good point because the commercial clearly indicates that Bill Gates is playing Bill Gates,  and Seinfeld's playing Seinfeld because they mention each other's names.  Those people in the window are obviously so out of touch, or they don't have TVs, or they don't care to know anything about anything,  which is kind of insulting to an entire ethnic group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, yeah, John, and not that they just did that for the comedic value.  It is pure comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if there was a comedic value, I didn't think it was...what was funny about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I found that that part was humorous.  Yeah, I would agree that I think it's possible to interpret that a little bit strangely,  but at the same time, I mean, look, you're also talking, I mean, if you want to speak in all these metaphors and whatnot,  I mean, you're talking about the man who is doing more to better the world than most governments possibly combined.  I mean, this is a person who...the philanthropic efforts of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are completely off the charts  by comparison to most...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for that reason, we should like this commercial?  No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's trying to save brown people and crown the world.  I don't think that's trying to drive a particular point.  My point is, you know, you can interpret that a lot of different ways, you know, with the minority groups standing outside the window and what have you.  I don't really think that that's what they were after at all, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A bit into the ad, Seinfeld...this is a great review by Maria Russo in the LA Times.  A bit into the ad, Seinfeld suddenly takes over from the salesman and is helping fit Gates' shoes.  As Seinfeld feels around for Gates' toe, he says, is that your toe? Gates says no.  Seinfeld asks, what is it? Gates says leather.  The camera lingers on Gates' face as he says leather, and he appears to be attempting to give a meaningful look.  Are we supposed to be interpreting something naughty in this exchange?  It's not unreasonable to go there, especially after we've witnessed the fondling of Gates' feet by annealing Seinfeld.  At the very end, she says, its main idea is a Dadaist void.  A decade after Seinfeld, nothing has gotten old.  Yeah, I'd have to agree with her on that.  All right, so you liked it, Ryan.  I would say I'm not a big fan. I can think John is not a big fan.  You're going to have to... Patrick, it's up to you to cast the deciding vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I want to...can I hold casting my vote until I've seen the entire thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we need to see more, too. I think we need to see episode two, three, four.  It might end up being the most brilliant ad campaign ever, begun with a subtle...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no way. Microsoft has never done a memorable ad campaign in its history.  Why would this be any different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly different from anything Microsoft's ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think the Mojave one was pretty fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They dropped that, haven't they? That's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was another blunder.  If people had known it was this, they'd like it.  To take a more literalist approach, which I'll back off on the Mexican thing for Ryan's benefit,  I think the joke about the toe leather was just a nerd... was just nerd humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just non sequitur.  What am I feeling there? Leather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because he says, is this your toe? But he's not pushing on his toe, he's pushing on the shoe, which is leather.  Get it? Which is a kind of nerd thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Literalist-engineer humor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it is not.  And then the furtive look between the two of them was them exchanging the fact that it was a punchline to a stupid joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have loved to have been at this shooting of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John, I'm actually just curious, can you name, just from my own personal edification,  a couple of things that you've actually thought were funny? Like movies, television shows, stuff you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a big fan of The Seinfeld Show.  I think Larry David Show is less funny because it's not scripted, and so I think it falls off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It descends to shouting a lot, which is kind of the failure of bad improv, is shouting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just curious, I just want to kind of understand your taste a little bit more,  and this is just for me as a colleague, I see you around a lot and stuff like that, so next time I know what kind of joke to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you want to ask him to a movie in a churro, you'll know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can tell you what kind of joke to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually, I don't want to know that. I want to know first what kind of movie...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, what kind of joke to tell? Funny joke.  Very circular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, no, I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell a joke, tell a joke, John. Something you think is funny. Let's hear it.  No, I'm not going to start telling jokes.  No, I want you to tell a joke. You must have a joke. I can't ever remember a joke.  Are you like that, or do you actually have jokes that you tell, like when you go on the golf course you tell a joke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, when I'm on the golf course, and when I frequent the golf course, impressing my clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you a joke teller, John? I don't think you are.  I have a lot of jokes. I have a lot of jokes, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, let's hear you...  No, I'm not going to start doing a monologue here.  Let's just answer Ryan's question with some stuff.  I bet he can reach that entire Red Fox record.  Just tell us... You don't have to tell a joke, John.  By the way, Ryan, now, talking about Red Fox, and I keep telling people this who like to collect records,  Red Fox at one point did all these party records, these albums, which are almost impossible to find nowadays,  and he must have done 50 of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have them? Do you have a collection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me, personally? No, I don't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you they should be on the internet. That's the kind of thing you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never seen them on the internet. I can't...  I love Razzleball and they say aristocrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a whole genre of party albums like that. They were filthy.  So John, you don't have to tell a joke. Just give me the punchline of a joke you liked a lot.  I mean, just the punchline. We'll all know what the joke is, and this will help Ryan in his...  Oh, I got plenty of punchlines.  Well, give us a punchline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, lady, Indians ride bareback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, there you go. I think that's excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another twit is in the can.

I'd rather make sure it was good and ready.  And that's why we wanted to do the podcast first, is to give something, put something out there in the time in between when I left in Gadget and when we actually get it out the door.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's about five seconds.  Slight?  I should have said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, is he the cutest?  But just so you could see the baby, he's a very, very cute.  Yeah, the baby's adorable.  Good work, Patrick.  Have a few more.
