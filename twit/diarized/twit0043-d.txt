Transcript:  This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, Episode 43 for February 26, 2006.  Old Yeller.  And on the, this is kind of fun, the first time we've used ISDN for a TWiT.  Doug K. of IT Conversations happens to have a Zephyr, as do I.  And that's why Doug sounds like he's in the same room.  Plus he has the same microphone.  You have pretty much the same setup.  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can both make the same mistakes.  And we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that you made them first and then I should be learning from what you're, you've  been doing this for years.  Yeah, Doug was just in Hawaii.  Were you acquiring more Hawaiian shirts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was.  That's part of the ritual.  It makes it a deductible trip, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it should.  You know, I was famous for my wacky shirts until Peter Hammersley, the executive producer  at Tech TV, told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, whatever charm the show had with those shirts, I can't imagine why they'd kill  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would they stop?  You have some great shirts.  That was my trademark.  So go back to it now.  Nobody can stop me except now I have to reacquire.  But I'll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should take a picture of the shirt you're wearing during each twit and post that on  the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make it visual.  That's Patrick Norton blowing his nose in the background.  Allergy season is here in beautiful Northern California.  He's suffering.  I forgot how bad your allergies were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're either non-existent or they're completely out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it grass?  What is it you're allergic to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much anything that generates pollen.  So most of what's healthy in the world generates oxygen for the atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tripp my allergies.  What makes us feel good kills poor Patrick Norton.  John C. Dvorak is here.  He's allergic to nothing except idiots and the author of the fabulous Dvorak Uncensored  Dvorak dot org slash blog off to Germany.  Actually first to first to Orlando.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah the PMA show, the Photo Marketing Association.  Have you been to that before?  Yeah I used to go every two years to give the same exact speech.  In fact this year was on the cycle with the speech was film is dead but now that film  is dead they don't call me back to do the speech anymore.  They know it.  I did it for about a decade.  It's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John you're really a master of efficiency.  Why rewrite when you can you know.  So film finally died.  You were right.  I went to PMA last year.  I went to Robin Lusso of Camcorderinfo flew me out and we did some video there and it  was really it's a fun show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it is.  It's a moderately sized show.  It's not huge but it's it's big and they have all you know all the camera guys are  there and they're showing all the newest stuff and it's you know if you like cameras it's  pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just it was a film show is the Photo Marketing Association.  So it really was you know film and cameras and photographer stuff.  And then now it's digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you know they had this little side show that was called the Digital Camera Marketing  Association something like that was started with a D and they would do this.  It was part of the same organization but they kind of do this little show on the side.  That's how they started the DCMA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it was very confusing actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right and then you've turned out to eventually they just I don't even think they do the two  separate anymore.  No it's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same show.  And then you're from Florida.  You're going on to Hanover and you're going to see it which is a big German trade show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I go to that every couple of years too.  I can't really don't like going every year because it's kind of a miserable show.  It's a huge.  It's like a World's Fair.  They have pavilions.  It's not like a big you know it's not like the thing in Vegas.  These are like there's like a permanent World's Fair.  It's got buildings lots of buildings.  You got a bus system that runs between the buildings and it's like going to a World's  Fair.  It's huge.  It's enormous.  And you know and it's it tends to still be kind of German centric and as opposed to world  class.  So it's kind of annoying in that regard.  But it's like a big German trade show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a really funny phrase.  It tends to be German centric instead of world class.  Not that the Germans have ever brought us any achievements in cars, optics or warfare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well what I mean by that Patrick of course is that everyone speaks German.  They don't care about the international audience.  And so I mean they're basically selling to dealers in Germany and that's what I mean.  So anyway but if anybody's you know picks up this broadcast and they want to send me  an email and if they got some cool product they want me to check out I'm going to go  to Berlin after that and I could use a tour.  Berlin is amazing city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dvorak John at Dvorak dot org.  You've been to Berlin before John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No actually that's the I've been meaning to go to Berlin every time I go to Hanover because  it's only like an hour and a half on the train and I just keep not doing it.  I keep you know heading someplace else and I just this time I'm going for sure.  So I'm going to be a couple of nights in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how much Berlin is mellowed in the last decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well everybody who's been there says it's one of the coolest places on the planet right now.  There's some really neat stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I spent the day there this summer with my son and it's really an interesting city.  Of course the wall is completely gone but there's a line in the street where you can  follow the path of the wall.  Go to the Brandenburg Gate of course.  I mean that's an amazing thing to see and a lot of history there and the Reichstag has  an incredible on the roof of the Reichstag is an incredible kind of open greenhouse kind  of thing with an amazing view, kind of a spiral walkway and an amazing view up there.  I've got a little piece of the wall.  You have a piece of the wall?  Somebody give me a piece of the wall.  I have a chunk too.  You go to Checkpoint Charlie they have the old, what's it called, Charlie House where  it was a kind of a rescue operation for people who had gotten over the wall for a long time  and of course once the wall fell it's now like a museum of the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a museum back in 86 when I was over there.  Actually a bunch of us actually managed to liberate a brick and break some pieces off  the wall to bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you got it the right way.  You got it by breaking down the wall.  We actually bought it in a piece of, encased in a piece of plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know at one of the Microsoft cafeterias, I can't remember which segment of the campus  it's on, but there's a piece of the wall that apparently I think was the Prime Minister  or the head of Mercedes-Benz or somebody gave Bill as a gift and it's this whole section  of the wall.  Wow.  You know that's like about a story high and it's got all the graffiti and stuff on it  and it's sitting in the cafeteria.  It's actually quite an interesting piece of art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your beast dug must be painted right?  Because every piece I've seen has a lot of paint on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean my piece is a tiny little thing in a baggie.  Right.  I didn't even get the plastic.  A chunk of the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pranger has joined us also from another video podcast, this thing called revision3.com.  Hello David.  Hey there.  Good to have you.  Welcome.  Thank you much.  Kevin Rose is supposed to join us, but you can stand in for him.  Okay.  Because I'm going to ask him about dig suing all these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is dig suing people for intellectual property?  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he's going to plead ignorance.  Yeah.  Well, look, you know, first of all, there's, well, we'll talk about it in a little bit.  Pranger doesn't work for dig.  I know.  So he can, he's not probably the right person to ask.  Now, Waz was going to join us.  He may still join us because I wanted to ask him.  He gave an interview to the Globe and Mail and he was kind of critical of Apple.  We'll talk about that a little bit too.  But we'll wait till they join us before we get into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you actually heard from Kevin today at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't.  He said he was available, but not.  Next Sunday, I should announce this also, we're going to, John, you won't be there.  I'm sorry to say you'll be in Hanover.  But next Friday, I should say March 3rd, we're going to be doing the show live from the Apple  store.  So, Waz has said he'd join us for that.  So that'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'll be pretty exciting.  Yeah.  I got lucky to get out of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to be there?  Oh yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'd stone you.  At least currently.  I mean, until it blows over, let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, one of the biggest articles on dig.com right now is somebody, I guess, has written  point by point refuting every single thing you pause in that article.  And I keep running into Mac people that I know that know I know you.  And they're like, Devorak doesn't believe that, does he?  He just did that for the column.  He just likes to agitate people.  I'm like, yeah, every six to 12 weeks, John goes, I haven't pissed off the entire Apple  loving community in a few weeks.  I could use a couple hundred extra thousand hits on this column.  But people are like, he doesn't believe that, does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised anybody would take the time to do a point by point refutation.  That's what cracks me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shows you how psychopathic some of these people are.  That's just nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why spend the energy on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's only just, you know, it's a consideration.  Somebody wrote me something nasty and I said, you know, it's not like I'm on the board  of Apple suggesting this and you should be yelling at me.  Right, right.  It's just a thought.  It's just a column.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, February 28, this Tuesday, Apple is going to make a big announcement.  I think that's exactly what they're going to announce.  What do you think they're going to announce?  They're going to announce they're shipping Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen the pictures of their new iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have.  I don't know how real they are.  Let me just tell a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just heard it was an announcement of something fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let me tell a story and we can see if we can decipher.  I mean, it's kind of, there's very cryptic.  I got the email myself.  It says, it's just got a little iCal picture, February 28, 2006, and it says, this is all.  It's just eight words, but everybody is reading into this eight words amazingly.  Come see some fun new products from Apple.  That's all it says.  Now, we're going to go down there.  I'm going to go down with the camera crew and we're going to cover it, but it could  just be iPod Socks version 2.  Fun new products.  It doesn't sound big.  Any thoughts from anybody?  The speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's so little information to work on at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like semiotics.  You're trying to understand what could they have meant by fun.  What do they mean by products?  Fun new products?  It's a video player.  That's what, and then Gadget had a picture, very similar to the picture of the video iPod.  Except the whole thing is a display and it's a touch screen.  Touch screen.  And you feel that that's accurate, David, or do you have inside information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have inside information, but that's what everyone that thinks that they have accurate  information keeps thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking the thing sacred of saying iPod Hi-Fi Boombox arriving next week amongst the  other products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet you it'll have Wi-Fi also.  Here's my thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's my thinking.  I think you're exactly right, David.  And Apple's talking about media hub, right?  And I think people are saying it's going to be a Mac mini media hub.  But what if it were an iPod media hub with built-in Wi-Fi, the ability to store and playback  pictures, video and audio.  And purchase it wirelessly.  And purchase it wirelessly and play it back wirelessly.  And subscribe to Twitter.  And subscribe.  Wouldn't that be an interesting product?  Well, that would be one of the things you'd be able to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could purchase and get all the free stuff as well.  You know, ask a ninja.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, we're going to see RSS clients in this stuff.  So you're going to be able to actually not only put your podcast on your portable device,  but even manage your subscriptions there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Screw the RSS.  I want BitTorrent.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it won't play WMV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think we can safely say that's not in the fun new product category.  The other thing that's I think probably a very possible bet is a media center Mac mini.  I mean, they're due for the new Mac mini.  They're not due for a new iPod.  It could be a new iBook.  Could be an iBook.  No, it's a fun new product, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iBooks are fun.  Especially in a shape like toilet seats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it seems to me that every time Apple farts, everybody gets all worked up.  I know, it's amazing.  Let's go on to some other topic.  I mean, who cares what it is until after they show it?  And then it's going to be like overblown when it rolls out.  We'll be talking about this for a month.  All right.  I think you're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think it's very interesting that people are just going on and on trying to read into  these eight words, you know, what it could possibly be.  We're going to go to MacBreak.  It's going to take a camera crew down there.  We'll have a same day coverage.  And if it's iPod socks, won't we be embarrassed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think of this new Skype version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, 2.0 with video?  I haven't tried it.  Have you tried it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't tried it.  I know that there used to be a plugin that a third party company made for video to work  on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I forget what it's called.  Right.  But now you can do it for real on Windows, but not on the Mac.  So I'm actually using Skype on the Mac right now.  I know you're all on Windows.  Actually a friend just got a new T-Mobile selling a new Windows mobile cell phone.  It's called the MDA.  Now this is a cell phone, but it has Wi-Fi in it, Windows mobile.  And he's running, he puts Skype for Pocket PC on there and you have to overclock it because  it clocks in about 200 megahertz, but you overclock it a little bit.  It runs Skype.  So he's able to on his T-Mobile cell phone make Skype calls via Wi-Fi.  And you can fry eggs on it too.  Yeah, you probably can.  It probably gets hot enough when you're overclocking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is the 12 volt battery, you need to keep it running for more than  an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.  Yeah, but it's a neat looking phone, but it doesn't, you know, again, the problem with  these smartphones, they don't have dial pads.  It's like the sidekick.  Like the phone functionality is second to everything else.  Okay, news.  News, that's news.  That's all news.  Everything we just mentioned is news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we do the 32 Google stories that have come out?  All right, Google's been in the news a lot.  So okay, Google's made another small announcement, Google Base, where they can use link credit  cards to their Google accounts, do purchasing, which people are predicting that Google's  shot across the bow of PayPal and eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're finally doing those transactions that they were promising, huh?  How do I do that?  Now I have a Google account.  Do I go to GoogleBase.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, do you have a Gmail account or do you have a Google AdSense account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what they're doing is they're allowing certain people to start selling stuff through  Google Base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So Google Base is now becoming the eBay killer that people were worried it was going to become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Slash Craigslist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's basically the same stuff you use to buy Google video or to pay for your  Google Earth subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also announced a content creator, a web design engine to compete with Yahoo's, GeoCities  and all that.  But boy, is it lame.  Is it?  Did you try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I went in there.  It was just useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My son looked at it and equated it with the first AOL web thing that they dreamed up.  Really?  Yeah, just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and ironically it was so popular that they had to close it after the first day because  so many people signed up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you guys ever read userfriendly.org?  Yeah.  The cartoon?  Yeah.  There's been a really great series where Iliad's been making fun of people who are completely  oblivious.  They're like, oh, Google's going to give away our information.  It's like, well, Google is already selling your information.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The writing joke is like, oh, great.  Why do I sign up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's this whole series of cartoons where they're kind of taking the piss out of Google  and its reputation and the fact that anything they do, everybody signs it.  Half the planet wants to sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's like Apple in that respect.  We just talked about two companies in a row that really generate more attention than they  deserve.  Apple just has to say hi there and everybody says, what?  And Google's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think Apple wants everyone to say what when they say hi there.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Google does, but sometimes they would like to be able to do something without having  everyone go nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I just logged on to pages.google.com, which is the page creator.  So apparently it's open again, although I just had a, I've never seen this, an error  message from Google says, Google, oops, Google page creator is having a little trouble right  now.  This is not because of anything you did.  It's just a little hiccup in our system that will hopefully go away soon.  We apologize.  How about experiences like that?  We apologize for the inconvenience and recommend you try reloading the page.  Well, let me try reloading the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what it does, Leo, it's going to create a website using your Google mail name.  And I'm sure they have lots of applications for it.  I can't think of a single one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's in MySpace.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it competing with MySpace or with Yahoo or with, I mean, it's supposed to actually  implement Ajax style stuff in there, which is a pretty big step, I think, if they make  it work for end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does have, it is doing character by character feedback to the host, apparently.  Oh, interesting.  So it's got some really sort of high interactivity features, but it's not quite sure what those  are yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and as bullet point number one, no technical knowledge required.  Maybe we're just, you know, snobs.  Maybe people need something like this.  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like front page from 10 years ago.  You know, you can pick from a couple of dozen templates and you can make this look and so  where are you?  But again, yeah, there's sure maybe there is a business model in the MySpace kind of  world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we do have, I can't remember what our, is it twit at google at gmail.com or twittv  at gmail.com.  I think that's it.  So I should sign up for twittv.googlepages.com.  Maybe I shouldn't have done this redesign.  I could just use a Google template.  Nobody thinks so.  Nobody thinks so.  Redesign is done, by the way, and now I have to implement it.  Oh, God.  It looks great.  I don't want to give out the address on the show because I don't know.  It's not on our servers yet.  As soon as it's on our servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't think the old design was that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the only problem with the old design is it's very blog focused.  So this is, this has a blog still in it and I hope you guys will participate in the blog,  but it's more like a network page where you see all the shows on the front page and all  the new shows on the front page.  It's a little clearer about what the shows are and what the latest version is and all  that stuff.  Doug, you have about, how many different IT conversations pages do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's all automated.  So we have one page certainly for every program and we're just about to hit a thousand programs  in the archive.  A thousand?  Yeah.  We're doing about 10 to 12 a week right now and we'll be doing 60 programs a week by the  end of the year.  You just did Steve Gibson?  Yep.  That was Larry Magid that interviewed Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you just let me know that the most popular, what do you think guys, the most popular IT  conversation interview of all time was?  They've interviewed everybody.  Adolf Hitler?  No, not yet.  Maybe when you go to Berlin, John, you can snag an interview with him and that would  be I'm sure very popular.  No Wozniak.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Woz gave a great presentation at Nome Dex a year and a half ago.  Very popular and we did a follow-up interview with him right afterwards and that has now  been downloaded a little over 150,000 times, which by our standards is pretty high.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So AOL has pulled an interesting stunt.  I guess this is one way to get rid of your dial-up customers.  They've raised the price of AOL dial-up, which was already exorbitant, to $25.90 a month.  It's the same as the broadband price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember when $25.95 a month would have been cheap for 56k access.  But that was a while ago.  300k access, yes.  It was a long time ago.  There's still a lot of people that can't get broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And AOL needs broadband.  It seems like, do you think it's that or they're trying to get rid of these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody in their right mind wants to get rid of free money.  It can't be costing them that much to maintain the dial-up centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AOL spokeswoman Ann Bentley said Tuesday, hopefully it's an encouragement for them to  get high-speed connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if it's a possibility that people who are locked into their AOL addresses and  want the ability to access while they're on the road.  Is it the mobile access thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get the latest on BlackBerry.  RIM had a victory in the patent office the day before their hearing on Friday.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said that one of the, I think there's four NTP patents,  one of them was invalidated.  So that would be, you would think, good news.  Although the judge, apparently in the RIM case, the U.S. judge is not well disposed  towards BlackBerry at all.  James R. Spencer heard the case on Friday.  What was the upshot of the hearing?  I didn't hear.  I was on a plane from Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that he, first of all, he was pretty pissed at the whole patent process.  And he was basically saying that this, he said this thing, first of all, should have  been handled out of court.  Yeah.  That it should never have gotten that far.  And I think he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's mad that he even has to waste any time on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's BlackBerry's.  Yeah.  And he also said that he feels that the patent process has stifled innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't blame BlackBerry on this, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were confused, too.  And then they made the people who apparently have the rightful patent fight them through  the system.  And then they ended up with their stock price and their entire customer base over a barrel  as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but we don't know...  This is what BlackBerry, what RIM is saying is, well, it wasn't the money.  Now, of course, this is revisionist.  Maybe this is just the latest.  But, and I agree with you that I think the NTP...  I have now come around to thinking...  John Weirney was the principal of the thing.  No, no, no, no.  John said all along the NTP patent was legit.  And after reading all of the detail on it, it does sound like that's a legit patent.  No, BlackBerry was saying, RIM was saying, it's not the money.  It's that we don't want our business process encumbered in the future.  And NTP wasn't giving us...  You know, wasn't saying, yeah, just license it.  You can do whatever you want.  They were saying, no, we want to kind of...  You know, they weren't being clear on what else they wanted, in other words.  And I can understand that.  And if you're trying to run a business, it's one thing to license the technology, another  thing to have this company have its thumbs in your business all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, supposedly they've got to work around...  I'm a BlackBerry user and they send out email to everyone saying, you know, just in case  we have a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what the workaround is?  The Department of Justice, the US Congress, major industry, all of them run on BlackBerry.  There's no way.  You know that there was intense pressure on the Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate  this patent.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure every congressman, every...  I mean, the Department of Justice runs on these things.  I'm sure President Bush carries a BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think he really carries any communications devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He just went back to the Trio 650 after he didn't want the 700.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has people that can do that kind of thing.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he might be a sidekick user.  I think he likes to IM with his buds.  I don't know.  We're just being silly.  You're probably right.  Now, that's an interesting question, though.  Does the president carry a cell phone?  I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.  He's got six or 12 personal assistants to be cell phone carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The president carries a cell phone that it would make it very easy to target him.  I guess so.  He carries really creative devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  No, he doesn't carry...  He's got a bunch of guys that...  That's what I just said.  In the time...  I know, but I wasn't listening.  In the time that you guys were chatting that up, I did a web page on Google and posted  it.  It's online.  It took that long to create a page from scratch.  So John's been web designing during the show.  I'm on the web right now at dvorak.googlepages.com slash home.  But now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you didn't get that error message I did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  We've got a page posted on the internet as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You put a picture of the sky up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Dvorak's faux home page.  This is a test of how fast it is to do a page.  Hey, it's beautiful too.  And click here for a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks 10 times better than Google video.  It looks a lot better than Google video.  It's colorful.  Yeah, well that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And look, it points to Twit TV.  Thank you, John.  Hey, that's great.  That's nice.  Okay, now I've got to do that.  Okay, talk amongst yourselves.  I'm going to go design a web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, hey.  Now you're just being a copycat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the patent and trademark market has office Gs, trademark office.  Actually, I guess they have, it says here, rejected all but three of the patents and  it's a signal that they will invalidate them as well.  I think that's political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you think that's political at this point?  Of course it's political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's you know, if the patent's legal and legit, having it invalidated at this point, that's  a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you guys been following some of the stuff the person that runs the patent and trademark  office is pointing out, just how it's messy.  It is, they've been done a series of interview clips on Boing Boing where they're talking  about how they just think it's, you know, she's, I mean, I can't imagine she's going  to be allowed to stay in that office very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the Onions list of how people are going to respond to the BlackBerry service shutdown.  Keep frantically hitting send until service returns.  Contact broker on astral plane through right combination of incense, cocaine and fatted  calf sacrifice.  Three commit useless information to memory.  That's what we had to do in the old days.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Imagine what happens when, you know, eight million people like me walk back into their  singular office and say, hi, I bought this and it doesn't work.  Yeah.  Imagine what they're going to have to deal with.  It can't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Email from PC using only thumbs and attempt to recapture awesome BlackBerry feeling.  Focus all mental powers on finding loophole in lawsuits so they can reclaim machines that  remind them when to eat lunch.  This is my favorite.  What will the, and the number one thing BlackBerry users will have to do when services shut down,  look where they're going.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Onion is fine.  We got a slow news.  We can't.  We have to apologize to the listeners in advance.  Why is that?  They get mad at us when we don't have a lot of cool stuff to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should just start every tweet with an apology.  Then we wouldn't have to worry.  This is tweet.  We're sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you already talk about YouTube and how networks are getting pissed about their property  going virally all over the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NBC.  This is a, I mean, NBC should be on their knees thanking YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where did YouTube come from?  I didn't, I had not heard of them.  Not too long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube, the band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube.  We talked about them last week too.  Y-O-U-T-U-B-E dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no I noticed.  I got two or three things today from people sending me from the YouTube.  Everybody uses it.  I never saw any of them either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're on the top 200 websites according to Alexa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but who uses Alexa?  That's absurd.  People who live in Elkhurst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've tracked Alexa.  Alexa is probably the 20th person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People who want numbers that don't understand that Alexa is a self-serving group of people  that actually use Alexa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alexa numbers aren't that bad.  I've tested them.  Really?  But you have to use the Alexa toolbar.  I mean they're not Nielsen numbers.  It depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stuff is way off.  So you think relative, but the relative ranking is right, just not the actual number?  Because you have to use the Alexa toolbar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't really give you real numbers.  They give you kind of rankings.  Ranking, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that would make sense.  So YouTube of course was where Lazy Sunday, the clip, the great rap clip from Saturday  Night Live first appeared and people were sending them around all over the place.  NBC got a lot of mileage out of it.  In fact they became so popular they tried to turn around and sell it on the Apple iTunes  music store for a buck ninety-nine, which was kind of silly since everybody already  had it for free.  And then they tried to pull it off YouTube.  Nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there's some good stuff on there I have to say.  They should be grateful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's a lot of sites like that that have a lot of copyrighted material that's  been posted.  Oh yeah.  Out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google video.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can probably find Lazy Sunday on Google video, I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if you can still find it on YouTube.  What I loved was all the Lazy Sunday ripoffs, not ripoffs but homages.  Everybody from 11 year old kids to, I mean it's just been hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you were up in Canada Leo, what do you think about this crackpot university president  who's banned Wi-Fi because he thinks it might cause cancer at Lakehead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That cracked me up, I saw that.  Lakehead University, they're worried about the quote health effects of wireless networking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not inundating with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just hope nobody's studying science at this university because they might want to think  again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody, somebody said, I blog this item on devorek.org slash blog, there's your plug,  and somebody sent in a comment, Lakehead University aka Last Chance You.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't get it anywhere.  Well you know in Canada, university education is very inexpensive.  McGill is like $1,700 a year.  And McGill's a great school.  It's a very good school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean a state by the federal government of Canada, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then Thunder Bay is kind of off the beaten track, a beautiful area, a little cold in  the winter.  That's where Lakehead is.  I was stunned when I saw that article in the Globe and Mail and I thought that is unclear  on the concept.  They also, in their defense, they mentioned security issues, but I think it really was  more about the quote health issues.  Yeah, but Canada's got curling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a video on YouTube of a bunch of curlers that are doing what's apparently the most  impossible move ever.  I have no idea what's going on, but they're cheering like crazy.  The commentators are going nuts and it's spreading around like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't believe that this show has descended to curling commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talking about curling, hey you're from Canada, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me just see, I'll give you the results of the curling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got another one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Finns one, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I've got the new couch potato definition.  That's sitting at home watching curling on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not even real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think watching Texas Hold'em is worse.  A lot of people doing that.  Yeah, but do you fast forward?  How is curling any less boring than golf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if you've played curling, if you were, whatever, do you call it playing?  I don't even know what you call it.  Curled.  If you've thrown a curl, if you've stoned, it's a fun game to play.  I'm not sure I'd want to watch.  Have you done it?  Or are you just saying it's fun?  I'm just saying it's a fun game.  I'm saying it looks like a fun game to me.  It's fun.  People I know who've curled say it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Canada took the gold and the United States took bronze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Canada did take the gold.  Oh good, all right.  Well that's appropriate, as it should be.  The Canadiens lost in hockey.  Both Canada and the U.S. lost in hockey.  And then who won the checks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the Russians played for the bronze medal and the Czechs won, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the gold medal is between the Finns and the Swedes.  That's right, the Finns and the Swedes.  The Finnish look like they're unbeatable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's twi-Twin Olympic news.  I could play the theme.  So let's go to another topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fans say, this is on my blog again,  fan set up church of SpongeBob.  And?  Is that a tech story?  Yeah, it's on the internet.  Do you have a problem with that, John?  I'm joining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we were supposed to have Kevin on.  I wish he had come on because I would like to have asked him about the fact that  dig.de, which was basically a copy of dig and a pretty direct copy,  has now renamed itself to Yig.de to avoid legal battle with Dig Incorporated.  Apparently, because Dig has now gone to Europe and has registered the trademark,  nobody else can beat Dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just went there.  If you type dig.de, you do go to Yig.  Yig.  Yig.de, and it's exactly the same.  Instead of having 33 digs, you've got 33 Yigs.  Yigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a bunch of sites that do that.  Well, there's more like,  There's Pig, which is an open source dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, I don't know.  Kevin's going to have a tough time shutting down all the digs.  I didn't know about Pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that pig.com?  I think it's Pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's, I don't know if they have a pig.com, but it's the software.  And there are, I think, quite a few companies running,  or companies, sites running the pig software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and Net Identity owns the pig.com site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pig.com, and then there's, so, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there's a funny thing about this company.  I hate to, never mind, I'm not going to even bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they have two fat guys sitting on a couch drinking beer  and call it Pig Nation?  Pig.  The Pig Nation.  Pig Nation video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you looked at Yig.de, though?  I mean, it really does look exactly like.  It's exactly the same.  There's no difference.  It's a blatant clone.  I can understand why Kevin would be a little upset.  It seems to be in a foreign language.  It's in German.  You should learn that language if you're going to Berlin.  Yeah, yeah, das ist gut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Das ist gut.  Wiener Schnitzel, very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are all important things.  How do you say beer?  Oh, beer.  B-I-E-R.  It's not the unlocked of it.  Prost.  From the Twit Army, who fortunately somebody's been  collecting stories, the Twit Army's been collecting stories,  the Motion Picture Association of America is bringing lawsuits  now not against, get this, they've gone beyond suing  BitTorrent sites.  They're now suing sites that index binaries on newsgroups.  What?  Well, if you go to the newsgroups, this is the newsgroups  and newsgroups, it's going to be very hard for them to shut  down the newsgroups, obviously.  If you go to the newsgroups and you go in the binaries  groups, there's alt.media.  That's a lot of binary.  Naked news.  Oh, right.  Well, you can get movies, TV, it's actually a very good  place to get these because it's faster than BitTorrent  and anyway, I'm not going to go into too great detail,  but the key is how do you find it?  Well, there are sites that index these binary files,  and so the MPAA is going against them.  Also, targeting nine indexing sites for BitTorrent,  including ISO Hunt, BT Hub, Torrent Box, Torrent Spy,  they're going after these guys, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always noticed one thing, not that I'm recommending  this to anybody, but it seems to me that some of the best  places to exchange these kinds of files is on the IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what everybody does, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've talked to a number of guys who run IRC servers,  and I asked them specifically if they've ever been,  if anyone's even asked them about this kind of activity,  and one guy in particular told me, you know,  if they ever came up and said anything to us,  we'd close down these rooms, these chat rooms,  but no one's ever mentioned it.  They don't seem to, the IRC seems to be completely,  I don't know, they get off scot-free for some reason.  Maybe just so hard to figure out who it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and the chase after it.  And so many of them are closed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you can just close one and create another one.  Right, yeah, it's very easy just to move along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like a rolling dice game, you know,  it's hard to shut down.  Here's a story that I liked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  It's industry news, it's about Yahoo doing content  by putting on a new show and then using sock puppets  as the anchorman.  Did you see this thing?  That's practically a twit right there.  That's our game plan.  We've already tried it.  We did it, we did it first.  We just don't have the sock puppets.  Sock puppets as anchors?  Well, just puppets, but they said early,  and apparently the new guy at Yahoo's media group,  he came up, ran this idea through  to add pizazz to the company's internet news  by creating a show anchored by animated puppets.  That ain't a bad idea.  Remember Anna Nova?  Why don't you just go buy the naked news  and get it over with, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anna Nova is a virtual character who does news  and actually it's not too bad.  You've seen the Anna Nova news.  No, actually I never have, I'll go look at it.  Anna Nova.  Oh, actually, no, you're right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have seen it, yeah, it's actually okay.  Yeah, it's a decent news service.  The naked news is better.  You know, that's done out of Toronto

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I actually was thinking of going over  and volunteering, but...  Are they still doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much does it cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't drop the numbers radically.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sell short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're asking me how much it costs?  David, why would I know that?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just remember we watched a sample of it  in one of the meeting rooms at Tech TV a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we're blown away by its brilliance.  Brilliant.  That was just so long ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm surprised if they're still going,  but I guess people,  I mean, they're probably still going  because people pay for it.  I thought it was free.  Leo gets it for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a little scared for free.  I have a special deal.  I have a special deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy that green-lighted the sock puppet news  is the same guy that green-lighted  Lost and Desperate Housewives at ABC.  You see, you see?  Lloyd Brown?  Yeah.  Brilliant.  Yeah, Lloyd Brown.  So maybe in mypets.com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  dog can get a job.  I have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one in the box.  One of the original ones, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have one of the original ones,  but I didn't keep it in the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think buying like 10 of them in the box  when they were selling them  because they were given away at the end down there.  It's probably a good investment.  So this is,  people remember pets.com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is the spectacular failure,  dot com failure.  They had a sock puppet spokes dog,  but they sold the sock puppet on the site.  That was their only remodeling.  That was their only remaining asset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they made a bunch of money with the sock puppet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the sock puppet made commercials  for a couple of other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did it really?  It was an insurance company

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for people who couldn't get insurance.  The tagline was,  everybody needs a second chance.  Oh, that's great.  It was the one good thing they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin's online now.  He changed his username.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  But no, he hadn't been online.  He told me he just logged on.  I told him that we were working on it  and he said,  wait, I got to get in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,  the president of Yig.de,  Kevin Rose.  Hello, can you hear me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we can hear you.  Hey, Kevin,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like that Yig site in Germany.  Nicely done.  You did a great job with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did you guys hear about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was in the news.  Yeah, that's...  I think I probably read it on Dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny because  there's actually never been any communication  from Dig to Yig at any time.  So like these ideas of them  freaking all out and saying  we're going to sue them,  I have no idea where that came from.  It was actually smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good way to get attention.  Yeah, exactly.  It worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've never even spoken with them  on our traded emails.  I would sue them actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because if you look at it,  it looks just like Dig.  You know, I understand that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin is going to sue me  for the Dvorak Uncensored blog  at dvorak.org slash dig.  I got a nasty note from him  I want to post it.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there is an open...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were talking about,  is it Pig, the open source  Dig clone software too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's clones like every other day  that are popping up all over the place.  Do you care about it?  No, the clones, you know,  not so much, but you know,  when someone takes your trademark  and uses it as a place,  you kind of...  There's actually...  Trademarks law is kind of strange  that you have to make sure that...  You have to enforce it.  You have to defend it, yeah.  Otherwise, you lose the right to  Right. Otherwise, you lose it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we figured the only reason  you're coming on, Kevin,  is because we're talking about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  I'm sorry, guys.  I wish I could have made it earlier.  How far along are you?  Are you almost done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  We ran out of stories,  so if you've got anything good  to talk about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd love to hear it.  We're talking about the sock puppet  that's going to do the news on Yahoo.  That's how bad it's gotten.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the pets.com one, is it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although, weirdly enough,  two of the commentators on this show  actually have sock puppets.  And Doug Kay,  who's also on IT Conversations,  has his in the box.  Sealed.  Is it sealed, Doug?  It is.  It's never been opened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's hysterical.  I checked eBay.  Six months ago,  I looked on eBay.  I think it was worth about $14.  Oh, that's a shame.  I guarantee it's going to be worth thousands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is, you're fighting,  you're in a race,  a race against obscurity,  because nobody's going to remember this thing  in a couple of years anyway.  There is one thing that I bought off of eBay  that I will not sell for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, it depends on what somebody offers,  but I do have a copy of Windows 1.0 Sealed.  Never been opened.  That's good.  I think I got you.  Well, I don't know if it's top,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I got something that's pretty cool, too.  What is it?  I have a sealed, unopened box of Microsoft Bob.  Oh!  Oh!  You know, but I may still have a T-shirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  up in here that matches that.  Okay, well, I got the T-shirt here.  I'll top you with this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I've got the Microsoft Bob hat,  which is the same hat that Steven Spielberg  wore when they announced DreamWorks.  He had one of those crazy-looking hats on.  No, we can put that in the box of crap, actually.  I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I left the Bob thing going, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard a rumor it's coming back in Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they're saying.  Bob is back?  No, I'm just kidding.  You missed him.  You've been wondering where he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's back.  Maybe the sock puppet can do the ads.  It'll be great.  The biggest comeback of all time.  Ken Norton could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The buy it now price for a brand new inbox,  pets.com, sock puppet plush dog,  is $14.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we are doing...  Actually, I haven't mentioned this to you guys,  but we are doing an eBay auction  to benefit EFF.  And I didn't involve you guys in it,  but it's not too late.  The auction will go up in a couple of weeks.  Remember, we were in the Superman comic.  They had the hoodlums who were stealing tea  and Superman.  Oh, that's awesome.  They have the Twit logo on it,  Hack 5 logo and Command N.  We got the Hack 5 team to autograph.  We have pristine copies sealed in plastic.  The Hack 5 guys have autographed it.  I've autographed it.  Amber and Mike from Command N have autographed it.  I'd like to actually...  I'll circulate it among you guys too.  We're going to put it on eBay to benefit EFF,  so we're hoping to raise a little bit of money.  I think we have eight numbered signed copies of that comic.  That'll be fun.  I have a copy of Lotus Jazz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one was the vaporware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it Jazz?  No, Jazz shipped.  Which was the Lotus product that never did?  Improv?  Improv shipped for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was probably their best product.  Improv was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember it was the first to do pivot tables.  It was free form.  Apparently, the reason that thing never got anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is because there was all this in-house,  kind of battling going on with these old Lotus 123 folks.  It's almost like the product at Adobe called InDesign,  which was killed because the Photoshop people didn't like it.  InDesign is now the number one page layout program in the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's...  I'm sorry, Image Styler.  I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Image Styler was great.  You turned me on to Image Styler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a great little program.  It still works.  I still used it for Quick Style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've moved a lot of it to Photoshop and Illustrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do a lot of this stuff too, but you can't do it as fast.  It did great rollovers and buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could load Image Styler

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and get a little special effect finished and saved

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before Photoshop would even finish loading the plugins.  That's the problem.  Somebody just walked out on the phone.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody just walked out on us, I think.  This is Kevin.  Makes a weird sound.  I'm here.  I got this off of dig.  Interesting.  Actually, I'm sorry.  It's from the Twit Army.  I'm talking about the dot grid on the printers,  the Xerox Docu-Color printers.  Ah, yes, to keep you from counterfeiting.  To keep you from counterfeiting.  There's a great link on EFF with all the decoding of all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny because there was a couple of kids busted recently  and they got counterfeiters.  I don't think that many people know.  If you think you're going to go out and counterfeit  using your laser printer or any of these printers,  you're making a big mistake because every one of them has a code.  It's like a serial number that's on that paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's printed on the paper.  I don't think that's such a bad idea, actually.  The EFF is all up in arms about it.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think people should be counterfeiting A and B.  Because counterfeiting is such a problem with these printers,  if they didn't do that,  you wouldn't get the right colors on these printers.  You wouldn't get them.  The reason that they went to it is because the printers  were getting able to make these great copies  that were perfectly accurate with color.  And so, if you remember about 1500 years ago or longer,  these color printers were inaccurate printers.  The government actually made a point on making these guys not...  You couldn't get that one green you need for the dollar bill.  These kids, they were like 14,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and they were printing them up in the basement  and they were washing them in the washing machine  to make them feel right.  This was a pretty good operation,  but I think it was a color laser printer.  Did they scan this stuff in?  Because most of the scanning software

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  won't let you scan in the US dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that one.  You can get around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very easy to do.  The trick is to buy the printer for cash,  do one run, and then throw it out.  That's what we do with guns when we're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never mind, I'm sorry I said that.  Such an informative show.  It's like, oh, you can just get a crack to take care of that.  Let me ask you,  how do we know that you can't scan money?  If you do it, what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We tried it on the screensavers, remember?  It gave us that error.  Photoshop gave us an error or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about a 20 or a 10?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got some Canadian money here.  This is very colorful.  I wonder if I can scan that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think I can scan that?  Yeah, but you have to scan it twice  so it's worth the same amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't quite work that joke.  I'm shrinking, which is good,  because I get paid in Canadian money.  That's why I have a stack of bills here.  Cash?  As I'm leaving, they give me a stack,  a WAD of 20s, and I go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You bring it on the plane with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does anybody care that iTunes hit a billion songs sold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they gave away 10,000 iTunes...  free money to some kid.  No, it was 10,000 gift cards to get iTunes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  five fifth generation iPods,  and a scholarship of the guy's name, a Juilliard.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A scholarship in his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought he got 10 iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he got 10 iPods,  $10,000 in songs,  and a 20-inch iMac  and a scholarship in his name, a Juilliard.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All for buying... what song did he buy?  Something by Coldplay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something off X and Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grocery stores used to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and not get as much publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one billionth, though,  that's a pretty big number.  That's got a lot of zeros after it.  Kevin, we are talking about our speculation  about the Apple announcement on Tuesday.  Do you have any speculation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have any insiders.  They're doing it on the Apple campus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I know nothing this time.  Yeah, because you picked it last time  at the keynote.  You nailed it when they announced the Nano.  Nothing, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you guys think it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a waste of time, personally.  We think it's a big video touchscreen iPod.  Although I don't know,  I think there's even money on the Mac Mini  on the Mini Media Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it was a video  at Airport Express is what I'm hoping for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think people forget that  that was something everybody wanted  as an Airport Express that not only plays music  but also allows you to distribute a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, I think you might be right.  I bet against that.  Why is that?  Movie industry?  Yeah.  Apple's usually a little bit ahead of its time,  but that's pretty far out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're talking about iTunes.  I heard a story, I think, on NPR  about some of the record labels now holding back  certain singles in order to convince people  to buy physical CDs.  That's rude.  They're freaking out about the fact that people  are just buying singles from the online stores  and they don't like it, so they're saying  hey, we're going to keep some of our best stuff out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the thing is that the reason  that this music business is so screwed up  is because they killed the singles business.  When I was a kid, we used to be able to buy singles.  They used to make 45s  until the album business started catching up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then they realized that they could sell you  an $18 CD with only one good song on it.  Yeah, the thing is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from 45s to cassette singles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and then there were CD singles for a while.  Until the Beatles  and the Rolling Stones came along,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no band could sustain a whole album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And no one since has been able to.  It's very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Frank Sinatra may want to argue with you  about sustaining an entire album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, well, that's fine.  Sinatra.  Bring in the Sinatra card.  Every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It always descends to that, doesn't it, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sinatra probably had a Mac too, right, John?  It's probably converting his Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to Windows as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any other stories top of mind?  This is kind of...  Either it was a demo...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I got a fun demo  coming up on DLTV on Tuesday.  We're going to show off the democracy player.  Have you guys seen this yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're on it.  That's our BitTorrent broadcast machine support  is from a participatory culture foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the player is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and we're supposed to be on the guide.  I don't know if that's actually happened or not.  Well, there's a big channel guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a few channels that are actually hosted.  Right there, like RocketBoom's on there.  Yeah, they said they would...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm mad at them, because they said  if you keep using our broadcast machine  and you'll be featured on the democracy player.  So it's been out for Mac for a while,  but it's now out for Windows.  It came out for Windows.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I think that there's a couple of good ones.  We've mentioned FireAnt before, which is also very good.  The problem is, do people want  yet another player on their computer?  Well, I don't think it's less the player

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than the fact that it's the player  that's built around being able to play back...  Torrents.  Video.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you know that the beaver lived amid dinosaurs?  Somebody's up on the Google News.  We are really down at the bottom of the barrel now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  While we're at it, why don't we bring up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that there's a march...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't there a probe approaching?  Oh, well, I hope Mars is ready.  When would you start playing some Mike Myers clips

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  while we're at it?  I tell you, we're in bad shape now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to kill the show.  Oh, no, don't kill it yet, please.  Hey, John, is it sure you're doing a new show on Ziff Davis?  Yeah, we haven't found out about that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that? What's now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're working on something.  What?  We're working on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're working on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Jim Lauderbach's basically recreating ZDTV over there.  No, he can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're doing that.  That's not allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got something else going on here.  What have we got going on?  Well, tonight, nothing.  Absolutely, nothing, clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Generally speaking, we've got something.  I don't know if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, you would know what's going on.  Oh, I'm not ready to talk about it.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting.  So should I just fold up the tent here and put Twit.tv to bed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually part of the deal was I can't do this thing unless I can cross-promote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is the new network called Yiff Davis to tell them that?  Yiff Davis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yiff.tv.  What a horrifying thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With English subtitles, it's all in German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yiff.  Yiff.tv.  I'm not using Yig from now on.  I'm giving it to you, Kevin.  You've got to learn German first, John.  I wonder if I can get the license for Yig here in the USA.  Yig.com is probably available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you act quickly at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's too many domain names to try and buy.  Too many.  You can't own them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's expensive after a while.  Okay, so you guys are going to go out and start a Tech TV with Yiff Davis.  You're going to let them do it again, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  Time to speak for a moment here.  Speak freely.  The Yiff Davis that you ranked on in the podcast, which was a fun interview to listen to, actually.  Did they take the obscenities out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They took...  Some of them.  The fluffer references were still in there.  I don't know about you thinking it was the obscenities.  That was part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was hoping they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, I just got the best look from my wife.  Looking at her head.  Shaking her head and looking at me.  Excuse me?  This is the Leoville Town Square podcast, which is not an official production of Leoville

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Town Square, but they asked me to be on it, so I agreed.  Let me just keep talking about the background.  They asked, why are you never on DLTV?  I said, well, I'm reluctant to be on DLTV because I don't want to...  If Patrick and I appear on a show that looks like the screensavers together, people are  going to say the screensavers are back together.  I don't think Ziff Davis has standing to be the one who does it.  I don't want them to do it again.  You want to say that they're not the same ZD?  Well, yeah, it's a vastly different crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Ziff Davis that sold ZDTV to Vulcan Ventures is like...  Not a whole lot of people from those days.  It's true.  It's totally new management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not so much that it's ZD.  It's mostly I just don't want any corporation at all.  I think we've learned our lesson having a lot of people on the show.  I think we've learned our lesson having corporate stooges run these things.  I think we should do it ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you guys choose to go that way, be my guest.  I'd like to also point out that I'm working for a couple of, and I quote, corporate stooges  who are basically like, do what you've got to do, make the content.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was very clear when I said that.  You and Jim Latterback are great and I have no trouble at all.  I would love to do that.  I think that if we're going to bring back Tech TV, we should bring back Tech TV, not somebody else.  Not Eric Hippo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually in disagreement with that.  Why do you say that, John?  Because I think Tech TV died and it's over.  I agree with that also.  I don't think you really want to...  I think what you want to do is create something new from scratch.  Which is what you're doing.  So the other stuff is just like ancillary.  Well, I mean it's what everybody's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Kevin when you're looking at what's going on in Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that it doesn't matter where we are as long as we're producing good quality content  that's free to people to download.  It's like, why not?  If we can make money, let's do it.  I disagree, Kevin.  It does matter where we are.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you be free if you're doing it for a major corporation or a network?  I would say no.  Well, it depends on what kind of constraints that you're running into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know with Patrick, you pretty much are in charge of the content.  You're in charge of that show.  Until he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anytime they wanted to change it, they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, I was never under contract at Tech TV or ZDTV.  So if they wanted to tell me to do something they wanted to do, I could quit.  And that's my option.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think if we build it ourselves, we don't have to worry about that option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what I want to say though, I get a lot of email like,  oh, are you going to try to bring this?  And I know you get this, Leo, and I know you get it, Kevin,  where it's like, oh, are you guys going to try to get this on television?  And it's like the last thing I ever want to do is want to be involved with you.  If somebody's out there and they want to take,  which I can't imagine, want to take www.dl.tv  and put it on insert name of network here  and sign us a check and say send us the tapes, great.  I'm not going to say no to that.  No, but we wouldn't be happy.  To be honest with you, we wouldn't be happy.  Well, I can't imagine any network that wouldn't want to be like the classic  like what you need is celebrities on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on the size of the check, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, and I'm, by the way,  I'm the only one who's still doing this kind of stuff on mainstream media  both for Clear Channel and for Rogers in Canada.  Ironically enough.  Ironically enough.  But my dream and my goal and my prayer is that we can own this stuff ourselves  and not have to do it, not have to work for the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right, you are working for Clear Channel, aren't you?  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like the cruel irony of this is that you're working for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but that's the only reason I can afford to do all this stuff for free.  And same for you.  I understand we all need jobs.  That's not the issue.  But what I'm hoping we're building to is creating our own jobs.  But maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe it does require a Ziff Davis or a Yahoo or an AOL or Google.  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then what are you doing?  Quit your whining.  What are you doing going to the man, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Doug K?  You're the only outsider here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If anybody knows me, they know I do as much work as I possibly can  to cross-market as much as possible.  You don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And nobody ever has owned Dvorak.  And that's really the truth of it.  But we're not in that situation.  There's always a man.  That's when I'm starting to realize that there is always a man, isn't there?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, we've got a teeny little network and some people think I'm the man  and look at me that way.  Right, there's always a man.  I love the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen the ad where the phone company executive, somebody,  the executive is...  Sticking it to myself.  Sticking it to the man and his little underling says,  but sir, aren't you the man?  Well, yes, I am.  What about Ricky Gervais getting $2 a show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is he going to get $2 a show?  Is he going to get $2 a show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was announced a couple of days ago.  But it's not in the podcast section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he going to get it?  He may get it, but what they're going to do is they're moving that over.  It's going to end up being in the audiobooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, by the way, we've always been in the position of doing this.  Audible came to us very early on and said you could sell Twitter on Audible.  Nobody would have put out a press release had we done it.  Ricky got...  Look, there were a lot of downloads when it was free of Ricky's podcast.  But the question is, OK, now start charging $6.95 for four maybe episodes.  They're not even saying how many episodes they're going to do.  I think it was four a month at $6.95.  Maybe.  They're not even guaranteeing that.  How many people are going to subscribe?  How many do they lose?  $10,000 would be OK.  $10,000 at seven bucks a pop, $70 grand a month.  No, they'll do more than that.  I think they were smart because they put the first season in the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put the first season in the podcast.  They put the first season in the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're going to be shocked.  I think that they're expecting more people to sign up.  I think the minute this stuff is paid, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you lose a lot of the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll be rushing to find out if it gets cracked, too.  The classic number is 10 to 1.  What happened when Wall Street Journal, when wsj.com started?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's different, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You pay for Wall Street Journal because you make money from getting Wall Street Journal.  I think that you can justify that.  Yeah, I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that the Wall Street Journal doesn't count in any of these comparisons.  I think that the Wall Street Journal is a good example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the Wall Street Journal doesn't count in any of these comparisons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but if anyone ever told me people would pay what they do for ringtones, I wouldn't believe that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  Good point.  The ringtone thing is a different story.  That's baffling.  I think it's right now, it's a $6 billion worldwide industry.  Baffling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we have had a standing invitation to take Twit, to put it on Audible, to sell it for whatever we wanted.  The two reasons I've said no is I don't want to put copy protection in it.  And I think that our audience doesn't want a paid version of it.  That's why we've kind of headed more towards the advertising.  I'd like to do a paid version, but I just don't think people will pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But on Audible, you can't even pay for anything on Audible without having a paid membership already.  That's what I think is the stupidest thing about Audible.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Through iTunes, you can buy anything on Audible through iTunes, can't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, because I had an Audible membership for the longest time.  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have an Audible membership.  I canceled mine.  I use it because I get two books a month.  But they're trying to get me to cancel it because I have the old program, which they sent me a note.  They sent me a free harmonica, some sort of cheap thing, and a note begging me to change my subscription,  saying, you know, we lose money on this.  We'd really be doing us a favor if you changed to a more expensive subscription.  I kid you not, I should have saved this note.  And of course, I've ignored it.  I'll edit this all out.  Chris, I always say that and I never do because I get lazy.  No, you don't.  I know you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never get anything out of it.  You guys really like to shoot the breeze there at the end.  You get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Nobody said that to me yet.  Really?  Like you're talking too much at the end?  I figure people have tuned out by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people, yeah, have hung up by now.  On this show today, I think they hung up real early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I try to put some really juicy, gossipy stuff at the end.  So keep them tuned in.  Cat's pregnant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's official now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the big story.  She put it on her blog.  Oh, she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Along with a list of products she'd be showing off.  I saw that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your blog?  CatSchwartz.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slash blog, or no.  Yeah, just go dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you have to, it's kind of a strange interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Baby gadgets and high tech parents?  Yeah.  Let's stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in a high tech baby carriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Megan still doing her jumping monkeys with the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think she kind of stopped doing that.  She's kind of busy.  Wow, she's sure got a lot of products on here.  Now, are these for sale?  What's the deal?  Does she get them for free because you put a link on there or what?  The world's first hands-free breast pump.  Hey, can we talk about something else?  Are they looking for volunteers?  We just revolted John.  I think this is the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even see that on here.  I'm looking at her home page.  There's nothing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to click the blog link, the blog thing, and then it's kind of a weird user interface.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so I really have no idea about breast pumps because I've never used one, but this looks pretty darn cool.  No, Patrick, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't read the copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's hope the pictures don't leak out again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about this?  How about this?  We all wish Kat and Keith a painless as possible safe birthing process.  Of course we wish that.  Patrick Norton Jr. coming along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy, that's coming soon.  Oh, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything you want to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Sarah gets to have a career for a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, she's not selling any of this stuff.  I'm looking at the URLs.  There's no way that there's no link to her.  Dude, they're not tracking her.  Yeah.  Which is a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about we get the John Dvorak model breast pump?  Dead silence.  No, we're just visualizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like a thousand jokes just passed through the night and I'm thinking, God, I can't say any of them.  None of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we know Leo won't edit it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has anybody heard any more about the Origami, the portable device from Microsoft?  There's like a weird site that Microsoft seems to own.  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's crazy.  You see the little device that Engadget's showing?  No.  They're saying it's a handheld and they're showing off pictures of mock-up, or not mock-up, but actually like hidden photos or something that somebody took with a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultra mobile lifestyle PC, says Engadget.  And when is Microsoft going to announce this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Soon, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A couple weeks from now or something.  Is this going to be like that idiotic watch they did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bigger than that.  Oh, the Spot Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's still around.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've met people who actually use those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I work with people who use them.  It just baffles me.  The thing is as big as a loaf of bread on your arm.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, for the kids today, that's a big style, the giant set of easy-to-hear watch.  It's bling.  Yeah, so yeah, it's a new PC category, 10 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  It's just you and me now, Doug.  Just the boys, huh?  I think we just had a major...  You had a Skype meltdown?  Skype meltdown, I guess.  I don't know what happened.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
