Transcript:  It's time for Twitter This Week in Tech.  What a great panel.  Ian Thompson, Georgia Dow, Oh Doctor, lots to talk about.  They're taking Jeff Bezos' wings away for pretty good reason, I guess.  The right to repair, the FTC says, you've got it, but would you buy a repairable laptop?  And then we're going to talk about the NSO group hacking and what companies need to do  to keep us safe.  It's all coming up next on Twitter.

Transcript:  Gosh, you know because I've been playing this new Amazon game called New World and I thought,  well it's called New World.  I should really have a character that looks like somebody from the New World in it.  So I modeled my character after you, Ian.  Deserving.

Transcript:  The comb over always an option.  Actually that Amazon game, which is in beta right now, comes out in August, got a little bit of a  furor going this week because apparently it was so high quality it was frying people's video cards.  It's recommended, I think, if you have an Nvidia GTX 3090 that you not play the game.  Hundreds of people reporting on Reddit that they're getting bricked.  I guess, I gather, the feeling is it's just overheating the cards because it's so damn  good looking. I wonder how much Amazon paid for that.

Start time: 322.34
End time: 340.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't played it, but is it that good looking to you? Does it look that great to you?  No. It doesn't.  I almost feel like this is some kind of market. What is that? I mean I've played a lot of games  and I've pushed a lot of graphics and stuff on my computer. For you to be frying out video cards,  there must be some kind of virus in this game.

Start time: 341.12
End time: 344.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know how that's Amazon.  I think it's just hype.  Outlandish.

Start time: 344.30
End time: 377.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might just be hype. Amazon put out a statement saying,  hundreds of thousands of people have played this game in closed beta. Millions of ad-hours played.  We've received a few reports of players using high performance graphics cards experiencing  hardware failure. We see no indication of widespread issues. Well, it's only a thousand  instead of a hundred thousand. I don't know. The new world closed beta is safe to play.  Darn it. In order to further reassure players, we will implement a patch today  that caps frames per second on our menu screen. So you can't turn it up too high.

End time: 386.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Usually they do have a quality thing that you can regulate, like how you want to play a game.  You're going to play it full or 1080 or something like that. The fact that they don't have that's

Start time: 386.34
End time: 400.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kind of weird. If you manage to score a 3090, hard to get card because of all the Bitcoin miners and  others, you're going to turn it all the way up, Owen. You're going to say, I want the best.

Start time: 400.72
End time: 416.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I paid for it. And you shouldn't have a problem with that card, which is why it's so outlandish  to me. I just can't even imagine that happening. But again, Samsung phones blowing up in your  pocket all day long. Everybody's phone was just exploding for some reason. I'm going to guess it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was a, it seems to be with the EVA manufactured cards and then maybe they had a batch that didn't  have, maybe the heat sinks weren't attached properly or they didn't put enough or too much  thermal paste on them, that there was some manufacturing defect. That sounds better. The  cards got overheated and it's a popular game and so forth. So, or it looks to be, I mean, it's not  out yet, but it looks to be a popular game. And as I said, I look exactly, inadvertently,

Start time: 442.54
End time: 448.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  like the old Ian Thompson in the game. So that's why I named it the Ian Thompson.

Start time: 454.08
End time: 475.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems about right. Jeff Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, launched himself into near space or  maybe space, sort of space, depending on your point of view this week in a strangely phallic  rocket ship wearing a cowboy hat. Actually, I think he took the cow. He didn't wear a spacesuit

Start time: 475.16
End time: 491.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  though. He just wore like a blue coverall. Well, that's a thing. I mean, now to become an  astronaut, you need to be able to get into a blue coverall and strap yourself into a chair,  apparently. Although thankfully the US has said you are not an astronaut unless you actually do

Start time: 491.10
End time: 529.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something useful. That's the funniest thing ever because Bezos, we talked about last week,  or maybe the week before, was I here last week? I don't think I was. Was I here? I can't remember.  I wasn't. No, it was Jason Snell. Two weeks ago we talked about it because Blue Origin had  sub-tweeted Richard Branson saying, well, he's not really going into space. And we got bigger  windows. And ironically, it turns out the FAA changed its definition of astronaut the day  Bezos went into space. So he's going to get honorary astronaut wings.

Start time: 531.74
End time: 538.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Which is ridiculous. He didn't get any wings. He got to go into space. Pay your taxes.

Start time: 538.58
End time: 549.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, pay your taxes. He had the bad taste. Upper atmosphere. What do you think? Was this bad taste  or not? At the end in the press conference, he thanked Amazon customers and employees

Start time: 550.00
End time: 610.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for making this possible. Let me answer that question first. Let me answer that question real  quick. Is that tasteless? First and foremost, you have a government contract to pay for most  of your ship. Secondly, you don't let your employees go to the bathroom. Thirdly, half my stuff  gets canceled. It doesn't come in two days, which I'm paying prime for anymore anyway. Now I get  stuff in a week, three weeks, four days, and you still charge me the same amount. And thirdly,  besides the fact you don't let people unionize, have a regular living wage, you are one of the  most worst people on the planet. You wore a cowboy hat. You're basically a space monkey. You're in  the upper atmosphere. You're not an astronaut. You're not a pilot. You are a loser that got  shot in the space. And then you come back down here and say, I'm going to give a hundred million  dollars to Van Jones to do whatever he wants. How about you give all your employees a bonus? How  about you let them go to the bathroom with a 15 minute break that actually means when you go there,  you get 15 minutes to go to the bathroom and come back. How about you not fire people for sitting  there being tired, sitting on their feet for 12 hours straight and have such a turnover rate so

Start time: 610.40
End time: 613.78

Start time: 613.80
End time: 618.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, he thanked him. At least he thanked him. He acknowledged that they worked hard for him.

Start time: 620.00
End time: 633.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But the real thank you is money, right? Like paying them a living wage would be a real thank  you. I don't know why did he give Van Jones a hundred million dollars? What's up with that?  That's charity. He's doing fine for himself. He gave Van Jones and Jose Andres

Start time: 635.56
End time: 651.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a hundred million each. Let me give a black guy a hundred million dollars and make it okay.  He gave $10 billion to the rainforest. We don't even know what he's doing to the rainforest.  You're burning. You want to take rich people up into the upper atmosphere, destroying more of the

Start time: 656.64
End time: 669.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the things the subtweets said. The Blue Origin spacecraft is environmentally better than the  Branson because it doesn't pollute. It's burning hydrogen or something. The entire thing of making,

Start time: 670.06
End time: 677.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  let's not pretend that going into space is a net zero from the environment. They had to make it

Start time: 677.00
End time: 692.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and all the technology. That's why he doesn't get official astronaut wings because you can't  just be a payload. You have to actually do something to improve public safety, do some science,  fly the thing. Do you have to do something? Maybe go through astronaut training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To become an astronaut, you've got to master two or three very highly skilled jobs, pilot,  engineer, medic, scientist, the rest of it. You've probably got to learn two or three languages as  well. Someone just paying a quarter of a million just to pop up into near space and then drop down,  that's not an astronaut any more than if I buy time on a track, I call myself a racing driver.

Start time: 722.94
End time: 738.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, that's the more legitimate concern is that both of these guys,  I think the point of this is really to create a commercial business,  sending people up after the same way they did. Yes, I think $250,000 is the going price,

Start time: 739.92
End time: 749.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at least on the brand side. It says a lot about the way that wealth is accumulated in society,  that people can just throw away a quarter of a million. It's as close to burning money as you

Start time: 749.94
End time: 755.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  get. It's literally burning money. It's almost literally. Well, they're burning hydrogen, but

Start time: 755.74
End time: 797.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  almost, very close. You, Uncle Leo, as a world traveler, you've worked really hard and you are  getting old, so you're traveling more. But I remember five or six years ago, it was a great  article that just blew up like wildfire. The new wealth showing is traveling and experiences,  and going to get a restaurant in Salt Bay and seeing Mount Peachtree with a flower that was  18,000 years old by this village people. So now they're like, shoot, we didn't win everywhere  on the planet. I got a mega yacht. Oh, let's shoot people into the upper atmosphere and charge them  a quarter billion dollars to go float around, which technically you can get on a plane. They  do that stuff where you float around on a plane for a little bit. Go do that. Stop trying to get

Start time: 797.64
End time: 801.48

Start time: 801.58
End time: 806.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  dollar boat as well? A yacht? I hadn't heard about the boat. What's this?

Start time: 808.28
End time: 822.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, he's got the money. It's a 417 foot super yacht worth an estimated half billion.  It's so big it has its own support yacht. Half a billion dollars? It just seems like we have

Start time: 823.46
End time: 869.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  people that are starving to death. It just seems so tone deaf. We really have to start to rethink  the way that we think about our society. Yes, we're hardwired to just want more because it  used to be that there wasn't enough and we weren't going to be able to gather everything. But now it  just seems like some people want to take everything. I'm happy that people are angry  about billionaires existing. I'm done with it. If you're not going to be actually trying to make  the world a better place, what kind of mark are you really leaving on it? It shouldn't be a jerk.  Should we not allow billionaires? We should tax them. You should at least be paying the taxes.  We should get rid of the loopholes and then see what the hell happens when they're actually paying  for what they should be, their fair share. Let's be honest, they're not contributing to society.

Start time: 869.30
End time: 878.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not like there's no incentive to succeed if you could just be a hundred millionaire.  That's a good goal. But it's more money than you know.  What do you need a thousand million dollars for?

Start time: 879.84
End time: 932.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You deserve to make as much money as you make as long as you're paying your employees a livable  wage, as long as you're paying taxes to actually get back to society. Again, you give fake $10  billion to the Amazon. Zuckerberg gave $100 million to Newark, New Jersey, basically just a  little campaign fund for Cory Booker, which did absolutely nothing for Newark. Some of the kids  got some new books. It was in stock. So the value went down after the promotion. So these are all  the scams that they do. Don't give anyone anything. Pay your taxes. Then we can put pressure on the  government to actually pay for the things that society needs instead of saying, oh, we can't  afford social services. We can't afford helping people out with more housing because people are  skirting the money and you're doing what with it? You're shooting yourself in the atmosphere and  you're about a half a billion dollar boat, which I say Bezos, you could do better because I just  Googled it. There's a lot of boats bigger and better than your half a billion dollar boat.

Transcript:  Should be doing something nice. There was a good piece by Abigail Disney, who is very, very wealthy.  The daughter of Roy Disney, Walt Disney's brother, they both. She's a very interesting character.  Yes, she is because she says, I was taught from a young age to protect my dynastic wealth.  And what she says in it is that the very wealthy and maybe it is even almost the  religion of the United States have this notion that it's better to keep our money than give it  to the government. We'll do better with our money than the government would do with it.  And that's kind of the justification for completely legally paying as little tax as possible  because we want to keep as protect your dynastic wealth. She says that the lawyers call it the  corpus. You always want to protect the corpus because again, you think it's better in your  hands than it would be in the government. And I bet you there's a lot of people listening who  think that's a good thing. But I have to say, no matter how much philanthropy very rich people do,  it is dwarfed by the amount of money government spends to feed kids, to house the homeless,  to do all the things government does. It spends a lot more money on those good works than  any philanthropist or all philanthropists. I have to say, as the token Brit here,

Start time: 1013.10
End time: 1030.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  aristocracy really doesn't work. America should know this. There's a reason why America won.  Just having dynastic wealth, it's not good for competition. It's not good for innovation.  It's, you know, you need a fairer spread and raise everyone up.

Start time: 1031.38
End time: 1067.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually kind of a great confession. She says, there's another reason for my inaction.  I'm deeply ashamed to say what it was, but here goes. Having money, a lot of money is very,  very nice. It's damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. She says,  once you fly first class, you never want to fly economy again. Once you fly in a private jet,  you never want to fly commercial again. She says the dynamics of wealth is similar to the  dynamics of addiction. The more you have, the more you need. I can understand it. I flew first class

Start time: 1068.00
End time: 1072.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1077.18
End time: 1113.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but at least the UK has some standards. Yeah, you know, I mean, I got upgraded to first on a  flight back from New York and you get the mattress on the full lie down bed and a pair of pajamas  and a fried breakfast when you wake up and 18 year old single mots scotch to go to bed with.  I can understand it. And I know somebody who's flown on one of the Google corporate jets and  it's fantastic. You fly into Paris, you don't have to go through the terminal. The customs officer  comes to you, you get into a car and you go away. I'm sure it's tremendously seductive, but it means  that, you know, in Bezos' case, people are having to pee in bottles just to keep their jobs.

Start time: 1113.54
End time: 1139.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's her, here's her final paragraph. If your comfort requires that society be structured so  that a decent percentage of your fellow citizens live in a constant state of terror about whether  they'll get healthcare in an emergency or whether they can keep a roof over their family's heads  or whether they will simply have enough to eat, perhaps the problem does not rest with those people  but with you and what you think of as necessary, proper and accessible.

Start time: 1139.56
End time: 1197.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think it's a cultural problem, right? Like I think that our culture needs to change what we  idolize, what we put into the media. It shouldn't be Jeff Bezos flying in a rocket doing absolutely  nothing but wasting money, but the people that are actually trying to change the world.  He should be ashamed. Like really that should be a shameful thing that he spent that much money to do  that little for that much press versus people that are actually trying to save people's lives  and feed the hungry. They're not the ones that we idolize. They're not the ones that children do  their, you know, their presentation on who's the person that you look up to. And I think that our  culture has done that through the media, through the shows that we watch, through everyone trying to  gather as much crap as they can. And that that means that you've won in this, like you don't get  to take it with you, but you could make a mark on the world to actually make a better place for it.  And I think that we need to fully relook at what we teach our children as what is important.

Transcript:  Agreed. Yeah, I think capitalism is the religion of not only this country, but in a way the Western  world and it's, you know, you see it even in China. I love capitalism. Pay your taxes.

Start time: 1209.76
End time: 1225.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't care what you said. It's agreed. It's not capitalism that's the problem. It's what it stands  for. If you were using your money to be able to make this world a better place and you actually  were conscious of your effect upon it and didn't act like you're greater than thou because of it,

Start time: 1225.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it might be a different situation. Is this related to the conversation which has also been going on  and is about to come to a head because the White House has now appointed a significant number of  anti-trust regulators who are against big tech? Is this related to the issues we have with big  tech and the calls to break up big tech? Is it similar or is it a different issue entirely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got to say as the foreigner over here, it is astonishing to me that America has basically  legalized bribery and called it lobbying. So what we're going to see over the next couple of years  is yes, there are a bunch of anti-trust people being appointed by the government and big tech  is massively ramping up its lobbying spending as well. So we're going to see a lot of money  going into politicians' pockets and I suspect not much action but we shall see.

Transcript:  Amazing article in Motherboard on a report that finds big telecom spends $320,000 lobbying Congress  every day. The last Congress telecom companies, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, spent $234 million lobbying  the 116th Congress. That's almost $320,000 today. Comcast, the biggest spender, $43 million,  AT&T, $36 million. Common Cause and Communication Workers of America issued a joint study. They  said the powerful ISP lobby will seemingly spend whatever it takes to keep politicians  beholden to them and maintain a status quo that leaves too many Americans on the wrong side of

The top targets, last Congress,  save the Internet Act, which would have restored net neutrality. The FCC Consumer Protection  Authority stripped away during the Trump administration. Telecom lobbies fought against  the Accessible Affordable Internet for All Act. They derailed the Resilient Networks Act, which was  an attempt to shore up Puerto Rico's network after the outages from Irma and Maria.  83 million Americans live under a broadband monopoly. One company provides broadband in your  region. Millions more live under a duopoly. And the result is obvious. Spotty access rates,  car and body, slow speeds, high prices and generally terrible customer service.

You  don't raise money, you don't take lobbying money, but that's never going to happen because the  people who write the rules are the ones getting the money.

Like before,  everyone was against Microsoft because Microsoft literally was running the world. So that was kind  of a thing where they were like, we got to do something here. But now when you have something  like Facebook, they're just going out, oh, this is good. All right.

This is a, this is a really, this is a sponsor we've had for a very,  very long time. I've really been a fan of theirs. You know, we, you hear all the news about,  you know, diamond hands and stonks and holding your AMC or whole, you know, buying games,  stopping. I have to say, I know that's fun. It's exciting, but the day traders I know, a lot of  them will say, I made a lot of money. And then they shut up because then the next day they lost a lot  of money. And the net is it ain't all going that well, but it is kind of incumbent on any of us to  take care of ourselves in our old age to save up. Maybe you want to buy a house, get married,  send your kids to college. And I would strongly suggest you not get seduced by the dreams of  great riches with your diamond hands, but instead growing your long-term wealth with a wealth front  investment account. Decades of data show investors that trade individual stocks,  any individual stock, not just any individual stock underperform the market every year. In fact,  only the real fact is 1% of day traders beat the market. I know. And everybody says, well,  I'm going to be in that 1%. You're not. The odds are not in your favor, especially if you're doing  it alone. Team up with Wealthfront. Wealthfront makes it easy. You don't have to spend every waking  hour checking the indexes.

Transcript:  article in the Wired. The FTC votes unanimously to enforce right to repair, and I started celebrating  woohoo, yaha. The move follows an executive order issued last week by the White House,  urging the agency to secure consumers' rights to fix their own gadgets. But then as I continue to  read, I found out the FTC really doesn't have a lot to do with any of this. It's nice. It's good.  It's great that the government is behind this, even though Apple, John Deere, and others have  been fighting it state by state. The FTC issued a lengthy report last May that blasted manufacturers  for restricting repairs. They voted five to nothing to enforce the Magnus and Moss Warranty Act.  Of course, the new chair at the FCC is one of those people President Biden appointed that is

But they did point out in the statement that they've only  taken one action on this in the last decade, and that was someone who was auto-enrolling people  for extended warranties. There's a big hill to climb between that and Apple suing third-party  repair shops and the rest of it. Repair absolutely needs to be done, but the FTC statement was a bit

Transcript:  weak source, I thought. This is what happens when you have lobbyists that lobby for your right,  because Apple puts on this huge front about we care about the economy. That's why we're not  giving you headphones anymore. The package is slimmer, we're wasting less cardboard, but you  won't allow people, one, to make a living in a business, two, to recycle your phones and keep  them alive longer, still keeping it an ecosystem. It's not like they take iPhones and turn them into  Androids. They're prolonging your product, but Apple's real device thing is drop it on the ground,  break it with my Gorilla Glass, go buy a new one tomorrow, and only we can refurbish it. And we  really don't even sell the refurbished to people. We pack them up and send them overseas when we get  bundles of them. So it's such a scam because that company specifically acts like they care about  renewing and renewal and the environment and all that stuff, but they don't. They just don't.

Of course, he underestimated the  the hacker mentality. It's easy to get a Torx screwdriver these days or a pentalobe or whatever  they're using. Kyle Weins testifying in front of the Productivity Commission this week brought up  some really strong examples. He says, we've seen manufacturers restrict Kyle Weins is the CEO of  iFixit, I should mention, one-time sponsor, actually off-time sponsor on our shows. But I love iFixit.  I've actually purchased their iFixit kits. I bought a battery kit for my iPhone, my  Pixel X4 XL, which was battery-swollen. 39 bucks, had a replacement battery, all the tools,  took it apart, put a new battery, it worked. I'm like, wow, I'm pretty handy.

My ThinkPad was showing up a non-detective  battery and it was like, do I send my main computer into IBM for two weeks or do I take  the back off it, reset the battery and see how that works? So of course we need to repair this stuff.

Start time: 1983.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Kyle's even fairly conservative. He's not even saying, because his company basically  sells parts, manuals and tools. That's their business so that you can fix your own stuff.  He says, look, if something's gone out of warranty, we should be at least be able to buy the parts  to fix that, right? He says, we've seen manufacturers as a quote, restrict our ability  to buy parts. There's a German manufacturer of batteries called Varta. They sell batteries to a  wide variety of companies. Samsung happens to use these batteries in their Galaxy earbuds. But when  we go to Varta and say, we want to buy that battery as a repair part, they say, no,  our contract with Samsung will not allow us to sell that. He says, Apple is notorious for  doing this with chips in their computers. There's a particular charging chip on the MacBook Pro.  There's a standard version of the part. And then there's the quote, Apple version of the part that  sits very slightly tweaked, but it's tweaked enough that it's only required to work in this  computer. And that company is again under contractual requirement with Apple. It gets even worse.  There was a company in California, a California based recycler, that Apple required to recycle  spare parts that were still in new condition. This is the quote, California Apple stops providing  service after seven years. So this was at seven years and Apple has warehouses full of spare parts,  never used brand new, rather than selling them out on the marketplace. So like someone like me,  says Kyle, who eagerly would have bought them, they were paying the recycler to destroy them.  Now Apple can say, oh, it's for safety. It's for quality. But if something's out of warranty by  seven, because it's seven years old, and you have lots of old parts that you're never going to use,  why wouldn't you sell them to iFix so they can sell them on to customers to fix their stuff?  I don't understand it.

Transcript:  Get a new phone. Exactly. Exactly. What I love though, is that the way that things change is that  if the culture starts to shift towards that we believe we have the right to fix things,  then the government will slowly shift because they want to be able to be reelected to,  we're going to make sure that people can fix things. Again, if they can make money and they can  do this as slowly as possible through lobbying, they completely will. And that's why lobbying  really should not be allowed, especially with the amounts of money that they're able to donate.  But we are starting to say, you know what, this is mine. I own it. Why would you stop me from being  able to open it up and not be able to repair it? It's ridiculous. And that wastefulness, we're also  starting to become distasteful before it was just throw everything out and get something new. And  now we're like, oh wait, it doesn't disappear into nowhere. It actually ends up somewhere that  we're going to have to deal with it again. Like we're all on, we're stuck on this lump of rock  floating through space.

So  you plug it in and it's a puck as well as a battery. So maybe that's cheaper. There's  third party apps that are cheaper. Oh, anchor makes one. It's a little thicker. Yeah. There's

Transcript:  one's going to buy it, but this is an attempt. It's called Framework, the Framework laptop,  frame.work. So this, the whole idea is this is a laptop that is modular, completely parts replaceable  from the keyboard to the, to everything. It's all accessible. It comes with a kit of modules. You  can customize. Now I have to say some of these modules are probably proprietary like that  keyboard. So, you know, that's not as good as like if we're a generic keyboard, it looks like a pretty  nice thin and light laptop. So you notice on the ports, the outlines show you can take them out.  And so you can build it any old way you want it. And yet I'm not tempted. I don't, I don't know,  should I get it? Should I run out and get this? It's kind of like the Google phone that they were

This is where that would  come into play or your headphone jack doesn't work. That's where this comes into play. You don't swap  things out or upgrade because the product works until it dies completely. But everybody's been in  a situation where the J key does not work and I'm like, it's on a laptop. How do I fix it? I take  it off and replace it with a laptop. That's where that comes into having a great value. And yes,  you should buy it and review it for the show and do your job, Uncle Leo, because that's part of your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  No one knows what we're talking about.  Our show today. Actually, here's a technology I really love. In fact, I used it for a long time  when it was PillPak. Amazon bought PillPak and now they have created Amazon Pharmacy.  This is the best pharmacy ever. I mean, first of all, I think we all learned, thanks to COVID,  it's better to have it mailed to you. It's better not to go somewhere and wait in line  for something when you can get it in a day or two. In fact, if you're Amazon Prime,  you can get it in second day like that. It's just easier. Amazon Pharmacy saves you time.  They easily work with your doctor and they deliver medication and always, by the way,  the right medication to your door. You can get the meds you need. You don't have to leave the house.  One less errand and by the way, more safety, more accuracy for you. Amazon Pharmacy is freaking  amazing. It'll save you time delivering to your door. No more waiting in line at the pharmacy.  You can choose between 30 and 90 day supplies. I love that. I hate it when they send me five  pills. No, give me a month's worth. If you're a Prime member, you can get six months worth  of prescription medication. How about that? It's also easy. You can have your doctor's office,  send your next prescription right to Amazon Pharmacy and then they coordinate with your doctor.  I think it's a good thing to ensure that everything's accurate and you're getting what you need.  In the old days with the doctor's handwriting on a script, you wouldn't know what the hell you were  getting. Amazon, make sure you're getting the right thing. That's one of the things that pill pack  technology does, which is really great. They have very smart technology that identifies every pill  as they put it in the package. Make sure you've got exactly the right dose, the right pill,  everything. You can use your insurance. Amazon Pharmacy works with almost every insurance plan  nationwide. Plus, if you're an Amazon Prime member, and I love this, most pharmacies do not do this,  they'll give you up pricing. They'll show you what it would cost with your insurance co-pay  or your price without insurance. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you get discounts when you're  buying without insurance and free two-day delivery. Prime members often get meds for as low  as a dollar a month, even if you're paying without insurance. That's really nice. That's really cool.  Your medical information is always, of course, protected. You don't have to worry about privacy.  They keep it inside the pharmacy. They never share your personal health data outside of their  pharmacy to anywhere, including within Amazon. You can always speak with a pharmacist. They have  pharmacists on staff 24-7. If you've got questions or need advice, that's a pharmacy that's there  whenever you need it. The pricing is so clear. I think it's great that you know up front  before you pay a penny what it'll cost, and you can even do the comparison.  Amazon Prime members can save on prescription medication when not using insurance. With  medication as low as a dollar a month plus free two-day delivery, you want to know more?  Amazon.com slash twit rx. Amazon.com slash twit rx. This is really the easy way to get the  medications you need. I always say pills, but it could be other things as well, obviously.  Amazon.com slash twit rx. Thank you, Amazon, for your support of this week in tech.  All right. This is personal. This is just personal. I'm going to say it's just me.  No one else will care about this. Maybe, Georgia, you listen to a podcast called  Call Her Daddy. You ever hear of that? No, I haven't. Alex Cross, you ever hear of her?  Big news. She was at Barstool, started the podcast in 2018. That was what? Three years ago, right?  Pretty much. I haven't moved from this chair since 2005, but three years she's been doing this.  She's a big influencer on Instagram, 2.2 million followers, very well known. I asked you, Georgia,  because I think it's a female slanted podcast, but I think it's also for 18 to 25-year-old women.  It's not for older women. I listened to it. She just got a deal with Amazon. They stole her away  from Barstool Sports. One podcast a week, $20 million a year for three years.  $20 million a year for three years. Wow. Good Lord.  Now, it is a Spotify exclusive, and I guess it makes sense for Spotify because you have to use  the app. If they're selling ads, they're going to be able to give the advertiser a lot more  information. If you're a subscriber, they make money from you that way. Maybe they think they're  going to make that much. I thought, wow, this must be an amazing podcast. I thought I'd listen  to it. It's very much like the old days of podcasts where it's a guy just talking or gal  just talking, and she swears every third word. Worse than a wanker. She's funny. She's got a  great personality. At first, I was like, how come I didn't get that? But then I realized, first of  all, for a lot of reasons. But what she's done that I think is really great is not only good for  podcasting, it's good for just the notion of a person, a normal person talking into a microphone  and connecting with the audience. She really does. It really connects with the audience. It's very  clear. But it is a big news story because according to the Wall Street Journal, she signed a deal that's  bigger than pretty much any baseball player, basketball player, Formula One driver.

Transcript:  So she, again, great for her. I never begrudge anybody making a bunch of money,  but she also had bar stools to amplify her voice. My daughter's listening to that podcast.  And the one time I heard it, I was like, what is that? Because she listens to podcasts and goes  to sleep. I asked her about the show. She's like, I don't even know. I just listen to people talk.  And she usually listens to female podcasts or so. They're just getting free views off of her  because she passes out after 15 minutes listening to it. But she had a baked in ramp up help audience.  And that's to say she's not good or great or whatever, but bar stools is pretty large.  And that voice that she's got, hopefully it's worth the money they paid her because that's a  lot of money. And either way, good for her. Get that check. CTC, cut the check.

Start time: 3823.66
End time: 3845.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And by the way, I think the problem was that barstool did not, I think I remember that  barstool offered her a half million a year and she said no, and she worked out her one year contract  and then shopped herself. And she's got a big Hollywood agent. I think IAC or something like  that. And obviously it worked. Spotify is really trying to own the podcast market.

You've got to give me Loki and the bad batch something every week or every series to keep  it going. So I have something new to go back to. Because after you go watch the initial things  that are nostalgic to you, or unless you have a kid watching frozen 92 times a day, there's no  value unless you're putting new things on there. So that's what Spotify is trying to do. They're  trying to catch lightning in a bottle and put more shows and products on there to keep people

The only thing, and I said good for  podcasting, it's good for podcasting in the sense that it really shows it's a real business,  but it's bad in a way for podcasting. It makes it harder for non-aligned podcast  podcasters like me because it's hard to sell to advertisers who say, yeah, but with Spotify,  we get all the information.

And she was like, she's like,  no, I listen to podcasts. This is one of the things I listen to to go to sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, I, I don't know, I, you know, of course, after I heard this, I started to question my  choices, but I, I think that I was so influenced by old media that I basically made twit kind of a  old media style TV slash radio network. Right. And, and the shows are focused on content and,  you know, the host or X have expertise and that kind of thing. And there was at the same time we  started in 2004, there were plenty of podcasts that were just people talking. And you're right,  a lot of those went by the wayside, but what was happening, I think what has happened is that it's  the rise of celebrity podcasting and the rise of big companies. And I think soon podcasting will  be dominated by three companies. I heart media, the big radio broadcaster, which is big in a  podcasting, Spotify and Apple, which is already starting to make a play. They launched a spot cast  subscription spot. Did I say spot cast a podcast subscription feature? And I think ultimately  they're going to start producing podcasts and they will even sign podcasters because it's a  kind of content. It's just, you know, why not? It's like Apple TV plus Apple podcast plus.  So I feel like that's, it's, it's almost the professionalizing of podcasting  in a way. It's the commercializing of podcasting.

Transcript:  but I think it also shows how, you know, after the pandemic, a lot of people wanted to have that  company. They were alone. They were stuck inside. And so a podcast was that company while you did  other things to keep your mind busy so that you wouldn't overspend on stuff. That's going to make  you feel really stressed out. And so I think that a lot of podcasts got some really big push  during that period of time. I have a lot of people that listen to podcasts before they go to sleep,  but also when they're doing everything else, they're doing their taxes and stressing out,  they want to listen to something, not watch something where they have to pay attention,  just to kind of have that company through the day of some warm, happy, fuzzy, or entertaining voice  to be able to take their mind off of that. The sky is literally falling.

And they were offered 2000 euros a month  just to read out these stats. And they called them out on it. But unfortunately, some people  actually did spread this stuff around. At least, Leo, you have some editorial control and quality

Transcript:  checking. Well, and the other, actually, I like podcasts. There's a whole separate kind of almost  parallel trek with YouTube videos and YouTube video stars. I mean, look at Georgia Dow, right?  That's what you're doing. It's different in some ways, though. The coverage, the tech reporting,  the reviews, they're very much more personality driven, maybe because it's video.  I don't know. Is that podcasting? No, or something separate?

Start time: 4205.10
End time: 4261.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to me, it's the same thing. If I'm watching this show, per se, like we're on video right now,  most people listen to it. When I'm on YouTube, like I watched recently like five or six of Georgia  shows, I know what she looks like. I know what the content is. And she's I can just walk away from it  and not have to look at it. I can listen to it and get the information. Now, am I podcasting? I mean,  I don't really I'll tell you right now, I make podcasts, I don't listen to podcasts at all.  If it's on video, though, I like checking in, seeing what's going on, and then I listen to it.  So I'm more of a visual person. So it's kind of the same thing. They're talking and they're running  their mouth. And more so now people are doing podcasts on YouTube, because they know that  there's an audience for that that only want audio. But they're doing the docu series thing where you  record it on video anyway, and you get two pieces of the pie. So you know, it's it all depends on  what people want. You got to give it to them everywhere. Leo, you got to be out here twitching

Start time: 4261.56
End time: 4432.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and tick tock and chatting. And that was what I would tell people and it was always my philosophy.  And it's why we do video people thought it was crazy, because it's a lot more complicated and  expensive and difficult. But I thought, well, you should give it to them in any format they  wherever they are, you should give it to them. Yeah, they are and however they want.  Okay, the value of an ampersand. Google, yes, Google. So actually, this happened to Jeff  Jarvis. Last week, Google pushed out an update to Chrome OS. Hit Jeff Jarvis is Chromebook,  he couldn't log in. He thought, did I do something stupid? Did I forget my password?  I don't understand what happened. It turned out Google pushed out a bad update 91.0.4472.165.  And it had typo. Now they didn't the Google has never revealed this. But thanks to some  sleuth work by Android police, and a Redditor named elitist ferret. I think we found out  what happened. They put out a new build version 1.167, which fixes the issue. But until they fixed  it, people either couldn't get into their Chromebook or would have to power wash it and start all over.  And if you had something on the hard drive, that would be bad news. Or you'd done a lot of setup  with Linux or something that'd be bad news. So here's the here's the bug. Wow. And this will  make sense to you if you have done any programming. In most programming languages, including C++,  which is what Chrome OS is written in the and statement, the logical and is written with two  ampersands ampersand ampersand. So if you, you know, if you want to say, if the if the password is in  the password database, and the user is logged in or not logged in, then log him in, something like  that, they left out one of the ampersands. So instead of two, it was just one, which is not  a it's not a legal C++ statement. But C++ is, unfortunately, not exactly the safest language  in the world. And it compiled just fine. And it ran just fine. But it had the upshot that  you never got to the second statement. It was always the first statement, there it is,  that's hard to read, it's a little blurry. Because of that one missing ampersand. So if key data has  value and the key data label is empty, then return key data label, you never got to that second part.  So it never executed. So you were never able to log in. Now, the real question is, how the hell  did this get through three testing channels, Canary, Devon, Beta? The whole time I'm talking

Same sort of thing you see though, with Microsoft  patches in that they will push out patches to consumers first, and then to offices later,  commercial licensees later, because we are their testbed. And yeah, in Google's case,  it was a bit unfortunate. But unless you turned your Chromebook off and turned it back on again,

Start time: 4495.18
End time: 4534.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it wasn't a massive issue at first. I think that's maybe why it didn't get it went undetected  because the testers maybe we're all logging in some other way or never turned their Chromebook  off. Or Yeah, I think it must have gone in at the last minute. And as a Reddit comment,  suggested any if you read it through a linter, which is kind of a standard process with programs  to check for typos, it would have found it immediately. I don't it's amazing that this  got through. It's amazing that this got through. And I don't know. Sorry. Well, you know, it shows

Or is I mean, this is, it's this kind  of thing that people who say we shouldn't be doing all this cloud stuff, we shouldn't be moving to  the cloud. This is a perfect example. Why it's a terrible idea. Is that is that the takeaway from  this is that's a terrible idea. The takeaway is don't force updates. That's the takeaway. That's,

Transcript:  At one point, there were competitors to YouTube. They've all given up by now. But there was a  company called VidMe founded in 2014. It only lasted a few years. It was shuttered in 2017.  But a number of big sites used VidMe for embedded video on their site.  VidMe, when it went out of business, lost the domain. The domain was purchased by Five Star  Porn HD and they started putting porn on the Huffington Post, New York Magazine,  the Washington Post. These are old articles. I doubt a lot of people saw them. You'd have to be  looking for pretty old stuff. Articles that were from 2014 to 2017. I like this though. Vice  founded a New York Magazine article about House Majority Leader John Boehner's creepy kissy face.  Instead of a video of the creepy kissy face, there's a Five Star HD porn video.  Here's one on the Huff Post. Farmer Bro Martin Shkreli, remember him? He says he's been permanently  banned from Twitter. There you go. I don't know why he was banned.  I think he's in jail now. I'm not sure. I hope so.  These things happen. I'm sure the problem is it's the kind of thing you wouldn't notice necessarily  right away unless you're looking at old news stories. Thank goodness for Twitter though because  I'm sure somebody tweeted it and brought it to the attention of the respective parties.

Start time: 5612.60
End time: 5646.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  letting that go. It's very, we discussed this before. There's so many things that  Twitter could be doing that they just, they're almost like Google anymore. They keep dabbling  and doing things and then taking it away. Like they have the tip service where people could,  instead of using Patreon or something like that, you could use it through Twitter. Only certain  people got it. Then nobody has it. Then they took it away. Now they're not going to be doing  fleets anymore, which I never did. Yeah. They killed fleets. That was around for a minute,  a hot minute. Yeah. So I mean, I guess they're like Google right now. They're just throwing  things at the wall and if it doesn't do really well, they take it down quickly. They won't just

Transcript:  let it stay. We played on Thursday, we played with the new tweet deck, which frankly I don't  like very much. Fortunately, I don't think I have it still, but there's a way to turn it on manually.  I really like to, I do use tweet deck because that does have a minimal scheduling features. Oh,  I think I, I do have the new tweet deck preview. Oh boy. I used to use tweet deck. I used to love

Start time: 5668.74
End time: 5679.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tweet deck. Yeah. But the only thing is it used to be great. Yeah. Well, it just allows me to do  Facebook and all that kind of stuff and other applications as well. I'm hoping that they're

Start time: 5679.42
End time: 5721.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to, that this is a sign that they're, they're going to kind of start putting money back into  tweet deck. This is the new tweet deck. It's a preview and you can actually exit it, but they,  you have now a lot, a lot more capability to change the width of the columns. There's a new  explore column, which is actually recommending a good recommendation for me. Oh, there you go.  Yeah. Here's a bunch of Linux stuff. That's just recommending. I guess it knows me.  Tweet, Twitter, you know me open source. So this is just a, I do, that's interesting. These are  columns you can add. See scheduled tweets. This is what you use, but you want to do it on all the

Start time: 5721.84
End time: 5759.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  social platforms. Yeah. Yeah. That's just cause again, I do stuff for other brands and companies  like that. So Facebook pages and website, it's just everything all in one. And they have to set  this like that. So yes, yes. And I can see it all in one place and it works well with my phone.  I'm not going to give them a commercial. They charge me more money. Why am I left for motion?  I don't even know if it works anymore. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going  on. Yeah. The service used to be amazing. Now they're charging people money. Who does that?  How do you survive? Capitalism is evil. You know, unless I'm getting a discount, which case

Start time: 5760.12
End time: 5779.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Viva La Capitalism. Twitter says, and this is kind of disappointing that they have a  kind of surprisingly low two factor authentication adoption. Oh, this is really gutting.  What would you, what would, okay, I won't show the number. I mean, they're saying basically that

Start time: 5779.68
End time: 5806.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the number of people in the last six months who are using two foot factor authentication has grown  9.1%. Oh, that's good. Right. But the total number of people using it is 2.3% of users.  And Google's got the same problem. I was down at an Enigma conference a couple of years ago  and they were saying they've had two factor authentication for years. Only 10% of people  are using it. And even then when people are using it, they're using it with SMS, which is the worst

Start time: 5806.76
End time: 5837.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  possible way. Well, that's another thing Twitter said of the 2.3% of all users who use two factor,  80% used SMS. Yeah. 30% used an authenticator app and only 0.5%. So that's 0.5% of 2.3%.  So it's like me. So use a couple of mates, use a YubiKey or some sort of a security key,  which is clearly the best way to do it. Do you know, do you know why uncle Leo,

Start time: 5837.64
End time: 5878.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you the general regular human being reason of why. Why I have 232 Twitter accounts  and every other week when I try to log into something, they tell me, oh, you've got to  update your email. You've got to check your thing. I don't have time to authenticate my thing. Okay.  I've got a Russian troll factory. Are you fancy bear? Is that you? I'm I heart moms on there.  I'm Negro diamonds. Like don't ask me what I am doing out here on the internet. I'm just saying  that I have too many. I don't have time. And same thing with Gmail. People open up 14  Gmail's just to give free stuff. I don't have time to second authenticate. And sometimes I

Start time: 5878.72
End time: 5887.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  forget what number or other emails to back up. But I think you're unusual. Aren't you?  I am, but we're just lazy Americans. Twitter pushes people out all the time when they have

Start time: 5888.16
End time: 5904.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one account. It's just too much. I don't have, who am I? I, you know what? Come and get me. Okay.  I'm not an astronaut in the upper atmosphere that I need to lock up my life. Okay. From the people  on Twitter. All right. I just need my stuff to work when I'm there. I don't have time for this.

Start time: 5905.28
End time: 5938.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No time. Well, I think that you're right. We are kind of lazy to be able to do it.  A lot of people don't even understand what two factor authentication is. They think that now  they're going to have to sign in twice or it's going to become more work. But for me, I've already  signed in. I'm like, I'm not going back to redo something, even though it could be more secure.  I don't really worry that they're going to be saying, you know what? I'm going to give you,  I'm going to double your bitcoins. If you give me bitcoins, I don't think they're using my account  for that. And I'm like, so I don't do it. I don't think that I have it on. I don't even know if I  have it on. I could check, but I don't. I don't want anybody to steal my account.

Start time: 5940.08
End time: 5985.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a very concrete demonstration of why you should have it on. There was a Proud Boy rally  in San Francisco about three years ago. I made some comments on Twitter basically pointing out  these people were, I want to be polite, but basically-  Gits.  Stupid gits.  And then within an hour of posting that, somebody had tried to use an old password to get into my  Facebook account and two factor authentication had blocked it. We need to have multi-factor  authentication, practically not SMS. And I agree with you, Leo, the key works. And it's a pain in  the ass to carry around, but so's the house key.

Start time: 5985.96
End time: 6017.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I carry it on my house keys. So I mean, I always have it with me. I don't know. I  hear from too many people who've lost their accounts or, you know, well, here's an example  of why you maybe don't want it to be too secure. Maybe you want the bad guys to steal your account  because otherwise they might go to greater lengths. Shane Sonderman.  Bust.  Oh man. All right. Well, there's a guy named Sparky, Sparky Herring.  This guy's a hero.

Start time: 6019.08
End time: 6027.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you ever used FidoNet, this guy was an absolute hero. He invented the format that made it possible.  QWK.  And to die in this way is just shameful.

Start time: 6027.62
End time: 6118.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I didn't realize that. So yes, he is absolutely, I was a FidoNet sysop. He's absolutely,  it's a shameful thing. He had the Twitter handle at Tennessee, which is, it turns out, a hot handle.  Short handles are hot. And I guess things like at Tennessee,  this kid, Shane Sonderman, wanted the username, contacted Sparky. He said, no,  you can't have my name. So the kid hired or recruited a group of friends to harass him.  They sent him a bunch of unwanted pizzas. And then things got deadly on April 27th last year.  A miner in Britain who is not identified because he's a miner called law enforcement in Bethpage,  Tennessee, claimed that Herring had killed a woman and set up booby trap bombs at his home.  So he was being swatted. So cops rushed to his door. Sparky grabbed a firearm because he  thought there were trespassers. When he realized there were three, there were police officers in  his home, he dropped it. He went out of the house with a gun, his daughter said, because he heard  someone was on his property. He sees all these cops around him. They ask, are you Mark Herring? Put  your hands up. He tosses the gun away from him to show he's not a threat, puts his hands up,  and suffers a massive heart attack and dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jail, man. They want the county jail. I'm thinking it's a federal offense, but  I don't... Actually, I don't see that. So...  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the kid who made the call will probably never be known because he is a miner.  It's not the first time somebody has died from a swatting attack. It's a terrible thing to do.

Start time: 6181.28
End time: 6210.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  2017, some guy... That was even worse because they'd swatted the wrong address,  and some guy who comes out having no idea what's going on and got shot straight through the chest,  and swatting is serious business, and this is getting people killed.  Don't get me started on American police procedures, but in this case, it wasn't a  shooting case. It was a heart attack, but even so, it was just heart rending.  When we got swatted some years ago...

Transcript:  The guy didn't say it was me. The guy said,  I have shot everybody in the studio and planted bombs in the studio.  I've heard the recording of the kid. A couple of guys came over and said,  we got this thing. Is everything okay here? And we said, yeah.  But you know what? We evacuated the building. They got dogs  and sniffed the whole place. They took it seriously enough,  but they didn't threaten our lives. Thank goodness.  The problem is in a lot of jurisdictions, the police are highly militarized.  They've got military weapons, military gear, and sometimes they can be very aggressive in these...  Trying to save lives, obviously. In this case, they cost a life.  And a life of somebody who was pretty important to us.

Transcript:  I do have to say, my interactions with the police in this country leave me a bit...  You don't have great police here. You don't have really good professional police.

I've met cops that I would invite over for dinner,  and I've had other cops put guns in my face over some chips.  And I'm like, wait, what are we doing? Like, what is going on?  So it's a mixed bag, but the bag is too mixed in a bad direction right now.  So it is what it is. That's why I live in a bat cave and no one can find me.  And I use all my tax loopholes, Uncle Leo. You got to get on board.  Uncle Leo, you got to start hiding out. You know, incorporate everything.  You own too much stuff with your name on it, Uncle Leo.  Your socks should be bought by Twitter.

Transcript:  Maybe we should mention that Sparky Herring was creator of Sparkware  and Quickmail, Q-W-I-K-mail. And as a final net sysop,  I was well aware of that because it was a really...  It was, in a way, the first newsreader.  It let you log on to a billboard, download everything, then log off.  And, you know, in my day, I had one line and then I felt great.  I got two lines on my billboard, on my bulletin board,  but it was pretty hard to get in.  So if you got in, you want to get everything and get off as quickly as you could.  And that's basically why he created...  He was harassed. I haven't even gone into all the things that they did to him.  He was harassed horrifically.

Transcript:  Sorry, Sparky, but we won't forget.  And I'm glad this son of a bitch is in jail.  Elon Musk has confirmed with a simple one word tweet.  He's learning his lesson a couple of days ago.  The word is no.  Fred asked him, any chance of a normal steering wheel  on future Model S and Model X Teslas?  And Elon's response is no.  What is he talking about?  Well, when the Model S Plaid came out,  it came out with an option for a yoke steering wheel.  Now, there's a reason why there's a round steering wheel on your car  because cars have a 14 to one steering ratio.  You turn it a lot to get a little turn in the wheel.  And that's sensible.  That's how we like it.  That's why you learned when you learned how to drive the hand over hand turn.  Fighter jets and Formula One racing cars have yokes  because their turning ratio is considerably lower.  Lower, I guess.  Right.  So you turn the steering wheel a little bit.

And when I go overseas and I have to drive on the other side of the road,  it hurts my heart and my brain to focus, to try to do it.  I don't want to get in a car where I can't just roll back  and put my fingers on the top and just be swooping.  I don't want, this is not what I want to be doing.  I don't need shake weights while I'm driving a car.  Okay.  I want to be able to roll my hand and feel the wheel.

What do they charge? 500 bucks a month.  I can't remember.  They charge you a lot for it if you have a Tesla.  It's basically testing software on public roads without safeguards.  And it's dangerous.  It's not full self-driving.  It's on city streets.  It's supposed to recognize stoplights, stop signs.  As you mentioned Owen, it isn't perfect at that.

Transcript:  They saw this with a Tesla beheading.  I mean, it's supposed to, you know, want to the road.  But in that case, a white trailer truck was going across the road  and it mistook that for the sky and some guy got his head taken off.  And Tesla are selling this as an autopilot option.  They don't call it that anymore.  But, you know, they are saying basically you can self-drive  and people are taking them up on that.  It's willful danger, I think, for drivers.

Transcript:  Consumer Reports got a quote from Brian Reimer.  He's a professor at MIT, the founder of their Advanced Vehicle Technology Consortium.  He told Consumer Reports, while drivers may have some awareness  of the increased risk they're assuming when they use FSD,  other road users, drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc.  are unaware that they are in the presence of a test vehicle  and they have not consented to take on this risk.  It's a little scary.  Tesla just asking to pay attention, people to pay attention isn't enough.  The system needs to make sure people are engaged when the system is operational.

Transcript:  It's the same kind of thinking though that the NSO group has shown  with their government-sponsored malware.  We just sell the tools.  We don't, we're not responsible for how people use it.  So Tesla says, oh, it's technically not an autopilot,  but you can use it that way.  And then, you know, people get snuffed.

Transcript:  A professor at the American University School of Public Affairs  who studies autonomous vehicles said that the full self-driving  beta-9 equipped Teslas in a vehicle she has seen act almost like a drunk driver  struggling to stay between lines.  It's meandering to the left.  It's meandering to the right.  She says, well, its right-hand turns appear to be fairly solid.  The left-hand turns are almost wild.

Start time: 6713.48
End time: 6732.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can fix this easily.  Tesla should be mandated to put a neon light strip  under the front bumper and rear bumper.  And when you're in this autopilot, non-autopilot,  it shows a green light on the ground so that we know  that you're not really driving your car right now.  So if I want to avoid you, pass you, get by you.  But it's so much cognitive load though.

Transcript:  It's always been the case that Tesla acts more like a software company than a car company.  And of course, this is traditional in software companies.  You release betas, even some that are not fully cooked, as we know.  But this is a little different.  You're taking people's safety in your hands here.

End time: 6886.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's a good point.  And I think Tesla really does do a lot to try to encourage you to pay attention.  They do warn you if your hand's on the wheel and they say,  put your hands on the wheel and they'll turn it off if they're not on the wheel.  I have to point out though that other companies like GM and Ford are putting cameras in the car  to watch to make sure that you are paying attention.  Your eyes are on the road and they have capacitive sensors in their steering wheel.  So they're a little bit more aware of your interaction with this.  Tesla's fairly easy to, you know, every once in a while reach over and jerk the steering wheel.

Start time: 6886.88
End time: 6915.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Somebody actually gamed a Tesla by hanging a weight off one side of the steering wheel.  One side of the other.  Yeah.  Just to keep it going.  And we did a story about a year ago of somebody recording a not safe for work video in a Tesla  with a couple of them making the beast with two backs in the car while on the road.  Oh, Lord, don't do that.  A Darwinism, you know, maybe this is a good time to stop this.

Transcript:  But if it doesn't really, if I have to be watching and my hands have to be on the steering wheel,  it's not really any used to be self-driving anyways.  So really just put it out when it's actually able to do the things that we want it to do.  Because if not, what are you doing anyways?  If I have to pay attention, then I don't need it to self-drive.  I'm already holding on to it and having to do other things.  So I find it frustrating just all the way around.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Thank you.  Oh, and JJ Stone.  Oh, Dr. Everybody, ladies and gentlemen.  Our show today.  Herbs of Providence.  Our show today brought to you by I want to make those.  That's a marketing opportunity here.  I don't know.  Brought to you by ESET.  Oh, man, for over 30 years.  ESET has been a global leader in cybersecurity.  I've been doing ads for ESET for probably about 20 years.  And I was shocked because I hadn't talked about it in a long time.  When I asked Russell, I ask him every time I see him, our IT guy, are we safe?  Are we safe?  Because I'm so worried about, you know, stuff coming in over the transom,  our employees, you know, innocently opening an email and bringing the whole network down  or getting ransomware.  I'm so nervous about all that all the time.  And finally, he said, Leo, we use ESET.  We're safe.  I said, oh, I know ESET.  It turns out we use ESET.  I'll give you a good example.  ESET is a very lightweight, does not use a lot of resources,  but it's also the best antivirus protection you can get.  More than antivirus, security protection.  Ransomware is clearly the number one issue people are facing right now.  We keep ESET around to keep us from becoming a statistic.  ESET solutions block advanced threats.  They do a multiple of different things without slowing you down.  I'll give you an example.  ESET Protect Advanced, they just announced this.  This is why I think Russell likes it.  It's a security management console.  So he can, even if he's not on site, get real-time visibility of all our endpoints.  You can protect and detect ransomware.  You can use it on-prem or via the cloud.  It's got service security, mail security, all the advanced features you'd expect.  They help you sleep a little more soundly at night, I can tell you.  And it's not just ESET Protect Advanced.  They have other resources designed to help your employees do the right thing,  to protect themselves and your company against ransomware and phishing attempts.  We were talking about MFA.  If MFA is not already in place at your company,  you definitely want to take a look at ESET Secure Authentication.  It's easy to use, user-friendly for your employees, easy to deploy for you.  You can use it with Office 365, Google Apps, Dropbox.  It's essential for preventing these phishing attacks.  Now, once your employees' logins and endpoints are secured with ESET's MFA,  and then you can train them for battle against online scams.  That's because 95% of all breaches are caused by human error.  Your first line of defense, it's your employees.  ESET has a fun, engaging, but effective cybersecurity awareness training.  They also have interactive, gamified training that teaches employees  how to recognize phishing, how to create strong passwords,  how to follow best practices on the internet.  You'll be glad to know it only takes 90 minutes,  but it's the best 90 minutes you could ever imagine for your employees.  Highly recommend it.  We have been using, even without my knowledge, ESET for years,  they continue to innovate.  That's key because these guys aren't sitting still,  the bad guys aren't sitting still.  You need security software that keeps up to date.  And these educational tools, I really like these.  A very important additional layer of protection for your business.  Successful ransomware attacks are in the news every day.  Trust ESET to keep you from becoming a statistic.  Try an interactive demo of ESET Protect Advanced at business.eset.com slash twit.  Ransomware protection, that means business.  Get protected today.  Learn more at business.eset.com slash twit.  Man, it really was scary when we had employees at home  and now they're going to bring in those laptops.  I don't know what's been going on.

Transcript:  I've been talking about it all week.  We talked about it on Security Now, on Twig.  I think we even might have talked about it.  Did Jason talk about it on Twit last week?  Maybe not.  What did that story break?  50,000 phone numbers, we're not sure where they came from,  handed to Amnesty International and a British security group called,  what was the name?  I forgot.  Something Stories.  I always forget their name.  Why don't I remember it?  Anyway, they found when they looked through these...  Go ahead.  Do you know?

Start time: 7854.89
End time: 7885.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no.  There's been a lot of work over this.  Two journalists in particular, Tom Brewster and Kim Zetter.  What it's looking like at the moment is this.  Pegasus is saying, we can give you malware to get onto any phone.  They had a list of 50,000 people, but it doesn't appear that Pegasus generated it themselves.  That came from a third party.  So it's now trying to find who the third party is.

Start time: 7886.08
End time: 7926.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when you look at these 50,000 phone numbers, it's very interesting.  The dates of those phone numbers being put on that list correspond sometimes even within seconds  to the dates of malware infestations on the phone that were analyzed by Amnesty International.  The list seems to be very closely related to maybe even a subset or a superset of NSO group  customers.  The NSO group is an Israeli company that sells hacking tools.  They say only to nice guys, only to governments that are good.

So this group analyzed 37 phones, many with a tight correlation between time stamps associated  with the number on the list and the initiation of surveillance attempts, in some cases as short as  a few seconds.  That seems to me to show that the providence of the list is something closely related to the NSO  group.  They found though what's scary and what's actually depressing.  NSO group says this is a bullsh**t, it's not true.  I'm sorry, did I say bullsh**t?  I mean, piffle.  This is piffle.  It's not true.  That's the new word I'm going to use all the time.

End time: 8083.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Anyone who says you're not doing anything illegal and so you don't have anything to  worry about, my response is, do you have curtains?  Really?  Because if you're happy, everyone looking in on your life like that, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There is no benign, right?  Everything is about power and control.  There is no benign.  There is no good people.  My phone knows more about me than I know about me.  Right.  Right.  So all of us could have something used against us in a way that would become malicious.  It's a way of being able to control people, being able to track people.  And we need to have laws in place that that should be just as illegal as if you go into my house  and snoop through all my papers and I catch you there.  Like that is as creepy as it is because they can find out everything about you from your phone.

Start time: 8135.72
End time: 8181.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's two things.  I guess on the one hand, you're absolutely right that people who are  not worried about privacy use that argument too.  Well, if you've got nothing to hide, why would you worry about that?  If you've got nothing to hide, why are you worried about government surveillance?  That's one specious argument.  But there's another one on the other side that I hear from a lot of  tech people and security experts that you don't have to worry about this because this is,  these are so expensive.  You have to be a nation state to take advantage of them.  And they're not general hacks, they're targeted.  So you and I have nothing to worry about from the NSO group,  not because we haven't done anything wrong, but because  we're just not going to be the subjects of this kind of attack.  I think that's also wrong.

Start time: 8182.72
End time: 8220.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think if you look at the contract that was put out,  they were charging a couple of six figure sums just for targeting 10 people.  Now, yes, you might say, well, okay, I'm not really going to be the person that's  targeted by this.  But the fact that this can be done and all you need is a phone number.  I mean, let's not forget Donald Trump was giving out his personal phone number to European leaders  and this is out there.  You know, the idea that you can sell malware legally as long as it's done to governments  is just an anathema.

But I'm doing the show, I'm in two chat rooms, I can't do three things at one time.  Oh, the power of things like this, even again, where it's like, oh, it's only these people.  Those people could be blackmailed with things that are on their phones.  You know, we have the article in here we didn't talk about with the Catholic priest who got  outed because he was on Grindr and his location and where he was at.  Oh, that's not hypocrite.  And so again, when you were in these kind of power structures, imagine what you could do  to cripple a nation, cripple a business if you just had this on the right person's phone.  So it might not affect me on my day to day, but it affects important people, journalists,  lobbyists, presidents, anybody.  So it's a problem.  It's a huge problem.

Start time: 8279.60

Then slowly, this is going to become more and more like out there for everyone to be  able to use.  And even just someone saying, listen, I'm going to be able to snoop onto your phone  and take a look.  You better be careful which way you're voting.  Like even if you're not sure if they're doing it or not, I think a lot of people would be  worried about something that they're doing.  Chilling effect.

Transcript:  Matthew Green, who's a cryptographer, highly respected guy at Johns Hopkins University,  wrote, I thought, a very good blog piece about it on his cryptographyengineering.com blog,  where he argues against security nihilism.  He says, a perverse reaction I've seen from some security experts is to shrug and say,  well, there's no such thing as perfect security.  The people we need to yell at obviously is the NSO group, but even more so, Apple and  Google.  Now, most of these phones were Apple phones.  So that was one of the things that scared people.  Wait a minute.  I use an Apple phone because Shogi's fiance said, well, I used an Apple phone because  I was told it was secure.  But the Pegasus software was on her phone.  It should be really important to note, both Android and Apple phones were hacked.  There were only three Android phones, but that's more because I think the logs are  deleted automatically by Android.  So it was easier to find it on Apple phones.  He says, really, what we need to do is demand of Apple and Google to do more to protect  their users.  I think that that's fair.  I think Apple and Google absolutely care about this, but they are also economic entities.  They're perhaps doing the easy thing instead of the right thing.

You have endless vulnerabilities on the computer system.  As we've seen with the Snowden leaks, if you buy a new computer and you're on a watch list,  stuff can be loaded on there before you get it.  I mean, but these are some very small number of people, but Scott McNeely was right.  Privacy is dead.

Transcript:  Actually, we've had a situation where a woman in my wife's office has tested positive for COVID  after getting the vaccinations.  So I'm in lockdown, which is why I'm not up at Petaluma.  Oh, my goodness.  So, yeah, we're keeping quiet until we know what the results are.

Transcript:  There was an excellent article, I think, today in Salon.  About these, they so-called breakthrough infections,  that the vaccine isn't going to protect you necessarily,  especially from this new Delta variant.  It's going to protect you from death and hospitalization.  So you probably should still be cautious indoors in public, maybe wear a mask.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, we dropped the ball on this one.  I mean, we had SARS and MERS, which weren't as infectious,  but they were locked down.  And now we've got four billion people who are unvaccinated,  and that's going to breed a whole lot of new infections.  I had a caller from Montreal.

I asked him, because I knew that, talking to Renee,  and of course, George is up in Montreal too, having talked to Renee,  that things were a little tough in Montreal.  There was a shortage of vaccines.  They were, for a while, giving only one vaccine,  hoping to spread them out a little bit and deferring the second vaccine.  Are things improved there?

Transcript:  I do want to mention we do Twitter every Sunday afternoon  at about 2 30 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern.  That's 21 30 UTC.  And I give you those times because you can watch us make the show live.  There was a really good conversation before the show started.  You would see that if you tuned in.  The live video and audio streams are at twit.tv slash live.  People who watch live or listen live often like to chat live with us  at our chat room, irc.twit.tv.  Of course, on-demand versions of all of our shows are also available.  All you have to do is go to the web, twit.tv.  There's a YouTube channel.  Let's see.  What else can you do?  You can subscribe actually in your favorite podcast client.  You get it automatically that way.  And if, by the way, they let you leave reviews,  please give us a five star review.  Let the world know that you're a twit.  Wait a minute.  That didn't come out right.  I do want to mention club to it because there's another way you could chat with us  in our discord, which is always a lot of fun.  To get in the discord, you have to be a member of club twit.  It's a way to support the network and get some benefits for yourself.  Seven dollars a month gives you ad free versions of all the shows  because we're monetizing you so we don't need to play ads for you.  Read ads to you.  You also and that's audio or video, all of the shows.  There's also a twit plus feed with additional content.  Things like the pre show chatter that we had.  I think that'll probably make it into the twit plus feed  and access to our club twit discord, which is a great place to hang  with people like minded people and discuss not only the shows,  we have sections for all of the shows, but frankly,  a lot of great kind of geeky subjects from anime to travel to photography to philosophy.  And I think we're going to have to have a seasonings channel for Owen JJ Stone.  Oh, speaking of Owen JJ Stone, as is our tradition,  we let him conclude the show IQMZ.com.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.  Oh, doctor.

Transcript:  So I was taking notes during your speech there.  Ian, speedy recovery to your wife first and foremost.  Hopefully, as well, and it should.  Georgia.  Georgia's got to do a show with me.  People pressure her on the internet to make her do it.  I know she's busy.  I know she has better things to do.  The last time she did a show with you, she revealed her real name.  I know.  I know.  And so we're out here in these streets.  We're doing those things.  And I just want to remind everybody not the world's opening up.  Trust, but verify.  OK, so when you're going out to go see people and visit,  if you know you're around people that aren't vaccinated,  don't pressure them into it, but tell them about your positive experience,  about how you didn't die and it's OK for you, but don't pressure them.  But just bring it up occasionally in a nice fashion.  No need for us to argue.  But if you're around people that aren't getting vaccinated,  make sure you're wearing your mask, especially when you go in a grocery store  and go inside and go shopping.  It's just better safe inside for you.  If you're inside with three or four people, not a big deal.  If you know everybody's vaccinated, when you go into the grocery store,  just put the mask off right now.  Not a big deal.  It's not a political thing.  It's a safety and health issue.  And anybody listening to this should have enough common sense to do it.  But I still say it out loud just in case you want to cut this clip  and send it to somebody who is semi-rational.  I believe that the world's going to get back to being a positive, awesome place.  I know we're destroying the planet, Uncle Leo, but while we're here,  love your children, love your husband, love your wife,  talk to your grandparents, call them.  You know they've been sad and alone inside the house.  Check on your family members and friends.  And another tweet is in the can.  Oh, you text me.  I reply to people.  I talk to you.  I'm here for you.  I love you all in these streets.  I'll talk to you later.  Another Twits in the Can.
