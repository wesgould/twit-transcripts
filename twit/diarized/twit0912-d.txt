Transcript:  All right. Hold on. We're not ready to begin yet.  I need somebody to talk to adjust the level, Leo. Oh, you have a little... He doesn't have headphones on. So we can't do a bleed. I understand why we had the bleed.  That's why there was the bleed. Harry, do you mind wearing headphones? I'm happy with whatever works best. We can provide you with headphones. Sure. I apologize. No problem.  Do you have some, Burke? You can get them out of my office if you don't.  Give him some nice ones. The good stuff. Give him good stuff. Give him the good ones. I think there's an unopened box in my cupboard on the left there.  Give him some sterile headphones.  I'm sorry, Harry. I wasn't paying attention. Yeah, usually we use the bleed, but I think... I suddenly realized you might not be aware that I couldn't hear him.  Yeah, that would be kind of a disadvantage to the overall program. It would be kind of a bad thing.  Good. Nobody should hire D'Amico Ryan as a head coach. That would be a terrible idea.  It's Lisa's birthday and I really wanted her to have a nice birthday.  Happy birthday, Lisa. Happy birthday, Lisa. It's also our anniversary because I foolishly thought if we got married on her birthday, I would only have to give her one gift.  You didn't think that. That wasn't why you did that. I just thought it would be easier to remember. One fewer date to remember or something.  It was fun. Unfortunately, the place we got married, Calistoga Ranch, has burned to the ground and the wildfires is gone.  Which makes me sad. She says, ah, this life. I said, Lisa, this... No. Because we used to go there on our anniversary and stuff and it was really nice.  But I've just learned that we had a caller from the new Kona Village, which is opening this summer in Kona, Hawaii.  I've just learned that that's reopening and that's somewhere I've always... I was on my bucket list somewhere to stay.  That's where Steve Jobs was staying when the iPhone 4 and Tenegate happened. He didn't want to come back, but they made him come back.  That's how good it is, I guess.  At the time, there were no TVs, no phones, no internet. It was like you were staying in a traditional Hawaiian hale.  Sounds alright.  How's that?  You can hear it and you get the volume there so you can control that. Don't deafen yourself.  Can you hear me, Harry?  Harry, can you hear me? Harry, can you hear me?

Transcript:  You made the move this week when Ivory came out. TapBots was one of the third party apps that Mr. Musk clobbered.  At first without warning, then with a lie saying, you've been violating the rules for 15 years? You just noticed?  Finally they said, oh, they retroactively changed the rules. No third parties.  But that wasn't enough to push you to Mastodon. Ivory was the thing that did it. TapBots was a very nice, or TweetBot rather, was a very nice Twitter client from TapBots.  And Ivory is basically TweetBot for Mastodon.

Start time: 576.06
End time: 609.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And honestly, it was kind of a combination of things. It was that. That was, I think, really kind of the final straw.  Also, as a lot of people have commented on, my posts don't show up in people's feeds and I don't see replies and I don't see other people's posts.  And so the whole experience was becoming degraded. And then not only did I have Ivory, which was great, but there's IceCubes, which is a great open source client.  I like IceCubes a lot.  There's Elk. IceCubes is fantastic. There's Elk.zone, which is a great web interface. I actually have a GitHub list that I've been making of different cool Mastodon projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, right. And so I've already got it. There will be some people who follow me on Mastodon who didn't follow me on Twitter.  But I've got 10% of the followers that I had on Twitter now on Mastodon, which is not bad for four or five days in.

Start time: 633.28
End time: 640.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people are reporting increased engagement even though there are fewer followers on Mastodon.  I certainly noticed that.  Yeah, absolutely.

End time: 654.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to. No, that will change over time. I think that as more people join, you will see less of that high signal to noise. But right now I totally agree. I'm definitely seeing higher engagement, higher quality.

Start time: 655.04
End time: 924.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty clear that Elon has decided to heavily algorithmatize the feed on Twitter. He's even said you pay eight bucks and more people will see you.  And I think he's I don't know why he thinks eight bucks from a few hundred million at best users is going to make enough money to pay for Twitter and the loss of ad revenue.  But he's doing whatever he can. And that's the problem, though, is that it then tells people, oh, you know, I'm nobody's nobody's engaging with me.  I don't want to be here. So you're driving off your creators.  Actually, Corey Doctorow wrote a good story about this this week.  It's an impolite title, so I'm going to say TikTok's in certification using the good places euphemism for that word.  I thought was quite insightful. As usual, Corey made something that's been around and obvious to all of us crystal clear.  A light bulb goes off. He says, here's how platforms die. First, they're good to their users.  Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.  Finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.  Then they die. And he gives an example, Amazon, which was customer first, customer first.  And then, you know, as the as the customer base got locked in with a variety of techniques like Amazon Prime and DRM and so forth, then they said, all right, now businesses, businesses.  And then the marketplace at 50 percent Amazon sales are in the marketplace, third party sellers.  But they got locked in even though they lose 45 percent of revenue to Amazon and fees.  And now Amazon says, screw you, you're locked in. And they start monetizing.  He says the company's 31 billion dollar and he puts it in quotes advertising program is really a payola scheme that pits sellers against each other, forcing them to bid on the chance to be at the top of your search.  But what ultimately happens is you've insured a fight your platform to the point where no one wants to use it anymore.  This is very clearly where Elon is. Twitter at first was all about the users. They couldn't figure out how to monetize it.  Then they got brands to go there. In fact, that's one of the reasons all of us were there. Right.  That's the best you have to be there to promote your brand, to build your audience.  Then once they got them locked in, now they can say, hey, if you want to reach that audience, which we own, it'll be eight dollars, please.  But you do that at the risk of driving people like Christina away.  He's talking about the in this article, particularly about TikTok doing this.  But it happens to every one of these companies.  His position, which I really agree with, is, you know, that's this is the way it is.  And you just move. You go to the next thing. You leave space for Facebook. You leave Facebook for somewhere else.  But what we need regulation for is to make sure it's as friction free as possible to move, to avoid the lock in.  You need interoperability. You need to make it easy to move somewhere else.  And then then you can let the market you can let the market rule.  He says, as I said at the start of this essay, this is towards the end, and certification exerts a nearly irresistible gravity on platform capitalism.  You know, the staff, the executives, the shareholders, eventually they all say, no, you got to insure defy.  We need the money.  But even the most locked in user eventually reaches a breaking point and walks away or gets pushed.  In individual product managers, executives, activists, shareholders all give preference to quick returns at the cost of sustainability.  And they're in a race to see who can eat their seed corn first.  And certification has only lasted for as long as it has because the Internet has devolved into five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four.  He's getting a little little cranky in his old age. I don't know.  And certification kills Google just laid off twelve thousand and the company's in a full bomb panic over the rise of a chat bots.  What do you what do you thoughts, Tim?

Start time: 926.64
End time: 957.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I definitely you know, the pattern is very clear when we certainly seen it before.  What's missing, though, I think, is the actual death of these platforms.  I think, you know, Twitter is certainly struggling.  And I think a lot of us are kind of thinking that his days are numbered, but it's still incredibly huge, incredibly popular.  And as Musk goes to say, you know, engagement numbers are up because everyone's kind of watching the dumpster fire smolder.  So I think it's a little too early to say that Amazon has died, that that Google has died, that Twitter has died.  And so I think that's the piece of the pattern that's missing in this case for better or for worse.

Start time: 958.02
End time: 976.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We certainly there are, of course, plenty of companies.  And this is, by the way, not just tech companies, any company with any consumers.  There are plenty of companies in that graveyard.  We're in the process of watching these companies move in that direction.  But you're right. I mean, it's it's hard to imagine Google going away.  Facebook, maybe it's not so hard.

Start time: 977.10
End time: 1007.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know Facebook's latest data on engagement since they started pushing videos from people I don't even follow into my feed.  Apparently that's actually working, at least right now in terms of engagement.  The AI they're using to put videos in front of you actually does seem to determine stuff that people will watch.  And so it's the numbers are a little encouraging lately, especially given how, you know,  a little bit of good news Facebook has had any front in the last couple of years.

Start time: 1008.29
End time: 1017.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Christina, is does this process end with the end of Twitter or does Twitter just kind of drag on?

Start time: 1019.71
End time: 1166.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it can it can be both. Right.  And we've seen both because we've definitely seen social networks just go under and and just disappear.  And that has happened. Google Plus is a great example of that.  Where obviously, you know, Google put a lot of money and a lot of effort into that and it failed.  And then they just shut it down and got rid of all the archives even, which I actually thought that was not a great move to not even keep the public archives available.  But that was like a high profile failure.  There have been other ones.  But then you also have instances where they continue to kind of stick around until they're sold and deleted.  And my space being a great example of that, where, you know, that has now had God only knows how many owners and people trying to use that very worthless at this point email list of users.  But my space, you know, was bigger than Facebook up until about 2009, I want to say.  And then you started seeing a really big migration of people from my space to Facebook to the point that that my space just kind of became a dead zone,  except for a very specific niche of people.  And that wasn't really unlike LiveJournal and GeoCities and Tumblr and some other things.  It wasn't really because of any policy changes that my space made.  It was just because the masses were all on Facebook.  And, you know, Twitter is interesting because, as Tim says, it's still this giant place.  I think that what will potentially be pushing people off of it is less the alternatives and more when the overall experience becomes degraded,  whether because more toxicity is there or, you know, just because you can't you're having errors in your feed.  You know, you're not able to post things the right way.  You can't refresh as quickly. You don't see all of your replies.  You know, that's the sort of thing that makes people go, OK, why am I investing time in this?  And arguably, you could say that the demise of Twitter started probably in 2016, ironically, when its engagement was higher,  when you started to see a lot of the previous like high profile users of Twitter leave the platform for Instagram and then later, you know,  TikTok, but you stop seeing the celebrities on Twitter.  And I don't know. I mean, it's one of those.  It's one of those what was the neologism like it happens, you know, slowly and then all at once.  I think that's it's like the collapse of the way Gibbons said it first.

Start time: 1168.16
End time: 1186.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  F Scott Fitzgerald said it about somebody going bankrupt.  But I think it was Gibbons who said the Roman Empire collapsed slowly at first and then suddenly and then it's been applied to a lot of things.  You're right. Although Instagram seems to be quite suddenly collapsing in on itself.  Am I wrong? Totally. Well, again, you're not.

Start time: 1187.24
End time: 1245.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think Instagram was one of those interesting ones where if they just stuck to their guns like when they copied Snapchat,  that was brilliant because they did stories better than Snapchat did.  They had a bigger audience and they added some features that made it better.  So that was like a perfect example of copying the right way with TikTok.  I think they just have fundamentally misunderstood their audience and misunderstood that it's a completely different expectation.  And if they wanted to create a TikTok compete, they should have created an app called Instagram Reels that I bet would have been very popular.  But, you know, by loading it down with stuff that people you don't follow, people you're not even necessarily interested in,  an algorithm that is not as good as TikToks and then you don't even see your friends' photos, the whole reason why people are there to begin with.  Yeah, I spend a lot less time on Instagram because I'm like, what's the point?  I used to come here for a specific reason. Now this isn't there.  And even worse, it's a watered down version of this other thing that already exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like a Fitzgerald quote.  But maybe he stole it from Gibbon.

Start time: 1273.77
End time: 1501.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Gibbon said it first, but I might be wrong on that as well.  How did you go bankrupt? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.  How did you collapse? Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.  This actually leads into this. There are tributaries off of this into a lot of the stories that we're talking about these days.  And I don't want to do another Elon Musk-filled tweet, so we're not.  Everybody's going, oh, thank God. I thought he was going to start talking about Elon.  But really, it's about companies in general going through this business cycle.  CNET, your former employer, Tim Stevens, has been accused of some interesting shenanigans.  We had Connie Guillermo on two weeks ago, right when this was breaking.  Remember the 75 stories an AI had written in their personal finance section?  She said, well, these are stories no reporter wants to write.  You know, the kind of the basic boring stories.  We had the AI write a first draft and then an editor look at it, correct it, finish it, and then put it out.  But now it's coming out that in fact there were far more errors that were not corrected, that a lot of the content wasn't very good.  And that perhaps CNET has been using it more than just those 75 articles.  She said, yeah, we've used for years, as many publications do, programs to put in stock prices.  I mean, that's not using AI to write a story.  There's a very different thing there. I don't blame them for that.  The Verge, though, has been really kind of hammering on CNET.  I don't know, maybe they have a vested interest in knocking down a competitor.  I don't know. But they're accusing CNET of doing something a little bit more nefarious.  Remember CNET was sold to an equity capital company called Red Ventures.  And Tim, you have some probably direct experience with this.  A bit, yes, I do.  And what always happens with these acquisitions is that the equity capital companies raise a lot of debt to acquire these companies.  So they're saddled with big debt.  And what you look at across the corporate landscape these days, heavily encumbered companies owning these companies.  So a lot of debt.  So there's pressure on them from both their shareholders and their lenders to kind of monetize.  So these companies very often either sell off pieces of the company that they bought or attempt to monetize it, as Elon is doing with Twitter.  The Verge is accusing CNET and Red Ventures of, and by the way, Red Ventures also owns a number of sites like the Points Guy, Bankrate and CreditCards.com,  which are sites that make their money through credit card affiliate fees.  And the Verge is accusing them, in effect, of turning CNET into that kind of site with auto-generated linkbait articles designed to rank highly in searches that they can then monetize with ads or affiliate fees.  Bankrate and CreditCards have also published AI written articles about credit cards with ads for credit cards nestled within.  It turns out the same guy responsible for this at Bankrate and CreditCards is responsible for it at CNET, Lance Davis, vice president of content at Red Ventures.  And I think there's an interesting accusation here that Red Ventures is basically taking this venerable, highly respected name in technology journalism and turning it into an SEO farm.  Tim, I'll give you the chance to either recuse yourself or to give us your thoughts.

Start time: 1502.22
End time: 1510.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no pressure. Obviously, I need to be a little bit careful with what I say here, both because this is my former employer we talked about and because I have a lot of friends and a lot of people who I respect.

Start time: 1511.00
End time: 1522.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's not really worth it. And I should say that. It's really important to say. So many people, including Connie, that I love and respect and honor.  I don't blame CNET for this one. I think this comes from Red Ventures.

Start time: 1523.40
End time: 1597.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so my take on this is a little bit complicated. I do think that, you know, clearly the Verge has an interest in making CNET look better.  I don't think that anything that the Verge has reported this far from what I've seen has been inaccurate.  I want to say one thing for sure. I wasn't aware of any of the stuff that was going on when I was there. I left CNET around August of last year.  There was kind of rumors and talk and that kind of thing, but I wasn't aware of anything going on.  So I have no insider knowledge about how any of this came to pass.  But I will say that CNET was using tools like Wordsmith and others. And those are tools that a lot of outlets use.  A lot of publications use those. And basically what they do is they help you optimize the content that you're writing to make sure that they include the right keywords to make sure that they are, you know, that they perform well in an algorithm based environment.  And that is really what consumers are operating within right now.  Anyone who goes on the Internet and searches for a thing is asking an algorithm what things should I read.  And so it's only natural for publications to want to make sure that their content performs as well as possible.  The thing is when you use a tool like that, it can begin to feel like you are basically reverse engineering Google, you're reverse engineering a search engine.  That's really what this game comes down to.  It's AI talking to AI, isn't it?

Start time: 1598.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1600.96
End time: 1612.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For Leo, at some point, you know, what's the best tool to optimize content for an algorithm?  It would be another algorithm effectively.  And so I think by extension, it's a natural thing that CNET would do this.  I don't think anybody would be surprised at CNET being one of the...

Start time: 1614.00
End time: 1618.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, especially when there's financial pressure to turn around a big acquisition, right?

Start time: 1619.42
End time: 1700.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe so. But I think that the timing is a little bit irrelevant here.  I mean, CNET has definitely been on the cutting edge of a lot of different publication types over the years, whether it be integrated affiliate links, things like that.  They've definitely been at the bleeding edge.  So there's no surprise that they would be at the bleeding edge of adopting AI technology.  My concern really is that there wasn't enough transparency involved here.  I think that's what my problem is.  If CNET had come out and said, hey, we're experimenting with AI.  This is kind of fun and new. We don't really know what this is going to be.  But here's what we're trying. This is where we're trying it on.  This is some content that was written by AI.  What do you think?  I think that this would have been...  I'm sure that they would have gotten some blowback for sure.  But from what I could see from my perspective and reading through coverage on The Virgin and elsewhere, it just seemed like it was...  They were hoping that nobody would notice.  And I feel like that's really the wrong way to go about doing this.  If you're going to be embracing this kind of technology or investing in it,  especially when you're talking about giving people recommendations about where they should put their money in a mortgage,  I think it's important to be incredibly transparent.  And Connie's piece was very transparent, but that came out long after the story had kind of blown up,  long after The Virgin's piece.  And I think it's unfortunate that CNET wasn't more upfront with what was going on beyond the scenes.  There was certainly...  We saw the little disclaimers on Google and things like that.  But that was, in my opinion, was not enough.  And that's where I'm disappointed in this whole thing.

If anything, I feel like they might have been sandbagged by this.  And they didn't know the full extent of what was going on and ended up being kind of hung out to dry, so to speak.  The Verge quotes a former CNET employee saying Red Ventures was using automated technology for content  long before the AI byline began cropping up in November.  They mentioned this wordsmith tool, which you talked about, Tim, nicknamed MortGOTRON.  Or morgoat...  I don't know how you pronounce that.  MortGOTRON internally, because of its use in mortgage stories,  they said it had been used for at least a year and a half.  But the siloed natures of the teams across CNET and Red Ventures makes it difficult for journalists at the site to understand the chain of command.  Who's using what tools and when?  So no blame on our friends at CNET.  I'm very happy, frankly, to blame Red Ventures and any equity capital company,  because I feel like these guys are to some degree the bane of our existence.

If you want to perform, if you want to be in the first page on a Google search, you have to be using these tools.  So I know a lot of automotive properties are using them.  This is not proprietary software.  This is stuff that you can go out and license that anybody can use.  I'll tell you what keywords that you need to inject into your content.

And also, I mean, they've seen that probably made a lot of mistakes, so the rest of us don't have to  and can learn from them in terms of disclosure.  But I feel like while we're not doing any of this and have no plans to do this,  in fact, it might not really work well for us anyhow, I would not say that at Fast Company,  we'll never use AI in any form because I think things are going to happen quite quickly.  And there might be ways to use it, which are actually completely above board and reasonable  and result in better content rather than just cheaper content.

It's called Plugged In and if you go to our Fast Company homepage,  there should be a newsletter's link that will let you subscribe.  And because I'm interested in the history of cartoons, I asked chat GPT what the first TV cartoon was  and every time I asked, it would give a different answer, many of them very convincing  and none of them correct.  Basically there are so many things where chat GPT has no idea what it's saying  and unless you already know what the answer is, you might well be fooled  because it is able to lie in such a convincing fashion.

So in a way then, it makes you wonder, should we be, you know, your company Github,  and you can you can disclaim this again, I know you have nothing to do with Skrtina,  but is getting a little heat right now from the open source community over its AI code generator, Copilot,  which is kind of impressive. Copilot also uses, we should mention, the same open AI technology as chat GPT.

Start time: 1973.36
End time: 2005.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is using GPT. Yeah, I was going to say I can't comment on any of the loss, it's not any of that stuff,  but Copilot does use the GPT 3.5, you know, a large language model that chat GPT is based on.  It uses something called Codex, which is specifically focused on source code rather than, you know,  the corpus that chat GPT uses, which is much more broad.  But if you use chat GPT to say, write me a program that does this, this and this,  most of its data set is probably coming from. Yeah, because chat GPT can write code.

We know somebody who used chat GPT to write a PowerShell script for Steve on security now  that looked through your last pass vault and told you some of its attributes and it worked.  And it was a lot easier to develop it because chat and I guess Copilot would be even better.  Now, clearly with Copilot, unlike chat GPT, there must be some rules in there to say, oh, and by the way,  make sure this isn't made up that it actually works. Right.

Start time: 2053.29
End time: 2149.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For the most part, I mean, there are suggestions that you can get that will not run.  So it is that's why we call it Copilot. It's not do it for you.  It's your Copilot, you know, autofill and suggestions, you know, plus one. Right.  So and the more that you use it, the more that it gets to know your code,  it does get to know kind of your style and your intent.  And it can give you better and better suggestions for what you're doing.  But no, you can absolutely the same way you could get a wrong suggestion.  You could get, you know, a wrong, I guess, paragraph from chat GPT.  You could get some incorrect code suggestions for the most part, though.  I think that the training model there is a little bit better because it is, you know,  focused more on one thing rather than, you know, however great the corpus is for everything that chat GPT is doing.  And as I said, it is learning based on your own style and the stuff that is in your project folder.  But no, I mean, this is why I always tell people, look, Copilot is amazing.  And it has saved me so much time, especially with boilerplate stuff.  But if you're trying to use it to just you think you can just automate it to write a program for you,  you might get lucky if it's something really simple like a PowerShell script or something like that.  But you you really need to have a better idea of what you're doing so that you can actually see what code it's suggestion  suggesting and then make edits if that needs to be the case.  But even if you still need to make edits, I think there's still value there because it can save you,  you know, a lot of time of having to manually Google and, you know, command C, command V from Stack Overflow or wherever.

Transcript:  Yeah, people. And that's it.  Every programmer knows this, but maybe a lot of civilians don't that almost all code is to some degree or another copy and paste from somebody else.  That's kind of how it works. So Copilot is a natural way to do this.  Copilot is quite impressive. It's quite amazing.  Here's the story from earlier this month by Checkpoint Research, a malware research company.  They call it OPONE AI. Cyber criminals starting to use chat GPT.  In Checkpoint Research, previous blog, we described how chat GPT successfully conducted a full infection flow from creating  convincing spear phishing email to running a reverse shell capable of accepting commands in English.  That's pretty scary.  This is a case of something called Info Stealer, which was created late last year by chat GPT.  A cyber criminal showing how he used chat GPT to write the code.  Looks like JavaScript. A hard coded, how to write code to basically steal files from a FTP server.  It's kind of amazing what they're doing.  One of the things that really becomes obvious is this is a conversation a year ago we might not have had.  This has happened all of a sudden out of nowhere.

Transcript:  I mean, I honestly I think that the way that and I know that a lot of creators are really freaked out by generative art and and generative music and all this stuff.  And I understand the fear.  But for me, what excites me about this is that the best AI art that I've seen has been from actual artists like those are the people who've been using the best prompts or taken some of the prompts and have taken some of the results and then made really great things.  And I think with music, it's the exact same way.  Right.  Like you might be able to get something that sounds slightly better than than than stock music, but it's still not going to be great.  Right.  So I think it's going to take a real artist to then take that and edit it and interpolate it and do what real artists have always done and turn it into something else.  And so the what I've tried to been trying to tell people, because this isn't going away.  This, whatever your feelings on on this stuff is, it's not going away and it's only going to become bigger. We can have conversations about ethics and we should, we can have conversations about safety rails and we should, but this is not going away.  So I've been the conversation I've been having with people for the last year or so is like embrace this as a tool to your arsenal to make new, unique and better things rather than looking at this as some sort of existential threat because you're not going to outpace this.  This is not going to be something that you can get away from.  But it might be something that if you are able to use, you could actually enhance, you know, this the stuff that you that you do naturally.  And that goes for writers as well.

I don't know what you call Wolfram Alpha search engine for knowledge or something.  But he said we should partner because we're good at getting the math right, which chat GPT is terrible.  And then if we worked if we work together, we maybe get something out of it.  He pointed out some really hysterical examples.  This is his article from his blog at Stephen Wolfram dot com.  Some hysterical examples of just chat TPT getting it terribly wrong.  How far is Chicago from Tokyo to which chat GPT confidently says the distance from Chicago, Illinois to Tokyo,  Japan is approximately seventy six hundred miles.  That'd be twelve thousand two hundred kilometers.  It's a very long distance. Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Turns out it's not even close.  It's six thousand three hundred thirteen miles.  So you correct it.  So you you you tell it and it says thank you for correcting me.  You're correct.  Of course is the distance is six thousand three hundred thirteen miles.  How far is Chicago to Tokyo?  And then it gets it right, at least in that continued conversation.  I think that's interesting.  But kids, don't don't do your math homework with chat GPT.  Stick to Wolfram Alpha because it doesn't even know three to the power of seventy three, which is pretty pathetic.  By the way, not even close.  It said 14 billion.

And it did better than random selection.  And it came close to humans in a couple of categories.  It got a C plus passing, but it's not like it.  Right. It didn't quite pass.  But it is it. But it is impressive because the interesting thing, though, was that it did significantly better than random selection.  Like it wasn't one of those things where you're just randomly, you know, OK, how would you have done if you were just randomly selecting the answer?  So it had some better accuracy and in some categories it was close to humans.  But obviously, this is only for the multiple choice parts.  And it did better in certain areas than others.  But, I mean, to me, all this really says is, OK, then you if you're big concern, whether it's high school students or, you know, graduate students.  You know, and professionals taking tests, if your big concern is the AI cheating at the test, well, then you need to start changing how you're testing.  You're obviously not testing the right things like that to me is the big takeaway.  We shouldn't be freaked out that, you know, these these these AIs are able to pass the test.  It's more like, OK, well, what's the goal of this?  And are we testing the right way? And I think in most cases, the answer would be no, we're not testing the right way.

No, like even if you could potentially automate things and do things better than like your typical public defender.  Do you really think that the you know, the Bar Association and the various lobbying groups for lawyers, you really think that they would allow this and their court is absolutely not.

They were one of the founders of OpenAI and now they have a even better deal with OpenAI.  The rumor was 10 additional 10 billion dollars.  I think that was confirmed by such an Adela over a period of time, obviously, and that chat GPT or that kind of technology will be used in Microsoft Office.  But I think a number of people are saying the real the real thing to watch is Bing.  Thoughts about that? I know you work at.  I work at GitHub, so so you know, which is owned by Microsoft.

And I don't blame them because Google has amassed, you know, and this is not in any way to try to integrate any other company.  But but they have probably mass like the largest quantity of AI talent from academia and from industry of anyone.  And the fact that it was chat GPT, which was interesting to me about that, is that it wasn't really that demonstrably different from any of the other GPT three things that have been available.  It was just the interface that I think made it so accessible has become this very mainstream thing where, you know, I've been thinking and have been talking about, you know, OpenAI stuff for several years.  But now this is a mainstream thing because the interface was so ripened.  And yeah, I definitely think that search is a great area where it could be helpful.  People have created extensions to add chat GPT things alongside Google results, and it's better.  And I think that, you know, Google results at Google's the primary search engine that I that I use and the results have gotten worse over time.  And I don't think that it's because of the SEO stuff.  I think it's because Google has optimized for different sorts of results and they've, you know, wanted to highlight other things.  And so I often end up typing Reddit into my search.  Yes, I find that I get much better results from Reddit than I do because those are what you're really doing is asking for information from real experts about a topic.

So searching Google for query and then adding Reddit to it is a good alternative.  But people have created, you know, like kind of side by side extensions and chat GPT stuff to Google things.  And I think that, yeah, this is an opportunity for Bing.  I think is an opportunity for a lot of consumer products.  Obviously, one of the big wins here is for for Azure, for, you know, other businesses who want to take advantage of those models and build it into their their products, having kind of a eyes a service.  Think, you know, look, this is going to be hot.  Everybody is going to be this is going to become an arms race.  Right. Even more than it already has been.  But for whatever reason, you know, open eyes, been the first to really commercialize this in a way that the mainstream of the world is going to be.  In a way that the mainstream understands.  And it's exciting.  I mean, personally, as a technologist, to me, all the other kind of fears we would have around it, like I look at this as a moment of this is this is exciting.  Like to me, this is much more the next big thing versus the metaverse.  Like this is much more exciting.  I agree.  And seems much more tangible as to what the next big place of computing is going to be.  Forget about the metaverse stuff.  The AI stuff is, I think, really what's exciting.

I don't think Sam Altman or anyone from open AI would be like, oh, this is the most innovative thing and no one else has done this.  I think what they would say is this is the first time that the public has actually been able to interact with it in a way that had a really good user interface.  That's what LeCun said.  Chatbot was a brilliant user interface.  That's what LeCun said.

So they tried to be bold, but they weren't quite as bold as chat GPT.  So they didn't get as much credit and they got a lot more flack about it.  I think partially because Meta is the kind of company that's going to get flack no matter what it does,  which is not true of OpenAI at least yet.

Transcript:  I've been using a search engine that was founded about five years ago by former Google search executives called Neva.  Are you familiar with this?

Start time: 3300.00
End time: 3319.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read a big story on it.  Oh, in fact, that's how I learned about it.  Yeah, the CEO is a former top guy at YouTube.  Yeah.  And he got a little bit depressed about the monetization of search.  The insurdification of Google.  He worked at Google so he went off to do a search engine with a paid model.

Start time: 3319.04
End time: 3424.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the premise.  We don't run ads.  In fact, even when Google started, Larry Page famously wrote,  a search engine can't have advertising or it will then become beholden to the advertisers.  They only held that off for a few years before getting involved in advertising.  So I pay five bucks a month for Neva.  I get a lot of they actually give you a free one password account and other stuff.  But I think it's really good.  And also because they're in this arms race, they added a AI generator at the beginning of search results.  So I search for chat, GPT and Bing just now.  And this is the result I got from the AI.  I think AI is a very good synopsizing and summarizing other content.  So they even do footnotes to say where this information comes from.  CNET, the Guardian Observer and the Verge.  Microsoft is reportedly integrating AI technology such as chat GPT into its Bing search engine,  which could potentially revolutionize search as we know it.  This technology is capable of generating a wide variety of text in human like ways in response to written prompts.  Microsoft hopes to launch this feature before the end of March in a bid to make being more competitive with Google.  I think Google should be scared not just by Bing, but by Neva.  I think this is pretty cool.  The only doubt I've been using Neva full time instead of Google everywhere, including on my iPhone for about a month now.  The only negative, the only hit on it is it's amazing how quickly Google comes back with the result.  Neva, there's a palpable second or two.  But other than that, the results are excellent.  I love this AI thing and there's no ads.  It doesn't favor Google content over anybody else's content.

Start time: 3427.43
End time: 3443.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe there's a dash of Bing in Neva's technology along with some of its own technology as well.  Oh, is it interesting?  I believe they've licensed some data.  OK. They have their own crawler, right?  Yes.  I think they kind of mashed together some of their own stuff and some stuff they've licensed.

Currently showing top news from all sources.  I don't know.  There's something going on there that I can move around that slider.  I think it's very innovative.  I have no relationship with them.

Transcript:  They're smart folks.  They've added a lot of stuff since they launched.  It's brave to say we're going to go against Google.  Yeah. I mean, they're a tiny company.  But maybe, you know, now...  We've all been used to getting our search free for the last 20 years.  But I think if there is a time where we're at an inflection point where the idea of going up against Google no longer sounds quite so insane, it's now.  Although, of course, Microsoft is probably in the best place to take advantage of this inflection point given that it's already a large company with a large search engine.  Although, I am curious how they could shortly roll out chat GPT as part of Bing just because of this issue with accuracy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the way Neva does it with the footnotes is the only way you could do it, right?  And this is the difference between that knowledge graph in Google, which is almost entirely from Wikipedia, almost always, and is never sourced.  At least Neva says where this stuff came from.  I've found it actually quite useful.  I'll ask it kind of technical questions like coding questions, like describe Dijkstra's algorithm.  And it does a really good job.  This is exactly what chat GPT should be good at.  And nevertheless, to beat Google at its own game is not maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe now's the time to do it.

I don't want them to be a Bing licensee or a DuckDuckGo licensee.  They also, by the way, when you install it, they install a tracker, which an anti-tracker tool plug in in your browser, which shows you what trackers are on Fast Company.  There you go.  Not bad.  There are far worse.  Let me tell you.  There's somewhere there's 30 or 40 trackers on a single page.  It's kind of kind of amazing.

Start fresh.  But you at least can bring your followers with you.  It's very easy to do that on mastodon.  I like our twit social because you have to be a twit listener to be in there.  So it is a community.  Harry's on SFBA, which is for San Francisco Bay Area people.  The local timeline really gets a point of view if you choose wisely.  When you're on somewhere like mastodon, that social is just like a mini Twitter basically.  It's everybody who didn't look farther than the biggest instance.  And it's also pretty big now.  It's well over 100,000 people.  So that could be good.

I was also on a smaller one, xoxo.zone for my very favorite conference.  And I did migrate, but I never used it.  So I did go ahead and migrate the followers that I had amassed there over to.  And there was some overlap, I'm sure.  But I did migrate those followers over to the main account that I'm on.  And that was actually seamless.  I was worried about what that process was going to be like, but it wasn't difficult.  So that's good news.

I also have something on pixel fed, which is a Fediverse, not mastodon, but kind of Instagram clone.  And I really like it on pixelfed.social.  I really like it because it's Instagram like it used to be with just a bunch of photos.  Golly, whoever thought of that?  No reels?  No dancing chipmunks?  What kind of place is that?  And one of the nice things about Ivory and these other clients is you can actually have multiple accounts in your client.  So you can have your photos on pixelfed and your toots somewhere else.  Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Worldwide Technology.  Worldwide Technology is at the forefront of innovation.  We love these guys.  It was actually the last trip Lisa and I took before COVID.  We went out there in March of 2020 to visit their Advanced Technology Center.  Wow, is that cool?  You guys probably remember in the old days, Ziff Davis had that big testing lab in Foster City.  And that's why PC Magazine could test a hundred printers because they had the capability of doing that.  You remember that?  Well, that's what the ATC is all about for enterprise technology.  That's Worldwide Technology's business is enterprise technology.  They created the Advanced Technology Center to try to research all of this great technology out there for enterprise.  It now has all the technologies from all the leading OEMs, including some of the big new disruptors, more than half a billion dollars in equipment.  It started one rack in one building.  It's spread to four or five buildings now, many, many racks.  But here's the great part.  And I really honor WWT for this.  They don't keep it to themselves.  Sure, their engineers use it to spin up proofs of concept and learn about new technologies and so forth to help their clients.  But they also make it available to you.  The Advanced Technology Center, you don't have to go to St. Louis.  You can use it anywhere in the world.  They offer hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs featuring solutions that include technologies representing all the latest, the newest advances in cloud and security,  networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics and AI, DevOps and on and on and on.

Yeah, there's only two days left.  Twit.tv slash survey 23.  We survey our audience once a year.  We don't want to spy on you.  We don't put.  We can't put trackers in a podcast.  It's RSS.  But we'd like to know more about you.  Our advertisers would like to know who those ads are going to.  We can't compete with people like Spotify who will spy on your every move and know who you are and all that stuff.  It's the surveys, our only tool, but it helps us a lot.  So it should only take a few minutes.  It's completely optional.  Of course, answer any questions you want.  Twit.tv slash survey 23.  I want to get I want to get people from every show participating, though, so we know about what we're doing and whether it fits your needs.  Twit.tv slash survey 23.  Last chance.  Don't put it off.  And we thank you in advance.  Some really interesting news from the Department of Justice.  There was a ransomware gang called Hive.  Ransomware has become a plague.  Obviously, it's really a problem, although I saw that the revenues and they know this because they can look at Bitcoin transfers were significantly down in 2022.  And the thinking is because people aren't paying.  It's not that ransomware is not hitting you.  It's just people have said, screw that.  We're not giving you any money.  Maybe they've got better strategies for mitigating a ransomware attack.  But also the DOJ is going after them.  This was a press conference from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Omonico.  It turns out, I think this is fascinating, that the U.S. had infiltrated the FBI had infiltrated the Hive ransomware group last July.  And as a result, under the, and maybe this is why ransomware is going down too, under the, you know, under the covers, that's not quite right, officers were able to warn victims of impending attacks in secret.  Saying, hey, watch out, they're going after you.  They also got decryption keys.  And they were able to hand out more than 300 decryption keys to people who had been hit by the Hive ransomware, saving them more than $130 million.  The U.S. estimates Hive and its affiliates, it's one of those ransomware as a service companies.  I don't want to use the word company, but that's kind of what it is.  Collected over $100 million from more than 1,500 victims.  They went after, and this was their mistake, hospitals, school districts, critical infrastructure.  In more than 80 countries around the world, one hospital was left unable to accept new patients because of Hive.  They worked with the UK's National Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies around the world to help victims.  In the UK, 50 organizations were given decryption keys.  And on Thursday, the FBI shut it down.  They took Hive's website and communications networks down with the help of police forces in Germany and the Netherlands.  That is a successful attack on the attackers.  I don't know if they arrested anybody.  I don't see that.  And that's the problem because as the head of intelligence at Mandiant, John Hultquist said, until you arrest them, they're not going to be gone.  It's like cockroaches. They just move somewhere else.  It'll slow them down.  If you went to the Hive crew's website, you would see this notice from the FBI.  This hidden site has been seized with lots of badges.  This is not Hive was not the biggest of the ransomware gangs.  There are bigger ones, although Reval, which was perhaps the biggest in 2020 and 2021, did get arrested around the world.  So this is good. Dark Side was taken down in June of 2021.  This is good. This is what it takes.  Let's see. What else? Intel. You want to talk about Intel?  Not a good quarter for Intel. The worst beating in over a decade, and or rights from Apple Insider.  They're maybe a little happy about a little happier than they ought to be about this.  32% drop in revenue since year over year since the holiday quarter of last year, 2021, actually.  Fourth quarter results coming out revenue 14 billion down 30% year over year.  Entire year revenue down 20% year over year.  This goes along with drops of 30, 40% in PC sales as well.  So it's just been a bad year for PCs. Does that mean anything, Harry?

Start time: 4376.62
End time: 4446.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Intel has known and acknowledged for a while now that it's in this rebuilding process after falling way behind other chip companies  and that it was not going to result in fantastic numbers immediately because they have to get back to where their process is competitive again with other technologies.  And I believe they've said that maybe by year after next, they think they'll be in a place where the technology is great again,  which is maybe as long as they give Pat Gelsinger, their CEO, time to get there.  Maybe that's when we can really judge them. And if the numbers are still this bad then, it's a really bad sign.  But I think that at least as of when Gelsinger started and I wrote a feature about him last year,  the board had given him quite a bit of runway understanding that it was going to be difficult  and there would be more bad news before there was any good news, although they may not have anticipated the degree to which the PC business would be so crummy.  And I think people and companies may just be postponing PC purchases because everybody is so cautious about the economy this year.

And if you look at the increase in ships between 2020 and now, not to say that some of the gains haven't been impressive,  but if you're not an enthusiast, you're not actually going to really notice, I think, for a lot of people.  And it's increasingly looking more and more like what was happening.  All that excess buying in 2020 and even a little bit into 2021 was a combination of both the supply chain,  maybe even making more of a frenzy because people couldn't get things, people having to work from home.  It's an anomaly. And I think to then, as a lot of businesses did, try to base it as like, well, this is the new baseline was clearly a mistake  because that has not continued. And I think that with the, I guess, being able to kind of look back,  we can say, no, why would we have expected those trends to continue year over year?  Because that's just not consumer buying patterns in the last decade or so. We haven't seen that.

Start time: 4532.10
End time: 4571.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I definitely think it is. I mean, I think we've got a long time to go before that.  And certainly people's usage patterns show that they're shifting away from desktop computing.  If you look at overall utilization, what devices they're consuming content on and even creating content on.  But if you look at overall time, I think that number is going up and desktop usage probably staying pretty much static for the past few years.  So, yeah, I think we still have a long way to go there. But if you also look at the number of layoffs that we've seen lately,  I mean, that's a lot fewer corporate laptops that are being needed. And certainly with nobody hiring, that means that there are fewer laptops being needed there too.  And if you do get hired now, I think there's probably a pretty good chance of getting a hand-me-down.

We had on Wednesday on Twig, we had just completely a representative because I think what, you know, we talked about these layoffs and I think tech industry since the beginning of the year, 200,000 jobs lost.  We talk about that in just kind of abstract numbers. I wanted to bring a face to it.  So we had Richard Hay on. He was a Google engineer, had been an engineer for 17 years at Google and was one of the people just summarily dismissed, kind of abruptly lost his job without any warning.  His boss didn't even know ahead of time. And I wanted just to kind of bring home the face of it because these are, that's 200,000 people with families, with bills, with mortgages, with rent.  And they don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. That's a huge hit. And I don't want to diminish it in any way by just talking wrong numbers, you know?

Start time: 4636.18
End time: 4692.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It really is a shame how that has to happen these days. Like the corporatification of layoffs is really tragic and nauseating, honestly, you know, having recently been through that myself.  How depersonalized it has been mandated that you cannot have any empathy. You cannot talk to anybody about the situation. You are very restricted in what you can say, when you can say it.  And, you know, as someone who was trying to be an empathic leader, someone who, you know, treated his employees like his friends, to have to go through that is really, really difficult on both sides of the equation.  So I don't know where this pattern came from or why it is almost legislated into corporate law these days, but it is really disgusting that that is where we've gotten to a point now where your ability to be an empathic leader has to end at the time when it's most important for you to be an empathic person.

But I mean, there were stories about Google employees who came into work and waved their badge to get in and either it turned green and they were able to go in or it turned red and they knew they had been laid off.  And that's how they got the news. And I don't understand what the excuse is for that.

Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, there's there's there's no good way to do layoffs is the reality. But there are there are ways that you can do it worse. Right. And I agree.  I agree. Like for all the excuses that and this has been a thing I think I've noticed because I first was seeing this in media where people would find out sometimes that they were laid off by losing access and slack and then people would disappear.  And it would be like, you know, like the snap and and you're like, what happened? You know, brought back PTSD one day when people lost access for slack for completely unrelated reason and freaked out.  What does this mean? It just fired. Yeah. Right. And and you know, you do this for for the automation reasons. Oh, we don't want people to have access to things.  It's like, OK, especially for people who you're paying a certain amount of money and who you have worked for you for a certain amount of time.  It's like have some freaking humanity. You know, there's a way to do it.  There's a way to take access away. It doesn't mean that someone is entering the office at 7am, hasn't checked their email, their personal email, doesn't know what's going on, waves a badge and finds out that way.  Like that that's just it's awful. And there are better ways to do it. There's no good way to do it. Period. But there are ways to do it that are worse than others.

Transcript:  So I didn't either. That's that's a massive loss for them.  And that's a massive that's a massive concern for open source because of all the work and money and resources that Google has given open source projects over the years,  sponsoring conferences and other things. That's been a discussion that has come up in the last couple of weeks with these big layoffs is what does that mean for the open source ecosystem?  And I don't think that it's a wrong one because budgets are tight everywhere.  And these are things that, you know, that some people in the open source movement don't like to acknowledge.  But a lot of the money and a lot of the funding really does come from these corporations, whether you're comfortable with that or not.  And if those checks go away, like, what does that mean?  Because the sustainability and open source has been a really big topic for the last number of years.  And corporate goodwill or corporations paying their own way for services and support is one thing.  But but the goodwill aspect, which has been increasingly a thing that we've seen happen, like I can see that potentially at some places, you know, going away.  And that's that's really discouraging.  And and I think it have really negative consequences because people haven't always wanted to maybe acknowledge how much of a role those checks and that funding can really play for a lot of small projects.

And so, yeah, there were a lot of, you know, kind of shadow groups of people.  Well, you know, yeah, you don't know, but people check in with one another.  I mean, that's what I was doing. I was checking it with my friends at Microsoft.  I'm in a few group chats and that's what I was doing.  And then, you know, checking Twitter and and seeing, you know, when some people were laid off and whatnot.  And and when you're talking about numbers this big, it's not about performance.  It really is, you know, decisions made usually about entire divisions, slash, division areas.

Transcript:  Yeah, one of the stories. And again, I hate to I'm not going to put you on the spot.  You don't represent Microsoft by in any stretch of the imagination.  But one of the things that we did learn is that Microsoft's VR AR HoloLens division suffered massive cuts.  And and that sounds to me like more of a strategic decision to not pursue those areas and instead of making hardware to make their software available to companies like HTC and Microsoft.  And then you know, Microsoft and Metta that are going to make the hardware and Apple, one imagines, that are going to make the hardware and then make the productivity software for that hardware, which actually probably is a better bet than putting all your chips in on the legsless, sexless people wandering around in a low poly count.

So I mean, I would be cautious about assuming that Microsoft doesn't have any AR VR slash metaverse platform ambitions forever.  But if they do, maybe this seems like a little bit of a reset.  And it seems perfectly sensible at this point to redeploy some of that mental bandwidth and resources into AI,  which so clearly is going to have so much impact starting at this very moment as opposed to the metaverse, which is still a maybe at some point and maybe not to the degree we expected kind of thing.

Mark Gurman saying Apple is going to push off its, you know, spectacle based AR vision for at least a couple of years to 2025, if not later, because they can't get it working.  Even their headset, which they're still rumors are strong.  They're going to offer for three thousand dollars this year has a battery in your pocket because it's too heavy to wear on your head.  So, yeah, I think there are some fundamental technical issues with the problem is we all read the same science fiction stories by William Gibson and Neil Stephenson.  We all want this.  We all want to jack into the metaverse.  We all want this.  But it's not sci-fi.  I mean, the battery.

My point is more like I wish that we'd have been investing more over the last decades in looking at that as a power source than some of these other things, because I do think that in my mind, that's the only way you can get the long lasting battery life and the micro-ization that you'll need for these things.  But I just don't think it's going to be possible with lithium polymers.  I just don't.  I'm not sure that I understand.

Transcript:  Our listeners in Australia are probably aware of the fact that a tiny cesium-137 capsule went missing on its way to Perth this past week.  Just one.  Let me see if I can find a picture of it, because it's so small.  They're warning the public not to touch it, but it's so small.  I don't even know how you would find it.  It's about the size of one of those little lithium ion batteries that you put in your pocket.  Here it is.  Here's the size next to an Australian something.  Ten pence piece.  I don't know what that is.  Six millimeters by eight millimeters.  If you see it, don't touch it.  Don't pick it up.  Don't taste it.  Yeah, it's like your guys are too young to remember when I was a kid.  There were constant ads not to touch blasting caps.  None of you remember that.  Do you remember that, John?  Blasting caps.  That was like maybe that was a major problem.  I know. Kids, if you see this, don't touch it.  Well, kids, if you see a six millimeter by eight millimeter shiny silver capsule, don't touch it.

Transcript:  I don't know.  To Christian's point, though, we haven't seen any real progress in alternate sources for power in a while.  I remember at CES about a decade ago, there was like a hall full of portable devices for hydrogen power, basically,  so you could have a fuel cell in your laptop or on your phone even.  And there were so many different vendors.  It seemed like it was just a couple of years away.  Yeah.  I'm guessing they started popping, you know, exploding in people's pants.  And that was probably the end of that.  But we haven't really seen anything since then.  So certainly solid state batteries are just around the corner.  I think we'll see those soon.  Those will provide a pretty big step forward in terms of charging speed, discharge speed,  and will help to reduce the overall volume of a given capacity of battery.  But really, you know, like I said, biochemistry happens slowly.  There really isn't any kind of shot in the dark that's coming soon for portable devices, for cars, you know, supercapacitors and things like that.  I think we'll have some big gains in a decade or so.  But there's nothing like that coming for smaller stuff.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Microsoft's quarter was not great.  Revenue was up 2 percent.  Profit down 12 percent.  This primarily, I think, due to this PC drop off.  Both below Wall Street expectations.  Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said new business slowed in December,  but it expects and it expects growth to continue to slow in the current quarter, which ends March 31st.  On the other hand, I think Microsoft is very well positioned.  This open A.I. investment is looking very smart right now.  Clearly, if A.I. is taking off, businesses like Azure are going to do very well.  Nobody wants to invest in the storage and the TPU capacity that's required for learning big sets of data.  So they do it often in the cloud.  Microsoft, Google, Amazon, all benefiting for that.  So, you know, I think I would be bullish about Microsoft.  Christina, I think you're in a and certainly about GitHub.  GitHub passed 100 million developers this week.  Yes. Yes.

Start time: 5446.75
End time: 5521.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was very, very exciting news.  100 million developers and a couple of years ahead of schedule.  So the goal had been 20, 25.  We were able to hit it, you know, early 20, 23.  So very, very exciting about that.  And when you kind of look at the trajectory of how many developers have joined the platform, even in like going back to 2016, it's really ramped up.  And I think it's because it was one of the great things is, is that the definition of developer has has changed, I think, in a really important way.  And and so people who are working on working around code or making contributions that might not be, you know, code focused can still use platforms like GitHub.  You know, the kind of the rise of kind of the lower code movement around people who are building business applications and doing other types of things.  You see a lot of data scientists and other people doing really innovative stuff.  But again, in their mind, you know, 10 years ago, they might have said, oh, I'm not a developer.  Now you can be like, no, you are this.  The stuff that you're doing might not be code in a traditional sense, but it definitely is impacting things or in some cases is absolutely code.

And you will see people who will just use it to just manage their life, like to just have it as like a very organized kind of to do list thing.  And and that's really cool to see.  But as you see, novelists, people who use it for writing, I think that is definitely a really cool way.  Then we also see, you know, it used in really interesting ways, you know, like by, you know, people in NASA and in other organizations.  It's interesting to see a lot of the data science stuff is really interesting because you can see people putting their Jupyter notebooks and their other outputs there.  That I think is actually really great.  I think seeing notebooks has been such a great feature to to happen, I think, in code for a lot of reasons.  And as we've gotten better support for that stuff within GitHub, I think that's been a really cool thing to see the data sets and that stuff that people have used.  I've got that's really awesome to me because those are things that wouldn't fit with a lot of traditional code things, but is a really great way where we had an incident.  I think it was last year where we got rid of one of our original shorts URL shorteners.  And we did it because the code behind it was really antiquated and it hadn't been up kept.  But we had to wind up migrating a lot of the URLs over and kind of keep them working because it turned out that there were a number of academic papers where people had used the URL shortener, which would just go to a GitHub repo in their academic papers.  And that's always really interesting to see how many people will put the full data sets and other information of academic papers on GitHub repos.  That's always really cool to see.

I follow him because I do the advent of code coding problems and he does these every year.  And of course, here's one of the best programmers in the world.  This is what a Jupiter notebook looks like on GitHub.  He's got cartoons.  He's got code that runs.  He's got results.  I mean, it's amazing.  He's even got visualizations in here because Jupiter notebooks, which is just one of many kinds of notebooks, but Jupiter is probably the most popular, allow you to run code and write text.  So you can you could do true literate programming.  I think this is fantastic.  I am so impressed.  I think to me, this is a great use of GitHub.  I mean, this is actual Python code that runs exactly.

And all this.  This is a GitHub page.  This is a repository, which is pretty darn cool if you ask me.  Anyway, Microsoft tough tough quarter.  But I think the market rewarded missing its targets with a four percent bump in the stock price because I think of the future of AI and everybody knew that this PC slowdown was going to hit Microsoft just as much.  And if not more, because of course they make the operating system for most of these computers.  So I think you're a good company.  If I were you, Christine, I would keep that job.  Just my advice.

You say, well, I don't know them, but you do know the name I.T. Pro.  For the last decade, our partners at I.T. Pro have brought you engaging, entertaining I.T.  content to level up your career, your organization.  In fact, I think a great many of our listeners are I.T.  Pro members.  There are 227,000 people in the I.T.  Pro community.  That is a great learning community.  Many of them, Twitter listeners.  Well, I.T.  Pro has partnered now with ACI Learning, which really expands its reach.  This is really good news for all of us.  Expanded production capabilities.  ACI Learning is has expertise in not just I.T.  Pro is the best, but they also have Audit Pro.  So audit readiness is a big part of I.T.  These days they can help you there.  They also have a cyber security division, which is the best.  They have even learning hubs where you can go and learn in person, which for some people, at least part of the time, is a valuable adjunct to the online learning that I.T.  Pro is famous for.  One of the most widely recognized beginner certificates, the CompTIA A plus cert.  I know many of you in I.T.  That's where you started, right?  That desktop support cert.  CompTIA courses with I.T.  Pro from ACI Learning make it easy to go from being kind of a daydreamer about getting that career in I.T.  To actually having a career in I.T.  Earning those certs is really the most important thing to do to get into an entry level I.T.  position.  You don't have job experience, right?  You can't say, well, I did this and this.  But if you've got that cert, they know you've got the skills, the qualification.  And it gets you started to move on in your field.  And that's what I.T.  Pro from ACI Learning is so good at.  Tech is one industry where the opportunities now are outpacing growth, especially in cybersecurity.  There are more than a million open, unfilled jobs in cybersecurity right now.  A recent LinkedIn study predicts I.T.  jobs will be the most in-demand roles in 2023.  Don't waste time.  Get going.  This is a career that will reward you.  It's fun.  You're already interested in technology.  About a one-third of the information security jobs require a cybersecurity certification.  About 23% of I.T.  jobs require that, but a third require of cybersecurity jobs require a cert.  Organizations are obviously very hungry for cybersecurity talent, but they want to know  that you've got what it takes.  The average salary for cybersecurity specialists?  $116,000 a year.  ACI Learning's Information Security Analyst and Cybersecurity Specialist Programs can  help you get that money.  Get certified.  Get that job.  Last year, the global cybersecurity workforce gap grew bigger, not smaller.  It increased by 26.2% over 2021.  There's a job out there waiting for you.  ACI Learning offers multiple cybersecurity training programs that can prepare you to  The most popular cybersecurity certs, not in any particular order, CISSP.  I love, this is the one I want to do, EC Council's Certified Ethical Hacker.  I just thought that would be great to have CEH after my name.  Certified Network Defender.  There's a cybersecurity audit school.  That's a specialty that is going to be in huge demand as people need to prove compliance  to customers, to higher-ups, to regulators.  Very important job.  Learn cybersecurity frameworks.  They've got great classes in that too.  When, where, and how you learn makes a big difference.  ACI Learning makes it easy.  They offer fully customizable training.

So she got a lovely birthday present.  But I bought her a, you know, our, our young star quarterback, the rookie, Mr. irrelevant  Brock Purdy.  I brought her, bought her a Brock Purdy jersey to wear during the big, there's a big game  today for those of you who.  I learned about that.  Yes.  You didn't know at first though.  Sport ball.  What is that?  So I bought her a Brock Purdy, Purdy Jersey.  But see, I, now Marie, you tell me if I'm right or wrong on this.  I thought what size should I get?  And then I said, I'm getting the small, right?  Because if it's too small, that's fine.  If I got large, no, that would have been bad.  So a little husband tip, start with the smallest size, whether it's a shoe or a shirt, smart,  start with the smallest size.  You can always return it and get the next one up, which I'm going to have to do because  she's not that small.  She is, she's tiny.  I thought it would fit.  But I guess women's small is pretty small.  It's probably, you know, the equivalent of a five and a half shoe.  So I did something really gloomy last night.  I watched a movie called Two Leslie.

Transcript:  So this is proof that Twitter, for all its problems, still is very powerful.  Normally this time, or actually last month in December, you see, especially in Los Angeles,  which is, you know, it's a company town, billboards, ads in every magazine, TV ads for your consideration.  Movies that they want the members of the Academy to vote for, to nominate for best picture, best actor.  Because it makes a big difference in box office, right?  So there was a tiny little movie.  It only made $27,000 at the box office called Two Leslie.  The movie company could not possibly afford even one billboard on Sunset Strip for your consideration.  But somehow they got every mainstream A-list actor in the world to tweet something just like this.  This is Edward Norton.  I don't post a lot about film or actor performances.  Maybe I should more often.  But for those interested in really great acting, I'll share that Andrea Riseborough's portrayal in Two Leslie just knocked me sideways.  It's about the most fully committed, emotionally deep, and then there's a dot, dot, dot.  I don't know. Maybe there's more.  Oh, here it is.  Physically harrowing performances I've seen in a while.  Just raw and utterly devoid of performative BS.  This is tough, but really elegant and compassionate film by Michael Morris where the emotion is really learned.  I happened to catch it.  Wow, I was really three tweets staggered by the depth she reached.  Very rare. Check it out.  But turns out it wasn't just Edward Norton.  It was pretty much everybody in Hollywood tweeted this.  It was a mass Twitter campaign to get this actress who's frankly not well known an Oscar nomination.  Planchette, Steven Spielberg, Oprah, happy birthday, Oprah, Meryl Streep, Daniel Day-Lewis, Martin Scorsese.  But Brian Rowe pointed this out on Twitter.  All use this exact phrase, the greatest screen performance in the history of the cinematic medium.  Marie, you work in PR. Do you think that was a coincidence?

She got a nomination for best actress, beating out some people who everybody thought were shoeing,  including Viola Davis for Wakanda and I'm sorry, the Queen. Right. What was the name of it?  Woman King. Queen King. Woman King. Apparently great. I did not see it.  And then there was Till and the actress in Till who everybody thought both actresses snubbed by the Golden Globes and now snubbed by the Academy.  But this very little known actress with a film that made twenty seven thousand dollars.  Got all of this attention and got a nomination. That's the power of Twitter. Right.

Like I am and I followed this stuff for a long time.  They didn't have money for a campaign.  So this is a really interesting, I think, example of the right connected people stepping up and using social platforms to highlight something that otherwise would have been a good thing.  Something that otherwise would not have been getting the sort of attention, whether or not she's going to win or not remains to be seen.  But that's pretty fantastic.

I do want to congratulate Mark Maron who is billed as an executive producer probably because they couldn't pay him for it.  But he's a well-known podcaster, does the WTF podcast, famous comedian.  I feel like he's one of our own. He has a very large role. He's quite good.  Didn't you think Mark Maron was good in it, Ant? Do you know even know who he is?  He was the guy with the beard who did the...  And then the other guy who was in it is Bubbles from The Wire.  And I'm watching this guy and I'm saying I know this character. Who is this actor?  Remember Bubbs in The Wire? He was the kind of strung out junkie informer that was actually you couldn't take your eyes off him when he was on the screen. He's in it as well.

And Melissa Leo was nominated for Best Actress.  She won the following year for Best Supporting Actress for The Fighter.  And I don't think she would have won had she not been in Frozen River the year before, even though The Fighter had a very large campaign behind it.  I think that Melissa Leo won because of the Frozen River campaign the year earlier.  But no, but it's interesting to see. And you're right, Harry, like there are ethical things, but at the same time, yeah, they're all used in the same language because some PR person send it to actors.

I mean, I think that, you know, you having, if a very famous and influential person decides to have other people, voters over at their home to watch something, I don't think that breaks any rules.

As I'm watching it, I don't know.  I don't want to spoil it.  I'm thinking, don't do that.  Don't do it.  I know they're going to do it, but I don't want them to do it.  And they did it.  That's all I'm going to say.  I don't know.  That's not a spoiler.  Hey, by the way, there are a couple of cool things we didn't mention with GitHub.

But it has not worked well with code because that's what it's designed for.  Exactly.  And like when I was hit by the car five years ago and I broke my wrist, my primary hand, like typing was for before I was in a cast when I was kind of traction was impossible.  And it made coding basically impossible.  And I was using a lot of text to speech stuff or voice to text stuff rather.  And code was that was the biggest challenge.  And so when I looked at Hey, GitHub, I was like, OK, not only is it so cool that you can just speak what you want it to do and it can it can write it the right way in natural language.  But the fact is that you can say things like new line or you can say in in in in port pandas and other things and it's not getting confused because it's been trained for this specialized thing, as you said, which is really awesome.

Transcript:  Kind of incredible.  Interesting story about a DSB.  So I had never heard of a DSB not being a pilot.  But if you heard about the Elon jet tracker, that's what was using a DSB, which is a database.  It's actually technically a DSB exchanged.  And it was kind of like IMDB or Wikipedia.  It was created by users.  And the reason it worked is because jet airplanes have all airplanes, I guess, have transponders transpawning their tail number and their location as they fly around.  That's how they know where everybody is.  Air traffic control uses it.  And I imagine other planes use it.  Well, it turns out if you're an enthusiast, you can also have a little receiver on the ground and monitor all the traffic going ahead.  And then if somebody were to write away to aggregate that data onto a map and you had enough people with those little receivers all over the world, you'd have a pretty good tracking map of all the flights.  Well, that's what ADS, ADSB exchange was.  But and I say was because it was owned by one person.  A lot of people contributed.  But Dan Strufert founded the site and was the sole owner of the site.  And he sold it to Jetnet, which was, by the way, owned by Get Ready, a private equity company.  And at this point, there is a little rebellion going on, including by the guy who does Elon Jet, who said, I'm not going to use this data anymore and I'm not going to contribute it to it anymore.  It's understandable.  I mean, the server costs, the hosting costs were expensive.  ADSB exchange couldn't really monetize very well.  It's free to use.  They used advertising and then they had a kind of higher paid tier.  But it's still an expensive thing to run.  And so at some point, Strufert decided that he was going to sell it.  Jack Sweeney runs the Elon Jet Twitter account said, today is a sad day.  If you feed ADSB exchange, we encourage you to stop feeding.  ADSB exchange was founded on the principles of hobbyists, community, not for profit, private equity firms.  So it'll be interesting to see within a few hours after the sale became public, the 11,000 feeders, 11,000 people running these receivers dropped significantly to 9,500 people in a span of a few hours.  I don't know where it stands right now.  I'm not an expert on this, but I'd be very curious to see what happens.  One one user said, flight aware, flight radar, when Elon wins, all the guys who are out to get us win.  So, you know, remember the saga of, you know, Elon Jet and Elon chasing it off Twitter and he went to mastodon and then Elon blocked every mastodon mention on Twitter.  There was a there's a final line in that story.  It's kind of it's kind of sad Wednesday, they announced that they had been acquired kind of like IMDb or CDDB or all these other.  Fortunately, nobody's acquired Wikipedia.  I hope not.  And no one can acquire mastodon.  Again, this is the argument for these distributed places.  Jet net is owned by silversmith capital partners.  They were acquired last year.  The acquisition is the second of what the company anticipates will be several future acquisitions as Jet net expands is data driven product offerings for the aviation industry.  So you got a problem there.  If you've got volunteers freely uploading this data and suddenly you make a killing selling it and this private equity comes along.  You need the volunteers, don't you?  Anything to say about that or should we move on?

Start time: 7418.34
End time: 7437.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sort of sympathetic.  I'm sort of sympathetic, I guess, to the volunteers at the same time.  The jet trackings that I know it's legal.  I'm not arguing the legality at all, because obviously you have to be able to the FAA has to be able to know what planes are in the air.  I'm not questioning any of that.  But I do think the jet tracking stuff is gross.  I do.

Start time: 7438.31
End time: 7455.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I understand.  Honestly, I understand Elon's point.  I mean, but I mean, it's not exactly assassination coordinates.  And Sweeney could have done some things to help Elon like delaying the tweet by an hour or two to give him a chance to move on.

Start time: 7455.00

Transcript:  I'm not saying that it was an assassination thing.  I think that was the hyperbole.  People in fandoms like teenage girls have been doing this for years for their favorite pop stars.  And it's gross.  It was gross then.  And they would put stuff on Twitter and on Tumblr and whatnot.  It's gross.  Now, I do feel for, I guess, like the aviation enthusiast community who feels like this thing they've been contributing to has now been sold to private equity who will be making money off of it.  But at the same time, like the data is either open or it's not.  You know what I mean?  Like you can create your own thing.  But I mean, this is this is public data for a reason.

And the thing that really sticks in my mind is these poor people go out of their doors of their apartment.  And at any time of the day or night, there are hundreds of fans standing there waiting for them.  They have to have big security guards just to get them to the car and barriers.  And it's and I'm starting to read much to my chagrin Prince Harry's spare.  And it's somewhat the similar situation.  It killed Princess Diana.

Transcript:  Right.  Well, and the way that a lot of the paparazzi finds where the celebrities are going to be is that they track their jets because a lot of them have if they own their own jet, then it's registered.  And if they are simply renting one, then it's harder.  But like, you know, Taylor Swift owns her own plane.  And now she's doing the thing, I think, where she like hides the registration, which you can do a certain way.  People still her fans are insane.  And and I said this as a big Taylor Swift fan, but not one who appreciates or encourages any of this because I think this stuff is just gross and disgusting.  K-pop fans are the same way where they will literally track exactly where people are at all times to try to know and put it up on the Internet and like not realize.  And then they get mad about the paparazzi, you know, stalking their their favorite stars.  It's like, how do you think they're figuring out exactly where they're landing, you know, and then showing up at private airports or, you know, God forbid, they're having to fly commercial, you know, showing up literally a baggage claim outside L.A.  Like that's that's because people are doing things like this and they're they're tracking their every movement.  And there's something there's something gross about that.  And again, I think that's I'm not trying to say that everybody in fact, most of the people part of this community are not involved in that at all.  But I do think that, you know, when we have those discussions and again, I don't think that calling it assassination was in any way correct.  But there there is this very gross aspect of for very for high profile people of having no privacy because you have really obsessive people out there who are tracking their every move and then in turn passing that on to, you know, people who are then going to take photos to sell for lots of money.

I'm sure it was at the one that I saw in New Jersey as well.  This was in 2018.  So which was the last time she toured.  But yeah, there was something like that that said that, you know, that there, you know, your photo may be used, you know, by that by being at this concert like you've consented, you know, to your photo being used, you know, in a database for her for whatever the purpose might be.  Which, you know, fair enough.  If it's something that if you want to attend this concert, you have to make that trade off.  There are plenty of people I'm sure who be like, well, I will never go to a concert that does that.  But I obviously so many people have my face, my face is in so many databases.  I wanted to see the concert.

The images are being transferred to a Nashville command post where they were cross-referenced to the database of hundreds of the pop stars and hundreds of the pop stars known stalkers.  Everybody who went by would stop and stare at it and the software would start working.  And and presumably if you were one of those people, some big burly guy with a walkie talkie would walk over and say, excuse me, sir.  Now this is relevant to today because it's been happening and we've talked about this before at Madison Square Garden.  The Dolans who own MSG and Madison Square Garden owns a bunch of other stuff.

Sorry, lady.  You can't come in.  Had to wait outside out front while her girls watched the Rockettes found out it was because she works for a law firm that has a lawsuit with MSG.  And apparently the Dolans have been doing this.  MSG has been doing this to any lawyer that has anything going on with MSG.  They have face recognition and they will lock you out.

Transcript:  The mom said, I don't know anything about this.  This is not my...I'm not suing them.  Sorry, lady.  And of course, James Dolan who gave a fairly fiery interview about this a couple of days ago says, that's all right.  It's a private institution to which the Liquor Licensing Authority in New York says, well, not exactly.  Because when you have a liquor license, there are caveats, covenants, things you agree, including being open to the public.  You can't have a private liquor license.  So there is some question.  In fact, New York State Attorney General Letitia James is paying attention investigating New York State legislatures have introduced a bill that would ban face recognition in sporting events.  And now the Liquor Authority, the New York State Liquor Authority, SLA, is saying your liquor license is in jeopardy.  Dolan gave an interview Thursday, a fiery, I'm told, I didn't watch it, interview with Fox 5, Channel 5 in New York, in which he defended his family's right to block anybody we don't like from coming in.  And of course, Madison Square Garden is the home of the Rangers hockey team and a couple of lawyers.  Now, we mentioned earlier, you don't want to get on the bad side of lawyers.  I say, well, sue your ass.  And I think there probably will be some lawsuits.  Dolan says, well, all right, Liquor Authority, you watch.  I'm going to pick a day and we're not going to serve any beer at a Rangers game and then see how you feel.

It's been another thing to be like, oh, you work at a law firm that's involved in litigation with my company.  So you're banned from entering the premises.  I mean, a that's really concerning that you have like the facial data of everybody who works at law firm like that's that's concerning right there.  And then B, it's like, really, really?

Wanna hang out.  All right.  One more break.  Then we are going to wrap this puppy up but it's such an important advertiser.  I want to tell everybody you gotta get bit warden bit warden is my choice for password manager.  I know a lot of you followed our advice.  I'm sorry and went with the other guys that hasn't ended up so well.  We didn't know honest.  If you're looking for a better password manager can I say in my experience open source is always the way to go with anything like this because you know exactly what's going on.  If at any point you don't like it you can fork it.  In fact, bit warden a lot of people run their own server with the bit warden vault.  So it's not on bit wardens vault.  You can do that with your your your individual account.  That's awesome.  And bit warden has its own server software.  But there's a beautiful rust fork of it called vault warden.  You can run if you don't want to run that.  That's the beauty of open source.  Bit warden is the only open source cross platform password manager you can use at home at work or on the go.  It's trusted by millions.  Steve Gibson.  I think he knows bit warden is a sponsor but I know Steve is a pretty independent thinker.  He was the guy who turned us on last pass in the beginning.  He moved off last pass to bit warden as well.  I've been on bit warden for several years.  We had been using last pass enterprise.  We are moving now to bit warden enterprise.  Russell started that process this week.  I'm really I'm really excited about this.  And I love it because bit warden lets you be an individual.  I have my individual account but you can also have an enterprise account.  Now let me explain.  Of course you want to know this all your data in bit wardens vault is end to end encrypted.  They don't have access to it.  Not just the passwords but unlike some other companies all the metadata the sites you visit.  When you visited them all that stuff is encrypted just like your passwords.  That's really important.  And of course bit warden doesn't track your data in the mobile app.  All it does is crash reporting.  If you don't like that this is where open source is beautiful.  Get the F-Droid installation.  You won't even have that.  Bit warden is open source.  It invites anyone to review library implementations at any time on GitHub.  You can review their privacy policies at bitwarden.com slash privacy.  You can protect your personal data and privacy.  You can add security to your passwords.  Use bit warden to generate strong randomly generated passwords for every account.  If you go to the bit warden site you'll see they have a password strength meter.  You can try out your passwords there safely.  See how strong it is.  They also have and I love this feature a username generator.  So you know when you create an account you use your email and a password.  Well what if the email you used was completely unique and never used before and will never use again.  That's what the username generator does.  It generates unique usernames for every account.  Stores them.  And of course you still want to get those recovery emails.  So what they do is they work with the big five integrated email alias services.  Our other sponsor Fastmail is one of them.  Simple login, a non-addy, Firefox relay.  They just added DuckDuckGo.  So you still get the email but you use an obfuscated address so the company doesn't have your address.  This is a great way to increase the security and to make sure that every single login is unique and is never used again.  Keep your main email address out of the databases too right.  And that's an I do that too.  I think it's a great reason to use it.  It integrates beautifully with Bitwarden and those services.  And for your business we're very happy.  We're moving to Bitwarden for business.  It's fully customizable.  It adapts to your business needs.  There's a team organizations plan that's $3 per month per seat.  There's an enterprise organization plan.  That's the one we're going to $5 a month per seat.  It's great.  You can share data privately with coworkers across departments of the company.  People share passwords.  We know that.  They write it on a piece of paper and they say here Marie here's the password to the Wi-Fi.  No don't.  No don't do that.  Use Bitwarden.  You can securely share those passwords.  And if you've got a Bitwarden individual account as I do,  it's very easy to integrate your individual account with the organizational account without crossing that barrier.  So your passwords are still separate, but you only have one login and there's all your passwords.  There's also of course the basic free account.  Unlimited free forever.  Unlimited passwords.  I think the $10 a year for premium is worth it just to support Bitwarden.  I'm a big fan.  I've been doing that for a couple of years.  Family organization option.  If you've got a family, you want to get them all on Bitwarden.  Up to six users.  Total cost $3.33 a month.  $3.33 a month.  I think that's worth it as well.  And of course it makes it so easy to import from any other password manager.  Export out of it.  Import into Bitwarden.  I hear from everybody, well that was easy.  That was easy.  The only hard part is changing all those passwords that that other company let out into the open.  Bitwarden.  Trusted by millions of individuals, teams, and organizations worldwide.  It's the only open source cross-platform password manager you can use at home, on the go, or at work.  They've got a command line version for Linux.  Open source is a beautiful thing.  Get started with a free trial of a Teams or Enterprise plan.  Or get started for free across all devices as an individual user.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.  I think the world is converging.  I think the world has said, you know what?  This is the way to go.  Open source, baby.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.  Highly recommended.  We thank them so much for supporting our show.  When Bitwarden called, I said, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I will do your ads.  I will happily do your ads.  Hey, we had a lot of fun this week on twit.  And you know what we did?

And then it's edited to include both Fight Club and the Antihero music video.  It's it's a the baseline fits perfectly.  It's one of the best like mashups I've heard in a long time.  And B, the video editing is superb.  So if you're a fan of Fight Club and Taylor Swift, which I know is a Venn diagram, which might just be me, this is everything you've ever wanted in your life.
