This is TWiT Episode 162 coming to you from the TWiT headquarters in beautiful downtown  Petaluma California.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Joining us today in the big debate at the center table, Mr. John C. Dvorak dot org slash  blog.  Hello John.  Hello everybody.  Hello every, I want to be like Jim Lehrer.  John, you could talk to Will Harris, you know.  Will Harris is also here.  He is from the lovely island of England, somewhere to the east of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.  Of Channel Flip.  I'm not going to look at John for the entire section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Andrew Horowitz is here.  He's going to tell me I'm always right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now Andrew, we're not going to keep you for long because we want to leave room for Patrick  Norton who may join us in the middle of the show.  Of course with my luck, Patrick's plumbing problems will take hours and we won't get  him.  But anyway, thank you for being here also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, thanks for having me.  I just thought I had this epiphany this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You had an epiphany.  Should I get back in the stock market?  I sold all my stocks because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of me?  I told you I was going to give you a sign when to get back in, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you given me the sign?  Did you wiggle your hips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you adjust your shorts?  But that is exactly the epiphany.  I was talking to John as a matter of fact and I said, John, think about this for a second.  It was so odd that commercial, the whole, you know, that whole discussion about, you  know, with the churros and the shoes and the crazy.  Oh, we're back to that.  Yeah. Well, it came over to me.  Listen to this. You're going to love this.  When he said, give me a sign, adjust your shorts, it occurred to me.  Short stocks.  He was short selling.  It was short selling.  Adjust it. Right after that, they came out with an 18% increase in their dividend.  They came out with a 40 billion dollar buyback.  The stock went up about, I don't know, about 15% right afterwards.  It was a sign to everybody out there.  Get out of the way.  Microsoft is starting to move again.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I do want to get you on to explain because a number of people wrote to me  and said, would you please have Andrew on and explain why this buyback?  What does Microsoft get?  What was it? A 40 billion dollar buyback?  What did they buy back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. Yeah, 40 billion.  Well, what's that number? 40 billion was the number they were coming in for Yahoo, right?  Oh, that's interesting.  I think it was a sign to Yahoo, first of all, that, you know what, you guys were really done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really. We don't have the cash anymore.  We spent it on a Ferrari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. And the second thing is, if you look at buybacks, we got without getting too technical.  The interesting thing is when they do a buyback and at the same time do a dividend increase,  it really doesn't cost them anything.  And that's because they have all these shares that they're buying back and they have already in Treasury.  And the 18% increase in dividend is going to equate to basically a zero cost to them on the outlay.  So it really is kind of a good thing for them.  That's a smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, very smart.  Why do companies traditionally do buyback their stock?  Is it to go private?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To prop it up.  Yeah, they prop it up.  It's kind of a joke, as I think John would say, it's bogus.  You know, what they do is they try to increase their EPS, their earnings per share,  and they do it artificially because now they have less shares outstanding and more earnings per share.  It's frankly, I think it's a pretty, it's a good thing, generally speaking.  It shows the world they have a good feeling for their stock.  But at the same time, I think it is kind of bogus because it really doesn't give you a correct,  really correct fundamental understanding of what's happening because they're just artificially increasing their earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, their earnings per share looks better, but they actually, they can actually have, the revenues could go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, historically, Microsoft has not been a dividend stock.  When did they start paying dividends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they started paying dividends, yeah, a few years ago.  They were, when they first came into the Dow, a few years back, and they all of a sudden started having a dividend out of,  it was very, very minor, nothing major, but they started having dividends.  And it was kind of interesting because no technology stocks really paid any dividends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, usually they want to keep the money, reinvest it because it's such a fast paced industry.  It's very important to do R&D. Is that not right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was. But if you look at the numbers and how many shares Mr. Gates had,  it was quite a remarkable amount of income for him at a reduced tax rate.  Dividends are taxed at 15 percent.  So it was really just to pay Bill off.  Exactly. Well, maybe Mr. Bomber too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think for a long time Bill did not want to go public.  He didn't want his employees looking at the stock price every 10 minutes.  He didn't want to do a dividend.  But at some point you get to a certain age where you got to think about college for your kids and you want to get some money out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, the story is the following.  Bill never, you're right, he never wanted to go public, but he kept promising all the employees as the company got bigger and bigger  that they were going to go public and they were all going to get a piece of it.  And so he finally had to renege and actually go public because he didn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. And the 18 percent increase in the dividend, what do you think that portends, Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's just to offset the cost of the share buyback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So in other words, it's a scam.  It's a net no loss to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it's a scam in the sense of an eBay scam, but it is a scam.  It's a, you know, they don't lose anything on the road.  It's tricky. It's tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Andrew, I want to thank you for coming in and filling us in.  Thank you. We appreciate it.  I like your epiphany. Thanks.  Have a good weekend. Don't change a thing.  Andrew Horowitz of the Disciplined Investor, the Disciplined Investor dot com.  We get him in to talk about money matters.  People are saying talk about tech. This is tech.  This is this is a huge company in tech and it's a big tech issue.  Want to take a break? We are going to talk.  We have some actually some very interesting stories to talk about, including  a new a new earthquake study that involves you and your laptop.  But first, I want to mention audible dot com.  Our friends at Audible have come back with that special two book offer.  We want to keep that going.  The platinum plan.  You get two books free if you go to audible dot com slash twit to audible dot com  slash twit to one of the benefits, by the way, of both the gold and platinum plans.  And I didn't even know this.  You know, I'm missing out here.  You get a free subscription to the Wall Street Journal  of the New York Times daily audio version.  So I want to underscore the fact that we talk about books all the time,  but you can listen to your newspapers this way.  You can listen to lectures, speeches, radio, a ton of great audio content.  Just go to audible dot com and browse around.  And then when you're ready to sign up, please use audible dot com slash twit to  sign up for that platinum plan.  You'll get two books a month.  But also when you sign up, you'll get two credits.  And if you decide not to stick around, no sweat, no problem.  You get to keep the books.  Here is the book I'm going to strongly recommend for you.  I just read this in paper because it wasn't out yet on Audible.  It is now out.  Neil Stephenson's Anathem, his new book, which came out just I think about a week ago,  a truly awesome book.  I am a huge Neil Stephenson fan.  Kryptonomicon, Snow Crash, The Baroque Cycle.  This is one of our best writers.  I don't even want to say sci-fi writers.  He calls it speculative fiction.  I think that's probably more accurate.  Anathem starts out in a monastery, but it's a different kind of monastery.  And it's a different world and a galaxy, of course.  But the people of this world have segregated the smart ones because they're scared of them.  They take nuclear power, astrophysicists, everybody who knows anything, and they put  them in monasteries for centuries, for millennia.  But something happens and they have to crack open the monasteries.  They need the brains.  And it is a great read, a great story.  It's long, too.  32 hours of great Audible.  And they've done one of these, I don't know, let me listen to the excerpt.  I'm not sure if you'll hear it, but they've done one of these Audible dramatizations where  they have multiple voices.  They do such a good job of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ...may speak of carrots, potatoes, dogs, cats, etc.  This doesn't mean that Arb has exactly the same species.  Naturally, Arb has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually from the introduction.  That's well before the story gets started.  But Oliver Wyman, Tavia Gilbert, William Dufres, and Neil Stevenson are in this recording.  We tried to get Neil for an interview on Twit, by the way, and he's like the J.D. Salinger  of our generation.  He doesn't talk.  He said, no, I'm not comfortable doing interviews.  I'm sorry.  But, you know what?  Let the book stand for itself.  Anathem, highly recommended.  You get it free by going to audible.com slash twit2.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  All right, Will Harris.  What happened?  What happened?  You got married.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel very good about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you Twittered it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I thought...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If Alexandra didn't leave you after that, you got a good woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Maybe she was Twittering too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was she Twittering too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she wasn't.  She was far too busy doing all those things that girls do.  You were standing up at the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way I understood it, you were standing up at the podium getting married and typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were you using a Blackberry?  What were you using?  I waited until I sat down again.  My wife...  Well, I thought, you know, everyone gets the pre-wedding jitters.  So I thought, well, what should I do that's part of my daily routine that'll keep me grounded  and feeling sane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, see, I broke out the Playboy.  So all right, I get it.  All right, so you Twitter instead.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I thought, you know, I'll Twitter going and getting a sandwich before lunch and I'll,  you know, Twitter getting all my stuff together, all my buttonholes in and walking down to  the church and waiting around.  You crack me up, dude.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  You crack me up.  You know what?  What was really nice?  Twitter community was I got so many, like, you know, best wishes and congratulations and  things.  It was absolutely lovely.  I'll have them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if I go...  How far back do I have to go?  Oh, like a fortnight?  That's two weeks for those of you who speak, do not speak the King's English.  It's a queen, isn't it?  Sorry.  I'm going there.  I just want to read this.  I want to read your wedding.  So this is good.  Did you preserve this in the album?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We haven't put the album together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you put the album together, I think your Twitter should be right along the side of  the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got...  I mean, the amazing thing about doing a wedding these days is not only do you have your official  photographer, you've got like at least, you know, 10, 20 other people who have all got  digital cameras there.  What was the wedding date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The 13th.  Already he's forgotten.  September 13th?  Yeah.  All right.  So I'm going to September 13th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So while you're doing that, I'm going to throw a question out there.  You know, the machine I do these podcasts on, just a regular Windows machine, but I can  never log on to Twitter, which is one of the reasons I don't take messages.  And then when I ask it to reset my password, it says I don't exist.  But every other machine I use, I use the same exact...  Clear your cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a cookie thing.  Just go into your cookies and delete all the cookies from Twitter.com.  However, you should be using Twirl.  Are you not using Twirl?  Yeah, I know.  Twirl's awesome.  I love Twirl.  All right, I'll go use Twirl.  I don't want to use Twirl.  Twirl's great.  In fact, Twirl, you can also post to the Twitter army.  You could post to Jaiku.  No, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do that.  This gives me a feeling for how well the Twitter service itself is doing though.  No, no, no.  It's not that.  Actually, isn't there a website, IsTwitterDown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I think it's IsTwitterDown.com and you can go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is second in usefulness to the frankly sublime, down for everyone or just me.com.  I love that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you go to IsTwitterDown.com, John, and it'll say no, and then you'll know, okay,  it's me.  Is it down for everyone or just me?  Is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  .com.  Which is fantastic.  When someone says, is this so and so Dan for you?  And I just reply with, Dan for everyone, just me.com.  In the spirit of things, let me share with you just very quickly a couple of tech revelations  I had on my honeymoon.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before you do this, let me just read some of the Twitters.  I may be getting married later today, but right now it's party time.  Okay, the Will Harris Twitter wedding countdown starts here.  Bed up in six hours to get ready up.  Coffee, breakfast, weather's sunny.  10 a.m.  Getting in the groove.  Okay, folks, pregame starts here.  Shower, shave, more coffee at the chapel now.  Got the fear.  Holy crap, I do.  You said I do.  On Twitterific.  Why not?  Were you on your iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  I give the marriage six months.  Six months tops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Six months tops.  What did what did Alexander, your lovely bride think?  She said put away the phone, Will, you're getting married now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think she was fine as long as I didn't have, you know, the phone go off,  you know, in the middle of it.  That'd be fairly if you had just Merlin Manslow.  Do do do do do do do do.  Is that your ringtone?  That's my ringtone.  In the in the middle of the chapel, that probably would be very appreciated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this was in the news.  Is that what you're telling us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm just I just couldn't resist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's this news story that was about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although you want the earthquake news story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what?  No, the one you said that you and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's not in the news, but I want to know about this, Will.  So Will did an interview with me here in the studio when you were in town a month ago,  which is now on the front page of Channel Flip Dotcom.  And, you know, you were interviewing a bunch of tech luminaries in their jammies.  Is mine the first?  Yours is the first.  And then you're going to have a lot of other people in their jammies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is that. Oh, that.  So wait a minute. Here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what upsets me. I should get Kevin Rose on.  So somebody put it on dig, right?  It got banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it got like maybe 400 digs.  And by foot, like by 400 digs, it still hadn't hit the front page of dig, right?  Which, as you know, you know, it takes like maybe 200.  And that's weird. Populous. Get something.  And then I noticed it had been removed from the upcoming stories.  And so I emailed like Dig Support and I was like, hey, how come this story isn't  appearing anywhere on the site whatsoever?  And they were like, oh, it got buried.  I was like, well, why did it get buried?  It's like, you know, it's a perfectly legitimate story.  It's this interview with Leo Laporte.  The description does what it says on the tin.  It's not misleading, you know, blah, blah, blah.  And like, oh, that's just the decision of the dig community.  And we're not going to overturn that.  I was like, well, how many like people  burying it does it take when 400 people have dug it and said it's really cool?  And they're like, oh, we don't give that away.  That's proprietary information. Five, probably.  Yeah. And I thought that's really lame.  This is a really good interview with somebody that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People love it. It's on my blog.  I tweeted about it. People loved it. It was very funny. Yeah.  I don't see any reason not to dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sucks that like, you know, 10 people on dig who are just, you know,  the haters can just pull it off the front page.  And there's no resource for it. Those haters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The question is, are they Channel Flip haters or they Leo haters?  Because I'm going to take this personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there's enough people that read Channel Flip for there to be  Channel Flip haters. So it was people who hate me.  It was about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it's just.  No, maybe it's about pajamas, for all you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was wearing a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe.  I thought I was quite distinguished looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that was the reason it was banned.  You're encouraging smoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was no tobacco and I was just sucking on the thing.  Well, it was the same thing.  I thought it was a very good interview.  I thought it was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think I think it is.  And I would encourage anybody listening to Twitter to head over  to Channel Flip dot com and watch it.  And there's going to be there's going to be more this week.  I got, you know, some some hilarious ones.  There's a great one of Irina Slutsky and Violet Blue and Ryan Block  and Tom and Molly, the legendary Molly interview.  Can't wait. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The tattoo and tongue piercing interview.  Yes. Hot.  Here's a story.  I love this.  Scientists are looking for volunteers  to monitor quakes using the accelerometers in their laptops.  Turns out that, you know, most laptops now, just like the iPhone,  have accelerometers built into them.  Mostly it's to protect you against when the laptop falls.  So the hard drive can, you know, you know, suck its head into the shell  before it hits the ground.  They these accelerometers, it turns out, are sensitive enough to be seismographs.  So volunteers will be downloading software  that links their computers to others in the network.  And then it gives them seismograph points all over.  They're looking for a bunch in California.  In fact, they it the system was up during July during that five point four earthquake.  We actually were doing security now at the time.  And I could see Steve Gibson and the whole thing was shaking around him.  And so they got about half a dozen laptops with the software on it.  Unfortunately, only three sent back signals.  They're working on it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a dead end story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. This is just that was the first thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's unbelievable, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just seems like it like that shouldn't be possible.  Like that's it's just such an epic story that you can measure,  you know, earthquakes with just like the stuff built into it.  It costs 70,000.  Look, the more seismic stations you have, the more you know about earthquakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to find out how fast it travels.  You want to find it helps you with the epicenter,  but also it helps you understand the process.  It's $70,000 to install a seismographic station  and then 3000 a year to maintain it.  This is like SETI at home for earthquakes.  I think it's a great idea.  The quake catcher system.  It should come, you know, they should do a deal with Dell or something  and just set it up pre-installed on every single Dell that goes out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and think what a scientific resource that would be.  That would be an amazing PR stint for Dell.  And I think that's the best way to do it.  I'm looking at a story on MSNBC that of course,  and this really bugs me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a lot of times in mainstream media covers tech,  they don't do the most basic thing,  which is give you the gosh darn link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know it drove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I find that amazing.  I was reading a story the other day where, you know,  the guy who was doing the research on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  time.com website, which was about other websites.  Yeah, like this website is really good for this.  I hate that.  And they don't tell you where.  There were no links in there.  Just guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't know if they're still looking for volunteers.  As you see Riverside, if we find a link, we'll put in the show notes,  but it's not in this MSNBC story.  So we didn't talk about this last week because I wanted to save it  for John C.  Dvorak.  Sarah Palin's Yahoo got breached because of this stupid system that  Yahoo has for security questions.  So they were only, you know,  if you forget your password and a lot of sites are using this now,  and then it asks you a couple of security questions or questions  where, where'd you meet your husband?  Well, everybody knows she met Todd Palin in high school.  The guy tried a couple of different things.  Turned out it was Wasalia High School,  or Wasalia High.  I can't remember what the other question was,  but it was stuff that was commonly known.  So when the guy gets into Palin's email account,  by the way, they think, they suspect,  one of the suspects is the son of a Tennessee state representative.  Made his father proud.  They asked the daddy, he said, I don't know how to do that.  It's way beyond me.  So the point being made now is that you should probably not use,  well, if you're going to use these standard security questions,  you should not lie about the answer.  If you use your mother's maiden name or your dog's name,  especially if you're a public figure, but anybody, you know,  this is probably pretty easy to guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not.  It's a really lame system.  They should at least make you register like a secondary email address  that they'll then email your password to, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That at least, but again, it's convenience versus security.  University of California, Berkeley doctoral student  and security researcher Ariel Rabkin said,  this is an attack any 17 year old in America could do.  You could do it.  You could do it in your living room drunk on the spur of the moment.  So I like this article in Time magazine.  They quote Virgin America's questions.  Like some of them are, one of them is how much wood would a wood chuck chuck  if a wood chuck could chuck wood?  And you just make up the answer.  I think that's a better idea.  But then you have to remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem.  So go check your messages, Leo, on the Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, would you like to go cook some some roast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I just saying I get it.  Adam can come on for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's invite him. Adam Curry, the pod father.  I don't even know if I have a CG for him.  I'll have to make a new CG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll just use a, you know, I'll use Steve Gilmour's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think he'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Gilmour.  Yeah, you do that.  All right, what else we got in the news here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm calling the pod father, but let's move on to other stories in the news.  Hey, there he is, the pod father himself.  Adam Curry, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey, Leo.  How are you?  I'm good, man.  Where are you?  In San Francisco.  Oh, you're in our neck of the woods.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  What brings you out here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Out here for a couple of weeks.  Headquarters stationed out here and really just to have John take me to fancy dinners  and buy me, well, not select for me, lovely wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're buying the wine, Adam.  I hate to tell you.  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You betcha.  Hey, you know, I don't buy expensive wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, you get gems, John.  It's like those little Easter eggs at Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the last time he was on.  They explained how to do that at Costco.  There's a lot of good school stuff.  A hundred dollar bottle of wine.  It's a gem.  It's a gem.  Well, that was just one extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the high end.  Most of the good wine at Costco is like nine or ten dollars.  All right.

Transcript:  So, Jami Thomas' trial got thrown out, mistrial declared.  Jami is the single mom from Raynard, Minnesota, who was fined $222,000 for using Kazaa.  Twenty-four songs.  The jury found her guilty and fined her the statutory fine, which is some astronomical amount.  Ended up being almost a quarter of a million dollars.  She appealed, lost in her appeal, but the judge said, wait a minute, I screwed up.  He had told the jury that it was not necessary for the recording industry to prove that anybody had downloaded the songs.  It was merely sufficient to make those songs available online.  That was sufficient.  The judge had said, hey, that's what the recording industry told me, but I looked into it and I was wrong.  So now they're going to go back to trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the way the judge only questions what the recording industry told him, like after the trial.  It's like that's maybe one to look at, you know, when you're in the middle of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They told me it was okay.  So I guess they're going to have another trial, but the recording industry.  They're going to start all over again.  They're going to start all over.  The recording industry says we can't prove that actual transfers happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jami Thomas could well escape her quarter of a million.  She could.  Fine.  She could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She should.  Anyway, this is bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Appalling.  Twenty four songs.  Now, here's.  I mean, ten, ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does she look like a song pirate to you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she's a single mom.  I mean, she wasn't.  Here's what she did.  She did what a lot of people did.  She installed Kazaa, downloaded some songs.  The default install and almost all peer to peer file sharing systems is the stuff you download is then made available.  That's how they work.  She didn't pay any attention.  Nobody does.  And so she was offering songs.  Anything she downloaded was automatically offered to anybody else who wanted to download it.  That's called peer to peer.  It's against her will.  They made her do it.  Adam, how do you feel about this kind of thing?  You don't have to put up with this in Britain, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, are you kidding me?  They're now even installing filtering mechanisms at the ISP's head ends to make sure that we don't download or upload anything.  This is a real problem.  It's getting worse.  Yeah, if anything, I have an 18 year old daughter and I had to explain to her because they don't teach us in school what copyright is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you tell her?  Do you say, honey, this is what I tell my 16 year old.  I said, here's your I'll give you a $20 a month allowance.  That's two CDs a month.  You have to buy your music.  You're not allowed to download it.  And every time I go to the Mac, LimeWire is installed every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's I try to explain the concept.  She has a she has a part time job and she can and she does buy songs off of iTunes.  But the real understanding of what is theft and what is property and what is intellectual property is not it's not something you you explain to someone who's never dealt with these concepts and has never been taught this in school.  You don't explain that in 10 minutes.  So I usually resort to do you want the Internet to be shut off because we're only going to get two warnings and the third strike.  We're out and we won't be able to get any more connection.  Goodbye, Facebook.  I use puppets, Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I find it's very handy.  Hello, I'm the recording industry and I'm a Jami Thomas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but clearly, but clearly the whole idea behind these lawsuits with these outrageous amounts is to set an example and to scare people in the submission.  And that's clearly not working because, you know, the people who are doing this, which is predominantly, I would have to say, young people who have no concept of it and really didn't then they don't understand.  And they're not being exposed to what potential dangers are or it's not being perceived by them as as a danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam, do you have the ethical conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course I do.  So you say it's wrong to do this and I have but I have this all the time with my with my wife, too.  And she had a cosmetics company and I would have this conversation all the time because she'd go down to Canal Street in New York City when it was still kind of what it was back in the day.  It's changed a lot.  And she'd say, Oh, look at all these knockoffs.  I love this.  I could have 20 20 bags.  I'm like, yeah, that's that's kind of funny.  But what if people start knocking your stuff off?  Well, that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's different.  I have I have a $20 Rolex that's made in Geneva with a J, by the way.  It's a great watch.  20 bucks.  I got it on Canal Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that came back to bite me in the butt because now she's buying real real deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that was smart.  I love Kate Spade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  During those old olden days, I collected a lot of those counterfeit watches and and I'm actually, you know, I can tell a counterfeit watch a mile away from it.  They're cheesy.  They don't look real.  No, no, actually, that's not totally true.  The really good ones are quite quite nice and they're not cheesy.  In fact, not actually run on time.  The way they work because they're courses.  That's right.  No, no, no, that's you're wrong on that, too, because the fact of the matter is you can get a self winding old fashioned movement in a lot of these counterfeit watches if you want to pay for those.  Are you going to not going to get that for 20, by the way, which the real price is 14.  But oh, you mean I got ripped off.  Did you get on Canal Street or off Canal Street?  No, actually, I spent 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know that they have that that tray of watches that says 10 and I just I never go more than 10.  That's why I said Geneva with a J.  If I'd spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you want to do is you want to collect the watches that don't exist in the reality.  And the one that my absolute favorite one is a Movado, a perfect Movado, but it's silver on silver.  Oh, and they never made a silver watch.  And it's actually quite attractive.  But anyway, there's another article to get off this topic.  But since we're talking a little bit about copyrights and I didn't see it on the on the rundown here, but I just sent you a link about which this is the only article.  This story that has me disturbed this week, which is the Electronic Frontier Foundation suing the office of the US trade representative over information.  It's withholding on the anti counterfeiting trade agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this is this that that that weird actor thing that Canada was going to?  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Proposals include having customs officers report directly to private businesses and potentially giving border control staff the right to search media players and computers for pirated material.  We've talked a little bit about this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the status of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still haven't got the documents.  We don't know what's in this paperwork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the October 2007, the US, the European community, Switzerland and Japan simultaneously announced a new intellectual property enforcement treaty, the ACTA anti counterfeiting trade agreement.  Australia, Korea, New Zealand, Mexico, Jordan, Morocco, Singapore, UAE and Canada have joined the negotiations.  And this is among the among the among the things proposed by ACTA is that they basically customs agents become enforcement agents for intellectual property and without any oversight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is crazy. So the the EFF says, you know, ACTA raises serious concerns for citizens, civil liberties and privacy rights.  The treaty could potentially change your way that your computer is searched at the border.  People need to see the full text of ACTA now so that they can evaluate the impact and express their opinion to political leaders.  Instead, the US trade representative is keeping us in the dark.  Here's the irony.  Here's the irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, Canada is proposing this, but it's coming from the United States.  I mean, it's coming from the US record companies and movie industry.  Yeah, of course.  The US wants to implement it, though, of course.  And what will happen is you go through the border.  But this is already we talked about this a few months ago.  This is already happening.  You've got your iPod.  You've got your laptop.  Customs agents would have the right to say, I'd like to see what's on your laptop, please.  I'd like to see what's in your iPod, please.  And then solely in their own discretion that this has ever happened to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've always not happened to anybody.  They don't have the powers yet.  This is the proposal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like to point out that the Customs Border Protection Agency, which I know a lot about  because I deal with them every single time I come into the country, they absolutely have the authority to do this already.  I think so. Yeah.  You're not in the country yet.  So you are not officially let in.  They have the right to search anything just like they search any vessel, any container of any kind.  So yes, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you Adam say, I'm not going to let you search me.  I'm just going to turn around and go back.  Or are you kind of their prisoner at that point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point.  I've never tried that one.  I think you got to try that, Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got a first class ticket here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got to return at least in 15 minutes.  I got to go.  I get stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have they ever looked at your laptop or your iPod or anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They made me open my laptop and they kind of look through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've seen them open it just to say it's prove it's a laptop.  But are you saying they actually look at the files?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I go through secondary and sometimes tertiary screening.  Well, you look like a terrorist.  There you go.  You look like a bad-eared Meinhoff gang kind of type.  I'll tell you what's more offensive is holding a US passport, which I've had from birth.  But living in another country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't really matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How dare you?  You live in another country?  The United Kingdom.  Please step aside.  Don't you love us?  Why are you living somewhere else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Papers, please!  The more offensive is that I have to prove what company I work for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to prove with business cards.  It's really an offensive procedure.  Well, wait, Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you at least explain why?  Because the fact of the matter is he has this exact same name as some guy they're after.  Oh, is that true?  Really?  Yeah, some evil Adam Curry from Nebraska.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're kidding.  Is he out there?  They wouldn't tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a lot of information over the past 10 or 11 times this has happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But essentially, I'm a match.  So they match by first name, last name, and then they do birthdate.  But if they get first name, last name, that you're a match and you're pulled aside.  And apparently the agency, because I said, why don't you pick this guy up in Nebraska and then get me the hell off the list?  I said, well, the thing is, they're watching it.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I said, well, the thing is, they're watching it.  So I don't know.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's one name that's like Robert Johnson or some really common name.  They talk about this in all these talk shows that bring this up.  And it's like there's like thousands and thousands and thousands of these people that are stopped because they have this actually really common name that's on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's like the idea that Robert Johnson is actually, you know, traveling under his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he's like an al-Qaeda terrorist, he's on a watch list.  He's not traveling as Robert Johnson, surely.  That's like that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you carrying a bomb?  It's like, yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But hold on.  This is one big misconception.  This is not about the no fly list.  It's very different from entering the border.  That's where I run into my problem.  So it's actually the Border Protection Agency has nothing to do with the TSA.  Right.  And being allowed to.  I have no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's another list.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's another list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's another list.  The fact that the no fly list is worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, anyway, you can't fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't even be coming over here if you're on the no fly list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the current status on ACT?  I am glad the EFF has raised raised this issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the current status is that the US trade representative is discussing it along with all the other countries and may or may not implement it at some point in the future.  But nobody knows because the USTR won't actually talk to anybody about it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the real problem with all this stuff is that the secrecy around it.  Yeah.  You don't know what they can and can't do.  You don't know what they will do and they won't tell you if you're on a list.  I mean, the whole thing is you're just you're just not, you know, your persona non grata.  And that's a little scary.  The idea that the border agents would have absolute authority to say, look at something on your iPod and say, well, we think that's pirated and take it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take the iPod.  This has never happened to anybody.  Yes, it has.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who?  Well, there's there's one case I heard the last time we talked about it.  I heard from some people that it happened to.  You're right. I think it's still very rare.  There is one case that went to court where a fella crossing, I think, from Canada into the US.  They opened his laptop.  They found what they saw, what they thought file names that sounded to them like child porn.  They were encrypted.  They said we want the password because we need to see what these are.  He said, no.  They said you're under arrest.  They brought him to trial.  The judge.  This is why I know about this is a very important precedent that happened last year.  The judge said, no, he doesn't have to give you his password.  That's protected.  He's OK.  That's a man.  They let him go.  That's right.  So that is a well-known case.  Now, why they happen to look at this guy's files, maybe they maybe they he was on a list.  Maybe they thought he was, you know, maybe there was something suspicious about him.  Maybe he was naked.  I don't know.  But but the point is they sometimes do do this.  I don't know how often they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So have we missed so have we so far the the Android phone this week?  That's this week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ordered the Android phone.  I've ordered it October 22nd.  I am a T-Mobile.  What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a joiner would guess like you'd have one on order before anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I also called Google and said, can I get a review unit?  And they said, yeah, we'll get you one.  So I'm going to have one in the next couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never thought I should have to get one.  Yeah.  Did you read my article in this week's Market Watch?  No, of course you did.  Nobody reads my stuff that does these shows with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was your article about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I talked about the platform shift and it being these phones.  I agree.  And I had a kind of a very interesting argument about it.  And I realized that, you know, because Microsoft was the first people out with the smartphone, they never got it right.  They were just essentially shrinking the PC and it wasn't a true platform.  Exactly.  And so what we have now as a true platform ship, but it's not shifting.  I mean, we're not going to lose PCs.  It's just going to be a new platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I think you make an excellent point, which is that Internet access will shift to these portable devices.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a bad but the thing that's that that that kind of you can try Adam again that why isn't he sending you these notes?  So the thing that's that interested me and the one thing I finally got kind of clear on was the fact that and the most interesting aspect is that Google picked it up and they did the idea before anybody else.  Well, but I mean, once they saw what Steve Jobs did, they got it.  They were on top of it.  Nobody else was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And here's now I'm an iPhone user, but here's the reason I ordered the Android and I'm excited about it.  In stark contrast to the iPhone, it's an open platform.  So yeah.  So the problem I'm having, I'm starting to have with the iPhone, I'm starting to get very upset with Apple.  Is there completely random choices of what applications to allow and what not to allow?  And it's clearly not an open platform.  It's much more like the sidekick where only the T-Mobile, you know, powers it be.  Would tell you whether you could sell an application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the problem with the with rather an issue that they're going to have to look at with the open sort of platform for Android, which is that they're saying that, you know, there are going to be certain restrictions like you can't have a an application that acts as a tethering to your laptop.  Really?  You can't have applications.  Yeah, because T-Mobile has historically been.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  That was my knee.  I'm back.  And he's angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mobile doesn't want people using their Androids as well as to the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because how are they going to stop that if it's an open platform?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's get back up a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you can't stop it.  If it's an open platform.  What is T-Mobile's problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't T-Mobile's problem is that they don't want people using laptop like internet usage because if you're on a laptop, you're going to use a lot more data than if you're on a mobile.  There are.  They don't want you using the phone as a internet connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what they're not with a laptop because they want you to pay extra for the laptop dongle.  But I have to say a couple of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First of all, they've got a they didn't have a one gigabyte limit on this.  They've raised that, but it's still going to be a fairly low limit.  In most cases, T-Mobile has very limited 3G.  In fact, they're aiming the Android at the 22 markets where they have 3G.  I could buy it here even though I don't have 3G.  But on edge, who cares?  I could buy it here.  I could buy it here.  I could buy it here even though I don't have 3G.  But on edge, who cares?  I don't want to surf on the edge.  And I don't think they're going to be able to stop it.  You know, T-Mobile has historically been very open to this kind of thing.  I'm kind of surprised to hear that they want to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me tell you something we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just on the on the know about the platform shift, because I found this really, really interesting when I was on my my honeymoon last week.  And I know this is interesting.  So I didn't take my laptop with me.  Right.  All I had was my iPhone and I discovered and I had like the the machine that was in like the hotel lobby.  So I discovered number one, we're in the sticks in Italy.  There was no broadband.  The Internet is now unusable on dial up.  Just.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You can't do anything on dial up.  Yeah.  Anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Edge is pretty much the dial up of wireless.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So.  But what I found was I had 3G service and this whole platform shift thing is a complete game changer.  Yes.  Because I could do pretty much everything that I needed to.  Yes.  On this phone.  I think Devorek's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think you need an iPhone to do that, though, Patrick.  Well, what do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I made a conscious decision not to buy.  Do you use a Nokia?  What do you use?  Yeah, I use the E71.  Well, that's a great smartphone, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What they what they did is they finally got it right.  They put a powerful enough processor in to actually make Series 60 SIMD and work functionally.  And I do comparisons with people in the UK all the time.  I said, OK, show me your 3G.  And I show them how quickly the GPS fires up and actual driving instructions work.  It's got a 3.2 megapixel camera.  I installed the Opera Mini browser so I get a full view.  Nokia is supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The S60 browser is supposed to be pretty good, though.  It actually does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does flash.  It does a whole bunch of things.  You know.  And by the way, John, as I said last night at dinner, I expect Blu-ray.  I expect blowback on the iPhone as a platform.  I agree.  I don't see it.  I think blowback is coming.  People are getting pissed off because it's not open because it's not open.  And if you can develop for Cindy, there's nothing wrong with that.  Symbian is a great platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, it's also Java based.  So I think a lot of developers might do both because you're just on that.  What I do is I do have an iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First, the first version.  And I installed Joy-Coo Spot on the Nokia.  And so I can just fire up and become an instant Wi-Fi spot for myself.  And I can keep that in my pocket.  I want to use the iPod touch browser.  Then it works perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the name of that program?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Joy-Coo Spot.  J-O-Y-K-U?  J-O-I-K-U.  I think the problem with the.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That turns the phone, the S60 phone into a Wi-Fi base station.  Wow.  And your carrier is not stopping that?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yet.  You could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have T-Mobile, so they haven't told me anything.  As far as they're concerned, I'm just using my phone to access the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons T-Mobile might be nervous in the US with the Android phone is it's only $35 for unlimited internet and messages.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's got to be an asterisk next to the unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, one gigabyte was the initial asterisk, which is very much not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to be not the devil's advocate on this one.  I'm going to say there's not going to be blowback on the Apple product.  I think it's going to be going to take off and it's never going to slow down.  And I think it's mainly because of the applications that are going to be developed for it.  Some of them are unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But those could all be developed on Android without any restrictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, John, John, which one is unbelievable?  I'm not seeing.  What is the unbelievable?  I'll give you a few unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  X-Plane, amazing.  It has nothing to do with it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can.  Here's the interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, in this case, Adam, you're the old fart.  Let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Finally.  I'm starting to blow back right here.  I mean, I'm an Apple guy.  I love Apple.  I got the first iPhone.  I got the iPod touch.  And I didn't.  I chose not to wait in line before my vacation in Guilford of all places.  There were 200 people outside of the O2 store.  I couldn't believe it.  And so I decided I'll pick up this E71.  And I've been extremely happy, certainly compared to the results other people are getting.  I think that testing the phone on the data testing, I call it a failure of a platform.  I don't think it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what I think we could all agree on, though, that the idea of these phones is happening.  The iPhone started it.  I don't think it's going to be preeminent.  I'm very interested in what Google does with Android.  I think Nokia has always had a great platform.  I think you're going to see other stuff to the T-Mobile Storm.  I'm sorry.  The Blackberry Storm is going to be an amazing phone.  I think you're seeing a lot of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nokia is not tied into a network.  That's the whole thing.  Apple is tied into a network.  That's why you get that, OK, you can't have this application because it's going to piss off our network provider, whatever deal we have.  You can go buy an unlocked Nokia phone.  You can do whatever you want.  I'm kind of with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They started selling unlocked Apple iPhones today in Hong Kong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For use in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not just saying.  You know, there's a big market.  I don't know whether you know this or not, but Hong Kong is kind of a big place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, I think that...  John, you don't have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I use burners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shut up.  Just shut up.  He doesn't believe in smartphones.  You don't know jack crap about any of the applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're both old farts.  I mean, come on.  It's wanker stuff.  There's nothing.  I don't think I've not seen any application of any deal value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the killer app, Twitterific on an iPhone at the altar.  That's the killer app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So what do you think about this idea that the iPhone is going to be what the sort of  the original Mac was?  The thing that spots all the trends, does it all first, but is ultimately killed by  a platform?  Apple has a great history.  Look at the Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple has a great history of doing this.  The Newton lost to the Palm.  The iPhone could very well lose to one of these other competitors.  I think if Apple keeps it closed...  I'm with Adam on this one.  I think Apple's made a big mistake by deciding to go with a single carrier and making a closed  platform.  It's Steve Jobs and a Power Grab.  They're doing the iTunes thing.  It's going to fail with iTunes because the record labels are moving away from them with  copy protection.  And it's going to fail with the iPhone, not because it's not a great platform, but because  it's closed.  If there's an open alternative, people are going to go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Apple has no history of being open.  So why should they start now?  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's that people even want it to be open.  I think it's just certainly a lot of the...  As far as I can see, most of the blowback on it is coming from people like us who are  the high-tech guys in the developer community who are so fed up with the fact they could  develop an app for six months and it might not end up on the store.  So either Apple needs to go open or they need to be really, really, really clear about what  they are going to allow and what they aren't going to allow.  That's not the reason for my blowback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just for functionality that this thing doesn't have out of the box.  Why should I have to live without GPS turn-by-turn instructions in today's mobile world?  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or cut and paste or voice styling or a dozen other features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever tried to enter a really secure Wi-Fi key into your iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never.  Forget it.  I make all my passwords...  This is terrible, but in order for me to use the iPhone, I have to make all my passwords  really bad, lowercase, alphabetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you use a 64-bit key or whatever we use at the office, it's like 50K.  It's like 50 characters.  Come on.  You can't do it.  And was that a one, an L or a capital I?  I don't know what that is.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is going to be a case where Apple is not going away.  They're going to be a leader.  I think you're right, John, that consumers will go for the simplicity of the iPhone.  I mean, the advantage Apple has...  Same reason consumers like iTunes.  It's the kind of end-to-end simplicity of it that people like.  But I think it's very interesting.  Watch what Teeba Mobile does with this app store.  If they do this right, if Android is open and well-designed and you start seeing developers  write software for it, developers who are spurned by Apple, I think this could be a  very powerful platform.  HTC makes great handsets.  They have so much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now, I can get Audible on my Nokia phone.  It has a little thing there.  You download the app and then it understands the DRM, whatever's involved.  I mean, while Apple has a lot to catch up, I'm going to rely on independent developers  to do that.  Makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I can listen to Audible on my iPhone also.  That's not an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the other thing that's interesting I found about talking about the iTunes and the iPhone  competitiveness is the fact that Google's building in the Amazon MP3 store to this thing.  That I really like.  I mean, how open-protected is that?  Yes, yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we won't know.  I mean, look, I ordered one.  I'm going to have one for review.  It's cheap enough.  You can buy one and see how it works.  Because I could pop my Tee Mobile SIM card into it, I would love to see an online review.  I would love to see an unlocked version of this.  But I think we will.  I think that's the thing.  And that's what you may not see for a long time from Apple in the US anyway.  Let's take a break.  I want to talk more about this.  I think it's a great subject.  And I agree with you, John, on the premise of your Market Watch column.  We'll talk a little bit more about that.  But before we do, I want to thank the folks at Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Leo.  I'd just like to point out that the Market Watch column is actually not viewable on a  mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you not even on the E71?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it has all these weird pop-ups and stuff.  We were doing it last night at dinner.  How ironic is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've got to be careful with Opera Mini, Adam, because it's caching everything, even  your SSL pages.  It's not secure.  So don't use Opera Mini for banking, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just for porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great for porn.  Well, let's get to that.  We'll talk about how porn works on the E71 in just a moment.  But first, I want to...  I'll be right back.  You may all leave.  I'm going to mention our good friends at Visa.  This is our last Visa commercial.  We really had a great time with them.  We were so glad they were here.  The contract ran out at the end of September, so we thank them.  We welcome them back any time they'd like to come and remind everybody when they go  shopping to take along your Visa card.  Visa makes sure it's safe and secure online or off.  They use very sophisticated, real-time fraud monitoring software to keep an eye on things.  We've talked about this many times.  To keep an eye on fraudulent activity so you are always safe.  Zero liability.  You're just not liable for unauthorized purchases.  Online and off, all the purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.  That's peace of mind.  Make sure when you go shopping, just remember this.  Take that Visa card out of your wallet.  Visa, safe, secure.  We thank them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, now I get it.  I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure.  No problems, they assure.  It's Visa, Visa, Visa.  Oh, yeah.  Yeehaw!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I am actually, I'm a little jealous because I wanted to get that E71.  I was an N95 fan.  Have you looked at the N96 at them at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have, but I really want the full QWERTY keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The keyboard makes a difference, and that's what I'm interested about with the Android phone.  It has a full keyboard.  The iPhone touch keyboard is so difficult to use.  I like the E71.  I've always been a fan of S60, of Symbian, since the Scion days.  I love my Scion.  In fact, one of the things I'm kind of looking forward to with this Android phone, it feels to me like it might be a little bit like a Scion 3A.  It might just have a little bit of that feel to it.  Oh, man, do you remember those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are so good, the five.  The little keyboard, there was like a laptop keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Best PDA ever.  But the one thing, and I remember talking to the president of Scion and said, you got a sync to the desktop.  And they said, no, we don't think that.  And nobody really wants that.  It's like, oh!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What happened to Scion?  It's S60.  It's Symbian.  And it's owned by, yeah.  Does Nokia own it out right now?  Yeah, they own it.  And I think they're good stewards of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why are they crazy?  I think it kicks ass.  It's really gotten now with a faster processor.  I had the E71i before this, the E61 before that.  Yep.  And the processor was just too slow for it to really be snappy.  And that's when you held an iPhone for the first time.  And it's like, crikey.  This thing's flying.  And now, the same thing happened.  I do want to point out, though, that every single picture I've seen of the Android phones or whatever,  can we all just agree that they're butt ugly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, god.  They look like Dell Axisms or something.  They're just clunky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An unsignificant part of Apple's success is design, form factor, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're going to appeal to the enthusiasts.  This is clearly a phone for the enthusiast crowd that wants to have an open platform,  that wants a keyboard, that doesn't mind if it's clunky.  Doesn't want to get laid.  Yeah.  Basically, it's for people who really don't want to have sex anymore.  Or never had it, more likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just on that subject, you were talking about when you were doing the mobile porn.  I was just looking after John's article on VNU.net.  No, no, no.  Well, yeah.  On VNU.net.com, one of their top headlines is,  is mobile video chat porn to explode?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me wrap my head around that.  Mobile video chat porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So adult chat.  And the whole article is absolutely, it's the most outrageously innuendo-filled article you can imagine.  Global revenues from mobile adult video chat are set to climax at one and a half billion.  Oh, please.  They've gone with 3G penetration, expected to exceed 25%.  Oh, god.  And then just to top it all off, the byline is written by Guy Dixon.  Oh, please, Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, come on.  I guess if you have a name like that, you probably were wounded at birth, at childhood, and you just have to live with it.  Yeah.  Good news.  Jack Thompson, the crusader against violence in video games, he's been barred, disbarred, permanently disbarred as of October 25th.  No longer could practice.  That makes me sad.  What?  He was a good person to rail against, wasn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  His heart was in the right place.  He was just a complete div about doing it.  A what?  Do you have that?  A div?  I think that's a CSS thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A div is like a pillock.  A pillock?  Oh, well.  Adam, can you translate for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you speak both English and American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm lost on this one, too, Leo.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to have another pint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I get the gist, though.  Let's go with idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you, Will, the word in the US, you might as well adjust a little bit, is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or putz.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Putz is good, too.  Okay, that's what I'm looking for.  So although he was clearly crazy and he was obviously sort of making a name for himself  and being a bit of a nuisance, the fundamental premise of what he was saying was kind of  not unreasonable.  He was just saying, look, video games that are designed for adults like Grand Theft Auto  or like all the serial killer games like Man Slut or whatever, as a 12-year-old or a 10-year-old,  you shouldn't be able to buy those and they shouldn't be marketed to you.  Well, I might agree with him on that.  Well, he was a little more adamant than that.  And so that's not outrageous.  But the trouble is he wrapped it up in all this sensationalism and name grabbing and  trying to create a media career for himself that the message got lost in the craziness.  So it's sad that the message has been vilified along with the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, that's not why he was disbarred.  He was disbarred for ethics violations, public misconduct.  He's appealed.  He's seeking an emergency stay from the US District Court and published a press release  that said the court's decision is, quote, in retaliation for his Tyndale House book  Out of Harm's Way, published in 2005, which blew the whistle on the Florida Supreme Court  and their efforts in the 90s to literally pathologize his faith-based  and successful activism against the American entertainment industry.  Basically, they're out to get him.  Yeah, that's kind of stupid, right?  Seems unlikely.  He's kind of a nutball.  But I just want to mention that all opinions on This Week in Tech are held by its individual people.  Don't sue the hell out of me, please, Jack.  I don't mean it.  We love you.  He couldn't sue the hell out of you anymore anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can, until October 25th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was this guy saying that video games are preparatory training for young boys when they go into battle?  Was that his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  This guy would do...  Let me see if I can find some of the high jinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the preparatory...  We should talk about that for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that's what I do believe in.  I believe that a lot of this, certainly the war games stuff...  It's the Army doing this.  It's not just the Army.  John, what's the name of that company that we saw a poster for the other day in the city?  Right, right.  Yeah.  Well, there was a protest going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, secretive gaming company.  There's a gaming company in South Park that wrote, I think, that Army game that Leo mentioned.  And there was going to be a big protest in front of the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's San Francisco.  Just a bunch of hippies and...  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you've probably seen the Mercenaries 2 commercial in the UK.  Yep, absolutely.  And when you look at that, it's like basically it's filled with images of mercenaries who  are blowing up oil rigs and there's helicopters.  And it's very close to reality, I feel.  And for my money, I'm not saying you can't...  It's free speech as far as I'm concerned.  They can make whatever game they want, but I'm not going to gloss over the fact that  it totally prepares 13-year-old boys for the future of warfare, which is already what it  is now.  It's killing people at a distance with drones and other long-range type of weaponry.  There's no real hand-to-hand combat anymore.  It's just, you know, get the coordinates, look at the screen, press the trigger.  So, yeah, it's totally...  It's training for these kids, no doubt about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I ask you a question?  What the hell's wrong with that?  Don't you want...  Long silence.  Don't you want an...  Don't you want an...  I mean, assuming that you need some form of national defense, don't you want kids to be  good at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's not an appropriate conversation for Twitter because I could go on for a long  time what I feel about that.  It will have nothing to do with technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a pacifist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't believe in our boys and girls killing each other in deserts.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't believe in that.  But at the same time, I could see how if you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Certainly, it's not based on BS lies from our own government.  No.  No, I don't believe in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Let's get back on track here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I can...  I warned John.  I warned him.  I'm not adverse to that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo is a political junkie, which he wouldn't think he was on real life.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  DailySourceCode.com.  There you go.  Daily Source Code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He'll talk about it.  But assuming the premise that you do...  In this country anyway, we believe in having a national defense and having an army.  Is it so bad to have...  To offer games that...  Look at John.  You always said that driving games helped your kids drive better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the other thing, I believe that if my kids who both play...  All of them actually play Grand Theft Auto, I believe that if they ever go into car thievery,  they're going to be getting good at it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So have we got any updates on Yahoo buying AOL?  I think that was a bogus rumor.  Now that died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that was a bogus rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Died.  These things take a long time to fruition.  It's unlike these bank deals that we've been watching recently, where they happen overnight.  Most deals take a while.  I think there may still be something in the works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  And what would Yahoo...  A part of AOL, because this would be part of the selling off of AOL.  What part of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They would take the online stuff and the...  I think it would be nice for them to get a hold of all of AOL's properties, including  Netscape, and then they can do the browser, because somebody must be hounding them at  the board level saying, hey, if Google is going to do a browser, and look where they're  going to do it, because we've all deconstructed everything Google is up to, we better do one  too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Netscape is open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but it's nice to have...  I know it's open source, but it's got all these...  It is slightly restricted.  It's not like just every...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't just write your own Firefox for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The team is there.  It's like whether it's open source or not, they have the code base.  They've got the people that code, I think, probably a few of them around left that can  code the...  I just think there's probably a few things, there's probably a few Easter eggs within  the AOL bundle that would make it worth their while.  It can't be expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's about the ad networks that AOL has.  And they have these ad networks that are quite powerful.  It's the only thing of actual value that is demonstrable.  That's what it's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This started September 24th, about four days ago, in the Financial Times, citing an unnamed  source familiar with the company.  Usually that means the CEO.  The report says active negotiations are not taking place yet, just that Yahoo could sit  down to the table over the matter.  Why would you raise a trial balloon saying we might be willing to talk to you?  Just to scare off other buyers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Adam?  Because you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To see maybe what the shareholders might...  Why would anybody do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe to gauge the shareholder reaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it was a trial balloon.  I think AOL may be in very dire straits in many business areas, and they probably are  actually working on some kind of deal.  And it got out.  It doesn't sound like a trial balloon to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The decision, according to this story, was made at Carl Icahn's first board meeting.  That new Yahoo board.  That guy's a troublemaker.  Maybe Icahn's doing this.  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, what if we bought AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's just buy AOL.  I believe it would, depending on the price, obviously, it would be a creditor.  It's about the ad networks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, there's a lot of scrutiny now over the Google Yahoo deal.  Even federal scrutiny over this.  Same thing.  Ad networks collusion.  We don't want monopoly.  Do you think it's a good idea that Yahoo be kind of working with Google on online ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be.  I mean, it's a big, big money deal, but I don't think it's going to kill the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not even a big...  It's $800 million.  $800 million.  Big deal.  Walmart pulls the plug on DRM.  This could be a big deal if you own any music you bought in the Walmart store, all 12 of  you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But first...  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're kidding, right?  A lot of people bought online music at Walmart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walmart is the biggest music retailer in the...  Yeah, but the physical media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many people bought...  Who buys online from Walmart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Now that you mention it, you might have me on that one.  But I would be shocked if they didn't have a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're going to be shocked too in just a couple of weeks.  I'll tell you why.  But first, I want to mention the folks at Qualcomm and Gobi, the global mobile internet  from Qualcomm.  We have a lot of worldwide travelers on the show today.  We know that much, and you might want to take a look at Gobi.  I just ordered a Toughbook with Gobi built in.  It's the wireless network card from Qualcomm.  A lot of notebook manufacturers are using these that allow you to access multiple wireless  carriers.  So as you travel, you can change.  It can be HSDPA in one country, EVDO in another country.  It's built in.  It doesn't stick off the edge.  You don't break it or lose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does this have multiple SIM cards, Leo?  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's hardware in the laptop.  And I presume with software, you would say, okay, today, in the States, I'm going to be  Verizon.  I'll be O2 in England.  So it's great for corporate network managers with one device, multiple carrier support.  The world is your hotspot is there.  I think it's a really good idea.  I haven't tried it yet.  I've asked for a Gobi notebook so we can give it a try.  If you want to find out more, Gobi, G-O-B-I, like the desert, gobiennywhere.com slash devices,  Gobi anywhere.com.  And you can also subscribe at that page to a RSS feed so that when there is a new Gobi  notebook from a manufacturer, they'll let you know.  So Qualcomm and Gobi, I think this is about time.  I've been using a single card, USB or a NPCI cards he put in there.  The idea that it's built in the laptop is great and the idea that it would work with  multiple carriers.  Hallelujah.  That's G-O-B-I, gobiennywhere.com slash devices.  We thank them so much for their support on this week in tech.  I think Panasonic announced two new Toughbooks, including an ultra light that looks really  interesting.  So Walmart stopped selling copy protected music.  The last time they saw it was in February.  They started selling copy protection free music last year and they went all copy protection  free just like everybody else around February.  However, if you bought WMA music, Windows Media Music, protected by Plays for Sure on  Walmart store, you might want to convert it to CD.  Walmart sent out a notice saying we're going to shut down the DRM servers in just a couple  of weeks.  So Burnham, they're saying, we're not going to give you, October 9th, the servers will  shut down and if you for any reason have to reinstall Windows or Windows crashes on you  or you want to move into another machine, you won't be able to and you'll never be able  to play that track again.  And you won't be able to burn them in CD until unless you do it before October 9th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is cloud computing at its finest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's DRM, John.  It's a cloud computing.  Well you are reliant.  I guess the analogy is you're reliant on a server in the cloud to allow you to play this  music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my complaint about cloud computing in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the email from Walmart.  If you have purchased protected WMA music files from our site prior to February 2008,  we strongly recommend you back up your songs by burning them to a recordable audio CD.  By backing up your songs, you'll be able to access them from any personal computer.  But once that server is turned off, you won't be able to do it.  So do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're so right, John, when you say that's the essence of cloud computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you two agree you don't like cloud computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not for mission critical or certain mission critical activities.  What John's probably going to say is it does have its place, but yeah, not for stuff that  you actually care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like my email?  Do you use Gmail, Adam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well that's cloud computing.  Gmail is...  Well that's cloud computing.  Yes it is.  I'm not saying I don't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well isn't that mission critical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's mission critical.  But in Gmail's case, you know, it's like it may go down once or twice.  I have pretty good confidence in that company.  And yeah, I use iTunes.  So choose your provider carefully.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's even more...  I think it's more complicated than that.  I mean, yeah.  Google...  I still have even a problem with Gmail.  I mean, I use, you know, Mark Perkel's operation to do my mail.  We just do it...  He does it himself.  That's cloud computing, John.  It is cloud computing, but I don't have to worry, for example.  Because it's more like a small business versus a large corporation.  Well that's more reliable.  No, wait, no, no.  Let me finish.  Okay.  And what I'm saying is that at some point, if Google or any large company that does something  like this decides that they don't want you anymore, or that you violated some one of  their policies and you don't really have any recourse, you could easily be booted off  there and lose all your email.  If you're working with a small company where you know the guy personally...  You can knock on his door.  I could call him at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the end of the day, you also have the ultimate control over the cloud computing, hopefully,  with whatever your MX record is set to on your domain name.  So I make backups of what I have on Gmail.  I don't trust that it could steal...  Well, see, that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if you add Google gears or something like that, some sort of persistent store,  so that you get the best of both worlds?  When you're offline, you still can work on the documents.  All the documents are still there, but when you go online, they're migrated up, they're  synced up with the cloud, and if you're on another computer, you have access to everything,  doesn't...  That's what modern cloud computing is, and I think that that's an incredible convenience  without risking your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, the biggest cloud computing fiasco is happening around us, which is the  financial system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's cloud computing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You better explain that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's giving anybody any...  I mean, it's all money, it's all in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's imaginary money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hell yeah.  Well, kinda.  So let's get back to what your description was of the cloud computing model that you  thought was okay.  That is not the same as the thin client model that all these guys keep promoting.  You can't do that with things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree, but this is not what Google is promoting, for instance.  Google gears is a great addition to Firefox and Chrome, where you just...  It's persistent.  And I think anybody like Adam who uses Gmail is prudent absolutely to make a copy of everything  somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, I've been doing that for 15 years, been backing up my email.  I don't think I've ever, ever, ever, ever had to go back and find something.  I wonder why I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just...  Well, you're being prudent.  You're being prudent.  That's not true.  I don't believe that.  Yeah, it is.  I use IMAP and that's...  I still have to once...  It doesn't happen too much.  I have also backed up all my email.  And unfortunately, it's on different systems because I keep blowing up these systems because  they can't handle all this email.  So I have all these different...  I have to boot up an old Mozilla mail browser and I have to boot up an old Outlook.  And then I even have some old Eudora files.  And so I have to boot up an old copy of Eudora to find some old email.  And what I've done is to say, screw it.  I just lost your name.  I just try to track you down on the net somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of pray that I'll lose all my email.  Yeah, well, that's probably a bad thing.  I wish there were a switch, a big red switch on my desk that said, dump the email.  It's probably...  Gone.  So remember when we were talking about the HD DVD versus Blu-ray battle and I posited  that, well, these guys are going to screw it up by having this fight because consumers  are just going to sit back.  They're not going to choose.  And by the time they solve this, downloads will be there.  And you guys mocked me, but you know what?  It might be coming true because Blu-ray is sinking fast.  The fact that HD DVD died didn't help one bit.  Blu-ray's market share fell to 8% in September.  92% of discs sold regular old DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I got an argument against this argument of yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Netflix CEO Barry McCarthy recently told Home Media Magazine he didn't expect Blu-ray to  have much of an impact on the company's DVD business at all.  Prices are too high on the players.  Only a fraction of Netflix subscribers rent Blu-ray discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  By the way, the price on the Blu-ray drives now you can get them at Costco for $279.  So it's not that inexpensive.  I'm not that cheap.  The trouble is I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $279, you can buy a DVD player for 40 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could buy a burner, which is what you really want in your house.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just want a movie player.  I'm talking about just watching movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me say, here's what the problem is.  Once they came out with those line doublers and then they came out with a 1080p line tripler,  whatever it is, you put a regular DVD in there and it scales it up and then you put it on  your...  It looks fine.  And that's what's killing HD, the Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this was my point.  HD movie and TV downloads are soaring.  And I think that this is really what's going to happen.  Now it's still a small fraction of overall sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's also capped and that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the caps are going to be an issue.  Let's not get back in that conversation.  But I mean, iTunes now as HD movie and a DVD or TV downloads in high def, I just think  this is where it's going.  I think Blu-ray just missed the boat.  It came in too late, too little, too expensive.  I mean, I have a PS3 and actually I'm one of those few Netflix folks who rents Blu-ray  DVDs because they...  John, you may say, oh, my DVDs look fine.  Blu-ray does look better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it does look better.  And I've looked at Blu-ray a lot.  I've never convinced anybody, but it does.  But I think Blu-ray is going to be saved if Sony and these other guys get their act together  and give us some Blu-ray multiplayer burners for our computers.  So we have a Blu-ray device.  Why don't we have them on computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's going on?  What is the story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You tell me.  This is what I think the big problem is.  And this is why the thing is dying on the vine because we need...  It's 30 gigabytes.  I mean, I could put all my photos, you know, well, almost a lot of my...  Actually, my photos, by the way, I just loaded up a...  I have 210 gigabytes of photos.  Can you imagine?  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My kids go to the hard drive and say, Dad, would you please throw out photos once in  a while?  I've got 50 different images of the same thing from different angles or different...  But why?  But anyway.  But why?  Storage is cheap.  But I just wonder if...  Is it a copy protection issue?  Why aren't we seeing...  We're building the ultimate game machine.  As you say, John, a light on a Blu-ray burner is not very expensive.  It's a couple hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, I don't like light on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they're cheap.  I don't care.  It's the ultimate gaming machine.  I'm just going to put a cheap one in there.  But we put a burner in there and we put a reader in there.  What do you like for the Blu-ray burners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like any of them because I've never seen one that I could play with.  I mean, probably...  The other problem is blanks.  Plexstor's got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plexstor always did good stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know, I've noticed this.  Plexstor has lost their PR people and then they moved and I've been having trouble getting  in touch with them.  And then the last Plexstor drive I had, which was a nice little drive, a very thin little  portable drive, and when it comes up on my list of...  You know, when I get the burning software, it says it's a Pioneer.  So I'm wondering what's going on.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe they're reselling the Pioneer stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  The Plexstor used to always make the best of everything.  And now I'm wondering...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're reorganized and I think that maybe they're just a brand name now.  Maybe.  I'm looking on Wikipedia.  It says the Plexstor PX750 is a Tiac drive.  The 800 is a Sony NEC drive.  The A20 Sony NEC and the 8300 is an LG.  Yeah, that's not good.  Maybe they're not...  Maybe they're rebranding stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it's starting to look like, which is not good because they were making definitive  products themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This just underscores my argument that physical media is dying.  It's all going to the cloud.  It's all bits floating in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all going to hard drives as well.  I mean, why buy a burner when you can just buy a hard disk for probably less than the  cost of a Blu-ray media, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, yeah.  Seagate came out with a whole slew of new drives, including a nice 1.5 terabyte drive.  I was at Costco pricing drives, and now you can get a terabyte for a couple of hundred  bucks.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I buy, in bulk, 750 gig Samsung drives, about a hundred bucks each.  That's what we record all our video on.  They're so cheap, after a week I take the drive, wrap it up and put it on the shelf  and buy another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're archiving on these old hard disks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not old, they're new, but yeah, I'm archiving on hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which reminds me of the day, some 10, 15, 20 years ago, when you went on and on about how  hard disks are unreliable because you, because they lose their magnetism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were 10 to 15 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we got an expert on who said, I don't know where you're getting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  I don't remember that conversation.  I do.  That's funny.  They're unreliable because they lose their magnet.  The magnet will stop working.  That's what's wrong.  They'll fall apart.  Well, hey, John, come on.  We did a radio show in 1992 and 93.  So it's 15 years ago.  The size of the hard drive, I think the top was 20 megabytes, maybe 40 megabytes.  Who would have thought we'd be talking about, for 100 bucks, a terabyte of storage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was a SCSI drive too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you were lucky, it was a SCSI.  If you spent some money, you got a really good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you could get the SCSI to work at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These were, this was pre SCSI, Adam.  This was 92.  We were, these were these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  IDEs, I guess.  Or there's actually something else.  ISAs, there's some.  They were ISAs.  They were ISAs.  EIDE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that it?  That was the fancy ones, EIDE.  And then we had, these were ISA drives.  And I think that we, these were the Seagate 20 megabyte MFM and 40 megabyte MFM drives.  Oh, that was fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I remember loading computer programs off a cassette tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boy, who doesn't?  Hey, remember this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The BBC used to broadcast those at night.  Yeah, well, the question is, were they using the Kansas City Standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'd like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You punch old farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Harris, the standard was the best.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You remember any of this, Will Harris?  No.  What was your first hard drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the size of it?  He was just born when the Kansas City Standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the first, my first hard drive was 850 megs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine was five megs.  Five megs was my first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I tell you, I tell you what I missed.  Three thousand dollars.  The, the sirens, I missed the, dee-nee-nee-nee-nee.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you talking about the modems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You don't hear that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there was.  It's the universal sound of the internet.  You know, anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At one time I can make the sound, that modem sound with my voice and get a connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're the captain crunch of the modem crowd.  All right.  I'm going to wrap this up.  We're starting to sound like a bunch of old BDs.  Bunch of dorks.  Bunch of dorks.  Will Harris, newly married, Mr. Will Harris, I guess we can call him now, is the head chief  officer at Channel Flip.  Go there now, channelflip.com to watch my manly interview.  You made it look better than I thought at the time.  At the time I was dying.  You actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I sliced out all the best bits.  Yeah, you did.  They're ready and juicy for people to watch.  Yeah, so it's down.  It's down to about 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you very much for doing it.  Channelflip.com.  Thank you for asking.  It's also on my blog.  John C. Dvorak's blog is dvorak.org slash blog.  He also does about 18 podcasts for MeVee-O, including No Agenda, Tech Five.  He also does Cranky Geeks at crankygeeks.com.  Anything I left out, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Market Watch.  Well, the Market Watch is in the PC mag.  I never read that.  I never read that.  Nobody does, at least the public does, but we don't.  You should, by the way, Adam and I did a really good No Agenda this last week.  It's at curry.com.  You can get a download a copy.  Because we dissected the debate.  Oh.  Because it's not a tech show.  So we dissected the debate.  And I think we probably, I think it was pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are no secrets, only information you don't yet have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we did like about a half an hour of dissection.  I don't have to listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I am interested in all this politics.  I would have killed you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it wouldn't.  I just don't have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You actually would like this show because I think it's really, it's a very compelling  show where we have 130,000 listeners now.  We're trying to get up.  We're nothing compared to your stuff.  But it gets to get into real numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm jealous because I would love to do more, as you know, more political stuff.  And every time we do, John, we just get raked over the coals.  People hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the reason, I mean, they don't like it when I do it on the blog either.  But I think what Adam and I have done is that we've actually, we've actually niche marketed  the product to a different group of people.  This is a political podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's not to be political, whatever we feel like talking about, but there's no tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talk.  There was going to be any tech talk at all.  So if you want tech on this show, you're not going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People say to me, you know, I don't mix politics with my tech.  I just want my tech, you know.  Sometimes though, politics and tech impinge upon one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's that big of a deal.  I mean, people don't, they don't have to.  I mean, I suppose if we're doing the Twitch show, I mean, I think people should be, which  should be mostly about tech news.  I mean, that's what the show is set up for.  And maybe you shouldn't be doing a lot of politics at it unless it's very tech related  like this EFF lawsuit.  But for any other podcast you do or stuff on the side, I don't see any reason that everything  you do has to be this way.  I'm always annoyed when I like write some long essay that happens to be very political.  And I've written political column.  I used to write, be not bad columnist.  So it's not like I can't do it.  And I get this flack and it's always like, hey, you don't have to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  We have the right to express our opinion as any other citizen does.  And then they have the right to throw us into chains and take us to Guantanamo Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam Curry is Mr. The King of Podcasting at mevio.com.  Curry.com.  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I yield the balance of my plug to make an appeal?  Yes, please, sir.  Please do.  I appeal to the citizens of the United States listening to Twitter to contact that representative  and tell them that they will hold them accountable for treason if they let this bill pass tomorrow,  the emergency economic assistance plan.  Really?  You think that's treasonous?  It's treasonous, 100 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to hear why now.  I'm sorry.  We're going political here, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  We don't want to get into it here.  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  You're in bed with the right wing Republicans who believe that it's socialism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not in bed with Republicans or Democrats.  That's WWF, man.  That's just a joke.  I agree.  This is the shadow government, the real people who own our earth.  They're doing this and we shouldn't stand for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.  And you can hear more of that kind of stuff on No Agenda every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it.  I want to hear more about it.  Adam Curry, it's so nice to talk to you.  You get it all there.  And we thank you all for joining us.  We dodged a bullet.  We almost got political there.  Another tweet.  Another tweet.  This is in the can.  In a moment, we're going to begin the show, but it may be that Mr. Norton will join us  if his plumbing problems are solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that like literal plumbing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Believe it or not, although he's used this excuse with me before, so I don't know.  But apparently, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it like a problem with your plumbing over here?  Right.  Same thing here.  Yeah, right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have a hell of a time.  What blue screen?  Forget it.  I'm killing you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hehehehehe.  Round the board.  Doing the twit.  Doing the twit.  Doing the twit, baby.
