And we welcome to the Macworld stage at Podcast Studio a great but varied group of Twits.  Starting with my old buddy Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen, now from Tekzilla.  And System on Division 3.  Look at that.  There's signs in the audience.  Patrick Norton for President 08.  I love it.  Alex is my hero.  Wait, hold on a second.  Who's Alex?  Alex Lindsay or Alex Albrecht?  And we have to decide.  Did you come for Dignation or did you come for Twit?  Okay, this Alex.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To hold it up again, Patrick wants to take a picture to prove to his wife he's not making  the whole TV thing up.  You know, between 1998 and 2004, I was on television.  I was a TV star.  You ever hear of Tech TV?  Nobody's heard of it.  Craig Severson is also here.  He's the video grunt, the pod grunt.  Also the host of the VC, what is the VC show called?  Venturecast.  That's right.  All at gruntmedia.com.  It's great to have you, Craig.  Thank you.  Stepping up to the plate here.  We're waiting for John C. Dvorak.  We'll be here in a little bit.  I'll warm his seat.  He's at lunch.  Keep his seat warm.  I'll play John until that time.  It's really fun for us to have a guy that we used to have on the screensavers all the  time, Mr. Bertman Roy here.  Thank you.  Bertman Roy is the host of Pixel Perfect on Revision 3, but he's also, of course, the  king of Photoshop.  And are you here showing off a book or what brings you to Macworld Expo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you pimping this time?  Yeah, what are you pimping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not pimping anything.  I don't usually...  Well, I do have a new book coming out.  I do a book every two and a half years.  So there you go.  It comes out of Photoshop World.  It's a new book.  All right, cool.  What's it about?  What's it about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not an almanac, is it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't have a name.  Don't say almanac.  Photoshop Studio is something or other.  You don't even know.  Yeah, it's actually Photoshop Studio with Bertman Roy, colon, digital painting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason Bert only does books every two and a half years is actually goes to the press  out, what is it, Virginia or somewhere, and you look at all the proofs and you're very  detailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, the thing is that I'd rather be in the studio working with this stuff rather than  writing about it.  Right.  I also like teaching about it and stuff, but to sit there and write about this whole thing,  and then the editing part, I've read my book about nine times already.  I'm really sick of reading that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's option control, damn it, for the last time.  That's why I never write my own books.  See, then when I read them, it's fresh, it's exciting, it's different.  It's a great technique.  I highly recommend it.  Okay, everybody cover your eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to make a gesture really quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also here today, Alex Lindsay, who's in here today, he's been here all week.  He's been the guy who's put together Podcast Studio.  He's done a great job, I think.  We've spent the last four days talking about podcasts, showing podcasts, doing podcasts.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really want to thank everyone who came.  We've had a fun time.  We've had a lot of fun conversations.  I really hope we get to do it again next year.  We really had a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was a good Macworld.  Did you get a chance, Patrick, to see Macworld at all?  I've seen everything at Macworld.  Did you like that MacBook Air?  What do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually, I was one of the eight people who owned a Macintosh Duo back in the day.  I have no problem with having an optical spindle.  I hear one more person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't have a user replaceable battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't care about that, huh?  Well, on one hand, yeah, it would be nice to have a user replaceable battery.  It's lithium-ion.  It's a finite life.  The finite life will end.  It will end faster than you want it to.  But Apple says it's $129.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll fix it.  They'll put a new one in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  I want to see what the price is like when people actually need to replace them in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  year or two years.  That's not, you know, it would cost about $100 to buy one.  Absolutely.  $129, that includes the installation.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Personally, I think, basically, you know, I'm assuming it's a lithium polymer battery  so I can take all that acreage, keep the Z depth really fast.  And it's just, it's a nice looking machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just hate to see something like that in your hands, though.  Because I just know you just snap it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually, are you gentle?  I think I've actually kept more notebooks alive than you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, don't look at me.  I'm not as bad as Ladderback.  True.  The killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I've actually, one of the funniest, one of my very first vendor meetings with  Jim Ladderback was with Zenith when Zenith still made notebooks.  And apparently he...  That's how long ago it was.  Yeah, this was like 1995.  And so he reaches forward to turn the notebook around because he wants to check the keyboard,  right?  Because it's like the first thing you want to do is, you know, how's the keyboard feel?  And it was like a mother leaping in front of a tiger to protect her baby.  Jim, what are we doing on Break It's Dillon when we have the entire media tour?  He was like, I'll be gentle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His reputation preceded him, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he had actually, I guess, dropped one on their previous media tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never seen anybody break more notebooks.  So you think you might maybe get one of those for yourself or Mrs. Norton or perhaps...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've got a fairly young MacBook that's...  Yeah, me too.  I think it actually has the same or a faster processor in it.  So I'm going to keep that rolling for a while.  But hey, you know what?  If I play the lotto and win, who knows?  Baby shoes or a new MacBook Air.  How is Malachi doing now?  He's...  Mordecai.  Mordecai.  Mordecai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lockeheim.  Wait a minute.  No, you're Malachi.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mine's Malachi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay.  Baby's doing good.  We had a really great spate of sleeping from like nine until four, and now we're back to  sort of the erratic sleeping.  He's grown like 19 inches in three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, my kid's 13.  He still doesn't sleep as he did at night.  So just get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still trying to get over the idea that the tiny creature you brought on the set back  in the day is now driving.  Can you believe, Henry?  Oh, Abby, yeah, she drove me here.  Does she know how to use turn signals?  Yeah.  How did she get her driver's license in California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a learner's permit.  So California used to teach kids, you know, the schools used to teach kids.  Now they just go, no, go ahead, have at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you know, it's part of being 43rd in the nation in education.  And actually those cuts, I think, are going to really help us get down into the bottom,  you know, 49 or 50.  Here comes Arkansas.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to point out that even before I had a child, I was bitter about the pathetic  state of education in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you send your kid to school here?  So yeah, we have, she gets in the car and you drive with her.  Right.  Is she driving a stick?  No, no, it's automatic.  She got a, she drove the Lexus.  But we, she drove all the way.  She drove the Lexus.  She says, dude, I like this car.  I said, don't like it too much.  It's much nicer than mom's Toyota van.  And she drove all the way to San Francisco.  She parked in this garage.  I said, honey, I've scraped my car many a time on the poles in this garage.  This is a killer garage.  Drive carefully.  She did a beautiful job.  And then we drove home.  I was, I, I might, but we made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My first drive in a loader's permit was from Danboro, Pennsylvania, population eight to  Newark airport on a Thursday afternoon across route 22.  Good Lord.  It was great.  Cause you know what?  What do you like to drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was a cab driver in New York a long time ago.  Were you?  You want to talk about driving.  Okay.  When you're going down Lexington Avenue and a hand goes up four blocks down, you got six  other guys around you.  That's, that's driving.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.  How long did you do that?  I didn't know you were a cabbie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was a, I drove for about the four months.  That's all I could take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's gotta be the world's toughest job.  That was tough.  Yeah.  That was tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's gotta be murder.  It's, it's 12 hour shift and it's very competitive.  And, and you know, you can't have driving where it sits in a really tight area.  So like your legs have to be wide open so the steering wheel can fit in there.  And you got some weird people in the back seat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were driving probably one of those old, those beautiful, what were they called?  Checker cabs.  Checker cabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Marathons.  No, I'm, I'm old, but not that old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I loved those.  Ford Galaxy.  They'd have the drop down, the seat.  Yeah, the two little seats.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually I drove them back for a little while there.  But now they're, they're gone.  I drove one of those little ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  So, so this is, to me this seems like Macworld is, is revived.  It seems like this show is, is like the old Macworld Expo used to be.  It's no longer the iPod or even iPhone accessory show.  There's a lot of stuff.  Would you agree Bert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was expecting to be an iPhone show.  Yeah.  Like last year was an iPod.  I remember last year I counted 42 vendors with selling sleeves for iPods.  Yeah.  And so I was expecting an iPhone show.  But I was surprised that it, it has kind of come back to what it was, that energy's in  the air, which is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Software vendors have come back.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Intuits.  Yeah.  iPhone cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And there are little software vendors too.  I think Leopard has really helped with people being able to develop software, you know,  cheaply and really beautifully.  So I'm seeing a lot more of the smaller software vendors out there that's really making beautiful  things.  So that's also exciting to actually see them here in person and talk to them and try them  out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex, you, you, you follow the kind of the content creation space.  I mean, Apple's always kind of been the leader in that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I mean, I think that one of the things that makes it, and we, we not only follow it, we  make content software.  So a DV garage, the DV mat and conduit and so on and so forth.  And so one of the things we know is that there's a lot of things that you can just do on a  Mac because of core audio, because of core video, and now because of core animation,  the tools that Apple gives us to get this stuff done makes it easier from a developer's  point of view, because I don't have to figure out what, I don't have to figure out what  the situation is.  I don't have to figure out how to get in and out of the computer, in and out of the video  camera or an audio device.  I just tell the operating system, give me that input.  And if someone builds a card that's compliant and I'm compliant, I don't have to do all  the work in between.  And that's why we have all these cool little applications that look pretty and do cool  things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is there AVC HD native support in Final Cut Pro yet?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't know.  I think so.  Didn't they update it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think, I think there is.  I believe they updated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't do Final Cut Express anymore.  I know.  Ever since the incident.  What was the incident?  The incident was that we got Final Cut Express and we found out the reason it did a lot of  things poorly is because it turns out to be, or at least did a lot of things differently  from Final Cut Pro as a certain well informed person told me.  It's an entirely different code base from Final Cut Pro.  Is it really?  I didn't know that.  And then right about the time we realized we needed to upgrade to Final Cut Pro to get  some of the tools we needed, they basically eliminated the ability to buy Final Cut Pro  at a discounted upgrade or without buying the multi-thousand dollar package of accessories

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  around it.  I'm happy with it.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a different program.  It's a wonderful editing program but if you're in a production environment you basically  need to be all one or all the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not really designed for that.  I mean Express was really designed for the individual editor who wants to get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta say Adobe Premiere, the latest version, is so, it's incredible to watch the changes  they've made.  That's a good program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they are thinking about production environments.  And even Premiere Elements is still a pretty darn good program for the low end.  I mean for under a hundred bucks.  Google accidentally, I guess it was a Google PR person announced, whoops, that, I guess  this is from TechCrunch, Duncan Riley writing in TechCrunch.  He says, I asked if Picasa for Mac was coming and as luck would have it I managed to pick  the Google employee with the least amount of media training.  Her response, Picasa for the Mac is under development and will be launched later this  year shortly.  She tried, afterwards she tried backtracking and disappointed me with somebody who would  give her the right answer.  Give her it.  Nice.  But that's good news.  Because even Google's looking at Macintosh as being a, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus Preview is like the worst photo previewing application ever invented.  No, yeah.  You mean, Album?  I mean it's great for PDFs.  No, well, just like, it's just in terms of, I'm so used to Windows where you can basically,  you know, quickly skim through.  Oh, the built in Macintosh Preview.  Yeah, the one that's built into OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think it'll be nice to have Picasa.  I think that's a great program.  And iPhoto has always been a little bit of a laggard.  And I think it will be nice to have competition if nothing else.  Big story this week.  It actually came out yesterday.  Yahoo is going to start supporting OpenID for the single sign-on.  That's huge.  That puts OpenID on the map.  In fact, they announced that they will be offering all current account holders the chance  to upgrade OpenID accounts.  Yes, Mr. Norton?  What's an OpenID?  I have no idea.  I just was reading the story out of it.  OpenID is this, remember Passport, Microsoft Passport, that eel faded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So who manages OpenID?  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which means it'll be much more secure and reliable.  The accountability there is just staggering to comprehend.  It's an open source standard.  And you can choose an OpenID vendor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the people control it, Mr. Laporte.  People control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In this case, for instance, Yahoo agrees to support OpenID.  It supports the standards, the API, and then they can interface.  So for instance, you could come, a Twit.TV support does support it.  We don't currently use it.  But you could go there and instead of using a Twit login, you could use your Yahoo login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this isn't just shopping.  This could be like controlling all of my passwords everywhere and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our friend Kevin is going to be doing it at Digg.  In fact, I think he is doing OpenID at Digg.  So that's good news with Yahoo behind it.  AOL has also announced they're going to support it.  I think OpenID finally will live up to the promise of Passport.  I love the idea.  I signed up for a Passport account, but nobody wanted to play with Microsoft.  Microsoft owns it.  We don't want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somehow we thought that might be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why.  I can't understand that.  I have to say I was very pleased to see Office 2008.  Oh my god.  That was...  Intel native?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Intel native.  Okay, so if you have an older Mac, the early testing says on G5 and earlier Macs, performance  slower.  But if you have an Intel-based Mac, performance better.  And the interface, I just love it.  It's basically the Office 2007 Windows interface.  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they can't do the ribbon 100% unfortunately because Macintosh API guidelines require that  you support Macintosh drop-down Windows.  But they fudged it, which meant that they did a good job where you could push a button  and then you get the ribbon.  Well, it's such a desperately needed upgrade.  I agree.  Oh yeah, it was a laggard program.  Other stories.  You might like this, Patrick.  I know you're a car fanatic.  I was surprised you weren't actually at the Detroit Auto Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never managed to make any of the auto shows.  It seems like that would be something you would like to do.  I'd never have enough seniority or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big surprise at the Detroit Auto Show.  The Prius is now going to offer a plug-in hybrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen the specs for the new one, but they've actually offered an EV mode everywhere  but the US since 2004.  You can basically...  The heart of the EV hacks that people have been doing over at Cal Davey, where basically  you take out the existing battery packs, you put in more powerful battery packs, and you  basically buy a $14 switch that says electric mode or EV mode from the Toyota dealership  and wire it in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of the best of both worlds.  It's a plug-in car.  You can charge the batteries and run electric fully, but you always have a gas engine so  you don't have to be near a plug.  I think there's real demand for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More batteries should be great.  One of the things we're playing around on system, and I'm trying to figure out whether  or not we can fit it in the budget, is for my commuter vehicle, basically turning either  a 68 Mustang or a 57 F-100 into an electric vehicle.  How many batteries is it going to have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to have the whole bed of the F-100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting is when you look at...  When you start...  Not really.  One of the most interesting ones I've seen, if you have millions of dollars, you go lithium  ion and you get this incredibly dense battery pack.  Even the companies that have millions of dollars...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't they expensive?  Most people like, for instance, this Prius is using a nickel cadmium or a nickel metal  hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lithium ion's expensive and it's challenging for the charging environment.  It's funny, people are like, lead acid is evil.  You can't use lead acid batteries.  The truth is it's actually one of the best managed recycling stories in the United States  in terms of actually a very minuscule percentage of batteries actually don't get recycled.  Because the materials inside of them are valuable and it's something that there's been so much  awareness on basically.  The negative on them is they're big and heavy.  They're big and heavy, but I've seen a Porsche 959 converted into an electric vehicle and  they actually managed to shoehorn, I think it was 20, pretty big Anterosys batteries  inside of that.  I just want mine to run off laptop batteries.  Well, if you get enough laptop batteries together...  Well, there's a certain...  That's what the Tesla is.  Yeah, except they can't seem to get their battery supply straightened out.  Were you on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Calacanis says he's ordered a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually know two people who have ordered Teslas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not expensive to order, it's expensive to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, yeah, well, even if you put it down payment, it's not expensive  to order, but they just got rid of their CTO, the production's been delayed and it all keeps  wrapping around battery issues and battery availability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a transmission issue too.  I think transmission...  Just buy one of those and take the batteries out and put in your 68 Mustang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that takes it from an $8,000 or a $4,000 project to a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Small increment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you going to do this on system though?  I'm trying to figure out a way to make it work financially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's really exciting because I think that we can talk a lot about ethanol and we  can talk a lot about all these other things that we can do.  Ethanol is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ethanol is a political monster.  It's evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was stunned to learn it takes more natural gas, more gasoline to produce ethanol than  it would be to just use the gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's other issues.  I mean, you have...  Not only does it take more energy, but you're using up an enormous amount of water and you're  running the corn prices into the ceiling.  Right.  So feet, which is used for feet.  And barley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So beer's getting more expensive.  Well, that's the worst.  They're going corn instead of barley.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, it's bad.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop.  So Suntory is going to be expensive.  Stop.  That's the corn beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that from...  I really think that electric is...  Whether we back it up with gas or ethanol or whatever, I think electric is really what  we need to be getting to because that means we can centralize where the power is coming  from.  And then if we change it...  Then you can use efficiency.  If you upgrade the central...  What we don't want to do is keep on trying to upgrade gas into...  Well, I mean, gasoline is like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, what a lot of people don't realize is gasoline is this incredibly efficient means  of transporting potential kinetic energy.  A lot of energy in a gallon of gas.  Vast...  I mean, not an order of magnitude, but probably...  I want to say three times as much energy in a cubic meter of liquid gas than there is  in a cubic meter of liquid hydrogen, right?  Really?  Yeah, I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also blows up more slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it all depends on how you store it, right?  More controlled.  It's all about how it blows up when it hits that bridge at 170.  But I mean, it's also interesting, but there's so many...  You got Archer Midland and all these big companies that are really pushing ethanol.  So they have the lobbyists.  Everybody wants farmers to not get subsidized and make their own living.  And that sounds great.  But it's also interesting to realize there's a great...  I think it's Popular Mechanics this month has a spectacular article on ethanol and why  it really...  We need a blend.  There's going to be...  There's no single point...  There's no single source to replace gasoline.  We need to try a whole bunch of different stuff.  Sawgrass, baby.  You know what?  If somebody will show me some sawgrass growing in a field and then convert it into something,  I'll be excited about sawgrass.  Everybody's very excited about sawgrass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cows do, but they have a different way.  So, Sun...  This is a more traditional story.  Sun Microsystems says they're going to plunk down a billion dollars and buy my SQL.  That just blows my mind.  I thought it was an open source project, but apparently it's a business available for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Sun that desperate for a business model?  Ouch.  Did I say that out loud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now, Sun has done a lot of open source, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a family member that makes a living off of dealing with Sun upgrades and migrations.  There goes your third Thanksgiving edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, MySQL is one of the most successful open source companies.  Of course, MySQL runs many, many websites.  It's part of LAMP.  Absolutely.  And the company had planned to go public, of all things, but Sun came along with a really  big check.  And they say that MySQL's revenue was $60 to $70 million a year.  So a billion isn't that out of the...  That's one and a half times earnings.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we're so good on the financial side of the business.  Yeah, I probably shouldn't be the guy to talk about...  Well, okay, is it going to make MySQL better or worse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.  I think having something like Sun behind it, kind of something maybe what helps stable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because, I mean, there are some amazing engineers at Sun.  It's not like there's no dearth of talent over there.  Right.  Or not like there's a dearth of talent over there.

Transcript:  I think, ultimately, like Novell acquiring SUSE, it's kind of a seal of approval for  the open source community.  It means this is a business and we've...  Yes, here comes Sco.  Stand back.  All right, let me see.  Oh, other financial news.  I know you're excited about financial news.  This was a very...  Last year, 2007, was a very good year for gaming.  Sales of all gaming titles and machines up 43%.  $17.94 billion in sales.  I mean, it is a huge market.  And guess who was the big winner?  EA.  Well, of course EA, but Nintendo.  Nintendo, the DS, which it's been able to make enough of, sold 2.47 million units in  December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, one in every 150 Americans has a DS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one month.  Eight and a half million units the entire year.  The Wii, of course, if they could have made more, would have done even better.  1.35 million Wiis in December.  Six million systems plus over the year.  Wow.  Really, it's been a big year for Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they making a lot of money on the Wii?  That's an interesting question.  I wonder what their margin is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say they're making a million plus a month and they can't keep them in stock.  They obviously could make more money if they could just make them faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think it's amazing that there's a video game that actually makes me sore.  I played it, I was staying at a friend's house and I started playing it.  There's a joke in there somewhere.  I don't know.  I wasn't going to...  I couldn't move my arm the next day.  Or my back or anything.  I thought this is what I need.  If I'm going to play video games, you need to get a little exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another exciting way to get repetitive strain injuries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Those lawsuits come five years from now.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony did well in December with PS3 moving, but not nearly as well even as the Xbox 360.  It's certainly not as well as the Wii.  I think, though, with what has become very clear a victory for Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or at least a nasty setback for HD DVD.  That was one of the big rumors floating around at CES that the price for Warner to abandon  HD DVD was $500 million.  Hey, it was worth it.  Totally unsubstantiated.  Well, if they actually managed to kill off HD DVD support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, HD DVD canceled its press conference.  It basically went away with their tail between their legs.  I have to think that Blu-ray is, at least in the minds of consumers, a victor.  If consumers start buying Blu-ray players as a result, I think it's all over.  We talked a little bit about that last week.  The interesting story on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great, we can get the bad interface and the more expensive hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's right.  That's the interesting thing.  The PS3 really is the Blu-ray player of choice because the new 2.0 spec requires the Blu-ray  player be networked.  In order to upgrade, you're going to need not only a networked player, but a player  that has upgradable firmware or a hard drive like the PS3.  So, it looks like, really, if you're going to buy a PS3, buy a Blu-ray player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't feel so bad about this if it didn't seem like Sony had to buy themselves out of  a bad position.  You know what I mean?  The HD DVD players seem better implemented.  The interface is more fun to use.  The original...  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked HD DVD a lot.  See, it's dead to you already.  It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I liked HD DVD.  The late great HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a nice spec.  The discs are dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think that's the question?  Did they resolve this conflict in time to even save discs or are people just going to  move right to downloadable?  I mean, look at Apple II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Downloadable, but the video quality, the difference in quality, if you've got a 42-inch or bigger  screen, there's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The question I have is, what is the percentage of people who have 42-inch?  I think we're very quickly getting to 2% or 3% of the population.  I go to most people's houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that mean 0.5% of the population owns an HD DVD or a Blu-ray player then?  It's a very small number.  Very small.  Because if you look at the CEA numbers, there's an astonishing number of HD TVs being sold  every month.  Oh, no, there's an enormous number of them, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still a fraction of the total ownership, though.  Or the size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How big are these sets?  There's a lot of HD...  I have an HD set, but it's 37 inches.  I'm not going to see the difference between 720 and 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On a lot of the online delivery, some of the online delivery just looks crummy.  And you think Comcast looks okay?  No, I think Comcast looks...  I was on a panel at CES with the president of the National Cable Television Association,  which was a really interesting moment for me because we started talking about the business  model for cable and startups, and obviously my experience at Tech TV weighed in on that.  Positively, I'm sure.  Yeah, positively.  Look, Comcast quality in San Francisco is atrocious.  It's pathetic.  The SD channels look like hell.  The HD channels don't look much better.  But if I'm going to be like, if it's an HD format, I don't want to see compression artifacts  and action scenes.  And most of the online delivery is basically slightly better than DVD quality.  I look forward to...  I've got my Apple TV primed up.  It's back out of the box in the basement where it's been sitting.  I'm going to connect it.  I'm going to rent some movies.  The early specs, the resolutions are still sort of centering around 720p.  It doesn't seem to be a 16 by 9 format.  It doesn't say 16 by 9.  It's like 2.35 to 1.  It's a non...  Engadget folks actually spend a bunch of time downloading the movies and inspecting them  through iTunes.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Double letter boxed on the 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Slightly.  Much less than before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If somebody can get me 720p or better, full 720p quality, I'll be thrilled.  If it's more 720ish, that's highly compressed, I'm not so thrilled.  That's the promise of this.  The extreme HD guys were talking up a storm at CES where they're talking about doing basically  Netflix delivery via satellite for all intents and purposes.  So you'll have a box, you have a server in your house and a box next to your television.  They're going to be downloading basically like full or closer to full Blu-ray or HD  DVD quality movies.  Will it work?  Well, they don't have any studio agreements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think part of it is does it have to be that...  Because I'm a perfectionist.  I want it to be all perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You shoot family videos with a $600,000 studio camera.  I say that with love and respect because you're my kind of geek.  He does.  The man sees things that normal humans cannot because that's what you do.  It's your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I do love that end of it.  But the question that I have is are we going to get to a point where it's good enough for  most of the population?  My parents have an HD set or something that they call an HD set.  They think it's HD.  They think it's HD.  Right.  It looks horrible.  I mean, it looks...  I don't think it's any sharper than it was before.  And it's fine for them.  I'm watching DVDs on my 37-inch HD, whatever.  They look okay.  I mean, sure, they're not as sharp as they could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite...  If you watch Casino Royale, there's the big...  There's the chase.  There's an explosion in the beginning in the elevator shaft.  That is the best demonstration of compression artifacts I've ever seen in my life because  you throw that on an HD TV and basically all you can see is giant blocks of compression.  Yeah, admittedly, if I'm watching...  And you're watching that on Blu-ray?  No.  I'm watching that on the DVD version of that and actually the downloadable versions of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to get you to compare the Blu-ray version of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's significantly better.  I would think.  I take Alex's point.  It's sort of like you drink enough until she's cute.  It's the same thing we've found, I think, with...  No, wait, let me finish.  I don't know.  I think it's a pretty good start.  With what we've seen with iTunes and with music, if it's convenient enough, it's going  to look better and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, a 128-bit MP3 is atrocious.  Absolutely.  Atrocious.  128-bit AAC isn't much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they've sold four billion of them.  It's the standard.  Not million, but billion.  Right.  Well, I'm looking at what Netflix is doing.  Of course, Netflix jumping the gun because of this Apple announcement.  Admittedly, they're not very good looking.  I downloaded it.  But they're available.  They're free.  They're right there.  I know, but there's part of me that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're going to go to the point where you're getting a say...  In a couple years, everybody's going to have a 1080p television.  Because that's just...  You know what I mean?  It's the consumer adoption.  The consumer electronics adoption cycle.  In two years, a 42-inch 1080p television is going to be like $8.  It's going to come in a box of Cracker Jacks or it's going to feel that way.  They're going to give them away when you sign up for a new toaster at the...  Two years this is going to happen?  Three years.  Three and a half tops.  But you know what I mean?  And I don't particularly...  I have a problem with basically what's happening with music production.  I'm tired of new albums basically having everything compressed to the point where there's...  There's no low and no high.  But pop can't compete unless there's basically no dynamic range in the music.  There's different compresses on it.  I don't want over-compressed video.  I don't want to lose...  I don't want to be watching somebody's spectacular cinematic effort, whether it's shot on digital or film.  They've gone through all this effort to produce what is art, right?  You're there.  You're down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think actually you and Alex are a lot alike in this respect.  And I think you have higher standards than most of America does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, look, I too have sung along with AM radio that sounded like ass fading in and out of the distance.  And it's a wonderful mythical experience.  It's a very American thing.  But if I'm in my home, I don't want to be watching bad quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other reality is a lot of studies show that if your monitor isn't bigger than 60 inches and you're not closer than 10 feet to the screen, you can't tell...  You can't see anyway.  You can't tell the difference between 720p or 1080p.  Sure.  I'm not arguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The point is this is America, damn it.  And we have choices.  So, Patrick's...  Oh, yeah.  Bring on the free...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you're going to tell me that I've got choices and I confuse something other than cable or DSL in my local community.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get your dish.  So, I mean, I love convenience.  My family loves convenience.  I don't really care about the fidelity of a movie at home.  If I really, really want good fidelity, I'm going to go to good cinema.  If I were on a really good experience, I'm going to go to a good cinema.  So, it's all about the free enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's ask Mr. Normal here, Burt Munroy, who has...  Who?  Mr. Normal?  Mr. Normal.  He's got a great eye.  He's in the art this bank creation.  He sees everything.  What do you have at home?  What do you watch at home, Burt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I actually have a 43-inch cinema display, you know, big plasma.  I don't watch it much because I pretty much sit in front of my two Cintiqs with my 30-inch Apple and I look at pixels the size of postcards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're spoiled by your 30-inch display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm looking at everything at 1600% magnification.  So, the stuff you're looking at, I...  Do you ever watch movies at home or anything like that?  Yeah, I used to do that a long time ago.  I haven't seen a movie in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Back when you were a cabbie.  The last time I saw a movie...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, I'll watch, like when Pixar comes out with a new movie, I'll go to a movie to see that.  I'll go to the theater to see that.  The whole experience of sitting in a chair for that many hours uncomfortably.  Can't go to the bathroom, you know, that kind of stuff.  But I pretty much spend my life in front of my screens.  So you have enough screen time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to spend any more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd rather make my pixels and watch somebody else's pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to interrupt a little bit because we want to welcome a sponsor.  It's a special sponsor for our Macworld shows.  It's istockphoto.com.  I'm sure you've heard of iStockPhoto.  Yay.  I use them a lot.  Do you? For your presentations?  For a long time.  They're the world's busiest, highest volume image market.  So for people like Craig Severson, a designer, somebody who's putting together presentations,  it's a great place to start looking for stock photo images.  Great image quality, huge selection, two and a half million images, 60,000 videos.  There are 30,000 more added each week from the world.  And the price is very affordable.  Images starting as low as a dollar for web use, video clips as low as $5.  If you're doing presentations as Craig is, you can get videos or images from $1 to $50.  Actually, you can get whole presentations, can't you? You can get templates.  I think so. But I got cows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really wanted a cow for this one particular shot.  And iStockPhoto, video, I got my cowshift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a revolution for photographers, people who want to sell their photos as well.  And not for videographers as well.  Yeah, I think it's great they're doing video.  So you know you're going to be on a site where there are a lot of people looking,  so you have a better chance of getting seen.  It's a free market. The little man has a chance.  It is. It's great. It's what the internet was all about,  these friction-free markets.  Contributors make up to 40% from each image or video they sell on the site.  In fact, they say, they're telling me at iStockPhoto,  there are many photographers and videographers now have quit their jobs  and just upload to iStockPhoto and they make a living.  Up to $200,000 a year just doing this.  I think it's great. It's supplemental income for most of you.  Most of you are not going to make $200,000, but I think it's a great idea.  iStockPhoto, now we've got a special deal.  20% off your first purchase if you're a new registrant.  You've got to use the promo code TWITSTOCK or visit iStockPhoto.com  slash TWITSTOCK for more information.  I think it's a great place to find images, to upload your images.  If you don't know about it yet, take a look at it.  iStockPhoto.com slash TWITSTOCK.  We do thank them so much for their support of our Mac World coverage all this week,  both on Mac Break Weekly and on Twitter.  Woohoo! Yes.  Was that a slash or is a TWITSTOCK just the code?  The code is TWITSTOCK, but you can do slash TWITSTOCK as well.  Both will work.  Both will work.  Both will work.  It's magic.  Magical.  Well, you know, Dvorak never showed up.  I don't know what his...  I'm here, Leo.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just saw him outside.  Did you?  When I was crossing the street.  Really?  Let's get some real content going.  He's hiding from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he is.  He's probably getting his personal MacBook Air right now.  I think he actually can't find us.  Many people don't understand this about John, but you know, he's wandering somewhere.  I will get an email from him saying, I couldn't find you.  I looked everywhere.  Where were you?  I can't find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got bored.  I went out.  I guarantee you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Went to the deli.  I guarantee you.  That's exactly what happened.  We're sorry we missed him.  And I know you're sorry you missed him because it's fun to make fun of John.  But we did.  It was really great to have Patrick Norton here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the name of that blog again?  Yeah, let's give him a plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  devorek.com slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sad thing is he said that so many times.  He's still going to have a 20% spike when this hits the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  We'll give him a plug.  devorek.org slash blog.  Thank you.  Hey, what can we plug for you, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He channels prep.  I was a single child.  I lived in the Midwest.  There was no cable TV or video games.  So you made your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I scared the hell out of the dog, but I kept myself amused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Memorize the phone book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a certain fun to having it done when we do this live.  I have to say, I miss working with you live in a live situation.  Artmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Acme.  Acme Motors.  Acme restaurants.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what's going on, but it's funny.  All right.  Craig Zeverson, let's give you a plug for gruntmedia.com.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And since we're at Macworld, I'll plug another show that I'm on with Kenji and John Foster  called MacBreak Tech, where we really go into a lot of, we just geek out for a long time  on technical issues around the Macintosh.  You're going to start doing that?  That's on Alex's network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex is also going to start doing a developer podcast, right?  Yeah.  We're working on hopefully-  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MacBreak Dev.  So that should come out in March.  It's going to be kind of more of the Patrick version of, you know, where basically Automator  is as light as it gets.  And then we go into AppleScript, Xcode, Shell, Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe you can help me get Automator to actually automate something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody just asked me though, they wanted a developer podcast.  I said, well, stay tuned because I think the date is due.  We're pretty excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the kind of podcast I've been wanting to do for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a hard launch date for that yet?  It's going to be the first week of March.  What's the best place to start looking for that show up?  It'll be up on pixelcore.tv.  And Grunt Media's favorite podcast is at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At techzilla.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bravo.  Bravo.  Made my favorite crack.  You guys are good pluggers.  Hey, while we're plugging, I just wanted to mention a book that I recently read on audible.com.  Have you read any Ken Follett?  You seem like you might like Ken Follett.  I haven't.  I always see the titles and they're compelling.  He normally writes kind of spy novels.  He wrote a novel about the Middle Ages and a cathedral building called the Pillars of the Earth.  And I just finished it.  I just adored.  I really enjoyed it very much.  And it's a wonderful, if you like, I'm a fan of long audio books.  40 hours.  You get your money's worth on this one.  But if you've got a long commute, this is a great choice.  Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth.  The Pillars of the Earth, that or any one of 45,000 other titles could be yours free when you go to audible.com slash twit and sign up.  There's, by the way, a sequel to this.  I didn't know, but I'm going to be listening to it called World Without End.  And that one's 35 hours.  I'm wondering.  Let me see.  No, 44 hours and 53 minutes.  Told you I could write a wrong novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe they read really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm listening to Spook Country by William Gibson right now.  Oh, the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know Patrick loved that.  And you're listening to that.  Good audiobook.  Spook Country.  I'll have to add that to my list.  It's a really good read.  This is my favorite part of the show.  It's when we share books, except that I end up with such a long list of books I've got to read.  It's a high class problem.  It is.  It is.  It is a first word problem.  Audible.com slash twit.  We love them.  We're glad that they've come back and are going to be part of the twit network for some time to come.  We appreciate their support as well.  Burt Monroy, Pixel Perfect is on revision three.  I know we can see that.  And we actually shoot it at Alex's place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alex does all the work.  So how do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you shoot a bunch of them at a time?  Eight shows.  We just shot eight this past Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're down to 72, right?  72 shows so far.  And how do you pick the stuff that you're going to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get emails from people and they say I want to see fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to see this or whatever.  And I base it on that.  Are you working on that?  I guess you're always working on a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, I'm getting ready to start a new picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just moved into a new studio.  And I'm trying to finish this book so I can start a new painting.  And I can tell you about it right now.  It's going to take about two to two and a half years to do it.  Whoa.  Wow.  It's a big one.  I decided to blow my brains out with it.  Wow.  That's exciting.  Well, that big one that I did that was 10 feet wide.  The train?  The train.  The train station?  I loved that.  I loved that.  This blows that away.  Right now, the smallest flattened file is 11.3 gigabytes.  And it's 26 feet wide.  And it's, well, it's a, you know, I like light bulbs and neons and little filaments and light  bulbs.  Well, try to imagine a 180 degree view of Times Square at night.  Oh, my gosh.  But no pepper.  Yeah, that's, well, there'll be some pepper in there.  So that's what I'm going to do.  That's amazing.  But I'll tell you the cool part about it, which you guys will probably be in it, is that  this will be the first time that I have people in it.  Because you can't have Times Square without people.  So there's about 600 and 650 people that are going to be in the street.  And they're all going to be people I know.  Cool.  Can we be in it?  Can we?  Yeah.  Everybody that I've dealt with in the last couple of years is going to be in that painting.  And all my personal friends, they're all going to be in a painting somewhere on Times Square  where people are going to be in it.  And I'm going to be in it.  And I'm going to be in it.  And all my personal friends, they're all going to be in a painting somewhere on Times Square  walking around doing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now normally you get it as a print, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is the print.  So you wouldn't, unless you really used a magnifying glass, you wouldn't be able to  see the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Well, you figure the average face is going to be about the good inch, three quarters  of a size.  How big is this going to be?  26 feet wide.  It's pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How big will the final file be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  11.3 gigabytes.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's flat.  That's flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's big.  That's flattened.  And it's pretty big.  Well, the thing is, you know, you talk about you have the magnifying glass.  I remember when I unveiled Damon, which is 40 inches by 120 inches, 10 feet, right?  I figured people were going to stand back and look at this thing.  Everybody was like four inches away.  Because you put so much detail.  Everybody's standing right next to this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're like the Hieronymus Bosch of Photoshop.  And there's so much going on.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mentioned Pepper because I've watched you teach people how to create pepper.  And it's like, that's so cool.  Oh my God.  Like Salt and Pepper?  Like the pepper inside the pepper container that's a small subset of the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The last painting of Luncheon Tiburon has a pepper shaker.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody's got to do it.  He's the guy.  It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next week, we can tear it off.  Two and a half years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, there's two things I missed about the screensavers.  One's Patrick.  You're the other one.  That was always a pleasure when you were in there.  I knew you were going to see something so much excitement and fun.  I miss it.  I'm glad we could still see it on Pixel Perfect or Revision 3.  Alex Lindsay is at Pixelcore.com if you want to find out more about the Pixelcore.  Pixelcore.tv is the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Pixelcore.tv, we have, I think we shot 30 episodes of MacBreak this week.  Wow.  So we've got iJustine, Justine Ezrake, Callie Lewis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now I see you only get the cute girls now.  Oh, they're really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I'm not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
