Transcript:  This Week in Startups, which is not our show, much to the chagrin of many of us.  This is the reason I'm dressed so strangely for those of you watching on video is I finally  got my steampunk laptop.  And so I thought I should dress for the occasion. This was built by look at this.  This cost me a mint about two years ago.  That's the good news is the money's long gone.  Bilt by a datamancer.net.  It is a normal Asus Windows 7 laptop from from about two years ago because it took him two years to encase it in wood.  There you go.  What's his name? Richard Nagy, I think.  To encase it in wood, to put brass keyboard on it and all of that stuff.  I'm not sure I would recommend this to anybody.  But I got it now, so I'm going to keep it.  But if you don't mind, I will take off the goggles and the hat because that's a little much does not hat not included.  That's a nice hat.  So we're going to be joined in a bit by Natalie Morris.  She's on vacation and so she's on vacation time, but that's OK.  There's plenty to talk about.  We were talking before the show began, though, about something that happened during the radio show.  And I thought it'd be worth kind of highlighting this before we get into the hard news.  And I guess Ed knows a little bit about this.  Somebody called the radio show and said, Hey, I downloaded something from download dot com.  And as a result, my Windows machine got a browser helper object, BHO installed that changed my home page, that changed my search engine.  I can't change it back.  What is this?  And I said, well, as far as I'm concerned, that's malware.  And you said that this is something that's being done routinely by not just download dot com, but a lot of download engines, Ed?  Yep, absolutely.

Start time: 280.28
End time: 304.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Download dot com is either the largest or the second largest source of software for Windows and the Mac in the world.  The other one is Softpedia.  And it's not 100 percent of the software that they make available, but some non non trivial percentage of it is wrapped.  Can you tell when you get it that it's wrapped?  Is there a way to know?

Start time: 305.38
End time: 305.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might.

Start time: 306.32
End time: 309.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it will have the name CNET in the installer.

Start time: 309.84
End time: 341.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you'll when you fire up the installer, it will say, you know, welcome to the CNET download installer.  So it's they're not trying to hide anything.  This is all a reasonably sophisticated computer user who goes through this can can either halt the installer.  There's nothing in there that's going to sneak on there without you having to have approved it along the way.  Let's see. Let's see.  So he said he downloaded the free YouTube downloader, which is one of the top 10 downloads on CNET.

Start time: 345.32
End time: 368.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it does say CNET editors note the download now link will download a small installer file, remain online until the end of the month.  The download now link will download a small installer file, remain online and double click the installer.  So this is the CNET software, the CNET wrapper says iron install.  And I'm going to run that.

Start time: 370.13
End time: 374.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, iron, iron install.  So this is a this is an Israeli company that.

Start time: 376.56
End time: 386.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's watch this because let's see how much how easy this is.  Well, the thing it installed on his system was kind of nasty, frankly.  OK, so here's a license agreement. Do I have to read this to find out?

Start time: 386.32
End time: 388.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not the CNET installer.

Start time: 388.38
End time: 417.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is something else. Yeah.  So maybe maybe I'm not going to hit something.  Oh, wait a minute. Here you go.  It shows installation type for the Delta toolbar install free YouTube downloader and Delta toolbar, a popular free toolbar designed to make searching and browsing easier.  I allow Delta search to be my default search engine, home page and new tab.  So if you read that, you'll say no, I'm going to do advanced instead of the recommended quick install.  And now I can uncheck those settings.

Start time: 417.58
End time: 423.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, you did it backwards.  You got it. You got to leave that check.  Now start from the bottom up.

Start time: 425.01
End time: 440.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to do it in the right order.  It's like a video. It's like a video game.  OK, now they're all unchecked.  You're saying that had I checked unchecked the first one, it looks like they're there below it.  So unchecking the first one will get rid of all of it.  But no, it doesn't.  And you need to do all three.

Start time: 440.54
End time: 443.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, see, do you see how they've done?  See what they've done?  See what they did.

Start time: 444.32
End time: 447.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See what they did there.  This isn't even the CNET one.

Start time: 448.11
End time: 476.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. So like I was like, I was.  Wait a minute. There's more web web cake.  I've gone through.  I've gone through some pieces of software that will install five different programs before they ever get to the thing that you actually wanted.  And then in addition to that, one or more of the programs that they install will at some point in the future download and install its own extra toolbars and stuff.

Start time: 476.69
End time: 477.20
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's awful.

Start time: 478.80
End time: 498.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I guess it's legal only because they they tell you and you're saying, but well, this says Web Cake.  This is another piece now from the same downloader is a browser add on that sweetens sites with features and tools for enhanced search results inline word references.  Site ratings and reviews, special offers and comparing deals.  In other words, I'm going to get a hell of a lot of pop ups.

Start time: 499.08
End time: 503.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's even worse than that because what it's probably going to do is what's called injection.

Start time: 504.22
End time: 508.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it says it will include advertisements and are not affiliated with underlying sites.

Start time: 509.58
End time: 519.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so what's going to happen is if you were to go to, say, Twit TV, it would take if you have an ad on the page there, it would replace it would replace that ad with one of their own.

Start time: 521.46
End time: 548.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow. So you know, I'm not going to accept I'm going to decline.  So that will stop it, right? That will stop it.  OK, I declined. Wait a minute. There's more. This one's really bad.  Safe Savers designed to save you money wherever you shop online.  Simply visit a participating online store. It's going to show me coupons.  It's an ad support software. No cost. La la la decline.  So what does that do? It's going to just put comparison pop ups up.

Start time: 548.52
End time: 589.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to take over pretty much the bottom half of the browser window.  Oh, geez. Right. When you're when you're at a site that's trying to sell you something like Amazon, you know, they'll they'll put their own ads and links on the bottom of it, trying to get you to buy from them.  Now they're basically they're basically replacing the web experience with their own experience.  And pop ups would be bad enough.  But these are actually rewriting the web pages that you think you're voluntarily going to.  That's that injection technique again. Right.

Start time: 591.41
End time: 603.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you could see how an average person would say, well, that's all right.  And say, OK, although OK, so I'm going to decline that.  So now it's going to install. I'm terrified because I don't usually use Windows.

Start time: 603.50
End time: 659.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to really be sorry. We're not going to be able to tell from your computer because you had so much crap where we actually will be able to tell.  So when you get when you get to the end of this, what you can do is go to the managed programs window and look at what's been installed.  Control panel. Right. And either sort it by date or filter to show today's date.  And then and then you'll be able to see what if anything they snuck on there.  But it looks like you did the way these things all the work, the way that they stay above law enforcement's radar is to at least hew to the letter of the law by giving you the right to opt out of all those installations.  So they will go through. They'll say, hey, we disclosed everything there.  We had links to our terms of service agreement.  You agreed to it. Privacy policy. You agreed to it.

Start time: 661.08
End time: 664.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it isn't really it's not fair to call it malware. It isn't malware.

Start time: 665.00
End time: 738.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as they tell you. I don't know. I you know, I there are the line.  The line on some of these things is I would call it extremely deceptive software, especially when you install one of those things and you think that all you're doing is installing one thing.  But what you don't realize in the terms of service that you didn't read is that it reserves the right to install more software later on.  Later. So later. Oh, I had it.  So I had a neighbor who came over. She brought me her brought me her computer over and she had done something very similar.  She had a new computer. She wanted to and I had installed Windows on it for her.  I know it was perfectly clean when she brought it over.  She had gone looking for a Post-it Notes program, something like she had used before.  She went and installed this thing and all of a sudden she was getting pop up.  She was getting things taking over her browser page.  And I went in and looked at it and I saw the date when she had installed this Post-it Notes program and a few other things with it.  And then every two or three days after that, there were more programs that had installed themselves.

Start time: 739.87
End time: 754.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what's really scary. I mean, but you read to it.  So Ed is coined a new phrase, a new term, douche wear. It's not malware.  That was Matthew. Oh, Matthew. Matthew. Nice job.

Start time: 755.28
End time: 757.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Thanks. I put that on my tombstone.

Start time: 759.46
End time: 783.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and you know, here's the interesting thing. It's not just for OK.  And by the way, the people reason people go to download dot com is because it says we scan it for malware before we give it to you.  So people go there because they think it's safer.  So that's even more annoying.  Secondly, it's not just download dot com, as you said, other downloads, but even Oracle's doing this with Java now.

Start time: 783.32
End time: 819.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Oracle's done this with Java for years.  And to me, what's worse, the worst thing about Java is that it's not just the first time you install it, you have to make a choice.  And then after that, it's fine. You know, you have to keep Java up to date.  Right. Really. You don't care not. Yeah.  And so each time Oracle prompts you to update Java, you have to go through that installer and uncheck the box for the toolbar again.  Each time. Each time.

Start time: 820.20
End time: 831.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd be like, yeah, it's like your doctor tries to give you a tries to sell you on a timeshare every time he gives you a vaccination.  Douchwear. Hard to believe that this is going on.

Start time: 834.74
End time: 838.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, Ed, you said that this is because shareware authors no longer can expect to get paid.

Start time: 839.66
End time: 911.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correct. So we have the software industry as buyers.  We have become accustomed to thinking that ten dollars is a horrendous sum of money to pay for software.  And that four ninety nine or ninety nine cents is what an app should cost.  Right. Right. And and so a lot of good software that used to cost 20 or 30 dollars, sometimes 15 dollars, sometimes 10 dollars.  The authors can't get anyone to pay for that anymore.  And they can't make any money delivering, you know, windows or Mac software.  And having to support it and support downloads and support registration and licensing and support themselves.  So basically, there's a dilemma that software developers are in.  They can either go with these monetization companies which load up their installers with special offers at which in turn allow them to make a frightful sum of money or they can take a day job.  And get out of the software business.

Start time: 912.88
End time: 917.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. It doesn't seem to be as much of a problem on the Mac in the Mac world, or is it?

Start time: 919.17
End time: 938.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I have not done as much looking there.  I do know that there are that I have had people report to me that they've had similar add ins installed with Mac software.  But, you know, the Apple has had their Mac software store for quite a while now, and I think they've conditioned.

Start time: 939.35
End time: 945.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're part of the problem, really, because to go there.  Yeah. And and that's where you start get used to five dollar, one dollar programs.

Start time: 945.84
End time: 958.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, the only people who can sell software for 20 or 30 dollars at the Mac store are Apple and a very, very small number of companies making high end professional software.

Start time: 958.32
End time: 971.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. You know, so I initially was really tempted to chastise CNET and its parent corporations, CBS, for doing this.  But now it sounds to me like everybody's doing it.

Start time: 972.36
End time: 1029.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you should. You still should. And I should. And I should. And just full disclosure, I work for CDNet. CDNet is a division of CBS Interactive.  This is your company doing this.  This is my company doing this. I have talked to top executives at at our company.  I have made it. I have made my feelings about this practice very loudly known.  I think it's horrible. But apparently there's enough money.  Yeah, it's hard to turn away that that, you know, that they'll go as long as we disclose it properly.  Right. And as long as this is a widely accepted industry practice, we're not going to change it.  Wow.  Unless so, you know.  Extremely disappointing.  Extra extraordinarily disappointing. But it is the best argument possible for curated app stores on every platform.

Start time: 1030.32
End time: 1055.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's probably why Microsoft, Apple, Google, they're all doing it.  Right.  And you don't see this stuff there. Of course, they get a cut. So they're monetizing in other ways.  Wow. That's just I was shocked. I had no idea. But I've never I haven't I don't go to download.com or Softpedia to get my stuff.  I like to go to the original authors page. But even there, you occasionally see this stuff.

Start time: 1055.78
End time: 1059.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even there you will still you will still get this stuff if this is what they've chosen.

Start time: 1059.54
End time: 1064.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well, that YouTube downloader that wasn't seen it. That was the YouTube downloader doing it.  Correct.

Start time: 1065.54
End time: 1071.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I'm sad. OK. We started we started on a bummer, Leo.

Start time: 1071.52
End time: 1196.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we're going to get we're going to go to a high point because you know what I brought with me?  The blue bag I got at the Motorola event. So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Why don't you try Natalie now? I'll do a little break and we'll see if we can get Natalie on the horn.  Meanwhile, I'll talk about stamps.com. This is a pro tip for anybody who does a lot of mailing.  You wouldn't do it if you you know, you just send a postcard out from now or then.  But you know, there are a lot of people who sell online at Etsy or eBay or Amazon or PayPal.  People who send out invoices on a regular basis or mailers.  There's really no reason you should be using a postage meter. That's crazy.  Really expensive. And there's probably no reason that you should be going to the post office at all.  When you can just do everything you want from your desk at stamps.com.  I mean, literally 24 7 print postage using your computer and your printer at stamps.com.  They've got a deal. It'll get you this USB scale for free.  That's nice because it you plop the letter on there. It always has exactly the right postage.  And whoops, there you go.  And the it'll even recommend the class of mail that you should be using for that package.  It'll print labels. It can go right on a box.  Print right on the envelope with your logo, return address.  Pull the addresses from the eBay or PayPal or Amazon or Etsy site.  It'll everything you need automatically.  If you're selling internationally, it'll fill out the international customs forms.  Yeah, click that link in the upper right hand corner there, the microphone, and use our offer code twit.  And we're going to get you a pretty good deal here.  A hundred ten dollar TWIT in the offer code there. A hundred ten dollar bonus value.  You get fifty five dollars in free postage you can use over the first few months of your stamps account.  The digital scale is free. You pay the shipping and handling. I think it's five bucks.  You get a five dollar supply kit to make up for that.  And of course, for four weeks free of stamps.com.  Got to give it a try. If you do mailing at all.  Stamps.com, use our offer code twit.  And we thank them for their support. Look who's here.  I realize, Natalie, you're on vacation. Why are you, why did you agree to even do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we're back. We're back this week. But it's had a little scheduling snafu with babysitters and such.  And we just came back from, we were at Fox fan night for my husband Clayton's job and getting back to prove to take a little bit more time than I thought.

Start time: 1230.34
End time: 1337.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't know what I can say, but I'm under a non disclosure, which I've not done in 10 years.  I don't do these. And so I can't tell you what what happened, but they did give me a bag at an event I went to.  And I thought, well, I can probably show what's in this bag. Guy Kawasaki gave me a book.  There's video Robert Scoble posted video of me and Guy and everybody and an executive for Motorola.  I don't know what he was doing at that event, but he was.  So Guy has now worked for every one of the giants.  I asked him and he said, I don't think this is under NDA.  He said about a third of his time is at Motorola. Good guy to pick for Motorola.  I'm not sure what Motorola is about to announce. Maybe it's in this bag they gave us.  I haven't gone through it yet. Oh, look, a Jack sound engine.  I don't know what from from Saul Republic.  And here it is, ladies and gentlemen, you've been waiting for it.  The new Moto. Oh, no, it's just a universal portable power pack.  That's all. They say.  That's all. That's all there is.  There ain't no more. So don't ask me about it.  I can't say anything at all.  But Eric Schmidt has been walking around with something in his hands that doesn't look like anything we've seen before.  What do you think that is?  And you're just left holding the bag.  All I got is a battery in a bag.  But Eric got something there.  This is why I don't do NDAs, because I could not.  I could not say what that is or anything that I might or might not know about it.  But if you guys want to say anything, you can.

What's interesting about this is that the leaks are apparently coming fast and furious for a new phone.  We are pretty sure it's going to be called the Motorola X.  I can't say anything about that.  But Rogers, apparently a video was leaked out from Rogers that kind of talked about how it worked and all the things in it.  The website is inactive yet, but somebody was able to get it.

Transcript:  That's not fiction.  You only need your voice without touching it at all.  You can get directions, set an alarm or do nearly anything just by talking.  Plus, with the speed of the Rogers LTE network, your responses will be delivered nearly instantly.  Moto X's personalized experience also includes active updates.  This means Moto X is always paying attention and ready to tell you what you need to know.  Instead of a blinking light that doesn't actually tell you anything.  Information quietly appears on the screen.  You decide if updates need to be addressed right away or if they can wait until later.  Moto X can also launch the camera in a flash.  No need to press a button or slide an icon.  Just twist your wrist twice and it's ready to shoot.  Once the camera is launched, start snapping photos by pressing anywhere on the touch screen.  We can stop it.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, Google Now is obviously their marquee feature, right?  And Google knows it and is starting to kind of embrace that.  And so I think that building a phone essentially around Google Now was the best thing they could have done.  If this is indeed kind of what's going to roll out, we'll have to hedge our bets on that, right?  But a Google Now phone is the future of Google, right?  Of Android and of their branch of Android, I should say.  Because I really think that in the end, the most powerful sort of selling point  and the most compelling feature that they have on Android altogether is Google Now.  Explicitly because it's something only they can really do because of the amount of data they have on you  and the breadth of data.  So it's not just they have a lot in one vertical.  They have a lot of information about different things, about location and about appointments and about email  and about all this stuff.  And I don't think anybody else really has that information.  Or if they have it, they're not leveraging it right.  I love Google Now.  So I think a Google Now phone is the right way to go.

Google is retiring Latitude.  The location service August 9th turns off.  They have a new Google Maps version 7.0.  They're pushing out now to Android and I presume at some point to iPhone.  Actually, iPhone is a separate app.  So I guess they'll just take it off or just turn it off.  I used it, but I don't think I think a lot of people probably didn't.  It would. It has this nice feature that you could look at your dashboard and see where you've been.

Start time: 1866.79
End time: 1894.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no, I used it a lot.  I was really, I was disappointed actually about this, but I mean, you're just going to have to be forced to learn to use it within Google+.  I think that's the smart move on their part.  You can't have all of these services that do something similar, but it's really going to be a smart move.  But it's really going to push a lot more people inside Google+.  My mother-in-law uses Latitude a lot, and she was pretty disappointed as well.  So she had never really used Google+, and now she will.  Well, that's the plan.

Start time: 1895.36
End time: 1991.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the plan.  I mean, there's two things I like.  I agree.  If you're sharing it, and it's a limited group of people, people you really know and trust with your location, but it's hugely valuable for that.  And then it also tells you your historical information, which is pretty wild.  So here's, for instance, a map of the few people that I follow and where they are.  It'll show me where I've been.  The location history is actually really wild.  It'll show you a graph of how often you're, how much you're at work, how much you're at home, where you go the most.  I apparently spent 26 hours working last week.  My average is 14 hours a week.  That's not so good.  So the truth finally comes out.  The truth comes out.  You know, I thought it was more.  I really did.  But now I know.  You can see how many countries you've visited, how many trips you've taken, how many miles total you've traveled.  I just think this is neat.  This is metadata.  Yeah.  Well, the NSA's got it.  Why shouldn't I?  Seriously.  I mean, since somebody else, if people are compiling this, it shouldn't.  This is one thing I like about Google.  They admit, yeah, we know this.  Would you like to see it?  And you even have a delete button or whether that works.  I don't know.  I have traveled 128,000 miles since I turned this on.  In 97,000 more, I'll have made it to the moon.  That's my bar graph on my way to the moon.  I don't know.  I think this is cute.  I like metadata, especially when it's about me.

Start time: 1992.58
End time: 2012.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the funny thing is, though, they allow you to check in now on Google Latitude so you can check in and mark the places that you want to remember.  But I don't use that really.  And they want it to be more like a foursquare where you keep track of where you've been.  So you go back there.  It's just not the right platform for that.  Better to keep that all in Google+.

Start time: 2014.65
End time: 2018.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  They know that location value information is valuable.  Yeah.

Start time: 2020.39
End time: 2053.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the check ins are how you monetize a service like this.  That's how you demonstrate loyalty to a location, a store, a restaurant.  It's a ballpark or whatever it is.  And then that becomes something that Google can sell advertising to.  And Google is an advertising company.  So not a value judgment there, but ultimately a service like that has to be tied to very specific high value advertising to be useful to Google.

Transcript:  As alternative private search service DuckDuckGo, they say they delete all the search records.  They don't save them. They don't give them to the government because they can't.  Says that their traffic has doubled.  Although if you look at the actual traffic, you know, twice nothing is not a lot.  But some people are very sensitive and they're turning to places like DuckDuckGo.  You don't have to use Google or you can use it in a private way.  Can you? You disagree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have an IP address and if you have cookies enabled, if you're signed into any Google service,  just about every website that you go to has some sort of Google button on it or Facebook button or Twitter.  And so you're leaving little footprints everywhere you go.

Start time: 2103.17
End time: 2122.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's actually a really good point.  The like button and Twitter buttons can be used to follow you around as long as sites have Google plus like or Twitter buttons on there.  That's really a signal back to the home office that you're there.  Even if you don't click, you don't have to click them. That's right.

Start time: 2123.15
End time: 2145.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to click any button.  Just visiting the page triggers the beacon, basically.  And so as a result, I mean, this is the you know, we started the show talking about monetization.  This is where the monetization comes from.  For these web services is people following you around Facebook, Twitter, Google.

Start time: 2147.11
End time: 2154.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess my attitude is I understand you got to monetize.  You got to be upfront about it, though.  And it backfires if you monetize by abusing your customers.

Start time: 2156.11
End time: 2217.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Twitter, for instance, their buttons do track.  Right. Obviously, any Twitter button you see on a page that offers a like a beacon, like Ed said.  But their adoption of do not track allows you to actually have those buttons not follow you around the web and then have Twitter not use that information.  But most companies, however, do not implement do not track that way.  So some people have been giving Twitter kudos.  And I agree in this instance on that specific case that they're doing it how is best for consumers.  But most people don't. And it's not in their best interest to do so.  It's not in the best interest to make it easy, I should say.  So they have to kind of assuage the wonks just enough to where that they can give people like the ability like, oh, sure.  You go into this setting and go into these 17 nested settings and then toggle this off and that on.  And you're good. Right. And so that that assages their need.  But it doesn't make it easy. It doesn't make it consumer friendly.  And it's certainly not opt in. It's always opt out. Right.

Start time: 2218.98
End time: 2233.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I turn on do not track in my browser, does that because that's a new setting that you see in browsers now.  Zero effect. No benefit. Zero benefit.  It doesn't. Wait a minute. You say when you check that box, do not track on Twitter doesn't do anything.

Start time: 2234.44
End time: 2290.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the do not track standard has not been adopted yet.  It's actually it's actually the do not track standard is being debated by the World Wide Web Committee right now, the W3C.  And the standard is in its death throes at the moment.  The committee is basically reading, reading the W3C do not track committee mailing list is like reading.  I don't know that the collected letters from Deadwood in 1878.  It's everyone wants to kill everyone.  And basically the standard is coming down to last call next month.  Wow. And the advertising industry and the privacy advocates are have basically reached a point where they cannot agree.  And so that the do not track standard is going to go up in flames.

Start time: 2291.34
End time: 2314.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if Twitter and any other company that did this, if Twitter has a do not track button, they're saying we won't track.  So they're there. If you check that box as a Twitter user, does that mean that Twitter is not going to keep track of you as you travel around the net?  That's what they say. But then how do they know it's you?  Because they're just keeping track of IP addresses.  They don't know that's you. So in fact, you're right.

Start time: 2314.48
End time: 2338.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes no sense. Because if I think Twitter's the way Twitter work in this is based on just a kind of layman's understanding as much as a layman as I can be writing about it, but not actually doing that work, you know, security work or whatever.  But the way their system works is that you're signed in as a Twitter user, right?  Like Twitter.com. I'm not signed in. It wouldn't try. You're getting no benefit from it.

Start time: 2339.32
End time: 2349.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're getting no benefit. We know that Facebook tracked you even if you weren't signed in by IP address. Right.  As Twitter said, we won't because if I'm not saying it doesn't know who I am.

Start time: 2349.42
End time: 2409.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What Twitter says is if you have dnt equals one turned on, that means I have enabled do not track.  They say they will use the signals that come into them to perform the task that you asked them to do and then they will discard the data.  That's good. That's and that's the way it's supposed to work.  But the advertising industry is is basically trying to they're trying to do two things.  Number one, they're trying to define the do not track standard so that it has a million exceptions in it,  allowing them to keep data about you and correlate it with not only your online activities, but your offline activities.  And and and second, they're they're trying to water down the standards such that the only way that you can turn it on is through not just opt in, but extreme opt in.

Start time: 2409.32
End time: 2418.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, so extreme opt in being the thermonuclear option.

Start time: 2418.68
End time: 2487.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that mean? Well, basically, so that where this has come, where this is.  This is falling apart. You're exactly right.  This is this is falling apart. It's falling where this became a huge issue is Microsoft last year said with Internet Explorer 10, we're going to turn do not track on by default.  Right. So when you install Internet Explorer 10, either as an update to Internet Explorer on Windows seven or as a new installation on Windows eight,  you'll get to a screen and it will say, would you like to accept the default settings?  And there will be a list of default settings. And one of those settings is turn do not track on.  And then if you click OK, then do not track is turned on.  The do not track, the advertising industry went ballistic at that.  And they and they said, and in fact, a guy from Adobe, a guy named Roy Fielding, who is also the maintainer of the Apache Web Server,  put a patch in the Apache Web Server that said any do not track signals that come from Internet Explorer 10 will be disregarded.

Transcript:  No, it's a big deal.  You make a good point. And a lot of times, you know, especially in it,  I'm sure we're going to talk about the ecosystem later and, you know,  the cannibalization of one ecosystem of mobile operating systems over the other.  But now the fact that that they're so separated and maybe Dropbox will make this a little bit better  that when I try and opt out of certain things, it precludes me from other things.  And so the onus is on you to manage so much.  And that's really that's not the way it should be.  I don't think that's a permanent solution.

Transcript:  Well, and to get back to this, the Apache patch,  I understand Microsoft's explorers point of view.  And I don't think that the Apache guy was acting on behalf of the advertising industry.  I think he was really making a statement about the way the tyranny of the default  and that there shouldn't be a default on any more.  There should be a default off. You should be made to choose.

Start time: 2715.20
End time: 2725.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2732.55
End time: 2742.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no there's no patch in Apache that that ignores,  do not track signals from any other browser at this point.  Right. So you and I know Safari has do not track. Right.

Start time: 2744.38
End time: 2756.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does fire. I think Firefox does. So what's interesting is not, by the way, Chrome never will.  Because if you think Adobe is a big advertiser, who's the biggest advertising agency in the world?  They're they're bigfoot. So here's the so, you know, this is the big foot.

Start time: 2758.84
End time: 2786.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is really fascinating. I mean, I've been following this stuff very closely for for a long time.  If you have so I described to you the the scenario, if you install Internet Explorer 10,  there's a big thing that appears on the screen that says I want to turn do not track on.  And you have to click OK. Or you can say I want to adjust these defaults.  And you can go in and you can change that and eight other settings. Right.

Start time: 2786.42
End time: 2793.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2800.42
End time: 2805.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And most people, that's the tyranny of the default. Most people just do it.  Very few people do anything. Most people just choose.

Start time: 2805.92
End time: 2835.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most people just choose that. But I'm going to throw an interesting statistic at you at the end of this sentence.  OK, what what mobile Safari does is if you choose private browsing, OK, now private browsing is what a lot of people is the official name for what a lot of people call porn mode.  Doesn't save your history.  You know, you can write, you know, the official explanation of this is that, you know, you're shopping for a Christmas gift for your spouse.  And so you don't want them to know what you've been looking at.

Start time: 2835.52
End time: 2845.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I'm looking for leather and chains and a whip for my spouse.  That's it. Yes. You know, and I want to see I want to see what it looks like on models with similar figures.

Start time: 2846.86
End time: 2908.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Of course. So if it so if you use mobile Safari and you choose private browsing, it also turns to not track on nothing on the screen ever tells you that you are turning do not track on.  Oh, that's interesting. That's the way that Apple has chosen to implement Apple.  Apple prefers to err on the side of privacy. Apple and Apple and Microsoft both are have shifted to the side of privacy as a competitive advantage.  Google, of course, is on the other side of things.  And and and just to defend Google to take Google's point of view here.  They're saying the more information we have about you, the more helpful we can be in providing Google now type information for you.  So, OK, fine.  Firefox is kind of in the middle because Firefox gets three hundred million dollars a year from Google.  And that's roughly 90 percent of their income.

Start time: 2909.82
End time: 2914.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they have to be very careful. But that's when you use the Google search in Firefox.  You they get affiliate fees out of that.

Transcript:  For Mozilla Corporation, I'd have to go back and look at my notes on this is another thing I've looked at very carefully.  But in exchange for that, they make Google the default search engine and they make it really, really hard to change your default search engine in Firefox.  I've been using Firefox as my default browser lately, right?  Just because so and and Firefox turns Firefox makes it very easy to turn do not track on.

Start time: 2954.56
End time: 2968.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. As as you said, so does Safari.  So when I use incognito mode in Safari, do not track is turned on automatically.  Right. When I use incognito mode in Chrome, what happens?

Start time: 2972.47
End time: 2979.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your your browser history is not saved.  But everything else, you know, if if it can possibly go to Google, it will.

Start time: 2980.14
End time: 3029.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we should point out incognito mode means that no history is being saved, but your IP address is still visible to every site you visit.  Sure. And even though those sites probably can't save persistent cookies, they can do something else called fingerprinting, which is in many ways more effective anyway.  Right. Fingerprinting is looking at a variety of attributes on your system.  What version of a variety of programs you're using, what your browser resolution is, what your screen resolution is.  All this stuff can be queried via JavaScript from any browser.  When you combine nine or ten of these factors, they identify you pretty much uniquely.  Right. So all right. So advertisers are, you know, this this that's why the cookie war is silly.  If we if we get if we make everything private, they just use they'll use fingerprinting.

Start time: 3030.25
End time: 3092.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, they they can't.  There is there's a very strong case to be made for if if you are concerned about your privacy to installing tools that prevent private information about you from being disclosed without your knowledge.  Your IP address provides some information about you, but it's it's a very pale alternative to the stuff that you can get with with cookies and such.  You know, Steve Gibson, ten years ago, was banging the drum about cookies and how horrible they were.  He still is, by the way, if you've ever.  He still is. And for a long time, he was a voice crying in the wilderness.  And and really nobody was doing much with them.  And now the chickens have all come home to roost.

Start time: 3126.32
End time: 3138.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I mean, it's not like they're.  So there's an answer to that.  Putting together a dossier so they can prosecute you in the secret court next year.

Start time: 3268.46
End time: 3303.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there's an answer to that, Leo, which is that increasingly.  And this is not tinfoil hat stuff.  This is this is real.  There's companies that you're not even you know, you would not recognize their names if you saw them,  but that are correlating your online activities with your offline activities.  And they are using those to make decisions about things that could have a very big impact on your life.  So if you're if you're researching fertility, for example, and you're also applying for insurance.  Yeah.

Start time: 3304.36
End time: 3308.82

Start time: 3310.16
End time: 3319.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is like what I just said about Steve 10 years ago saying nobody thought that was a big deal.  By the time it becomes a big deal, it's too late.  Too late. Yeah.

Start time: 3319.92
End time: 3339.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And let me just take it like let's take make it super practical.  Just bring bring that wider argument that that 15 year argument down to last year.  Right. When they found out that some travel sites were displaying higher priced hotel results.  That's right.  To people on Macs.

Start time: 3339.50
End time: 3350.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's right. If you were on a Mac and you went to a travel site, they'd give you the fancy hotels.  But that was and it was simply completely legitimate.  They said, well, what turns out that people with Macs usually want the fancier hotels?  Yeah. Yeah.  Honestly. Right. Yeah.

Start time: 3351.44
End time: 3376.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. I don't agree with their methodology.  Like if I was them, if I was the department head and that guy came to me with that idea, I'd be like fantastic idea.  You know, promotion for you.  But for the consumer, as somebody who goes after looking for a hotel, no, it turns out if you drill down in that argument.  And I just I looked into a little bit is that the hotels that were regular priced are available to you just as they are anybody else.

Start time: 3377.35
End time: 3380.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it wasn't like they were lower down on the search results. Exactly.

Start time: 3380.32
End time: 3401.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. So they're prioritizing. Right.  So what they're doing, though, in effect, is making choices for you.  So you can argue for or against that.  But what what happens is once they start tracking you across multiple sites, multiple networks and creating a footprint of you that's larger than just one site.  Right. It's not about that site's cookies.  It's about the profile and all right.

Start time: 3402.64
End time: 3408.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you shop at Target? Do you shop at JCPenney?  You shop at Nordstrom. We're going to make decisions based on that as well.

Start time: 3408.56
End time: 3429.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  And so if you're concerned about that, if you're somebody's concerned about that and not giving an experience that is somewhat that is not being editorialized, right.  And Internet that is un editorialized by advertising agencies and by the people that are leveraging those cookies, then taking your privacy seriously is a concern.

Start time: 3429.44
End time: 3462.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. And then and then the second question is the on the other side of it.  Why are they so attached to this?  Can't they is it it doesn't seem to me that the targeted ads I see or so are all that well targeted.  Couldn't they just show ads without targeting?  Is it really necessary?  You know, the ad companies will say, no, we have to.  This is the only way we can make we can monetize.  You can't have Facebook without targeting, which just doesn't make sense.  Is that true?  They're addicted to big data.  They want it, whether they need it or not.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 3463.88
End time: 3500.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're addicted to big data in the same way that the NSA is addicted to big data.  The NSA probably doesn't need the the yottabytes.  Right. Of data that they have.  But in the NSA's case, they're so worried that they're going to miss the next 9-11 that they say, let's gather everything.  And if we gather everything, then nobody can accuse us of right of not trying to connect the dots.  And in the case of the advertising companies, they say the more data we have, the more options we have, the less data we have, the fewer options we have.  More options equals more money.  It's as simple as that.

Start time: 3500.62
End time: 3537.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that, yeah, we have to kind of remember that as sophisticated as these methods are and as much kind of weight we give them, this is just the tip.  Right. This is the beginnings of it, as people are just now starting to kind of be able to to fracture all of this data down into slivers of targeting.  And the targeting thing is only maybe 12 years old.  And the really the finesse has only come in the last three or four years.  So imagine 10 years from now what it's going to be like, how much they'll be able to tell, how precise they'll be able to get it.

Start time: 3537.52
End time: 3562.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've interviewed guys at companies like Cadence that 20 years ago, if you give them the zip code, they could say, yeah, I could pretty much tell you what magazines you subscribe to, what cars you and your neighbors buy.  We've know we've been collecting this information for long before the Internet was widely used and people know this information.  So I'm not sure that this is something brand new.  Maybe we're getting better at it.

Start time: 3562.38
End time: 3583.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but the difference between what you're describing there and what we're talking about now is the difference between neighborhood level demographic profiling and individual profiling.  And the problem with individual profiling comes when it's wrong.

Start time: 3583.36
End time: 3594.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. If you know, if the big data is perfect, you mean when it's incorrect or when it's morally wrong, when it's incorrect, when it's incorrect.

Start time: 3595.32
End time: 3645.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correct. So although although when it's morally wrong is the case, too.  So imagine the example that Matthew gave there about travel websites that give different prices, depending on whether they think that you're a demographically correct customer.  You use a Mac, therefore you're probably higher socioeconomic status.  So we'd like you to our site.  Now, let's say that they can go to your your profile and they can say, well, you know, you've been visiting a lot of sites that are associated with African Americans.  And so we're going to show you that there's no availability for our hotel.  Right. Redlining. We're going to redline you. Yeah.  Because you know, that would be wrong. You just won't fit in here.  And that's thoroughly possible with this stuff.  And there's the nightmare scenario with individual profiling.

Start time: 3645.96
End time: 3651.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had never even considered that. That's a horrible thought, especially on a day like today when race is such an important topic.

Start time: 3651.42
End time: 3697.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is. These are the things that because we want to assume the best in the companies that we do business with.  And for the most part, the tech companies that we do business with are I think they have good motives.  I think Google really and truly believes and for the most part is right that in gathering all this information about us, they're giving us a better experience with Google.  Now, I think Microsoft is trying to do the best thing for its customers.  Facebook, maybe I don't think it's Facebook. Yeah. Yeah.  Yahoo, Twitter, all of them. I think I think most of them come to it from there.  But then you start going to the second and third tier companies who are getting this information where the scruples are gone.

Start time: 3699.16
End time: 3712.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Once they're reselling that data, then your morality is is sold down the line.  It's like, oh, well, every time it goes, you're trusting that next level, the next tier outwards from the original intent.

Transcript:  All right. You convinced me that you should have talked to you earlier, Ed, because you're very cogent in this.  And I think you convinced me and I think you've given us some very good, reasonable examples.  So let's take a break. When we come back, what the hell do we do about it?  Because, I mean, it's pretty widespread and it's going on.  And as you can, as you mentioned with your example on do not track, it's not going our way.  Ed Bott is here from ZD Net.  Natalie Morris from crash test mom dot com mommy, mommy or mommy mom, mom, mom dot com.  And from the next Web managing editor, that means he does the work.  Matthew Panzerino. Great to have all three of you.  You're laughing, but it's true, right?  Because you've both been managing editors, you know, I was managing editor at the site.  That was MSNBC's way of saying, stay in the closet over there and pretend you're, you know, having something to do with this show.  And we'll call you if we ever need you. It's different TV.  Always has been. Hey, let me show you something.  This is Squarespace dot com. The best hosting, the best software.  If you are ready to create your Web site, you got to try Squarespace.  They've updated their site. It looks so cool now with little animation and stuff.  But this is all done in Squarespace's content management system.  But better than that, more importantly, the hosting, you all could go.  Everybody watching the show right now could go to a Squarespace site.  You couldn't bring it down. You can't say that about most sites.  Squarespace, because they do the software and the hardware and the hosting, it's very tightly integrated.  It all works together. When a site gets more hits, it stays up.  And you know what I like about Squarespace is if you get the unlimited plan and let me show you the pricing, you never have to worry about getting a bandwidth bill.  You can get everybody in the Twitter audience and the slash dot audience visiting your site and CNET and ZD net visiting your site.  And you'll never get a bandwidth bill. Squarespace.com.  I want you to take a look at the templates. They're always putting out new templates.  The new Momentum template, gorgeous. The new events calendar.  If you have a site for a band or anyone who wants to keep track of schedules, maybe a store sales, that kind of thing.  Great for that. Squarespace. You could try it free for two weeks.  Go to Squarespace.com. Click the try button. Play with it.  Import your data from your existing site. All of that.  They've got the importers. They've got the tools. You don't have to be a JavaScript CSS expert to use Squarespace.  When you decide to buy, take a look at this pricing.  The most popular plan is the $20 a month plan. $16 when you buy an annual plan. $16 a month.  For that you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.  I'm telling you no bandwidth bill. No limits on the amount of traffic served to your site.  Your site will never go down. Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  You get a mobile website because every one of Squarespace's designs is mobile responsive. Love that.  They'll even, if you buy an annual or buy annual plan, they'll even hook up your domain name for free.  Get a new one. .com.org.net.mobi.biz or info.  And they'll set it all up for you.  If you want to add e-commerce, that's $24 a month with an annual plan.  And man, they have, just the e-commerce platform on this is fabulous. They've really done it right.  I want you to try it. Squarespace.com.  Try it free. You don't have to worry about the plans or anything until you decide to buy.  But once you decide to buy, I want you to use the offer code TWIT7 for the seventh month, July.  And we will get you a good deal. We'll get you 10% off that new site on new accounts.  Squarespace.com. Offer code TWIT7.  Seriously, if you're starting a new site, don't go anywhere else.  If you're a developer, by the way, I always say how easy it is to use.  But if you are a JavaScript coder or a CSS, they have a full developer platform as well.  It makes it very easy.  A lot of people are Squarespace. I think set up Squarespace sites for others.  That's a good business too.  So why don't we, so Ed, you know, you finally scared me.  I've been listening to Steve Gibson for five years now and you finally scared me.

I don't, Google doesn't bother me, but I can see how it'd be a problem.  So what do we do?

Start time: 4005.74
End time: 4033.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You should. You should try and scramble your online profile intelligently.  And the second thing is there are privacy tools out there.  And three of them that I can think of, ABINE, ABINE.  ABINE.com. Excellent tool.  It's called Do Not Track Plus or Do Not Track Me.  They've changed their name.

Start time: 4033.52
End time: 4038.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4038.86
End time: 4055.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're plugins. They work with all browsers.  And they basically give you control over what information goes out to other sites.  And so, ABINE, Privacy Fix.

Start time: 4056.50

Start time: 4079.38
End time: 4091.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I highly recommend somebody take like 10 minutes to run Ghostory if they're ever curious or wondering why we're even talking about this.  Just take 10 minutes, install it, visit a few of your favorite sites and see how much of it is there.

Transcript:  And you, trustees, like for instance, I'm looking at PrivacyFix.com. That's one of the ones you recommended, right?  Right.  And then I'm looking at the permissions when I add this to Chrome.  It can access all my data on all websites, read and modify my browsing history.  I'm giving this guy absolute permission to see everything that's going on.  Well, how could they work if they couldn't do that?  Well, I understand, but you trust them, I'm asking you.

Start time: 4147.32
End time: 4206.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. All three of those companies I trust.  Now, the interesting thing about Ghostery is that they are owned by...  Their monetization comes from the advertising industry.  What?  That's the... Yeah, yeah. It's owned by a company that is actually a large advertiser.  And so their goal is to get you to install the opt-in module that will allow them to collect information about you in a non-identifiable, non-personal way and help them out.  But Ghostery is one of those weird...  I don't understand that at all.  Weird stories. Yeah.  Well, they were a purchase, they were an acquisition.  Privacy Fix was acquired by AVG.  Who's that?  AVG, the anti-virus people.  Oh, AVG. Okay, yeah.  AVG. And so AVG is one of the biggest providers of the toolbars that we were talking about earlier.

End time: 4251.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not giving it to them. They're not collecting the data.  All three of those companies I will vouch for.  Although Avine is the one that so far is completely independent, run by privacy advocates, and as close as you can get to being ideologically pure.  And you can use Adblock Plus.  That's a good one.  That will block a lot of stuff.  Although people... Google pays Adblock Plus to have their ads served through Adblock Plus.

Start time: 4251.78
End time: 4263.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they charge... so they have a whitelist of advertisers that will get through Adblock Plus and they go to them like Google and say,  for a small amount of money the Adblock will not work on your ads.

I'll tell you about two months ago on my personal website, which has had advertising on it for 10 years.  And for a while there, it certainly has paid for my web hosting bills through the years and occasionally bought me pizzas and stuff.  I removed all tracking, all analytics and all advertising from my personal website two months ago because I can't stomach this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but they're also better at monetizing it. So the worst part about the internet right now is all of the small sites...  I'm not going to do it, but my bosses, my employers are...  No, all of the small sites like you and me, you know, the little guys out there...  Yeah, I'm not such a small site anymore.

Transcript:  Well, in fact, we don't... we have analytics on here, but we don't track people.  We don't sell that information to anybody.  You know, we don't give it away. I guess Google's got it because it's Google Analytics.  So maybe we shouldn't use Google Analytics anymore.

Start time: 4407.50

End time: 4434.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, it's one of the reasons we do the advertising model we do.  Our advertisers don't get any information about who listens to the show because they advertise.  We just say, this is how many people heard your ad. Give me some money now.  And that seems to work for us. But I don't know.  What were you going to say, Natalie?

Start time: 4435.04
End time: 4461.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just wondering... it's a nice little manifesto, but you know,  there's so many people who don't think that we have the option to control our privacy.  It's either all or nothing.  And so that's why you get so much fear mongering when you watch the daily news.  So is there... are there... what are the small ways that we can change the system?  What are the small ways that we can say, I'm not for this and I'm for this?  Is just to really dive into your privacy settings and decide, you know, that kind of thing.

Start time: 4462.81
End time: 4473.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  A-Bind does that, by the way. One of the things A-Bind does is it goes through settings  and shows you how to turn off, you know, search following you.  And it tells you what the pros and cons are, which is kind of nice.

Start time: 4488.62
End time: 4502.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is that enough to create a movement? Is that enough for advertisers to say,  hmm, they don't like this, should we start privacy by default? I don't think so.  Well, that's the real question.  It's just us tech nerds doing it right now.  That absolutely is the real question, Natalie. Absolutely.

Start time: 4503.48
End time: 4513.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4513.82
End time: 4535.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. I mean, we're talking about a great deal because of Edward Snowden.  And I'm a little more, you know, and maybe that's where politics come in.  I'm more worried about the government doing this than private business.  And some people might be more worried about private business than government.  Oh, I trust the government. It's just law enforcement. I don't trust Google or Facebook.  I don't know. I don't know.

Start time: 4541.34
End time: 4570.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But you get, but there's so much value in Facebook, right?  There's so much value in Google now. And it's not unreasonable for Facebook and Google to monetize that.  I think they need to be upfront about it, right? They need to say, here's what we're doing.  I think Google does this, by the way. Here's what do we do.  Google does everything it can to be transparent about this. Here's what we're collecting.  Here's your information. Go to the dashboard. You can see what they know.  Delete it if you want. You know, but I think they're fairly explicit about what they're collecting.  Facebook, much less so.

Start time: 4571.62
End time: 4664.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a philosophical thing, right? You have some companies that have decided consciously  to sacrifice a direct customer to company relationship for growth, for speed of growth,  for continued growth, rapidity of growth. That relationship has been given up by using the person's  information instead of just charging a price and selling them a product, creating that direct one-to-one relationship.  Some companies have done that, and they offer a distinct value, like as I was talking about Google now.  That's a distinct value that Google offers, and they've given that.  So you have to decide yourself whether you're philosophically comfortable with that,  and then move forward, or decide whether you're more comfortable with something like, you know,  you mentioned with mobile Safari turning on do not track. That's a symptomatic thing, right?  Because that is the way that Apple thinks about customer privacy.  You are their customer, and advertisers have nothing really to do with that relationship.  And so they kind of allow certain things to happen because they're standards.  But for instance, the magazine details, you know, magazine publishers are very resistant to newsstand  because Apple did not want to give those advertisers your personal information  because that's a customer relationship you have with Apple.  So that's kind of a philosophical thing that goes through.  Now they make mistakes, they make their own wacky choices at some points.  But I'm just saying in this case, you have these two philosophies,  and you kind of have to decide which one of those you're comfortable with.

Start time: 4665.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. All right, we're going to move on. I think enough said about that.  It's an important conversation, and because we had Ed on, I really did want to talk about this a little bit.  I know Ed's been very outspoken about this, and I appreciate that, Ed, as has Steve.  And you can hear lots more about this when you tune in Security Now.  Steve talks very specifically about what to do, what's going on, and very technically.  And I think that's great. It's one of the reasons we do the show.  Dropbox had a conference and announced a bunch of stuff which I didn't really understand.  So thank goodness I have you guys to explain it to me.  What the hell is Dropbox up to?  Did they give you a bag? That's the question.  I didn't get a bag, no.  What is it blue?  Who is siphoning? Is that Matthew?  Yeah, Matthew, I think we're going to have to call you back real fast.  The thing to do with Matthew, I know it's been an hour. Unplug your headset and plug it back in.  There is a particular chip that has a memory leak.  I'm trying it. How's that?  Yeah, it's all better. One hour. It's always one hour after you get online, the memory leaks.  That's funny.  Is that weird?

Start time: 4736.32
End time: 4748.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it the headset? Is it the audio chip?  Yeah, it's in the headset.  Because this is a Microsoft Live something CX300, which is literally they've been making it for like 15 years.  Yeah, it's an older headset.  The same exact one.

Start time: 4750.57
End time: 4768.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll send you a newer one that doesn't do that next time.  No, I've heard it so many times. I now know what to do. It's bizarre, but I now know what to do.  That's why you're a pro.  No, all it is is sitting in this seat. I've got a nice impression on the chair now from my buttocks.  So I have a story about this Dropbox thing.

Start time: 4769.32
End time: 4784.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, tell me. What does it mean?  So, you know, my husband and I, we have an app called Read Quick, where we take your reading lists and then we allow you to speed read them,  or you can open any article, long form article or short form, and speed read it one form at a time.

Start time: 4784.44
End time: 4785.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So if you now only works on the iPad, but we're launching an iPhone app coming up soon.  And we've been thinking about launching an Android app.  And in order to do that, there are a couple of ways to do it.  One of which is to own that data ourselves, get a server, hire someone to maintain it so that when you sign in,  you sign in with your Read Quick account and then you can use it on an Android tablet or an iPhone.  That's really cost prohibitive.  We thought about using iCloud to sync between the iPad and the iPhone.  But, you know, developers aren't all that thrilled with iCloud yet.  We had some reservations about that.  Let me just clarify.

Start time: 4826.32
End time: 4842.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you have to have some content for the reading and you can use Instapaper.  But what you want is if it's on multiple platforms, it's only been on iPad up to now.  So that's not been an issue.  But if you're on multiple platforms, you want a user to have the same content on all the platforms.

Start time: 4842.96
End time: 4856.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In any experience. And this goes for any app, even the fertility app I was telling you about earlier.  Like you want to be able to sign in on any device.  So you need to pay for data storage.  Right. A developer has to pay for data storage.  They can use iCloud, but that's not cross platform.

Start time: 4856.88
End time: 4862.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obviously, that's just only within Amazon sells, you know, Amazon S3.  They sell storage or AWS.

Start time: 4863.10
End time: 4899.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so now Dropbox came out with this and we thought this is perfect.  This is exactly how we can now store information cross platform because it will allow us to create user accounts.  They will own the data. We won't own the data.  But, you know, how much we care about that, we can go back to the previous conversation.  So that's what Dropbox's new solution is.  It allows developers to use them as the back end of their applications across platforms.  So it's one of the first real marriages.  I mean, like you said, Amazon does it.  But this is a big step, I think, when you think of marrying the two platforms.

Start time: 4899.72
End time: 4931.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this was DBX was Dropbox's first.  Yeah. So this was their first developer conference.  Up to now, Dropbox has really just been a consumer service that you used.  Although more I see more and more apps using Dropbox as as their de facto storage.  But now they have a sync API that you have access to.  Right. Or a data store API.  So you can as a developer, you can say, hey, save this for my user.  Right. Do the user have to have a Dropbox account user has.  OK. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 4933.12
End time: 4935.38

Start time: 4936.76
End time: 4953.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a really great idea.  And and as somebody who's followed synchronization services for a long time, this is really, really hard to do.  And so this is going to be painful.

Start time: 4954.20
End time: 4965.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, look at the companies that have fall, you know, run against the rocks of this, particularly Apple.  iCloud still doesn't work and it doesn't even work for Apple.

Start time: 4965.70
End time: 5015.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't even work for Apple. That's the hard.  That's the thing that tells you how difficult synchronization is, because iCloud is an inside Apple's ecosystem kind of thing where they control every single transaction that goes to it.  And and it's still difficult.  Synchronization is so tough. If you talk to app developers who've worked on these things, I've talked to a lot of Microsoft focused developers on these things.  And it's it's a nightmare.  And so if it's just you and your data on one device where you sign in, sign out, go to another device, sign in, sync, sign out, everything works perfectly.  The nightmare comes up when you're synced in, you're signed in at the same time on two or three devices and and you start getting collisions in the synchronized data.

Start time: 5015.72
End time: 5039.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, doesn't though hasn't Dropbox demonstrated that they've solved this in terms of our using Dropbox?  I mean, I have Dropbox on all my computers and it seems to work fine.  What they do, if by the way, if you change a file on two different accounts or two different computers, change the same file, it just keeps it.  It says, well, we got now we got you got to reconcile this.  We got to. Right. So that's that's at a file level.

Start time: 5039.50
End time: 5042.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5043.54
End time: 5052.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You're at a bite level, so to speak.  Oh, yeah. And that's when the data store.  Go ahead, Matthew. Oh, no, it's okay. Go ahead.

Start time: 5053.70
End time: 5103.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the example, the best example is you and your wife are sharing a to do list.  And I saw this.  I wish I could remember the developer's name.  But says, OK, so you've got a shopping list app and you say I need to pick up four folding chairs at the store.  And and your wife goes and changes that. No, we need five folding chairs.  But while she was doing that, you were over checking the because you bought the four folding chairs at Home Depot and ran the credit card bill up.  And then you checked it as done. Yeah.  So it got marked off of both lists.  And so now you get home and you were supposed to bring home five folding chairs, but you only brought home four because the problem was more complicated than you thought it was.

Start time: 5103.50
End time: 5116.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And data store is the Dropbox API's answer to core data, which is the most problematic portion of iCloud.  That's the part that doesn't work. Right.

Start time: 5116.32

End time: 5136.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But then apparently there was a session shortly after that was closed to the press in which they said, we are so sorry.  This we we they we know it's broken.

Start time: 5137.16
End time: 5221.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And, you know, the thing is, without getting too deep into it, because I'm not I don't want to speak out of turn.  But there have been developers that have been working with Apple since literally iCloud was announced like beta stage of iOS five, you know, before it even was available to the public who recognized these problems and had kind of tried to work on the work with Apple on them.  Even developing documentation about the issues and how to resolve them.  And it's taken them this long to get around to fixing it.  And it's not like they don't have a lot of other problems, you know, things to work on.  And the teams at Apple are smaller than most people realize, right, that are working on these items.  But it's it's just a telltale how hard this is that people working at Apple who have direct access to those iCloud teams like literally they could go to the office over and say, hey, I'm having a problem seeking calendar, you know, to, you know, get this data over properly.  They still can't fix it. And the developers outside, I mean, they have no chance, you know.  So that's why a lot of people are looking at Dropbox API now as a viable alternative.  Apparently, Datastore isn't quite as powerful as CoreData theoretically could be, you know, if it worked.  But it people are looking at it simply because of the reliability factor.  I mean, they've built up a reputation for reliable, straight document syncing.  And so now they're basically branching out into this CoreData type syncing.  And people are like, hey, you know, maybe they can.

Start time: 5221.76
End time: 5233.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

So they're going to get it.  A lot of people using this that are outside of the iOS only ecosystem, right?  So they they have a big market to kind of tackle people that are going to  Windows desktop.  I know I cloud has some basic storage stuff there, but I cloud for Windows is  still very anemic.  And so you're you're going to Android, going to the desktop and that sort of  thing.  They're going to have a lot of a lot of draw there.  And you know, I think that's the thing.  I think that their business with iOS developers is going to really spell  whether or not it's a success or not, though.  So there's going to be a lot of people who is as a godsend.  But I don't think those are going to be the people that make this or break this.  I have a question for Matthew.  Yes. Yeah.  But Dropbox is made of a lot of independent users, though.

I want to ask Matthew a question because you're more in touch with the startup  space than than I am.  Do you think Dropbox's goal is to resist being acquired and become big enough  to be a top level player?  Do you think they can do that?  Really? They say they don't want Google to come along and snack them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, as far as I understand it, that's their current like I mean,  I I am not privy to their boardroom discussions by any means, but from their  stance publicly and from the discussions that I've had with people that both  work there and, you know, are around there, that that's their current stance  that they want to be as big as, you know, one of the other titans in the  industry. I mean, like you joke about Oracle, but, you know, it won't be  Oracle's business, but they definitely want to stand, you know, kind of in that  standalone area.  They want to be the file system for the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't tell you don't even touch TV people's hard drive.  In fact, don't even mention it because it's not important anymore.  Right. It'll get subsumed on its own.  There will always be local storage, but almost everybody's critical data will be  in the cloud eventually.  So you don't want to bring the hard drive into the discussion because then you're  reaching out and touching personal things that are theirs.  Right.  But instead, we're not going to replace any of that.  What we're going to do is we are going to be your new file system, which is  exactly what Apple's trying to do with iCloud.  They're trying to replace the old file system metaphor with a new file system  metaphor that is not a file system at all.  Right.  Or we know it is, but to the consumer, it won't appear that way.  So I think that that's that's what Dropbox is definitely aiming for.  They're not interested in acquisition.  As far as I know, I would say they're skating towards IPO faster than they're  skating towards acquisition.  Thanks.

Transcript:  Do you have I know you do a lot of you a lot of you have drawers full of old gadgets,  closets, maybe entire sellers or addicts full of old gadgets you need to know about  Gazelle Gazelle dot com.  Sell your iPhone, your iPad, your Mac, get actual money for it so you can move on to  the next thing.  Kind of pay it forward.  Keep it moving with Gazelle dot com.  One of the things I love about Gazelle is you can get a 30 day quote right now.  You don't you're not there's no obligation.  Just go and find out what your stuff is worth.  They will they will lock that quote in for 30 days.  And should a new phone, let's say, come out in the next 30 days that you really,  really, really want, you'll have already locked in the price.  The reason to do that is that old phone is not getting more valuable as time goes by.  I could promise you it's worth less every day.  So go there with your Galaxy S3 or your Galaxy S4, your Galaxy tablet.  Yes, they take Samsung, Google Nexus, Kindle Fire.  They even take Microsoft Surface.  You know, just out of curiosity, you might actually be able to make money now buying  surfaces at 350 bucks and selling them back to Gazelle.  See if they wised up yet.  How much is a 32 gigabyte surface RT worth?  Seventy five bucks.  Probably. They're not stupid.  What shape is it in? It's perfect shape.  You got all the accessories. Of course you do.  Let's see what it's worth. Hey, that that not bad.  One hundred eighty five bucks. Quick. Grab it.  I'm selling. It won't be worth that tomorrow.  I can promise you. Go to Gazelle. G A Z E L L E dot com.  They are really great. They've paid out now over the last few years.  Half a million customers, a hundred million dollars to people.  You can get cash and get a PayPal credit instantly.  My suggestion, if you use Amazon, is get that Amazon gift card,  because they'll bump that by five percent over their quote.  They'll wipe your data for you.  They'll even give you more money if you're if your thing is in better shape than you said it was.

If you don't if you think like, OK, twenty or thirty bucks is not really worth my trouble.  But it's sitting here. And it's not a great idea.  Yeah. Or something to someone.  So if you have a specific cause like, I don't know, fundraiser for your for your groups and, you know, your kids, Boy Scouts or whatever,  you can start a gazelle group for that and just say send it in under this, you know, with this group.  And then the money instead of going to you will be donated to a good cause.

So Microsoft Surface staples.  It's it. We heard the rumor there was a leaked staples ad and now it did happen.  In fact, today, three hundred fifty dollars for the thirty two gigabyte surface R.T.

Transcript:  You know, at this point, we're at a we're at a point in the in the buying cycle where we know a new generation of hardware is coming out in a few months.  You know, we know that come this fall, Windows eight point one will be out.  A bunch of Haswell based machines have already started coming out.  And there and there's going to be new, you know, Tegra four and Snapdragon X, whatever, based machines are going to be out.  So if you if you've thought about buying a surface R.T. and the price was putting you off and now the price is lower than fine.  But I mean, I certainly wouldn't buy one now.  We're at the we're at the we're at the summertime doldrums where you're about to get right.  Really tremendous deals on all sorts of things.

Start time: 6003.26
End time: 6011.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's something else that doesn't bother me so much.  I have I have a surface R.T. that I keep on my desk all the time.  It is my full time music and Skype machine.  And it does. And I do a couple other things.  And then I'll pick it up and I'll carry it around because it is so light and so pleasant to use that I'll use it for that.  But it is most assuredly a secondary machine.  I'll take it if I'm going on a business trip somewhere that's a short flight back and forth, I can bring it and I don't even need to worry about the charger.  So it has some advantages to it.

Transcript:  It's interesting to me that and this is just not a I mean, I don't want to read too much into this, but it's interesting that the low end computer market is being taken over by half computers, right?  By software that's it's sort of like almost an embedded systems thing.  Right. Because you've got the Chromebooks at like 250 bucks.  Right. The surface artis at 350 bucks.  And it used to be that the thought was skimp on hardware.  Right. Make the hardware pretty terrible and put a full version of Windows on it.  And we know how the whole network thing shook out.  But now the low end market is being taken over by hardware.  That's not bad. I mean, the Chromebook harbor is OK.  You know, and it runs a browser fine, which is essentially what you're running.  And then the surface art hardware physically and power wise, it's fine.  You know, the software is really where I think some of the issues came in.  But it's just an interesting trend towards almost embedded systems in the low end machines.  And it's the cost differential doesn't add up there.  It's just weird to me that they're taking these $250 machines and making them purpose built software for them.

Transcript:  I do have to point out that the PC market is essentially dying as we watch another down quarter personal computer shipments down for the first half of this year.  11 percent. The first quarter, according to IDC, the worst ever in all the years is track PC shipments.  I don't I don't do they consider an R.T. a PC. I know they consider the no surface pro and a PC, but not the art either.

Start time: 6173.38

Transcript:  No, no, I'm actually going to post it as breaking.

Start time: 6198.88
End time: 6257.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so Gartner and IDC have different definitions of what a PC is.  Right. So neither neither company considers a surface R.T. a PC.  One company considers a surface pro a PC.  The other does not. Surface pro is definitely a keyboard.  So one considers a device with an X86 processor to be a PC.  The other says, no, if it has a detachable keyboard, it's not a PC, regardless of what processor is in it.  So we're at it. So the real point here, the column that I that I won't write, but I should, is that the definition of a PC has become  as it means like you've tossed the Monopoly board up in the air.  Nobody knows what a PC is anymore because a ninety nine dollar Android tablet can do PC things.  A Kindle fire can do PC things.  An iPad and a surface R.T. can do very PC things. Right. But they're not PCs.

It's not that Windows 8 sucks.  It's certainly not driving people into the market, but it's not that's not it.  I think some of it is people are happy with the PC they bought three years ago.  They're just not anxious to buy a new one. Certainly businesses are.

Start time: 6303.70
End time: 6373.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, businesses buy PCs on a they have a retirement schedule for PCs that's partly dictated by the IRS  and partly dictated by the same kind of, you know, penury that defines Scrooge.  If they can make a PC last for five years, six years, seven years, they will do it.  You'll keep that PC and you'll like it.  And and so, you know, that's sort of the that's the reason why XP is still around, even though it's about to, you know, it's it's nine years from nine months from from retirement.  But what's happening with the with the with the PC market, the in the much broader sense of what a PC is, is people are saying, I can do all sorts of things that used to require something.  I call the PC. I can do it on a smartphone. I can do it on a small tablet.  I can do it on a large tablet. I can do it on a notebook, a netbook, a desktop PC, something at my work at an Internet kiosk.  I can do this stuff anywhere. And so what we have is people using a multitude of devices.

Start time: 6374.18
End time: 6377.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what's really happening is it's just a diversified environment.

Start time: 6378.05
End time: 6428.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because people are still buying stuff, right?  I mean, you don't sell thirty five million iPhones in a quarter, which are small computers and not get to say, well, you're giving these people computers.  You can't. It's just it's only it's only the research firms that are like, you know, going like this and going like, that's not a PC.  You know, because it's it's really a personal computer on on almost every definition except for hardware, perhaps, or detachable keyboards, you know, that kind of thing.  But the way people are using them is definitely as a personal computer.  So I think that what we're seeing is, you know, your your PC sales are going down, but your PC sales are in fact going up because people are buying multiple small PCs instead of one desktop PC and then maybe a laptop.  You know, they're buying smartphones and a couple of tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's great, right?  We finally got to the point where it's a camera with a phone attached.  I mean, you know, people do most of the picture taking on phones and they have for years.  So and I think Nokia should be applauded for taking serious, making serious strides in the photography department.  Too bad it's running Windows.  I ain't going to run out and buy a Windows phone.  I'll digress just slightly with the Windows phone thing.  We were just talking about Windows 8.1 and Windows phone, right?  So the problem that I have philosophically with the way that Microsoft has approached Windows phone  is that they're pushing it as an accessory to Windows desktops, right?  They're approaching it as the phone you buy if you use a Windows desktop.  But in reality, within years or within, frankly, it should have been already by now.  The desktop should have been an accessory to the phone.  And they're treating it the other way around, which I think is well,  but wait a second, Google refuses to develop apps for that platform.

Start time: 6702.98
End time: 6715.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Yeah, it has to because it's such a small fraction of the total market.  It can't possibly justify the development cost.  Yeah, Microsoft just but this completely in Microsoft's interest.  Yeah, absolutely.  To do that. I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  If they have to pay people to get them to write programs, do it.  Pay the money.  Pay the money.

I know you cover him dead, so you probably know more.  But for a layperson, it's like, well, it's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  It's like, well, I don't know how that makes any difference at all.

Start time: 6788.36
End time: 6809.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't talked to too many of my friends at Microsoft about it.  I think it's actually the opposite of that.  It's more a reflection of how Microsoft is working today than it is.  The reorganization is not trying to change behavior.  The reorganization is reflecting how the behavior has already changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve's done a pretty good job.  There aren't too many CEOs in the in the tech industry today who are capable of continuing to make a profit.  I mean, by that same logic, Tim Cook should have been fired three months ago.  Yeah, that's a good point.

Transcript:  Microsoft keeps getting overlooked as a wildly profitable company.  I mean, people get on them because they've stuck to a business model that they that some feel they're writing into the ground.  Right.  But that business model has provided them with massive amounts of money and their shareholders with a lot of value.  So, you know, firing Ballmer can seem like a pro a progressive maneuver, but it's also one that fits in the face of everything he has managed to do, which is make a whole lot of money.  Right.

Transcript:  And the people who did get promoted, their three new executives, three new divisions are, for the most part, real engineers.  Julie Larson, Green, Chi Lu, both real engineers.  I mean, they're the technical side.

Start time: 6878.83
End time: 6934.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Real engineers.  And what's fascinating to me is the companies that people think of are the divisions at Microsoft that people think of as being failures.  Bing, the guy who runs Bing is now in charge of office.  Yeah, isn't that interesting?  Which is the single most profitable and highest revenue division of Microsoft.  Right.  The guy who was in charge of Windows Phone is now in charge of Windows.  Yeah.  You know, and Julie's in charge of the Xbox and Surface, the hardware thing.  So it's this is really a new wave strategy.  This is the really the people who've been building the stuff that is small and has the potential to get larger are the ones who've been promoted into the big positions and the ones, the ones who are who have been responsible for the last 10 years of Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not there anymore.  Not there.  Well, some of them, because like Don Matric, they went off to run Zynga, which is the writing on the wall.  I have to think that Don got a little heads up.  Hey, Don, we're going to reorganize. You don't have a role.  Maybe you would like to.

Start time: 6951.67
End time: 6956.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6957.32
End time: 6976.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, Don Matric does not need money at this point.  I'm sure he has enough Microsoft stock that he's he's not chasing the money.  I think the Zynga job is fraught with peril.  But so was running Xbox, apparently.  My he's the guy who wrote the apology and did the Xbox one eighty.

Start time: 6977.14
End time: 6994.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Zynga, if he's going to Zynga, that reads to me like they they maybe want to investigate a different way of making money.  Right. So I mean, as opposed to the way that they make the money now, which is, you know, finding whales and pumping whales, those whales for money.

Start time: 6994.52

End time: 7018.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think that would be like an easy way to do it.  I don't know if it's at all similar, but I think that if he went there and didn't reorganize anything and just went business as usual and just kind of like put his sales spin on it, I think that's not the job.  Yeah, that would be kind of a Ron Johnson move, I think.

Start time: 7018.48

Start time: 7022.68
End time: 7035.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ron Johnson took went to JCPenney and instead of trying to reorganize the company, he said, we're just going to do this the Apple way.  Yeah, right. And he really he brought some people right.

Start time: 7035.76
End time: 7069.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people followed him. Some people like the product development level with apps and stuff like that.  And then some people at the the web development side of things and then some people in business development.  But I don't think enough people followed him or he brought in enough people at the managerial level to say, like, look, I'm if we're going to do this, quote unquote, the Apple way, or if we're going to reorganize this around the boutique situation and all that stuff that he did there that didn't quite work.  If we're going to do that, then I need people that are philosophically on board from here to here in the organizational structure.  I don't think he did that. That's interesting.

Start time: 7070.40
End time: 7084.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a sense of of people who are successful in the tech industry are often successful because they're in the right place at the right time with a set of skills that happens to mesh with the strategic direction of the company at that time.

She created the ribbon for Microsoft Office when Steven Sinovsky left the Windows 8 group.  She jointly took over.  And now all of a sudden, she's running devices and studios engineering group.  Is that a promotion, a lateral move, a demotion?  I think you hit it on the head when you said this is the future.  These these this might be the future area.

Transcript:  And like I did a joke tweet about it like last year when Microsoft announced the surface stuff, you know, and that was started to come down.  You know that Apple had the hardware software epiphany in like 1979 and took till 2012 for Google to start doing something about it with Android, with the Motorola purchase, which I from day one was like, this is hardware.  This is not your patent thing. They may have hedged their bets there, but it was definitely a hardware play.  And then, you know, Microsoft with the surface thing.  And so so like hardware epiphany took, you know, whatever, you know, 30 years for them to come around to it.  But that epiphany is very much in play now.  And I think that putting these people in charge of a hardware division of in a software company that is going to produce the software for that hardware, that's a very powerful position.  So I wouldn't view it as a demotion at all.  Instead, I view it as a vote of confidence that this person is going to be in charge of where we are philosophically moving forwards.

Dr. Bose, he was called with great respect by a lot of people who knew him well as passed away.  He was an MIT professor, an expert in sound when he founded the Bose Corporation.  Whatever you think of some of Bose's products, the Bose 901 direct reflecting speakers of the 70s were by considered by many the best speakers ever.  And I think the Bose noise canceling headphones are still considered the gold standard when you fly in a plane.  Did you know Mar? Did you ever meet Mar Bows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sold and they still do sell the experience and the experience of using a Bose product these days.  If you have the Bose iPod stands or you put your iPod or iPhone in them, they just work so well.  And so you might be able to buy something that costs a few bucks more and sounds a lot better.  But it's harder to use. There's a certain amount to be said for the experience.

Start time: 7390.14
End time: 7427.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm willing to bet that what Bose did was maybe they would never give products for review.  They would call to chastise people who reviewed products and give bad reviews.  But I would bet that anything, if anything, they were making a sound curve that they felt would appeal to people.  They weren't trying to be accurate.  They were trying to make a sound that somebody would listen to that Bose acoustic wave radio that Paul Harvey was selling.  And the person who listens to Paul Harvey would get at home and say, my God, that sounds beautiful.

Start time: 7427.88

Transcript:  I think that whatever you say, Omar Bose is an amazing guy and he donated a considerable amount of his value to MIT.  They got a lot of non-voting stocks. So in fact, in many ways, MIT owns Bose.  He donated. Bose donated a majority of the company's non-voting shares on the condition that the shares never be sold.  So at least if you're buying a pair of Bose headphones, you know you're supporting MIT.  Yeah.  Also a big transition. PC World is no longer in print.

Sports Illustrated won't write about sports anymore, but you're going to, they're going to have bikinis for all time.  The Sports Illustrated, Swimsuit Edition will be the only print issue.  The only print issue. That's insane.  But yeah, so I think that definitely, and I think that it's part of an overall thing that we're seeing or that we will see kind of take traction, which it will be sort of smaller, lighter weight publication.  And I think that big publications will take to that too. I think they will maybe break their stuff down where you won't have one magazine covering kind of like a wide array of topics.  Instead, you'll have several small magazines perhaps presenting chunks of content on a subscription basis.  So I think that that fracturing of the industry will start to occur and we'll see probably smaller products digitally offered.

Start time: 7622.22
End time: 7665.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really interesting thought about the future because having spent my entire life basically doing first print magazines and then digital magazines.  The interesting thing is that the magazine publishing industry was designed around monthly mailings.  It was designed around the post office. Right.  And in a digital first world, you don't need to have that, you don't have that level of it with you.  But the problem right now is that the ability to put a magazine into a digital format is still messy.

Start time: 7668.46
End time: 7691.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem. Like you said it exactly. They're putting a magazine in the digital format instead of thinking of what a digital quote unquote magazine should be.  So I think that a lot of the growing pains have come from people taking that and squeezing it through the tube into what they feel should present on an iPad, let's say, and it not turning out right because that's not the right way to think about it.

Start time: 7691.76

Harry left in 2008 to do his own online thing and good for him, but he talks about PC Magazine stopped publishing a print edition.  I didn't realize in 2008, a long time ago, computer shopper.  Remember that? You could make furniture out of it.  A year's worth of computer shopper.  It's not an OSHA waiver to a computer shopper.

I think that the parent company wasn't all that interested really in bringing it back.  And it was more like that Gina and I and a lot of others, including Jerry Pornell, would have loved to have seen an online Byte, but it just didn't.  It really didn't have the support of the owners.  Creative Computing, he talks about. Remember that?  Oh, God, yes.  Great magazine. Early 80s. 80 Micro Computing, the trash 80 magazine.  He talks about.  And Dr. Dobbs Journal.  Dr. Durup, remember Running Light Without Over Byte was their motto.  Compute.  Just some some classic magazines.  I was remembering today.  PC Magazine used to have a Spencer the Cat party because that was their gossip columnist.  That was one of the hot that and Dvorak's party were the hot tickets at Condex.  If you could get into that, the Spencer the Cat party, you were an A-lister.  And I remember very well standing next to some guy dressed in a cat costume and Bill Gates dancing.

Transcript:  It's not really an it's not fair to compare him to Andrew Carnegie.  Andrew Carnegie had a crappy reputation, was a union buster, steel magnet who said, I don't think this is good.  I'm going to give some libraries.  Actually, he was a Scotsman, and so he probably talked like this.  I'm going to build libraries.  Maybe they'll forget the union busting.  And they do, of course, because it's Carnegie Libraries, even here in Petaluma, just down the street.  There's a beautiful Carnegie Library.  Nobody remembers the other stuff.  I think Bill doesn't have anything to hide.  And good for him.  He's given away billions and billions of dollars.  It's fun, though, to think of those old days.  Here's a picture that McCracken posted of Bill talking about MS-DOS 2.0 with Chris Larson, who I think he was a Mike on the right.  Is that is that Andrew Flugelman on the right?
