In fact, I've never met her before.  The lovely, the talented Natalie Delconte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.  It's great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were on when I was in China, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was.  Yeah, you were in China and I was on with John Dvorak and Becky.  And when I listened to that show, I was in my apartment in New York sitting on the floor  and they were drinking wine.  So I thought, oh, I should show up with empty handed.  So I brought wine and homemade cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, not empty handed.  You got you covered both sides of the of the alley here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also brought my mother because I heard Patrick had his son on last week and I went the other  way generationally.  I don't have any kids, but I went up the generation ladder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis is also here from the beautiful Brentwood.  Ah, yes.  And the Calac compound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fresh Prince of Brentwood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, explain to me every time I have a lovely young lady in here, they bring their mother.  Is there something I should be worried about?  I think that's it's a chaperone.  You're a married man.  I know I'm harmless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My lawyer told me it was a good thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They think they're all trying to fix up their moms with you.  No, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That could be it.  That could well be it.  It's good to talk to you.  I'm talking to you in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been, you know, I'm getting busy.  I got this big product release coming December 10th.  A Mahalo release or something different?  No, we're having a baby.  Oh, London.  Yes, London will be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exciting.  December 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right around the corner.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I am like so excited.  I can't I'm like more excited than ever and also terrified at the same time.  It's a really interesting feeling for me.  I'm not usually terrified of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you should be terrified of this.  This is nothing.  I mean, entrepreneurship is nothing.  birthing a company is nothing compared to birthing a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so we're, we're, we're excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You won't even doing really any of the work.  You just be sitting there pacing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I tell you, this whole pregnancy thing so far so good.  I feel great.  We're eight months in and I'm feeling good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to find a way to add value when you're just kind of watching the whole thing.  It is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little, it's, you feel bad a little bit.  Like all the sufferings going on on the other side.  But don't worry, Jason, the nausea begins in the first trimester after birth for the, for  the father.  Just, just thought you'd like to know something.  Lack of sleep is instantaneous.  Oh, that's right here.  Oh, anyway, that's great.  That's soon.  That's like a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am giving my last keynote.  I'm going to retire from keynoting.  I'm going to do my last keynote next week and that's it.  No more travel.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, congratulations.  Yep.  You could still do Twitter because that's the kind of thing you could do with a baby.  Of course.  We found that out last week.  Oh, did you have a crying baby on the show?  Patrick Norton brought Seamus his two year old.  Oh, that's awesome.  Oh lordy.  That was something.  He actually left about a third of the way through.  In fact, we may, he may show up again because he said, can I, can I come back next week?  And I said, yes, but he hasn't, he hasn't come back.  So he may, he may walk in the door at any minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a real revolving door here.  It's an open door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good way to put it.  It was literally open, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was open.  Just walked right in.  Yeah.  Anyone can come off the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I really shouldn't do that.  Should I?  Once they know there's cookies.  Hey, there's something else here, Jason, that I'm very intrigued in.  Natalie brought the Motorola Shoals, the new Verizon Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  I am hearing great things about this product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really fun phone and Google announced this week now that it's doing sat nav on Google  maps, but only with Android 2.0, which this is the only phone now running Android 2.0.  So I used the sat nav to get here because I came from San Francisco.  I was filming loaded at CNET and I put in the address here and it worked great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels really nice.  If you compare it to the iPhone, it's about the same size.  Screen is maybe a little taller, slightly wider, higher res.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels heavier to me than the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a little heavier, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The camera is 5 megapixels and it's got a faster process.  So there's a lot of guts in there that it's going to maybe feel a bit heavier.  And I also wish the edges were rounded because I don't think it's as comfortable in your  hand.  But other than that, I think it's really, really great.  It's got a real keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now this is a tiny keyboard.  You have small fingers, so this might be okay for you, but I think I'd have trouble typing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with this.  Well, that's the problem with small hands is when I hold it in one in each hand, my  little tiny thumbs don't reach to the center of the keyboard.  So I have to keep curling my hands in.  But the virtual keyboard works great.  So most of the time I don't opt for the physical keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's got the new Android 2.0 operating system on it.  Did you use the G1 phone?  Can you compare it to the G1?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bit.  I haven't used the G1 extensively, but I do find it to be, it gets to the Android marketplace.  It syncs well with Exchange.  It's again, fast.  It feels very snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Much snappier than the G1 did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really like it.  I'm a fan of it.  I like that the camera also has a flash.  There's 16 gigs of onboard memory.  I listened to last week's tweet over Google Listen, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Google Listen is a nice podcast application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really nice.  It works on the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've never even heard of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's in the Android marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it made by Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It's a Google product that takes RSS feeds of podcasts and you can listen to them and  it'll cache it locally so that I can walk outside.  I need a block or two of leeway, but if I start listening to a podcast and then get  on the subway, it will continue to play that podcast.  Oh my god, that's genius.  I've been waiting for that application.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's definitely one of the best podcast applications I've ever seen.  This is the thing that's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just had an epiphany.  Everybody talks about iPhones lead in the application business.  If Google is going to make applications for their own phones, they have thousands of really  great programmers.  They own the best web app programmers on the planet.  Are they going to just start releasing a program or two a week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They certainly could, couldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They could.  They could make everything that is great on, they could make their own version of everything  that's great on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This week, Apple announced that there are over 100,000 apps.  102,000 apps that they had approved and about 97,000 of them were in the store.  97,000 applications.  That's extraordinary.  That just shows that developers are happy with the business model.  Some people complained about the 70%, 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's better than 100% of zero.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I've never seen a demographic breakdown of developers and a lot of people think that  the developers that are writing applications are a lot of 14-year-old kids or young people  who are not really, because that's why there's so many of them is because there's a lot of  crap in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's bad.  I think that means that first of all, that 14-year-old who's writing an application today  in five years is going to be writing really good applications.  So it's not a bad thing.  Remember, Apple used to put Apple IIs in every school because they wanted to cultivate those  kids.  It also means that it's easy to write.  If it were hard to write, you wouldn't get a 14-year-old writing applications.  So I don't think that's necessarily a negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the point I'm trying to make is that we don't know that the younger developers  are really okay with the revenue model.  They might just be okay with doing it for practice in sort of an open community forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've seen developers talk.  In fact, Scoble has an article on his blog the last couple of days saying developers,  and they've got to make that choice pretty much always come down to Android and iPhone.  That makes sense.  But what's significantly missing is BlackBerry.  That's not good for BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And BlackBerry is the leader in smartphone penetration right now, so it's kind of odd.  I just got to have App World, which they just released, and so I've been playing with the  App World.  But you go in there and it's like going into Walmart.  If half the shelves were empty, it's like there should be more things in here.  You pull up certain categories and you're like, really, there's nothing here.  Where is everything?  Where'd everybody go?  Yeah.  Kind of sad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But then people are going to be able to launch these applications instantly.  So this whole idea on Android, you just point to a URL and you can download an application.  You don't even go through Google.  You just go direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting that Google's doing turn-by-turn navigation.  They say they're going to try to get it in the Apple Store.  There's no way Apple will let them do that because Apple even says in the Terms of Service,  no turn-by-turn navigation.  Well, obviously without our approval because TomTom's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they charge an arm and a leg for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't see Apple saying yes.  But on the other hand, with all the attention they're getting from the FCC right now, maybe  they can't say no.  Maybe they just have that option.  So you said it worked pretty well.  Do you think it replaces your TomTom or your Garmin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm probably the wrong person to ask about this because I don't drive.  I live in New York City.  So I don't need turn-by-turn navigation all that often.  But in the off chance that I do get a Zipcar and need it, then this is much, much better.  It's all you need.  It is all you need.  I don't have a separate GPS.  Why get more?  But I don't think it didn't lead me wrong here except when I pulled off to go to Jack  in the Box on my way up here.  And it did tell me to go the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wanda, you let Natalie go to Jack in the Box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She made me go to Jack in the Box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was her idea?  Mom says Jack.  That's very cute.  In and out next time though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah, we did go to In and Out last night.  Last night?  You went to In and Out?  After our Halloween.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That's nothing like about 80 Mounds bars and then an In and Out burger to really settle  the stomach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I made the cookies before we went out last night for Halloween.  Did you have a costume?  I did.  I was a Top Chef.  Oh, how cute.  Yeah.  I saw your costume on Facebook.  You were a Whirling Dervish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good.  That's probably what I was.  You didn't know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People asked me.  I said I'm Rocky Rococo.  I didn't know.  Did you do any Whirling Dervish?  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, I could have.  I should have.  I could have spun around like crazy.  You don't trick or treat, Jason.  Do you bring Taurus and Fondue out, your bulldogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is a thing called Bow Wow Ween here in Bretwood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You, Ted Danson, Jill Kleberg, the gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Basically everybody gets together, me and Ted.  They dress up their dogs.  I just, I'm not going to shake my head.  I just want to say this is why the rest of the world hates us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just want to point that out.  That's why the dogs hate us.  And the dogs.  Not just the rest of the world, the dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean other places in the world, they're eating dogs because they're actually, you  know, eating food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had Ozzie, our little papillon dog, in a sombrero and a serapi.  I think it's meant for a chihuahua, but he's the same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How multicultural of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I thought that was very diverse.  I was in a fez and the dog was from Down Under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How much more dangerous is it to use a mobile phone for turn by turn navigation than an  in-unit, you know, designed for when you're driving kind of unit?  I mean this seems like a recipe for disaster.  It's a recipe anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on, Jason, when you use your GPS, you look over at it.  You touch it.  You press the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, actually in the cars I have, a number of the units don't allow you to touch it unless  you're going under five miles an hour or something.  That's one of the reasons to get an external unit like a dash, which has now been sold  to BlackBerry, but that's the reason I use the dash is because when I'm on the highway,  if I'm stuck in traffic, I can touch it.  But holding it in your hand, I don't have to hold the GPS unit in my hand to do the  commands.  It's mounted.  Right.  I mean, sort of this unmounted thing.  And I see cab drivers doing this now and it makes me really nervous.  Also the screen size is what, half the size?  A third of the size?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should really be.  You should have a little holder for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I saw that there were already third parties making holders for this that will  mount in your car.  But also when you think of the traditional sat-nav devices, they're made by a company  that doesn't make phones.  And so they make some kind of nonsensical decisions like a keyboard that's not QWERTY,  but instead alphabetical, or it's not an interface that you get used to.  So if it's your phone, you have your hands on this all day.  You have a lot of muscle memory when it comes to using that phone.  So if you do need to touch it a little bit while you're driving, at least your body's  already ready for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where do you stand on?  It's actually a very interesting question.  Where do you stand on, because you use a lot of portable devices, the idea that everything  should be in one device or is it better to have a music player and a GPS and a phone?  You want it all in one device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing is that if I decide to make this my primary phone, then that takes  me off of iTunes, which is where I tend to keep and store my music.  So then will I go to an iPod Touch or an iPod Classic?  And maybe I like that idea, maybe I don't.  I know Donald Bell, who reviews MP3 players at CNET, says he really likes the idea of  having someone else or having a standalone MP3 player.  Like best in class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like it's the best MP3 player could be.  It's the best navigation it could be.  It's the best phone it could be instead of compromising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So I don't know.  I think it really depends device by device.  I don't love reading books on my phone, even though the Kindle has an iPhone application.  I like to have a standalone device as an e-reader.  So I think it really is going to depend on the function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about you, Jason?  You got an opinion on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I always carry my BlackBerry and my iPhone with me.  Oh, interesting.  You have two phones.  I will never be with one phone because it's too, I mean, I need to get on email.  Sometimes it's an emergency.  Sometimes I'm the only person who can answer a question.  Sometimes I got to check the Nix score, whatever.  It's important things going on.  Redundancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, what did you and Mark Cuban say at the Dallas game, at the Mavs, Lakers?  Were you like sitting next to each other kind of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, somebody who I know had second row seats, so he got me second row seats and then Mark  was right across.  So he saw me and came over and we just chatted it up for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When he's at a game, number one, I don't, like one time I went to a game with him.  He got me tickets for the All-Star game a couple of years back and we hung out in the  suite with Dirk and Nowitzki and everything.  It was cool because he's not in the game, but when it's a game that he's playing in,  you do not want, I don't want to sit next to him because he gets in a foul mood if they're  losing and he gets insane and he's arguing with people like five rows in front of behind  him.  He's arguing with the refs.  He's throwing chairs.  I mean, he did get fined for running on the court.  The guy is really passionate about it.  That's like him working.  If people who don't know him are like, hey, we should go to a game together.  I never ask him like, hey, go to a game together because I know how he is.  It's work.  That's like asking somebody who's a conductor, like, hey, can I go hang out with you when  you're conducting an orchestra?  It's like, no, he's actually really into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, his reputation is for being fairly bombastic in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but he was like the mayor of the Staples Center.  Everybody is coming up to say hello to him and people are yelling his name.  He really has done an amazing thing for the NBA in terms of getting excitement.  When he comes to his arena is sold out number one.  He's in the top three or four arenas in terms of being sold out.  When he goes to an arena, when Dallas goes to an arena, those games sell out because  people want to see him.  They want to see the Mavericks.  He creates a sense of excitement.  So good for him.  Yeah, nothing wrong with that.  Yeah, but I think I like the idea of having redundancy.  When I was at that game, I was taking pictures of like or videos of Posh Spice who was there  with Bax and, you know, Kelsey Grammer and all this stuff.  But I was like, I'm going to take a video with my iPhone.  I'm going to take a picture of my BlackBerry and one's uploading so I can use the other  one.  I think people are going to have multiple devices, but the devices will share functionality.  You know, so your kindle will let you do email and surf the web eventually, and you'll be  able to have ebooks from your kindle on your iPhone.  But you're going to use whichever one's best and people have multiple ones because the  cost of these things is also going to go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd love to get that kindle into something because you know, you don't want to carry  that kindle around all the time.  Boy, this is a category that's exploding.  Not only Barnes and Noble, I just saw who else has just announced an ebook reader or  they're going to do an ebook reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Azusetech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Creative Labs or something.  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think that many people read books.  Yeah, I mean, who's buying these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put a TV show on there and maybe somebody will buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't understand why they just have this aversion to letting you do email or surf the  web on it.  I mean, it's clearly capable of that, so why would you punish people for buying a 300  dollar device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think it's really that capable of that.  The kindle's a slow device.  It takes, I mean, even though they say...  Well, that screen is really slow.  The screen is really, really slow.  The screen is slow.  It doesn't change pages all that quickly, so I wouldn't want to do too much web surf.  I mean, if you go to the web...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One person in the chat room said, I read books.  One person.  I read books.  And he's lying.  He's lying.  He buys books.  I buy them.  They're on my shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't read them.  No, but what about if you wanted to get the weather or text based stuff?  I'm not saying you're going to be using Flash and playing Farmville on your Kindle, but  what if it showed you the next game?  I'd play Farmville on my Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank God they don't have Farmville on my Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, forget about that.  I mean, people would be playing Farmville.  Imagine they put Farmville on the GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you get sucked into that Farmville thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I played it for...  I said I have to check this out because it's all over my Facebook news feed.  I turned it on and then I looked up and I think it went from being Monday to Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whatever they're doing, I think they're hypnotizing people in that game.  It's the most addictive crack.  Do you ever play that, Natalie?  It's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Age of Empok.  No, I ignore all the invitations on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something about...  It's the Zynga stuff.  These guys, they're...  What is it?  They're crushing it.  They are crushing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have crushed it.  Yes, they're crushing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  150 million a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's nuts.  I mean, I remember when Mark Pink is some pretty good friends with him and we were at dinner  and he's like, I think I'm buying this poker company.  And what do you think?  And I was like, I don't know.  It sounds like casual games.  That's been done.  No, no, no, no.  I was like, absolutely wrong.  Absolutely wrong.  He goes so fast on that.  And I begged Sequoia Capital to invest in that company when I was working there as a  consultant.  And Fred Wilson wound up doing it, who had invested in Mark's first company.  But they have figured out what's addictive about the social games and what's unique about  being able to say...  That's their success, isn't it?  Invite your friends to this.  And now I'm going to...  If I invite you, then I get extra points and gold to plant better trees.  And they've really nailed that piece of it.  And it shows your virtual currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does Pinkus have some expert in that working on this?  I mean, I would think that this must be a specialty.  Is a game addiction specialist, like a person who could turn that stuff on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, in truth, and this is no dig to Zynga, all of this had been done already in other  games, just like Age of Empires you had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But putting it on Facebook was what did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what they basically did was they figured out a way to sort of strip the games down  into something simpler.  And this is for middle America.  This is like moms and students and playing this grandmas and it's super addictive and  social.  And what do we like about playing games?  It's playing games with other people.  This is what the Nintendo Wii did.  It's not the technology, it's the socialization of the technology that really makes it explode.  But the virtual currency is amazing.  People are more motivated by virtual currency than real currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was reading The Wealth of Networks by Yul Haibuk.  And he says something in there that I've been thinking about lately about how it used to  be before the digital revolution that from nine to five, we had some kind of hierarchical  relationship with production.  So you produce something, you bought something, you sold something.  And then come quitting time, you were then a consumer.  And so it was duplicitous.  You were either that or you're this.  And now the digital world is blurring our reality so much that you are both a consumer  and a producer at the same time.  And I think this Farmville really speaks to that is that you don't have to be one or the  other.  You are both again, producer, consumer.  And that's what we call the user.  It's a really interesting change in the way that we interact with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I cut you off.  His last name is Benkler.  The book is online, The Wealth of Networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great book.  Really interesting.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me take a break.  And speaking of books, and we're going to talk a little bit about Audible and we will  come back.  Natalie Del Conti is here.  She is the star of what?  What are you the star of?  Are you on a regular show on CNET?  I am.  You're on Buzz Out Loud pretty regularly.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I do Buzz Out Loud two days a week.  Two days a week.  And then I have a regular show called Loaded, which is just your daily tech wrap up of what's  going on.  It's five minutes every morning.  And I also do tech reporting for the CBS early show and CBS News local affiliates.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course, Jason Calacanis, basketball wizard and entrepreneur whose twist show is  huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you for the inspiration.  And I've learned a lot about doing the show from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to last time I talked, you had our webpage this weekend, right?  Is that moving along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bought the domain name this weekend and my idea for it and I sort of ran up the flagpole  with you when I bought it was just make a landing page where we can put all of these  great this weekend shows.  This Week in Google has been a great addition and then there's people outside.  So maybe we can centralize some of the stuff and sell advertising into it.  Cool.  Yeah, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always liked the idea of that.  But I'm going to mention something that will make you even more excited right now.  It's called, you know what I'm talking about, audible.com baby.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Audible.  Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's taking up so much of my time.  I don't know if they're going to ask you to talk about the copper bracelet.  They are.  Do you have you listen to it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is great.  I mean, this is made for the medium content.  I mean, this is not a book made into audiobook.  These are the great thriller writers and they're making content directly for audiobooks.  So made for the medium.  They know this is going to be an audiobook and they're writing it to be an audiobook.  Really fantastic.  And it's a they did this last year.  Yeah.  Chopin manuscript.  Right.  Follow up and you can get it now.  I think you can download the first chapter to for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if they had the I screwed it up last week.  They had the first chapter free last week.  And now you can get the whole book for nine ninety five at our special our special place.  It's audible dot com slash twit copper.  So this is Jeffrey Dever.  You know, and people know him.  He's he's of course a bestseller thriller author.  He wrote the first chapter, gave it to another writer, Gail Lins, who wrote the second chapter.  She gave it to David Huston, wrote the third chapter, which was fun for these guys.  Sixteen very well known thriller writers in all.  And then Dever gets it and writes the last chapter.  You know, Molly Wood and Tom Merritt and I did kind of something like that on Twitter.  We did a hundred forty character novel.  But I think these guys are probably better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's leave it to the professionals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alfred Molina does the narration.  He did the Chopin manuscript and he's very good.  He also did Da Vinci Code Spider-Man to you.  I think I'll play a little bit if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  They don't have the preview on here.  Let me see if I can see it.  And here it is.  Here's a little bit from the Chopin manuscript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was born in New Delhi and now he liked to think a resident of the world was observing  the family through expensive binoculars from a hundred yards away in the hills above the  beach.  He was parked in a rented Fiat, listening to some syrupy French pop music.  He was taking in the gray water, the gray sky.  I can't wait to listen to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's good, right?  Yeah.  All of a sudden it's like, what's what?  What's syrupy?  I need to hear more.  I need to hear more.  Yeah, it's true.  It's a great thing about audiobooks.  It's just like when you're driving, instead of listening to commercials, you could be  listening to these like professional authors like with this really thrilling stuff.  And this probably be made into a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just got a new car, which I was supposed to talk about this week and I can't talk about  till next week, but it has an audio system that ties into my iPhone.  When I get in the car, the book starts and when I leave the car, it stops.  And I am in heaven now.  I am just like in heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's amazing.  This simple little feature like just knowing where you left off is just so important.  It's so cool.  I think I know a car that is by the way, because I know the car that has that system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so awesome.  Well, actually, we're going to advertise the system next week, but I can't talk about it  till then because they're still doing some research on it.  So I will next week.  I was going to do it this week and next week I'll talk about it.  Is it parked outside?  You can see it out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the new Twitmobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll agree to the embargo.  Yeah, there is an embargo.  I wish there weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is the hardest thing I've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't normally accept embargoes or NDAs from other people and now I'm embargoing myself  and it's like I want to just nail my head with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, you don't want to say it because you want to get it perfect when you do do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't talk too much about why, but the campaign starts next week.  They don't want us to talk about it until the campaign starts because they're doing  research now, etc.  Anyway, Jeffrey Deaver, Lisa Scudellini, Joseph Feiner, Lee Child, and a cast of 16 of the  best writers.  Alfred Molina, you don't get a better narrator and it's yours right now for $9.95 at audible.com  slash twit copper.  We love Audible.  We know you will, so give them a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  If you're a fan of the show, you already have an Audible subscription.  I know.  You're going to pick this up.  What you want to do is to support the show.  The show is free.  You don't charge.  You can easily charge like a lot of other people do.  The show is, frankly, you can have twice as many ads in the show.  It'd still be just as good.  You're pretty reserved in the amount of ads you put in.  Why not just tweet thanks to audible.com slash twit copper, C-O-P-P-E-R, two P's in that  for those people who are dyslexic like me.  You tweet that on behalf of the show and just say thank you to Audible for supporting independent  media.  That means a lot to Audible.  I know because I talk to these guys.  They're Audible under COM.  They love to see that.  Every Sunday when you do your show, every Friday when I do my show, they see thanks  audible underscore COM.  That's their at symbol.  They get a couple hundred followers.  Follow Audible.  It means something to them.  They have been a supporter of this show since the beginning almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think this is their third year now.  We're grateful to them.  We're grateful to you for listening to the show.  Let's see.  We've been talking about Android.  There's so much news about this Android 2.0 and the new Droid phone.  The Ares, which is the next one we now know is going to come out November 6th.  It's like a week away.  The Droid comes out November 6th.  The Droid is November 6th and the Ares is another month after that.  It's unfortunately, it's 1.6.  It's not 2.0.  I don't know why they are putting the old Android in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a smaller processor.  I'm disappointed.  It's kind of ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's 99 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's ...  How much was that?  This one will be 199.  I have to give this back.  This is not my phone.  I just got it for a while.  It's a review unit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might go to the Verizon store now that I've played with it.  I kind of like it.  You know what I ordered that I mentioned this before is the Nokia N900, which is Nokia's  tablet.  It's on Mimo.  It's another Linux distro called Mimo that Nokia's developed.  It looks very sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the N800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have the 810.  I used to have ...  I have the 810.  Didn't like it that much.  The 800 and the 810.  Sluggish.  This is going to be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was sluggish.  I couldn't really figure out what to do with it or when I needed it.  This has a phone in it.  Right.  That's the difference.  It's now your phone.  That's what I wanted from that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's unlocked.  I'll have to put it on T-Mobile.  But T-Mobile, it's designed for the T-Mobile frequencies as well as other world frequencies,  so it'll work well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Verizon customers are always belly-aching that they don't have the phone choices.  Well, they don't.  So now with the Droid and then the Ares, they're going to have a lot more choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to see a ton of Android phones too.  This is just the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is going to be ... In the same way, it was the golden age of the internet for the  with Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, all battling it out for features and offering stuff for  free.  That's what we're going into now.  It's going to be the golden age for development of these platforms with the bandwidth increasing,  screen size increasing, processor speed, and now these developers charged up in a monetization  system.  I mean, there's going to be things that are coming out.  I was talking to some people about biometrics.  If you've ever known anybody who had a heart attack, they have them put a thing on their  side, the halter monitor that monitors your heart rate for 24 hours.  Then you listen to the tapes and look for patterns and stuff like that.  The Fitbit, which was one of the TechCrunch 50 companies two years ago, just launched  where you put it on your side.  It recognizes when you're sleeping and how many walks you take like a pedometer.  These things are all going to start ... These new hardware sensors are going to start to  be put on your phones and whatnot.  Everywhere.  You're going to be able to monitor this whole ... There's a term for it that these Tim O'Reilly  geeks have been calling it.  I forgot the name of it, but a lot of good things start in his food camp or whatever.  This sort of monitoring yourself obsessively.  Biometrics or something like that.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're talking about Gordon Bell and ...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have a buzzword for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He wrote a book.  What's it called?  Life ...  It'll be in the chat room.  I mean, it's basically ... This is for OCD people.  Typically programmers who got too fat and then they started ... There's like Oisy stories.  You can find these websites like a programmer who got like 100 pounds overweight and then  they monitored their calories and put it in an Excel spreadsheet and then did a program  and then they walked a certain amount and they knew their exact net in, net out calories  and then they watched themselves get really skinny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw something at iStage last week in Phoenix, this company that had developed a technology  that takes your biometric readings such as your pulse and your temperature and your heart  rate and all of that stuff from in-ear systems that can be built into your existing Bluetooth  headset or your earbuds or whatever it is that you already put ...  Yeah.  I mean, and it worked pretty well and the guy sort of did some jumping jacks and then  ran around the stage a bit and it gave a real-time feed and then ...  It's like the Fitbit, right?  It is like the Fitbit, but I don't have to put another gadget on my person because I'm  already carrying around in earbuds or I don't use a Bluetooth headset, but ...  Add to that a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what Bell does.  He calls it the SenseCam.  He's a Microsoft researcher, but he also was the founder of digital equipment.  His book is Total Recall.  The camera takes a picture every few seconds of everything he's doing and done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not internally, I hope.  Not inside his person.  No, it's around his neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the idea is that you create this lifestream, a mountain of data that is everything you've  ever done, records everything you've ever seen.  It might as well get the bio data as well.  Who's going to look at this?  I don't know, but I guess if it's searchable, you never ... His wife, Gwen Bell, who founded  the Computer History Museum in the South Bay, passed away of Alzheimer's eventually.  She had Alzheimer's.  I think he's probably moved a little bit by the notion of, as she forgot her life, this  idea that you'd have everything recorded.  Your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This was actually a William Gibson novel in the Adoro series.  Yes.  He had little zeppelins, balloons that would float above you, almost like in Sim City they  have that little thing that floats above you, like the crystal or whatever.  People would be walking around a club or the city and it would have multiple camera angles  streaming back to some server somewhere that records your whole life.  Then you could either sell access to your life or go back and get it.  If you include the biometric data in it, imagine you get an injury and they're like, well,  we actually ... Looking back, it looks like on September 17th, something happened because  it looks like you fell and that might have been when you hurt your knee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you rewind if you have all of this data?  You could go and you could search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, undo, I don't know.  I'm going to control Z my life.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would like to cut and paste some stuff that happened when I was 23.  Bring it back.  Yeah, I'd like to actually cut and paste myself back into that night.  It's a pretty good night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very interesting article in AboveTheCrowd.com that says Google redefines disruption, the  less than free business model.  Some interesting quotes about Android.  Android is not only a phone OS, it's a consumer electronics OS.  If Ford or BMW wanted to build an in-dash Android GPS, guess what?  Google gives it to them for free and then the kicker because ... Google gives you ad  splits on search if you use their version.  Google in effect pays you to use their mobile OS and that's why he calls it the less than  free business model.  Does that make sense?  Jason, you're a search mogul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  There's also an anti-competitive law against this when you sell something in the market  for less than it's worth.  This is a whole new brave world where it's like I'm giving something away essentially  to kill a competitor.  Google's giving away Office right now essentially to kick Microsoft where it hurts.  They want to destroy Office not because they gain anything by destroying Office, but because  they hurt Microsoft and where their revenue is.  That's why Microsoft is so obsessed with search as well, although them getting into  search means a revenue model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at how much money Firefox makes from Google because they've got a Google search  box and Firefox extend that model to everything if the operating system is Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you follow the logical conclusion, eventually they would give hardware away for free.  If a netbook cost $300, $400, you could easily make that back in AdSense.  Not easily, but you might be able to.  If every time you open the computer you play a 30 second spot or you had to watch five  30 second spots a day, at some point it would pay for itself.  Bill Gross of Idea Lab who created Overture, which was essentially what Google's become  with AdSense, who's pretty much the most underrated genius of our time, he saw this.  He had a company called Free PC.  You could buy a PC.  It was essentially free.  It was like $20 a month for the ISP.  You got the PC for free and it had a little toolbar at the bottom that had battery ads  go by.  They sent out I think tens of thousands of these computers and they were making a network.  Guess what?  If you had the ability, if you were NBC or something, you had a lot of video inventory,  if you put out a computer that every time you booted it forced a commercial, sure, it  would make a ton of money.  By the way, above the crowd is Bill Gurley.  He's a famous venture capitalist from Benchmark.  Oh, you know him.  Okay.  I know Bill.  Not a good poker player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lost a lot of money at the Deconference.  A lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well that's good because I'm going to start reading this because this was a very, I thought  a very insightful...  He did eBay.  He did eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  There's a book called Eboys that you can get on Audible about Benchmark and their company.  It's a VC firm that's known for having all partners who are over six foot.  Oh really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the tall guys.  Basically, Benchmark.  That's funny.  Yeah, I've heard of Benchmark of course, but I didn't know Bill Gurley's name.  It's a good...  Abovethecrowd.com.  It's a good blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He writes a blog once every two months, but when he does it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very insightful on this subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw Android running on an e-reader again at iStage, which is the launch event for CEA  into their CES show.  I liked this one a lot.  I think it spoke to your point.  It was called The Edge and it was running Android.  One screen was E Ink and the other was a netbook tablet.  There was no keyboard, but you could double click on the text on the left side and it  would either launch a video on the other side, whatever the author wanted you to see.  It would launch a hyperlink.  It was kind of a hybrid thing.  Yeah.  It was really immersive.  I liked it a lot.  A friend of mine called it a never-ending story kind of experience because you can take  the existing story and then augment it with video or audio or whatever, a dictionary.  It was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of this stuff is converging in such a way that now we're seeing amazing creativity.  We've got developers who are getting it.  We've got a convergence of internet.  It's cheap, small hardware.  We're getting some really interesting uses of all this stuff.  That's very innovative, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think so too.  It's going to amount to manufacturing at this point because it's a beautiful device, but  they have to get it right.  They have to make sure that it's going to launch at CES in January, but it will cost  over $400, which is too much for a device like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what do you think, Leo, in terms of the market share of Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if I were a developer, if I were that 14-year-old kid we were talking about, I'd  be writing for Android.  I'd be learning Android right now.  I think this is the way to go.  I think that Google's not going to sit still until Android's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  All that competition in the hardware space has got to lead to a better product than iPhone,  perhaps, or products that would be more…

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is what we were waiting for.  For a whole year, they were stuck with this crappy G1 hardware.  Now they've got some decent hardware and I think we're just going to start seeing  this snowball.  And I think, and I've Twittered this, and I sense a backlash against Apple.  People are starting to turn a little bit against Apple.  They're feeling a little bit like Apple has become the big monopoly that Microsoft used  to be.  They're the Yankees.  Yeah, they're the Yankees all of a sudden.  Hey, easy.  The Yankees.  Did the Yankees win last night?  Boy, they sure turned it around, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of ugly.  The Yankees win.  It's not over yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not at all.  Not at all.  If they're playing the Yankees, it's over.  No, I think they got serious.  If they're playing the Angels, it wouldn't be over, but they're playing the Yankees,  it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, did you, anybody watch the last Sunday after Twitter?  I was working a little bit late and I turned on YouTube and I saw, oh, YouTube, YouTube  is doing a concert on YouTube live from the Rose Bowl.  I watched a couple of hours.  Never buffered.  Unbelievable.  Perfect quality.  Unbelievable.  I don't know how many they served.  They didn't, they aren't saying, you know, they're being, well, they're being cagey.  10 million during the entire concert.  I don't know how many at any one time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Half a million easily, maybe a million concurrent, right?  That's got to be a record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The last, the biggest number I ever heard was live eight and AOL did 180,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, they did pat themselves on the back and said it was the biggest live streaming  concert event ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're not being, they're not being, they're not saying exactly what the peak number  was, but still, yeah, it's got to be half a million.  If you've got 10 million people in two hours, it's got to be a million.  It's going to be two million.  I believe the Foo Fighters did it just a few days ago as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't even come close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The quality.  How do they do it?  I mean, I thought you, I just, now I should point out the reason I bring it up is we're  blown away and rightly so.  I mean, this is streaming internet video, beautiful quality, millions of simultaneous  views, but that pales to the number of people that watched the World Series last night or  will watch Monday Night Football tomorrow night.  You're still far away from TV capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not far away from TV.  Ten million people coming to see something, you know, how many unique, let's say two or  three million unique or whatever.  Even I don't know, maybe they're counting 10 million unique.  It's good.  No, they're not saying unique.  Yeah.  So think about it on a global basis.  If you could put YouTube or the Super Bowl or any of these things on TV, it's going to  be huge.  I mean, we're going to have a global market for watching things that has never existed.  And you think about Twitter.  How did you find out about the YouTube concert?  I found out on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody found out Twitter.  Twitter is a new TV guide now.  I mean, Twitter is where you find out what to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TV guide would be diminishing Twitter's value.  Twitter, Twitter.  I've said it's the internet.  It's the internet nervous system is what it really is.  It's how it's the signaling system for the entire internet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Correct.  And one of the functions is, hey, everybody watch this.  Right.  And that's never existed before.  Everybody watch this now.  And boom, trending topic, YouTube.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Natalie brought down our streaming by tweeting that she's going to be on Twitter.  The streaming went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just had 10 people tell me the same thing.  I tweeted it and everyone's like, boom, tries to get on.  It went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I got to talk to YouTube.  I mean, I don't think we have 10 million people trying to watch,  although with Natalie on it could be.  But it's really interesting.  I think that we are headed towards that convergence.  I just wonder how long before the capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And when did you stream say they were going to be?  What did you stream?  What did when did YouTube say they were going to be you stream?  What did they say?  They were going to be a streaming company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said that over a year ago.  It's been at least a year and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe this is what they meant, though.  Maybe they didn't mean for everybody any time.  Right.  Well, they can do it for you, too.  You just test it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't test it with you, too.  One of the most popular rock bands ever.  You think they would test it?  It's not a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the real deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can just get you to one.  Although I'm thinking about this Twitter nervous system  that you're talking about, I think not to jump ahead too far in the stories,  but these Twitter lists are a way to filter out the noise and just start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. We're going to take a break.  Let's talk about lists.  I really think that's a good subject.  And I do want to get to that.  And I think Patrick Norton is ready to join us.  Hey, there he is.  So when we come back, Patrick Norton and Twitter lists.  We continue with Natalie Delconte, her first time with me on Twitter,  but second time on Twitter and Jason Calacanis in just a little bit.  But before we do that, I do want to talk about our friendly sponsors  from the folks at Citrix and Go To Meeting.  Do you ever use Go To Meeting, Jason?  You know, we were going to I was going to steal your idea,  the TechCrunch 50 idea, and we were going to do the twit 12.  And oh, yeah, we'd go do it with Go To Meeting.  And we were going to have 12 people who had a good idea come on.  And they had to use Go To Meeting to demonstrate it.  I thought it would just be so much fun.  You know, great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And ironically, for TechCrunch 50, we use Go To Meeting.  And I do about 250 meetings in the course of two weeks.  And we do about 500 meetings over that period.  And they're all virtual or 90 percent of them.  And they all use Go To Meeting.  But I mean, some people use some of the other products,  but it's it's majority Go To Meeting.  And I can tell you, it works flawlessly.  I mean, I don't let anybody use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I won't do a meeting with anybody with anything, but Go To Meeting.  I'm pretty I'm pretty spoiled.  We got a special deal. You could try it free.  So here's the deal with Go To Meeting.  You set it up. You can set it up before the show's over  just by going to go to meeting dot com slash twit.  It'll take you two minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you're serious about business, you use that one and it's free.  So just go try it and you'll see, you know, it's worth it's not that expensive anyway.  But it's one of those things that just well worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Every penny.  We have three or four counts now because we have our hosts using it.  All right. Let me get Patrick Norton in here.  I have to press a button or two because I have to change  the configuration of the Framitz rod.  Hello, Patrick Norton.  Yeah, the Framitz rod.  He's going to be on number six left.  All right. There we go.  Patrick Norton, say hello.  Now he's not saying anything.  What are you being so quiet for?  Are you there, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I turned the mute on.  So my horrible,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hazel breathing didn't come over the line.  And so my clever, clever technical accuracy is taking me out once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we. Sorry, I didn't see an email yesterday, so I figured you were booked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, we got the text message and like put down the baby and grabbed.  Put down the baby, grab the old ladies, everybody go.  My parents are in town, so they're actually getting more full on baby time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Natalie brought her mom to the studio in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My parents are in town, too.  We needed babies. They live here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick, you know, Natalie Del Conti, I'm sure.  Yes, we used to work on the same floor right next door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh huh. Our cubicles share the wall.  We both faced each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did he ever punch a hole in that wall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he never punched a hole.  And you didn't know him that well.  But yeah, but I could hear him.  I could hear him.  One cabinet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was one cabinet punching incident.  I think it was clearly and I went to apologize to everyone in the row  that I went to the person that was responsible for my ire and their manager.  And we resolved the issue.  It resolved stories being stolen from the screensavers for an unprepared show.  There you go. Fill their time to say no one to write for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Had every right to.  And I'll never forget the dented look at that cabinet to the end of its days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My dad likes to say you should lose your cool about once or twice a year  so people know what you're made of.  You know, I think he's right.  Capable of adamantium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you. I think he's absolutely right.  I think that that's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Completely lose it.  I haven't done it yet this year, so maybe today will be the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't imagine you losing your cool.  What do you look like when you lose your cool?  Do you like to turn bright red?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just cry. I'm just a good girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's what dad meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I hate to say I'm still working on how to lose my cool effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I watched the last detail last night.  Jack Nicholson teaching Randy Quaid how to lose his cool.  It's a great moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a beautiful moment.  It's one of Randy Quaid's greatest acting moments.  Not that there are so many of them, but I love you, Randy.  I'm just I'm just saying this was his business. His movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that was a wonderful movie.  I haven't seen that in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, speaking of like getting really angry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you guys may have talked about this already, but Jason,  how is the war against these scumbags going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, really good.  The why don't you set this up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so people know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. So for background, I  I had a couple of companies from TechCrunch 50 call me and say, listen,  should I do this Koretsu forum?  Should I do this Mike Segal thing in New York where you pay  and then you present to angel investors?  And I said, what?  And they said, yeah, you know, you pay and then you get to talk to rich people  who might invest in your company.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  I know all the top angel investors in the world.  They don't charge you to pitch them.  They want to hear pitches because they make money off of you in the long run.  They make money if they invest in your company.  It's like they are you're doing them a service by giving them  the opportunity to invest in your company.  I invested in GDGT.  Trust me, they didn't pay me to pitch.  I I chased Peter and Ryan and said, listen, for two years, I said,  whatever your next company is, I'm going to angel invest.  Let me be the first investor.  Let me be the first investor.  Let me be the first investor for this.  And I and I've done that with a couple of things with Jack  Dorsey, who's the Twitter founder, who's doing this new payment system on iPhone.  I've got like three emails into him like, listen, save me a little spot.  I really would love to be involved.  And so long story short, these, you know, DB's,  you know what that stands for.  These DB's are chargels.  Yeah, dumbbells.  It the second word is bags.  And the first word is, yeah,  Ruth. Yeah.  So I'm to push stuff.  Anyway, stuff.  They were charging $1500 to present for like 10 minutes to a bunch of angel investors.  So the guy who's a former employee sends me  a former employee sends me a whole email saying, like, listen, I worked there.  It's a scam.  It's filled with a bunch of lawyers and consultants.  And, you know, you shouldn't do it.  And not only is it $1500, but you have to do four chapters.  So it's really $6000.  So I say, listen, you shouldn't do this.  I'm on this week in startups.  And I'm giving a bunch of advice to people.  Don't do it. Don't do it.  Anyway. And so then they one of the guys starts mixing up with me.  And I said, listen, you want me to go on a jihad against this?  I will. And so I basically I started a jihad and I said,  I'm going to destroy this thing.  And I demanded that they drop the fees or I would launch a competing product  in 30 days that would be free.  And so anyway, a week after I, you know, given the ultimatum,  they start calling Sequoia Capital, my investors,  and they start emailing them and CC me all these different people  and threatening a lawsuit.  This is not good for me to have people calling my VC, right?  And long story short, they drop the fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good for you.  Now, I read I read an interesting post by a British  angel who explained why they charged and he said, well, you know,  you want to make sure that people are committed.  You'd be surprised.  Are you sorry? That's OK.  No, no, I'm glad to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Four minutes in, put a beep.  Yeah, that's all right.  It's BS. It's that that is the lamest excuse.  They say it's to filter.  Guess what?  A lot of the best companies were started by people who were broke.  Larry and Sergey were broke.  You know, they were going to get somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also says, I'll give you the rest of him.  He says he says we help them.  We work on their presentation.  We polish it. We put a lot of effort into that.  That costs money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do two weeks of  preparation with the TechCrunch 50 companies.  I don't get paid for it.  Again, you know, they're doing this as a scam.  It's the same as people who charge.  You go to become a model and they're like, oh, Natalie, you're so beautiful.  We need to send you to a modeling classes.  They're going to be thirteen hundred dollars and we need to get headshots.  It could be seventeen hundred dollars.  Take a makeup class for fourteen hundred dollars.  But you are going to be the next Kate Moss.  I'm telling you, you have it.  Trust me. You know, like  or when you or you have to need you need acting lessons or coaching lessons.  That's BS.  It's just a way to scam people who are desperate out of their money.  And as a guy who had to fight my way in, I took personal offense to it.  And now I've destroyed them because they said last week  they weren't going to charge companies under five hundred thousand dollars  in revenue or raising money, whatever the fees.  And there's a couple of more of these groups.  And I'm going to specifically target them and I'm going to put them out of business.  Or they can drop the fees and I'll give them credit.  So I give Karetsu half credit for dropping half the fees, essentially.  But it's not going to I'm not going to stop until they don't.  And you know what? It's over now because all the entrepreneurs know it's a scam.  And I told everybody who is doing it, you need to all the entrepreneurs.  If anybody asks you if you should do this, tell them outright it's a scam.  And so now they have no customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was a little shocked, actually, to hear it.  I thought they charge to pitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That seems all undercurrent of smarmy people.  And this one guy in New York,  Seagal, Mike Seagal, these people were sending me like email after email from him.  I can talk to you about raising money.  I need your credit card number.  It's going to be a thousand dollars for me to have a phone call with you.  And then I want, you know, between five thousand and fifteen thousand dollars  and one in 10 percent of your company to help you raise money.  Wow. And this guy who I know, who was a former whatever, somebody I know,  did it because he was desperate and he presented and he said he went to present.  There were no investors there was all people who were like lawyers.  He said everybody afterwards came up to me and started to try to sell me services.  Lawyers, headhunters, real estate agents, accountants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically you paid you paid to be to be a little fish in a shark tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To pitch to someone's mom or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. You know, all the you know, what angel investors, you know, these guys,  Ron Conway and, you know, Kevin Rose does angel investing now once in a while.  And Jay, I thought that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen a number of investments that that Kevin's made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, he'll put a 25K into something and his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And his name is valuable, of course, is that that's what I always do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm like, hey, you know, you got my Twitter, you know, you got my my email  newsletter, I'm going to I'm going to, you know, help you out as best I can.  If you if you if I can invest and it's a privilege to be to invest in these companies,  because all I need is one out of 30 to become the next anything good.  Twitter, Google, whatever. And I'm golden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Little did we know Patrick somewhere without any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll give them the name.  Little did we know Patrick, that little guy, Kevin came along,  that someday he'd be an angel.  We should have been good for him, man.  We should have been nicer to him.  Should never have punched that.  Oh, never mind.  You're the one who punched him.  I didn't punch him hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who held him when he cried?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. I held him when he cried.  Let's talk about let's talk about Twitter list, because I think it's very a big  it's probably the biggest single change  to the Twitter interface since the ad sign, maybe even more important  than the ad sign and completely eliminates the power of the suggested users list.  It puts that power into the hands of everybody, of users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like saying, you know, replacing one nuclear bomb with ten thousand AK  forty sevens takes the power away from the nuclear bomb.  I mean, you can do a lot of AK forty sevens, but it's it's  it's still not going to have the same impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But they get rid of the suggested user list.  They auto now. They should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what I've said this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He realizes junkie that it was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, yeah, it's just that this is just a new way to present  the cool kids list, I think.  I mean, it's definitely useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But who presents it? You do. You do.  So it's who you say is cool.  And I think that's much more valuable than somebody, some faceless person at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  And you're going to get much more engaged followers rather than have you made lists yet?  I have made lists. I got to say, I didn't like it's hard to do people that way,  because no one is completely mutually exclusive in any of those lists.  Well, some people are decidedly not my family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So everybody has lists now. Right.  So I think to concede.  So you've got news organizations, interesting, influencing friends,  companies, colleagues, co-workers.  See, at first you look at this and you think, oh, this is for me.  This is an organizational feature for me, but it isn't. Right.  I mean, you could use it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I sort of use it for me, but there's there's not a client  that's going to filter just those lists yet.  I mean, I can use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can. You can click it and you'll see everybody who's on that.  That now is a stream of just those people. Right.  So that you can.  You're right. No third party clients do it, but Twitter does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They will, I'm sure.  They will very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you made lists, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not quite yet.  I'm still trying to decide if this is more of a search engine tool  than any search, remote rankings and distribution search engines  more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's exactly that.  I think what it is is authority.  It's giving it's a it's a way of ranking authority.  So, for instance, now it shows that Patrick Norton is on one thousand  two hundred fifty three lists.  That is a number of value. Right.  That says Patrick is valued by that many people.  I think this is the new number. Forget followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's five dollars to tweet me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see the way that people name you on your list, like all of my  the lists that people put me on are geek, tech, nerd.  What did you want to be?  It's it's well, no, I think I'm happy with those lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can. That's the other thing that I think helps me identify.  They did very, I think intelligently is you can see  the whose lists you're on.  So if you go to click the listed thing, this is all the people who  you're a tech, tweets, tech, tweeters, most influential in tech, geek, tech.  Yeah. Interesting people.  And you can see also how many people are following those,  which I think is very interesting. Right.  What do you think, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, it's a big deal because you can tell somebody's authority  and you can tell who the spammers are instantly, because if you have to,  if you appear on X number of lists and those lists are followed  by X number of people past a certain, you know, standard deviation or whatever,  you're either extremely popular or you're non-existent person,  possibly a spammer, you know.  So when they when you do a search, they can easily say by authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's interesting.  You're right. Spammers are going to be on that list, are they? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, so spammers will try to create lists of other spammers.  And but nobody's going to follow those lists except other spammers and fake accounts.  So now they can immediately do a cutoff.  And imagine you do a search, you do a search for, you know, Yankees.  And I say, you know what?  I just want where I do a search for the new Android phone.  And I move it over to authority.  And only people who appear on more than 100 lists  that have over 10 people following each list do I see.  And now I can start to see, really, these are the interesting people, you know,  whatever. I mean, that's going to sound obnoxious,  but these are the more authoritative figures. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think behaviorally, this is really helpful,  because a lot of times I'll wake up in the morning and only read 20 tweets back.  And then I'm like, I don't care to catch up.  I'm just not going to do that.  There's an interesting term coined by David Levy.  He's a professor at the University of Washington called information  environmentalism.  It's the way that we filter out all the noise to get to what we really want.  And a lot of times, I think maybe there won't ever be a technology to help us  with that beyond an RSS reader or a Twitter list.  But it does seem that technology is becoming more keen at giving us  the information that we want to know in certain informational subsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's with the help of humans.  I think that's the key to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one of the things that it's been coming out  in some of the conferences around online video distribution is that  in some ways, the evolving thing is  edited collections of video rather than pure random collections like YouTube,  you know, or something that's pretty obvious from people who follow YouTube.  Traffic is that the the cultivated pages or the posted pages or the homepages  all tend to generate more traffic than, you know, somebody stumbling  across your video and the giant collection of a billion videos  that are floating around out there.  It's kind of interesting to watch it swing back.  The pendulum kind of swings back and forth. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, Twitter, as usually be to bring.  No, it's not you. It's Twitter.  But it just sucks the air right out of the room every single time.  I don't know why they still bring it up.  Here's a good story. Google Voice.  Google made a PDF that it sent to the FCC in response to the FCC action.  But they did it wrong.  And people were able to read the  the PDF submitted to the Federal Communications Commission was improperly  formatted so people were able to read the redacted information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I love when people do that. Oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so we now know Microsoft Word and hidden columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. Genius. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We now know several things about Google Voice we didn't know before.  Businessweek's reporting that Google Voice now has one point four million users.  This is still not a public service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow. That's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  40 percent of whom half a million use the service every day.  I'll include myself in that number. Yeah, I use it.  Google also in the redacted section suggests  that Google intends to take its voice service global  as linked deals with international service providers.  Of course, they're not doing that yet.  You have to be in the US to use it.  It's pretty amazing that they screwed up the formatting of the PDF.  Do you use Google Voice, Patrick?  No, I'm I'll send you an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's less of a need for an invite than a  anything that involves comms.  I just use my iPhone and I don't jailbreak my iPhone.  I should try it, but it's you don't need to jailbreak it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can you can you can use it without jailbreaking anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. I know that.  I guess what I'm saying is like it's the one thing that I want.  I want to make sure, you know, it's reliable.  I understand. Yeah, I've I've I've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And the iPhone is so reliable.  Don't you find? Don't even get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it wasn't for eight hundred and fifty megahertz, the eight hundred  fifty, the eight hundred and fifty megahertz rollout.  Literally, I was shopping around and flipping coins to decide  which of the other networks to go with.  And I went from, you know, not being able to hold a call for five minutes  to actually being able to hold calls in parts of the city  that I've never actually had connectivity before.  So I can't AT&T can't roll out that nationwide fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Using Google Voice, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Calacanis, I signed up for it and I'm not currently using it  because it was a weird phone number.  And I guess I got a phone number to get your phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've the number of ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, yeah, I'm going to think about doing that.  But right now I have the simul scribe, which is a human being.  Oh, yeah, we've been using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were and they did. They're the phone.  Yeah, folks, they said that works really, really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They send your phone message to the Philippines, Manila.  Somebody writes it down and somebody writes it.  So compared to the translate they have.  And I need this because I don't like picking up my phone  because I get a range of phone calls and my numbers out there.  Right. And it's great because I'll get something.  Somebody's pitching me on a technology.  I forward it to my CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They set us up with a phone number for a Mac break weekly.  We've been using it.  It's always they're very accurate transcriptions, unlike Google Voice.  It's terrible. Isn't it horrible, Natalie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been called Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm surprised they got it close at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Madeline, dad, because someone calls me Nat, Cat.  Let's see what else? Yeah, every name.  But Natalie, somebody called you fat.  I mean, that was the end of it.  Yeah. Hey, fat.  And then I didn't eat for a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great game to go to your Google Voice account  and look at the text.  Let me see if I could do this without giving out anybody's phone number.  So my Leo, don't do it.  My sister, I know I can't, you know, I'm zooming in as best I can,  but there's no way I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Steve Jobs' iPhone. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My my sister calls. Hi, Maria.  OK, that's not my name, obviously.  And I think my sister knows that with even I know you're very busy.  I just want to know if you want to do fees sometime this week  or you if you think that Dan should do it.  I don't know what she's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You probably shouldn't be fusing with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm fusing with her. It's pretty funny.  I mean, some of these are just hysterical.  And yet there's enough there.  It's really a game to figure out what they're talking about.  There's enough there that you can just what I want when I'm working

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with delicate and important communications.  It's like that cell phone moment where you're in the critical moment  in the conversation with the girlfriend or boyfriend or soon to be ex  or spouse or soon to be ex spouse where the phone cuts out,  you know, and you call them back and they're even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a feature on Google Voice that I like, but confuse my wife.  No, and you can you know, you have your contacts  and you can have a different outbound message for every contact.  So I have friends, I have family.  And in the family message, it says love you.  Bye. Because it's only going to my kids and my wife.  But my wife calls, gets this message.  She says, do you tell everybody who leaves a message with you  that you love them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it takes it from that number.  So if someone else calls you from your home phone,  they're going to get that love you message. Oh, because I didn't think  any any number that it and it doesn't let you try again.  Like there are people who will call me and and they'll it'll say,  you know, at the tone, say your name and Google Voice will try and reach Natalie.  And then there's that tone and people are like, what the heck is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get a lot of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then and then you pick up and it says, will you take a call from?  What the heck is this?  And then that person's like, oh, I didn't understand it.  And then that person calls again.  They never get to do that again from that phone number.  So every time that person calls, I get a call from what the heck.  So I'll not call you from your home number because that's good.  I get the lawyer thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love you. Love you. Call me anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The big picture is that now with this product and with Gmail and with calendar,  you know, this is going to be the leverage to get you to get the one login.  And all of a sudden, all your information is on your phone.  You're done synchronizing the cloud.  Well, and it did that with a pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But of course, it does it with the Android phones.  It does with the droid. It does it with the iPhone now, too.  So, you know, when people call me on the radio show and say,  I can't get my calendar to say, I just say, put everything on Google and forget it.  Yeah. Yes. You said it.  Forget your your slave.  We're slaves to Google.  Hey, here's one for you, Mr. Jason Calacanis.  Microsoft and no Microsoft and Yahoo delay signing search deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello. Yeah, no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the endless story that we thought had an end and now doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I told you for number one, I told Dvorak this would get done.  And he was like, no, it's never going to get done.  A year and a half ago.  This has to get done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dvorak's verging on accurate at this point.  They still I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. I mean, they should for if just to shut him up, they should.  I see. Because it's not done.  It was done. That would be done.  Carol Bart's, we beg you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just shut up.  Just shut up, John. And get signed the deal.  Oh, that's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, they they sign the deal.  They rushed to do it because they wanted to.  You know, Google needed to do this.  I mean, Yahoo needed to do this because they need to save face  and get their company back on track.  I mean, their stock price has gone up actually since doing this.  And I think, you know, Carol Bart's is not a product person.  And so I think it's a mistake to put a non-product person  in charge of a company like this.  That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just love her.  I take no prisoners attitude, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do like that about her.  So, I mean, she's not a wet noodle and she has a spine and she's tough.  So hopefully that will work out for her and she can get great product people in there.  But man, did they screw up.  I mean, if you think about what they could have said, they could have.  I would. This is what I would have done if I was CEO.  And I mean, this is but it's not over for them.  I mean, no, they still have overall, you know, 400 million huge.  Look what they did within Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's AOL. Never mind. That's AOL.  But anyway, I have another glass of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, yes. Anyway, they are.  They can still do great things if they had product people.  But I mean, if you think about the moment in time a couple of years ago  when they had Katarina from Flickr and Josh from Delicious there, I mean,  they had some of the best brains in the world and they didn't  embrace them and use them to build great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they still haven't monetized either product, have they?  No. Well, I mean, and both those products are still the most loved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some of the most loved Yahoo products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no doubt. I just I'm just saying like, you know, being so angry, like,  and are they ever going to monetize these?  They've got this traffic. They have this community.  Everybody's invested. Everybody lives on it. And it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but imagine they properly motivate those two individuals.  And if you said to Katarina, like, OK, you know what you did with images?  Do it again with video. Do it again with blogs.  Yeah. Josh Schecter.  You say, Josh, just look at the search and do something huge with search  and, you know, get them involved.  And you know what? They just they had all these great assets there  and they didn't leverage it.  So maybe, you know, because she's such a strong leader  and she's got the company going the right direction  and she has the support of the board and she has a currency  that's worth a lot of money, she can go invest or buy  a lot of the great companies out there.  Go buy, dig. Go buy it.  And and let Kevin Rose work on some of these products  and make him chief product officer.  That's a good idea. Yeah.  Thing they need to do. Yeah.  And maybe she's the type of person who's not going to sit there and go,  what, we're going to put Kevin Rose in charge or whatever.  You know what?  They, you know, but that's how they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they have the cash now?  Are they in a good enough cash position they could go on a buying spree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have stock even better.  You know, you just, you know, stock and cash.  Undervalued stock.  Exactly. That stock could be worth more.  So, you know, an AOL is coming into the market.  So what you're going to see when AOL goes public in December,  January timeframe, you're going to have Yahoo, Google,  Microsoft and AOL are going to go on a buying frenzy.  And all the startups that you love now that are independent companies,  you're going to start seeing them get bought up real quick.  And Facebook will be going public in 20 months.  And when they go public and Zynga is going to go public,  you're going to see massive, massive amounts of acquisitions  and, you know, the the third age of the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dvorak says it's Sarbanes-Oxley that's keeping these companies from going public.  Is that the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is little yes, there's a little upside to going public early now  because you can get cash from other places.  Remember, people used to raise 20 million, 30 million, 40 million,  50 million, 100 million in IPO.  Well, what did Twitter just raise?  100 million. Yeah.  That's IPO level money.  I mean, once you get above 25, 30 million dollars, that's I raised 20 million  for Mahalo. You don't need to IPO now.  There's plenty of sources where you can do it.  And guess what?  You know, Bloomberg's got a company that's worth billions of dollars.  That's private. It's OK to be private.  It's OK to be illiquid.  You know, if there is M&A activity going on, the companies are worth a lot of money.  But that being said, these companies are getting too big  with too much revenue to not do it.  So Facebook and Twitter. They have to spend.  And Zynga, those three companies, Facebook, Twitter and Zynga will be public.  And they're going to be the next Yahoo, Google, you know, Microsoft's.  And I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is why do they have to go public?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because when they have that currency  stock, you can do a lot of interesting things.  You can get a lot of capital and you can acquire it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But unless the stock is freely traded, it doesn't.  It's hard to it's not currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. And so you think about employees, you know, if you have these employees  and they can't sell their stock at Facebook and they're getting tired,  you know, and they want money and you're OK, I've been at Facebook now  for three, four or five years.  And I was supposed to be able to buy a house and a car at some point.  You know, it gets a little tiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't hire. What if they just pay them well and give them good, you know,  I'm just saying, you know, never going to make it.  No, no, that'll never work. That'll never work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, Google pays extremely well, but, you know,  people were there for the stock options and the major run up when you get  you can get people to work 50 hours a week, 60 hours a week with cash.  But I thought I thought it was Microsoft.  People to work 80 hours a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once Microsoft topped out, they once Microsoft topped out,  they could no longer use, you know, options become less of an intriguing bonus  because then maybe you get a down payment on the house,  but you're not going to retire with millions in the bank.  I mean, at some point, companies are companies going to live  on the whole stock option lifestyle forever.  Are they ever going to, you know, actually take care of their employees  long term, the way, you know, adult companies do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It depends on if the value of the company is increasing.  When you have a company like Microsoft and the value of the company  is not increasing anymore or it's not increasing greatly.  That's when you have the problem.  We have a company like Facebook or Zynga or Twitter,  where the value is growing, you know, every year it doubles or triples  the value of the company.  Then people would rather get the stock and they'd rather have the chance  to hit the home run.  And, you know, people can choose.  If you're a developer right now, you can choose to be at Google or Microsoft,  a blue chip company where you could choose to be at Zynga or Twitter or Facebook  and risk the stock.  I mean, it's we live in the greatest country in the world still,  despite all the scripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not arguing that.  And you're an example of somebody who swung and made it several times.  But most people who take stock options, they end up with a pile of worthless  paper underpaid and that had helped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick and I are shining examples of that, by the way.  I just want to point out your experiences may vary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you for putting it out there.  Your experience with stock options may vary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how many times do we get hit on the head by this model?  This is it could be bust 3.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we're not going to see another bust, are we, Jason?  This that was that was a once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not like that one, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, every time I think about the bubble, there is there will be another bubble.  It just won't be in real estate or technology.  The the industries learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So you don't have the bubble in the same sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it was never will never have a tulip bubble again.  Right. And what we will have is a biotech bubble at some point.  Right. Nanotech bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Nanotech. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, I mean, what's going on with nanotech and biotech is just I mean,  this week in this week in nanotech will  we collaborate on that one?  It's a huge or green tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Green tech.  And I don't know.  There seems to be a lot of green solutions these days that have me scratching my head  that do seem like interim solutions, but people want to invest there.  Right. They want to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd love to buy a green tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'd love to I'd love to buy a nuclear power plant.  That's the solution. Yeah.  Obama is actually Obama is a big nuclear fan.  He sort of played it down during his presidential run.  And he was in Japan talking about how if France is 90 percent nuclear,  we need to look at that very seriously, which is basically this way of saying, it's on.  Yeah. We're going to build nuclear power plants in this country.  And there's like a good number of them that are under application review right now.  And we haven't built a new one since 1976 or 1977.  No, it's time. And it's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trust me. I'm coming around because I wasn't a big fan, but I'm coming around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Listen, put it in my backyard. It's fine with me.  Yeah, it's better than coal.  These things are much safer now.  And it's much safer than having a bunch of terrorists in the Middle East  want to kill you and sending them bucket loads of money to, you know, hate you.  Trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook's privacy policy went public on a Thursday for your review and comment,  not merely public, but your chance to say what you think.  The statements of rights and responsibilities.  And they say we're avoiding legal jargon that most sites typically put in their  terms of service. It articulates our mutual relationship and shared obligations.  We're doing the same with our privacy policy.  It is in simple English. You can read it.  Things like when you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior  version for a reasonable period of time.  Your content may be viewable in cached or archived pages if they've done so.  But access and control over most personal information is readily available through  the profile editing tools. I mean, this is plain English.  Natalie, you read it.  What do you think? Is this what they needed to do?  I think so. I've had this argument on Buzz Out Loud with Brian Cooley before that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ULAs need to become more user friendly because he thinks we just all should assume  that no one reads the ULA.  They don't.  And that's OK.  And that if we violate it, we can plead that we didn't really read it.  And I don't think that that's the case.  I think that we should bring it into the vernacular of everyday use and allow  other people to opine on it in order that we can really then be expected to uphold  what we are clicking in agreement of.  This is an example of a company learning and learning fast because remember, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  made those changes kind of unilaterally and people screamed and Mark Zuckerberg had  to pull it back.  And now they're coming back again with new policies and this time saying we want  your comments ahead of time.  Seems like they learned their lesson, Jason.  It's a smart PR move.  I mean, if you screw up like three or four times, you're going to get a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, if you screw up like three or four times listening to your customers the next  time around, it's not a bad idea.  Not a bad idea.  Whoever's running the PR there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good on you. But you say it's PR, not it's not substantive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody cares about privacy.  I mean, that's the sad part, at least not in this country.  And the intelligence, the intelligence or care, but they are not allowed enough  voice. And in Europe, you have great oversight.  So they do things like your phone bill gets deleted or you can say, I don't want my  phone records kept.  You can opt out of these things in other countries because they have very  intelligent people who are able to pass regulation as opposed to companies which  have bought and sold our, you know, governance like we do here in this country.  Of course, their businesses run smaller and slower and ours run bigger and faster  and they take more advantage of us.  So you can pick your poison.  But nobody cares.  And nobody, the only time people will care is when their privacy is compromised.  And it happens so infrequently that people don't care.  I mean, if you if 10 years ago I told you the level of oversharing going on on  Twitter and Facebook right now, you would not believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So you've got Josh Harris living in your pool, a pool house.  You know, you know what it's like.  Exactly. Exactly.  Yeah. So I want to ask you if people care about net neutrality.  I'm going to talk about two new bills.  There's one in the House and one in the Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Internet Freedom Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's free nothing.  Yeah. Except, except Comcast to do what it wants.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  Before we do, I want to remind everybody to back up.  And when you back up, you got to do it right.  You got to back up off site.  It's not enough just to have a hard drive sitting next to your computer that you  back up onto. That's a good start.  I'm glad you're doing that.  But what happens if the worst happens?  If fire, flood, tornado, earthquake, or the bad guys come and take everything.  That's what happened to Francis Ford Coppola.  He's living in Argentina.  He's backed up 20 years of scripts and materials.  He's smart. He says, I'm backing up.  I got the external hard drive right here.  What happens? The guys break into his house and steal the backups along with a  computer and he's lost 20 years of scripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Godfather 4 not happening.  Oh, there's a relief.  I think it's not all bad.  Of course, the hip. It's starting 50 cent.  The hip hop version. Not all bad.  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, what if there was a service where you could back up your computer  off site? I mean, but that would be too expensive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Or, you know, an automatically do it so you didn't have to think about it.  You just install it.  What if you could go to somewhere like, I don't know,  carbonite dot com and use the offer code Tweet and try it for free?  Yeah, that'd be so cool.  Yeah, you try it for free and it would just, you know, like automatically would  find your photos, your emails, your financial documents, your music,  all the stuff that you've been working so hard to collate and put together  your lifetime on the hard drive and just back it up.  You know, just start saying, no problem. I got it.  And from now on, it's backing it up to the Internet.  It's encrypting it on your drive, encrypting it as it goes.  So it's private. It's up there on the Internet.  You can log on to any computer, anywhere to your carbonite account and get the file.  What if what if there was such a thing as that?  And what if you wouldn't have to worry about how much stuff you had  because it was unlimited backup for less than five dollars a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would be something that would cost a thousand dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So good. No, no, no. How about five dollars?  How about how about I better than five?  How about fifty four ninety five a year?  How about that? How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, a hard drive, external hard drive costs like two or three hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cheaper than that.  Now, I got to say, you can't.  It's not every drive on your network.  It's not 100 different external drives. It's the drive in your computer.  It's great for a laptop, by the way. Laptops are the first to go.  Six. This I can't believe this, but this is this is from Harris Interactive Survey.  No, I'm sorry. This is from USA Today.  Six hundred thousand laptops are reported lost or stolen at US airports every year.  That's ten thousand laptops a week.  Geez. Lost or stolen.  Most of those are never found again.  That's from the Ponymon Institute in Computer World.  Three percent are recovered, according to the FBI.  So that's you know, these guys, if they'd been using carbonite, they wouldn't.  No, no sweat. So I want you to try it.  Look, we talk about backup.  Everybody believes in backup. Everybody plays lip service to it.  But sometimes it's just too hard to remember, too complicated.  It costs too much. This is why I just want you to try carbonite.  Try it free for two weeks.  Use my coupon code TWIT and you'll get it free for two.  You get two free months when you sign up to buy.  That's a good deal.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E carbonite dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's backup done right for five bucks a month.  Less than less than.  I mean, because I'm just thinking about something  about a third of the Twitter listeners are probably suffering from anxiety  and depression related to, yes, losing data.  Yes. And it's a lot more expensive to get yourself an anxiety slash  and I depressed and drug.  It's the sort of Damocles hanging over their head.  It is. Do you ever have that fear like at the middle of the night,  like, oh, my God, I left my laptop in my car.  I wonder if it's stolen. I lost everything.  You know, or what if I did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had my camera in my laptop in my car and I left it at work and I walked home  and and I walked back to work to get it because I said I can't leave.  I literally in the middle of the night.  I can't enjoy life.  I can't enjoy life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And with carbonite, you can.  Yeah. It frees you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much would you pay to enjoy life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, five dollars a month.  You get a lot of enjoyment out of your life.  Less depression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Getting a little sick. He's good, isn't he?  He's good. It's good.  I agree. I should be a pitch man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. I like to entertain myself, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, great. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Make the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always laugh because like I always talk about, you know, off  basically backing up out of the house and people like, you're such a pessimist.  Like I live in San Francisco.  I have family have been burned out of two homes.  I've had my truck broken into and everything stolen.  It's like one backup is one backup.  You know, one back moving back off site is a hell of a lot more reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What about all the zombies in?  Oh, yeah. I mean, I was driving around down there at like 12 o'clock  at night after death crunch.  And it was like night of the living dead.  There were hundreds of homeless people, drunk people, hipsters.  I couldn't tell the hipsters from the homeless.  And they're walking around like brains, laptops, you know,  just walking through the street.  And everybody I know who lives in San Francisco has had their apartment robbed.  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Natalie, you split your time between New York and San Francisco, right?  Or you spend more time in New York?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I spend about a week a month or every other.  Which is worse here?  Worse in terms of crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like zombies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where the more zombies are definitely on the New York City subway.  Although I did usually when I rode, you need to think that I was going to get bird flu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's something there's people with birds actually on the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true. Yeah.  You need a lot weirder than the subway.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The subway in New York City functions.  Muni is a really interesting.  It's not a good way to get around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw a man with his whole head  wrapped in duct tape with only slits for his eyes on Muni.  I've never seen that on the subway.  Although I did see a guy playing with the box cutters on the subway recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you also I mean, you also missed a lot of the great days  in the New York subway before Giuliani got a ton more cops  and made them get out of their cars.  And I know Jason is where their duct tape people then.  I've actually I've seen drug use in the New York City subways,  people having open fires in the New York City subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It gets cold in there. Come on.  The disco bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've seen people smoke crack on a subway car.  Yeah, I've walked into that.  I mean, there were times you would walk on a subway car in Manhattan,  literally walk into the car and it smelled so bad you'd walk out.  This is during rush hour.  There'd be a car with like three people in it.  There's nobody in it. Yeah.  And nobody in it.  And then the other cars would be packed because the homeless people  would smell so bad and they would have, you know, in the car.  And it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I will say, I think technology changes the way we ride  public transportation because it used to be a dude with a boom box.  And then that was what everyone was listening to.  But now everyone on the subway is so heads down.  We all have some kind of MP3 or media player, you know, no eye contact, whatever.  So no one's really motivated to be weird to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes it hard to do flash mobs.  You know, I saw that there was that video of the twins.  Remember the mirror on the subway and nobody notices.  You have to go, you notice they're the same on both sides.  Yeah, yeah, whatever. Yeah, I'm tweeting.  I'm sorry. Don't interrupt me. I'm tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can get data from this Motorola Droid in the subway, which really is amazing  because Verizon, every New Yorker agrees that Verizon has the best coverage.  Oh, yeah. They must have antennas in the tunnels. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. No, they don't.  I mean, why hasn't that occurred yet?  Why don't they have antennas in every subway?  Can't they get that sponsored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want anyone talking on the phone next to me in the subway.  I give them a dirty look, but maybe that's the reason.  I don't think anyone really talks that much anyway.  No, who talks? We text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. You can't get data all the time in the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can or you can't?  He says you can't.  No, you can't. But why not?  We should be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why don't they put free Wi-Fi in the entire subway and sponsor it?  Google is somebody from Google listening to the show.  There's something you could do with all that money.  You know, you can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've released the Apple iPhone in China and the Chinese are so paranoid  that they won't let them put a Wi-Fi on the iPhone.  They're scared of Wi-Fi for some reason. Absolutely.  If you give people Wi-Fi, then they can actually be reporting.  You think? Do you think?  So, oh, I get it. So they're more.  But the 3G lets them do that, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's because they can't on a Wi-Fi network listen in as easily.  Because if you're on, they probably have tapped all of the regular phone networks.  They own the phone company.  Right. So, I mean, that's they've got everything on lockdown.  But on a Wi-Fi network, maybe it's encrypted.  And don't they have their own Wi-Fi standard there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want us using that standard.  China likes to have their own broadband standards in general.  I use Wi-Fi. Is it Wi-Fi or is it 3G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've used Wi-Fi over there, too.  But that might just be the hotels.  They don't they don't have the same kind of penetration of hotspots  in China for some reason.  But I suspect I think you're right, Jason.  I think it's because they can't control it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it has something to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every Internet service provider in China is licensed by the government  and they yank your they can like yank your license.  They can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They can also route this.  This is in the early days.  I don't know if this is still going on, but there were I had a VC tell me  they had made an investment there.  This is, I don't know, seven, eight years ago.  And there was a competitor.  And in some region of the country, they were redirecting the traffic  from one website on like an IP DNS basis to another website  that was competitive because somebody in the military son  owned a different competitive gaming company.  So like, you know, you would be putting in like, I want to play World of Warcraft.  And you're like, no, you don't. You'd like to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  That wasn't the game you were looking for.  No.  So now both the Senate and the House have bills that would block the FCC  from net neutrality rules.  Senator McCain has a bill and now Representative  Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee has introduced the.  The real stimulus act of 2009 that she caused it,  it should prohibit the FCC from, quote, needlessly imposing  regulations on the Internet. It sounds so good.  It sounds like it sounds so sensible.  We don't want the government regulating the Internet.  The Internet is new. It's it's entrepreneurial.  It's innovative. And government regulation would just slow that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the government telling the government not to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what the FCC works by what the legislator legislatures  tell, set layers, tell it.  The bill says the FCC cannot, quote, propose, promulgate or issue  any regulations regarding the Internet or IP enabled services.  This is a companion bill to McCain's  inaptly named Internet Freedom Act.  Now, Jason, I want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lately named it's that's pure politics.  That is absolute magnificent politics by a lifetime scrapper.  Who is the number one recipient of money from telcos over nine hundred  thousand dollars, followed by majority leader Harry Reed  with something like three hundred and forty one thousand dollars.  And money is received.  This is this is pure double speak at its finest.  And it pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a really good video and I put it up on my tumble.  No, I'm with you.  If you go to Freeform's video channel, they've made a video.  Larry Lessig's on this saying a lot of money is coming to Washington, D.C.  to keep to basically shut down the open Internet.  And, you know, the real problem is that net neutrality is such a bad description  for what this is. I understand from a technical point of view  why they call it net neutrality.  But what we're really saying is companies should not be allowed  to discriminate about the traffic that's going out on the internet  for their business, for their petty business reasons.  The Internet was designed to be agnostic about all traffic,  to treat all bits as equal.  And no company should be allowed.  No Internet service provider should be allowed in any way to impinge on that.  This video, I'm going to play a little a little section of it for you  because I found it very moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Spare time using completely free technology.  This is the founder of Kiva.  Every 18 seconds on the website, our user base of three hundred  fifty thousand people has lent out about forty three million dollars  to about sixty thousand borrowers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We feel fine automatically runs every three or four minutes.  And it's been running for about four years now, having collected about  eleven million feelings and all now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So one of the things we did is we made a video that showed a simulated election  and showed us stealing that simulated election.  And we took that video and we put it on our website  and we let people put it up on YouTube.  Within a few days, about half a million people had viewed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Twenty thousand people coming to talk about a piece of legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Fifteen million low income individuals have used the Be High website  to find information and to and to help their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I sent it to 17 people and within a few days,  over a million people were coming to it a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  When I told people the idea, no one thought it was funny.  Adam the K.  If you were pitching that at a network, they would have said no.  There's no way to do it.  It's the second most viewed video in Internet history.  It's approaching 60 million hits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the time our next record came out,  a video of us dancing in our backyard had been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times  before the label could even figure out what single to choose.  There's been hundreds of remakes of our videos by our fans.  And I suspect they're mostly trying to impress each other.  I think that like what they really want to do is stand out in the community of weirdos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was a global phenomenon within 18 months of that decision to build the software.  It had enormous reach.  Talk about Skype.  The Internet was an open place and they could get on the Internet and distribute Skype globally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some applications that it never would have occurred to me to think about in the course of designing.  It's the father of the Internet.  In fact, we're careful in this design to be application agnostic.  The Internet has no idea what's being transported on it.  It doesn't know if it's voice or video or a piece of a web page or part of an email.  And incredibly, that means the network is completely open to every conceivable application that you can invent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Some people call that net neutrality, which is that the architecture is neutral as to whether or not I'm moving giant databases about science or movies.  But I like to think of it more in terms of my rights as an Internet user, which is that I should have a right as an Internet user to have access to a neutral architecture that lets me innovate with no more restriction than fulfilling the technical protocols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Openness means.  We're sitting here.  I mean, doing this on the open Internet, even though a company like Comcast might want to block it because it hurts their business of selling television content, we use Skype instead of telephony, even though that might put a pack bell or AT&T out of business because we're not using their service, we're just using their bits.  What we do base is based on the open Internet.  I know Jason Calacanis.  You must feel the same way.  You wouldn't be here without an open Internet either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's I mean, are you going to trust your future to Verizon or Comcast?  I mean, you're going to trust those guys?  I'm not. I don't think they'll do the right thing.  I think they're going to do what's in the right thing.  That's for their shareholders and for their CEOs to make a lot of money.  And the Internet's been the greatest force for good and for sharing of information and democracy forever.  It's just insane that we're even having this discussion.  And I hope that people are not complacent about this.  This is one of those things where it's very easy to get complacent about it.  And I think what we might be faced with is that I think we might lose the open Internet and then we're going to all have to fight.  And it's going to be a lot harder to fight to fix this than it would be to prevent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T is telling its employees, contact your member of Congress and tell them you support these bills.  This is a big fight.  There's a lot of money.  If you believe in the open Internet, and I think if you listen to this show, I think you must believe in the open Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We ask you to believe in the open Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wouldn't be here without it.  I got to ask you to write your member of Congress and say, please, you know, support, throw these bills out and support the FCC's regulations for net neutrality.  It is absolutely vital.  This is something you may not care about privacy, but you got to care about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we care about innovation as well.  There was a recent study that I was reading in Europe that when there's more regulation of anything like this, then innovation goes down significantly.  And these are the web tools that we live and breathe every single day that would go away if people are not thinking in terms of an open filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, just one day you might wake up and it's like, you know what, I was going to call my mom on Skype, but she's on Verizon.  I'm on Comcast and they want a fee and I can't use Skype or Google Voice is this great product.  You know, Gmail now doesn't work with Yahoo Mail.  If you want to be on Yahoo, I mean, we just set us back 15 years.  It's just unbelievable.  And I mean, just shame on these companies, really, to the people of Verizon and AT&T and Comcast and the people who work there.  Don't send those letters on behalf of your employers and inside of your companies.  I know it's a risky thing to do, but for the leadership.  Gosh, how do you sleep at night knowing that you want to take something that's been so valuable to so many?  You don't need to corrupt this.  I mean, you're making enough money already.  Last time I saw Comcast, Verizon and AT&T are crushing it.  I mean, how much more money do you DBs need to make?  F you guys.  Yeah.  Grady bastards.  Really?  I mean, what do you think about that?  No, seriously, these Grady mother-  Isn't this cool?  ...Efforts are going to now start like, oh, by the way, yeah, which level of internet service did you want?  Oh, do you, oh, you haven't subscribed to the Voice over IP channel.  We'll get you HBO, NVOIP and-  Oh, if you're like, there's an extra fee for gaming packets and oh, you're a level 57.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to use peer to peer?  Oh, that's an extra $35.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's going to be an extra $19.95 a month.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Comcast is actually trying to overturn the FCC regulation that forbid them from doing that deep packet inspection and turning off BitTorrent saying, oh, they exceeded their authority.  They aren't allowed to do that.  That was an illegal decision.  We'd like to keep doing it.  If people have the notion that somehow these companies are not going to assert their commercial rights and cut this stuff off, you're not paying attention.  You're not paying attention.  They want to do this.  They're working hard to do it.  They're lobbying very hard right now in Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at Apple with the iPhone, locking it to one neck and at work.  I mean, Apple's like, everybody loves Apple, great company.  I mean, they'll do whatever they have to do to make more money.  These other companies, Verizon, Comcast, I mean, these guys are gangsters.  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess we've said it.  So a little advocacy from all of us on Twitter, you know, write your member.  I don't think I last night cool enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want me to start throwing things?  This is a time to lose your cool.  Start crying, Natalie.  Okay.  Do you want me to cry?  I can cry on demand.  Don't make Natalie cry.  Write to Congress.  It's not fair.  I'll cry if I have to.  Well, Fred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, that's a bumper sticker.  Don't make Natalie cry.  Vote against the Internet Freedom Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to see that on Zazzle.  It really is 1984 language, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Internet Freedom Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's brilliant.  I mean, it's like the pay.  How can you vote against the Internet Freedom Act?  You get killed.  It's like voting against the Patriot Act.  I mean, it's just.  And how is John McCain.  It's so scumbaggy.  That's the problem.  It's the Internet.  Large ISPs rights to take you any way they can act.  That's what this is all about.  This is about AT&T wanting you to be able to restrict VoIP access.  It's about Comcast wanting to rake it in on on on crushing P2P  and other traffic they find annoying like video traffic.  And what it comes down to is that in many cases, they don't deliver the level of service  they want or they feel they are incapable of delivering the level of service  the customers think they have paid for.  You know, you've got 16 megabits,  except we only want to give it to you when you're downloading one web page at a time.  Not for video, not for software downloads, certainly not for peer to peer.  You know, and you look at what's going on and it's really depressing.  I mean, how much money is AT&T spending on technical economists?  I love that name.  Well, if people actually really want to have this level of service 24 7 for downloads,  it would they would need the equivalent of a corporate account.  And that's a four hundred dollar a month fee.  We can't afford to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a place you can go save the Internet dot com.  They are they've been around for a long time.  For, you know, fighting for net neutrality.  If you want to read more, find out what's going on.  They'll help you contact your member of Congress.  You can fan them on Facebook.  You can use them on Twitter.  You could tell your story.  And and I think this is the best way to to get active.  Save the Internet dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And tweet that.  And to John McCain, who fought for freedom and people's ability  to have democracy, shame on you.  Like, what did you go fight for if you're now going to be such a,  you know, in the pocket of these billionaire  DBs, you know, like really, you fought for freedom and the  the network that's providing so much freedom around the globe.  You want to start limiting.  Really? Look, take a deep, long look in the mirror.  Why did you fight and why were you in a POW camp?  And now you're going to come back to the United States and for nine  hundred thousand dollars, you're going to be bought and sold  like a commodity. You're so disappointed in John McCain.  I'm so glad I didn't vote for him. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there that's a good way to end this one. I think  I think while you're listening to the show, go to save the Internet dot com.  Natalie Delconte, thank you so much for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's I've had some pretty hardcore network guys that work with the hotels down there.  And the routing is difficult and the routing on the show floor is miserable at best,  even if you pay a lot of money for a guaranteed rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
