And actually the recruit, we'll talk a little more about the  recruitment later in the show, but this is a time for anybody who works for a tech company  in Silicon Valley to put a little time into making the government work better for everyone.  And I know with some, at least in Silicon Valley, the current administration is not beloved,  but that doesn't mean the government doesn't have to continue to do the job, get it done.  In fact, all the more so. So this is I'm really glad to have you out here.

And I, in fact, when we were talking about Ant, because Ant's a great photographer and  a great tech writer and he'd been on our shows too, I said the same thing. I said,  he'll never leave North Carolina, but it turns out he's very happy to leave and take his family with  him to get out of North Carolina.

Transcript:  Did you know that Amazon has a team of tweeters to defend? Actually, this makes sense. I bet  you more than Amazon does this, but we've only now learned about Amazon's special social media team.  They, they jump into action whenever somebody says, oh, the Amazon warehouse,  it's a horrible place to work. They've hired a team of warehouse workers to come in and say,  no, no, no. But Business Insider's article this week, Amazon's army of tweeting warehouse workers  backfired spectacularly this week after a thread about working conditions went viral.  Last year, Amazon enlisted a team of employees to write positive comments. They call them the  FC fulfillment center ambassadors. But once it was discovered,  it became kind of a liability. It started with a Twitter thread earlier this week.  Diana Wild responded incredulous incredulously to the Amazon news account, inviting followers  to tour a fulfillment center and see what our warehouses are really, really like.  She tweeted, not that anything on Twitter ever, you know, can be taken as fact, but really like  because your workers are liars, you're not going to convince the working class that everything is  fine by telling us where to avert our eyes. We already know what it's like. Why don't you really  treat workers better? You can afford it. And then the FC ambassadors leapt into action. Everything's  fine. I don't think there's anything wrong with the money I make or the way I'm treated at work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Start time: 496.22
End time: 509.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then other Twitter users began to mock them. And well, it's the Twitter garbage fire  all over again. I don't even know why I brought it up,  except that you like this story, Owen. Why did you like this story?

Start time: 510.48
End time: 637.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love this story because Amazon is the new devil in America business. You need Amazon. We love  Amazon. They're destroying companies left and right. Their shipping programs they have right  now are sad. It sounds sad to say for UPS, they're crushing UPS. They're crushing the post office.  They're whittling down prices and no one can do anything about it because you can't say no. You  just have to say yes to what they're doing to you. And so isn't that, isn't that a bad thing?  Isn't that kind of the definition of monopoly? So it's, it's, it's a very bad thing as, as they,  play the game to crush the postal system and UPS all the while having people go buy your own truck  and deliver for us and we're going to pay you nothing and you're not going to be unionized.  And if we want to cut you off, we cut you off and all the things that they're doing,  phenomenal business, the mindset and the capitalism. I love it. Okay, great. But the human  being side of it, like instead of hiring an army full of people to tweet in a warehouse,  how about you just set up an algorithm where you randomly give every employee  one free hours paid work or one day off out of the month paid or something stupid like that,  where everybody feels like they're in the lottery and they're going to, oh, I got paid day off.  That's something to make people happy. This thing that you're trying to do does nothing for you  because everybody knows that you basically work for a slave ship when you're at Amazon. Now it's  not slavery because you're working and you're getting paid and you chose that job. You chose  that job. When I go get it, when I go get a pedicure, I feel bad for the lady doing it.  I think to myself, but that didn't stop you from getting your toenails painted bright orange.  I thought to myself, she chose this life. It's not my fault, but at the same time  has nothing to do with the Vietnam War. Amazon has the power to fix things in a way that's real  and they choose not to because of profit margins and money. And I mean, how much money do you really  need at the end of the day? If you're keeping score, that's now three politically incorrect things  I've said in the first 15 minutes. I'm trying to save you by talking over you.  Drinking game out of this?  Alcohol poisoning by the end of the show. I've decided that I'm going to play the role of

Start time: 637.24
End time: 647.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  capitalist. I'll be like Mr. Moneybags with the white mustache here today for crying out loud.  And they chose that work. No one's forcing them to show up every day.

Start time: 648.34
End time: 655.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, you get a 15 minute break and guess what? It takes you eight minutes to get to the bathroom  when you're in the warehouse. And by the time you get back, you're two minutes late, you get docked

Start time: 655.68
End time: 719.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for it. Well, that's what happened on Twitter was people started making up fake ambassador  tweets. Oh, of course they did. Like this one. This is from Jose, Amazon FC ambassador. Hi,  I'm Kyle. I work at an Amazon fulfillment center and I love it. We don't get pee breaks. So I've  gotten used to using diapers and my God, they're so comfortable. Also I have grandkids even though  I have the profile pic of a 20 year old and on and on and on. And that's actually, that is,  I have to say the best way for Twitter to deal with this kind of stuff with is with humor.  Skewer. Yeah, absolutely. Little satire never hurt anything. It's always good.  It's a good way to bite back. Yeah. Anyway, I would guess I'd be shocked in fact,  if most companies don't have an army of people. We have a social media team putting out stuff.  They do not respond to criticism though. I don't have them seeking out people saying bad things  and responding to that. They mostly just tweet out here's what's going on today at the show,

Start time: 719.54
End time: 733.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right? It's different. That's just beyond PR. I couldn't believe that Mary Hanbury who wrote  this up for business insider just left on the table, the opportunity to coin the term warehouse

Start time: 733.62
End time: 742.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  washing. Oh, credit Denise Howell warehouse washing. I like it. Well, and I've heard of a

Start time: 742.64
End time: 757.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  few folks on Twitter who were like, Oh, well, Amazon offered to let me tour their fulfillment  center and it did defuse the anger. But then as soon as people realize that everybody's getting  that cookie cutter approach, that's just going to backfire again. So I think that's the first

Start time: 757.64
End time: 772.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lesson any company learns about Twitter is it has to be authentic. Yeah, you can't fake that.  If it's if it's BS, people see through that so fast. They know they're being manipulated or  tempted to manipulate unless you're a Russian troll factory and then nobody sees through it at

Start time: 773.54
End time: 789.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  all. And at the end of the day, I mean, I don't know if you guys actually know people that work  in the warehouses, but I know people that work in a Philadelphia warehouse and the South Jersey  warehouse and their experiences of anger, frustration and semi torture. I love what you're

Start time: 813.04
End time: 821.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what happened. He's pushing the button, pushing the button.  Go ahead. Oh, to have friends who work there. Yeah. Yeah. Two people in two different states

Start time: 821.98
End time: 830.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  have the same type of horror stories about the work and environment. So that's to me systemic.  These two people don't know each other. They work in two different states and to be fair,

Start time: 830.94
End time: 835.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the system operates. They don't quit because that's the best job they can get in that area.

Start time: 836.42
End time: 844.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they so here's the thing. There's a puppy mill there. People quit every day,  but at the same time, there's always somebody who needs a job. So why don't your friends quit?

Start time: 846.22
End time: 850.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have quit. Oh, they were talking about their experience when they were there. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Start time: 851.36
End time: 854.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They have quit and one went back and then quit again.

Start time: 856.80
End time: 873.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was in high school, I worked at McDonald's. Not the best job ever cleaning the fry trap,  but a job and I was working and I learned actually a pretty good work ethic there.  I value that work I had, but I guess it wasn't as bad as working in an Amazon warehouse.

Start time: 875.06
End time: 920.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I worked in warehouses when I was younger and I didn't have half the experiences that these  people tell me they had. I used to work at. So it is bad. It's bad. When you get to a higher  up level, it's like your program to treat everyone below you the same way like they're nothing.  So the crab boxes to try and get up to a level where you get to tell everybody else what to do  and not have a heart and then you continue to do it. So even when you were at the bottom and  you got treated that way, once you get up to this level, it seems like you're just predestined to  keep the system going with not any understanding. It's a machine. Like I said, capitalism, I get it.  You don't have to work there. You can quit. But I mean, for as big as they are and as much money  as they make and it's how happy they try to make the customer, they could make their employees a

Start time: 927.94
End time: 938.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I feel like this isn't a job for high schoolers just paying their dues. These are full  time career oriented adults. Should I not shop at Amazon though?

Start time: 939.40
End time: 941.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You can't not shop at Amazon. Same thing about Walmart.

Start time: 942.78
End time: 946.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause that's the option. I'll go to jet.com, which is Walmart. Is that better?

Start time: 948.34
End time: 967.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Probably. It's all the same. Walmart used to specifically not give people full time jobs  just so they could keep them subsidized and getting welfare handouts and stuff from the  government and tell the government it's like, oh, well, we're not going to give you as many  subsidies anymore. So I mean, again, capitalism at its best, everybody's got a scam. If you've  got to work and you're on the lower totem pole, you got to do what you got to do.

Start time: 968.38
End time: 989.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to your local market, your local bookstore. Oh, you don't have one anymore. I'm sorry.  We do. We're lucky. We have an independent bookstore here. But, and I feel guilty because  I still buy books on Amazon. I occasionally, I will go in there and buy books, but the copper  fields, but Amazon's so much more convenient. I should probably put my dollar where my mouth is.

Start time: 990.34
End time: 1005.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You should. You could do it. You can make the effort. You can wait a couple of days for a book.  That's the problem. I can get it tomorrow from Amazon.  I know. I know. Especially out there, you guys get stuff next day, same day.  Out here, we're still in the two day hold period. We don't have that Insta stuff right here.

Start time: 1005.54
End time: 1014.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, almost everything's next day now here. God, sometimes it's same day.  Sometimes, that's how they get you. Yeah, you're in the LA area. So the more metro you are,

Start time: 1014.76
End time: 1019.86

And I went to the, we got a call in the radio show. I said, what should I do? And I said,  well, there's this thing called Gmail. It goes out once in a while, but not for days.  And then I had to play this video. This is Telus.com. This is their apology

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 1071.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1122.84
End time: 1142.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We're sorry. But on the other hand, they can make a really well-produced video  in the time it takes to reboot their servers. And also that person is not good at reading off  the teleprompter. Does anybody else get annoyed when you can literally see their eyes scanning?  Like, just be authentic. Just be like, can we mess up? I'm sorry.

Your email's down. Your email's down. My phone's blowing up.  Boss is threatening to fire me. The engineers have put themselves in the hallway. They're crying in  a fetal position.

Transcript:  Yeah, I like it. I like it. Okay, I did two silly stories to begin. Let's take a break.  I know, you know, one of the things that we hear from our audience all the time is  that these shows go on so long, they starve to death during the show. So as a public service  announcement, I'd like to introduce you to DoorDash. There's no reason you should be stuck  watching a long podcast and not have some pizza or a Subway sandwich or maybe some lovely cheesecake  from the Cheesecake Factory. DoorDash puts some of the best restaurants in your town  on your phone so you can order and get the food delivered right to you. All the big  favorite chains like Chipotle and Wendy's and Cheesecake Factory, the Subway, but also  over 340,000 other amazing restaurants just in your area. DoorDash is now in 3,300 cities,  all 50 states in Canada. When Ant brought his family out here, his teenage son, Isaiah,  we took him out to eat and he looked in on the door. Of course, there's a sticker that says  DoorDash and he said, Dad, they have DoorDash here too. Yes, they do. They have DoorDash  everywhere. DoorDash is awesome. Get it on your phone. You never know when you're going to be  stuck at the office or starving at school or just a long day of work and you don't want to cook or  stuck listening to an extraordinarily long podcast. Treat yourself to the meal you deserve on demand  from your favorite restaurant. Restaurants come to you with DoorDash and I love our dashers.  Always be nice to your dasher. They're great people. Right now, our listeners can get $5 off  their first order of $15 or more. When you download the DoorDash app, put it on Android or iOS  and then offer code TWIT. $5 off, get a little something, get an extra something, some extra  chips and guacamole on your first order. When you download the DoorDash app from the app store and  enter promo code TWIT, promo code T-W-I-T. I'm tempted. I want to maybe order some DoorDash  for our studio audience today. They have a lean and hungry look. I'm so excited. I now have  permission to answer the doorbell during these shows. You may go get the door anytime, Denise,  for any reason at all. Actually, you mentioned that Amazon's crushing UPS, but actually,  didn't they find the final deal with FedEx died? There's no more FedEx ground. FedEx Air was  stopped a few months ago because Amazon's just basically doing it themselves. They bought planes  or leased planes. They don't buy planes. They have trucks now and vans and even people in  1986 El Camino's delivering packages for them. You never know. It's kind of getting to the point

This guy's a 16-year-old kid and he did something that made every parent  in America sigh, which is he won $3 million in a Fortnite competition, which meant that every  teenage kid has been telling their folks, oh no, really, I'm going to make a living at this.  Now they go, see? See? And every parent's going, oh my God. Does your kid play Fortnite yet, Denise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  think. So we're going to get into this story, but the one thing about that hole,  the kid won $3 million. Tennis players don't make that much money to win a tournament. Golf  players don't make that much money to win a tournament. This kid made that much money.  And the thing about that whole tournament that I didn't really care, if that's the thing,  you make money at it, God bless you. Great, this is America. But the one kid, he got sixth place  and he was uncontrollably shaking and crying in his father's arms because he got sixth place.  And his dad's just holding him and he's literally just shaking. They're both crying.  And guess how much money they made? They made $900,000.  What?  He would throw my daughter on the floor and be like, get up, we just made $900,000.  What?  Sixth place is great. I'm usually first, second, third place.  That's almost a million.  Sixth place? I'm like, stop crying. Daddy, we're good, son. Son, you are the best son, any son.

Start time: 1622.78
End time: 1753.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this poor kid, I'm not going to say his name, but according to Kotaku,  he was streaming a Fortnite game Sunday. People were watching the stream and he abruptly left  his desk just like Denise Howell when the DoorDash guy comes. And his father was coming to tell him  that armed police were at the front door. This is a big problem on Twitch and other streaming services  where they swat you. It's terrible. And as we know, swatting is risky. People can die.  Not to mention the fact that it pulls law enforcement off of real crimes.  And it's expensive. That was definitely a new one he could be heard saying on the stream.  I got swatted. I was lucky because the one officer lives in our neighborhood.  We got swatted once at the brick house. And fortunately, the pedal of the police are kind  of lackadaisical. So a couple of detectives came and said, is everything all right? Yeah,  we're going to get some dogs just to search just in case. But you know, we figured it was bogus.  I shouldn't have said that out loud. He had appeared on The Tonight Show to talk with  Jimmy Fallon about his win. So he's very public. And of course, you know, this is the problem.  I think gamer culture is a little toxic. There's a whole section in today's Sunday Times about  Gamergate. Today is the fifth anniversary of the beginning of Gamergate. Brianna Wu has a piece in  it about how it's not getting any better. They talk about the initial, you know, the Zoe Quinn,  who had left. This is how it all started. Zoe Quinn had a bad breakup. And her 20 something  boyfriend wrote a 10,000 words screed against her. Five years ago, a series of vile events  changed the way we fight online. Actually, they did this interesting. They did a one of the Times  does these animated editorials online. But poor Zoe Quinn never went home. She was visiting friends  in San Francisco. She just she didn't even go back to her home. And Charlie Wartzels, who's been  doing some great work, I think, for the New York Times. This is technically an opinion piece,  but it is a history of Gamergate. And it does feel like this community is a little bit toxic.

Start time: 1755.56
End time: 1814.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I'll also say, OK, good. I'm sorry. No, you go and then I will.  It's not even just the gamer community. I just got done talking to my daughter about a girl who does  tutorial videos and a guy asked her out. She said, no, thank you. And then she ended up getting  killed by this person who ended up stalking her, finding her and killing her via the internet.  So it's so bad when you're out there publicly putting yourself out there like there needs to  be something where like if a doctor was my name, maybe you should just stop giving out real names  or something, because the more you're online, it only takes one crazy person or one jealous person  to destroy your life. Like you said, luckily, no one was hurt in this instance. But it's not  even just video games. It's just being online and being popular and either desirable in some form or  fashion. It's really creepy right now what's going on with the internet. We need to figure out a way

Start time: 1814.58
End time: 1872.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to fix it. I don't know how you do it. I agree. I mean, there's always been a little bit of this  in the world. They call it prairie dogging. If you stick your head up, if you become known, people  tend to want to cut it off. There's always been a little bit of that world. But I think part of the  problem is that it's Twitter, especially, but 8chan and 4chan and Reddit kind of become a big  lever, a big megaphone that can really hype this up much more than just somebody being mean at work.  Oh, you want three million dollars. Good for you. That can really escalate to something much, much,  much worse. And so I kind of blame social media. But on the other hand, what are you going to do?  Can Facebook, Twitter control it? 8chan is pretty much shut down, but that didn't mean that  0hn wasn't started and take it up right immediately the same way. It's kind of the nature of the world

Start time: 1872.98
End time: 1900.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we live in. So what I was thinking is certainly the behavior is something that can't be tolerated. And  as our doctor was saying, needs to be addressed one way or another. And it's a hard nut to crack. But  from a tech policy and privacy standpoint, another thing we probably could come at is the fact that  traditionally property ownership records are public. That's the problem. Yeah. Oh, doctor can

Start time: 1900.30
End time: 1909.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  be oh, doctor, but how long before he's doxed? Oh, well, I live on a black site. No one can  actually find my address, but that's just me. But if you buy a house, you're right, Denise,

Start time: 1910.04
End time: 1925.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you buy a house, the problem was in the old days, it went to the county seat and it was on a  piece of paper at the county seat. But then there's companies like Spokio that send people out to every  county seat and record all this stuff and put it online. Do you change the laws, Denise?

Start time: 1926.18
End time: 1950.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, maybe it's time to start thinking about, you know, I know people have been appalled  for years at what can be found out about them just through simple web searching. And one of the primary  things that can be found out is if you own property and your name is on the deed as it tends to be,  or some entity that you're involved in is on the deed, then you can easily be linked to that.

Start time: 1950.60
End time: 1968.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you, because Denise is a professional lawyer. I'm asking for a friend. Is it possible  to buy a home without your name being on the record? Like is it possible to buy under a holding  company or something that can't be traced back to you? Sure. You can have a corporation owned

Start time: 1968.58

Start time: 2006.66
End time: 2041.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  easily doxable. The thing that drives me crazy, what you were just talking about finding online.  It's not even so easy to find out someone's address online, but there's all these websites  that for $34, they'll do a background check. There's lots of stuff for you. Like that's  something we should cut down on because if you had to actually do the work yourself,  people will probably give up on it. But if they're looking at a site and they're like,  oh, for $5.99, I can get your phone number, your address and relatives. Okay, sure. I'll go pay  for that. Like it's really, I don't know. It's really weird. Really weird. I do want to point

Start time: 2041.52
End time: 2056.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  out that- Yeah, yeah. It comes back to what's going to be public information because that's  just somebody willing to do the work for you and then you pay them for it, right? So if the  information is available, someone's going to go find it. Yeah. I should point out that Congress

Start time: 2057.60
End time: 2089.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is asking, as subpoena, the owner of 8chan, Jim Watkins, he'll be appearing before Congress on  September 5th. He himself says, I really don't like what's happened. And he shut it down. He  said, I wish I never started it. But he also pointed out, and quite rightly, as soon as I shut  down, when she did, somebody else would come along and there is in fact zero 8chan, which is  the same thing. So it's pretty hard. I mean, you cannot, the nature of the internet is anybody can  create an account. Even if Twitter starts to shut down the analysis, they just create a new account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Like, there was a story, I think maybe Carolyn McCarthy wrote it about Google Plus and how they  were just trying to copy Facebook. I loved that story.  Yeah, and how they missed out on, they could have created something different, better, where the  interactions would be healthier and you wouldn't have as much of the- Well, and because Google

Start time: 2127.22
End time: 2145.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus had the tools necessary, users could block people from commenting. It was so much better  than Twitter. Yeah, Mike Elgin would always-  Mike and I and others have said for years, we were extremely disappointed that Google  didn't keep Google Plus going. I know they still use it internally.

Start time: 2145.86
End time: 2175.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, and I don't think it's the end of the world for Google Plus to go away, but if what happens  out of the last year or two is new companies realize that they need to think about the holistic  aspect of their footprint and the implications of how people interact with each other online,  maybe the pendulum is starting to swing the other way, where we start to see safer spaces  or smaller spaces or more fragmented spaces where you don't have some of the same negative  side effects that we currently have on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Start time: 2185.37
End time: 2264.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nope.  Okay, so Instagram is doing a thing where they're trying different countries and they're not showing  likes anymore. So people don't have anxiety and stress and they're cutting down on the dopamine  and your addiction and need to have likes and all this kind of stuff. And they say they want it to be  for health, mental health and anxiety and stress and they're trying to cut down on it, which  I personally don't believe at all. I feel like that's like a sham because it's owned by Facebook.  So it sounds great, but I don't like it at all. I don't like that idea. I don't like that premise.  I don't like that thing. I haven't seen it yet, but what you were just talking about  is a company quote unquote saying that they're trying to make it better for  people's mental health and mindset and not wanting to one up each other.  I think it's about the fact that they're losing out on branding, marketing and advertising dollars.  Because if I am a person with a million followers and I get 200,000 likes, the brand could come  directly to me instead of running trash Instagram ads through the feed. They can get something  organic through me, but if they can't get the likes and I can't prove that I'm worth the value  that they're paying me, so then they might just go back to Instagram and say, okay, we're going  to run whatever kind of ads you want us to run. So I'm interested to see how that works.

Transcript:  What are the things Facebook does and Instagram is a Facebook company? In fact, they're going to  rename it Instagram by Facebook for reasons I don't fully understand. One of the things  Facebook does is the minimum to deflect like, oh, well, hey, we're getting rid of likes as if that  would have anything to do with influencers. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's an economic thing,  oh, doctor, but I also think that's just like, well, we're doing something. Twitter does that too.  We're doing something. It's the least. They do the least they can do. It doesn't seem to make any  difference at all. I mean, how does getting rid of the likes do anything to reduce the value of  influencers? You still get rid of the follower count, maybe get rid of the follower count.  Are they thinking about that? I don't think so. No, because then if you don't know how many  followers somebody has, you don't know if they're an influencer, right? They could just be a regular  person. They could be somebody normal. Yeah. What's up with that? Who closes like this.

I probably won't  cause I'm crazy. But when I went there to go meet them, I met three guys that work for the Sixers  as the Sixers sports team to play 2k as the Sixers. They travel around and do tournaments  across the country. And these three dudes are like two times bigger than me. And like, when I said,  like you wouldn't, it doesn't matter, but they're decked out and like $300 Jordans. Like these guys  are bawling out of control, making money. Like I was like, yeah, how much money do you make? He's  like, Oh, we make anywhere between 250 to 500,000 a year, but then we do our own tournaments where  we can make double that. And I'm like, they're paying you to play basketball and pretend to be  the stars that they actually have on the court. I, I wasted so much of my view.

It was a lot, three billion, something like  that. That's a good question. It was pretty good. I think Marissa got out unscathed,  but Verizon couldn't figure out what the hell to do with Tumblr. So they, first of all, they realized,  oh, it's a porn site. We just bought a porn site. One third of all of the Tumblr blogs were adult  content. So they banned that, lost one third of their audience. They lost more than one third of

Start time: 2911.53
End time: 2953.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  their audience. Really? You think? I discussed this like a long time ago when we were in here.  I used to use Tumblr as a funnel for web traffic, simply because of that, like,  I'm not going to go into details of stuff that I would do, but you could mix and match content,  and you could drive people to click on anything you wanted them to click on via Tumblr. Once they  shut Tumblr down and tried to make a quote unquote kid-friendly, not only did they take off the adult  content, they took off a lot of the content, just adult meme content, some things that weren't even  sexual, like porn, but they just deemed inappropriate. So they cut off massive amounts of content.  They cut off massive amounts of free-flowing content that used to flow through Tumblr. My

Transcript:  than that to buy The Break House. So WordPress.com's parent company, Automatic, bought it,  which actually is great. Matt Mullenweg says, we're not turning the porn back on.  But I think it actually makes sense. WordPress has a platform that's probably a little more  beefy for people who need more capability. Tumblr, anybody could quickly and easily set up  a blog. I loved having a Tumblr blog. So I had quit my Tumblr account a long time ago,  not because of the adult stuff, but just because when I quit Facebook and Instagram, I just quit  all of that stuff. I signed up again as soon as I heard this. I said, good. I couldn't get  leo.tumblr.com back. Somebody took it. But I have chieftwit.tumblr.com. And I don't know what I'm  going to do with it, but it's still got great mobile apps. It's an easy site to create a blog  in.

Transcript:  You always want to sell at the peak. That's right.  All right. Let's take a break and then we're going to come back. There's some Apple news.  I'm studiously avoiding the Wired story, three years of misery inside Google. It hurts.  It's a little too close to home, but Matt Cutts read it. I'll ask you what you think.  And we have a Googler in the audience who doesn't look evil at all. So there, right?  Actually, I thought the article was very positive about Google because what it really said is that  employees at Google, unlike say employees at the Amazon fulfillment center have a voice  and can stand up and can walk out and can say, no, we don't want to do this.  We don't want it to be this way. In fact, there's a quote that's, well, we'll get to it in a second.  I'll talk about it in just a bit. Our show today brought to you by My Mattress.  Mattress. Everybody has a Casper, right? You don't? All right. Let me tell you about Casper.  You ought to get a Casper. It's the best mattress out there. Casper was started by some guys who  said, you know, this is actually the best stuff in Silicon Valley comes out of this kind of notion  that there are places in the economy that are inefficient, where you're spending more than you  ought to. And a mattress is, man, they were the worst. Because basically a mattress company would  make a mattress and then sell it to a mattress showroom would mark it would double the cost.  Mattress showroom takes half. So that means you're paying twice as much as you need to  for the mattress. And what do you get from a mattress showroom? The privilege of lying on  the mattress for a minute in broad daylight with a salesperson staring at you. You can't even take  off your shoes. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's not a good way to test a mattress, but that's a problem  because people want to do that. So Casper said, well, we could get rid of the middleman. We could  sell really beautiful premium mattresses for a fraction of what they cost in the store. But people  do want to lie on it, right? So what we're going to do, and this was brilliant. Now everybody's  doing it. They started this. We're going to give people 100 nights. If you don't like it after 100  nights, you buy your Casper free delivery, painless returns in the US and Canada, a 100 night risk free  sleep on a trial. So if you don't like it after 100 nights, they'll come and get it. Here's my Casper.  I just got the new one. I love this. Casper just introduced their hybrid mattress collection. Now  I've had a Casper forever and I love the Casper, but the hybrid mattress does something interesting.  They brought back springs. So they've always had this award-winning durable foam mattresses, but now  they've added durable yet gentle springs in the mattress. This new innovation gives you luxurious  comfort, resilient support, elevated lift for active support, all body types. I'm a little  heavier than my wife, but the springs really help. Look how comfy that looks. Oh, it's so nice.  Increased airflow within the spring network so you sleep even cooler. That's one of the best things  about Casper mattresses. We know sleeping cool is an important part of sleeping well.  And then this is for me because when I get up out of bed, I would roll off the mattress because the  edge wouldn't be firm. It beats the same softness. Now with the springs, you have enhanced edge  support, firmer perimeters that makes it easier to get in and out of bed. This new Casper mattress  is awesome. I just got it. As you saw, I tried it out. As always though, I don't know how they do  this, even though they've got springs in it, it still comes in this surprisingly compact box,  which makes it very easy. Don't do what I did. I opened the mattress in the foyer. Big mistake  because then I had to manhandle it into the bedroom. Bring it into the bedroom and open it.  Just a little tip, something I've learned. But I have to say, when my son went to college,  we got him a Casper. He was able to get up three flights in the dorm, get a nice comfy mattress,  and it was so affordable that when he was ready to leave after four years, he said,  should I take it with me? I said, no, leave it. We'll get you a new one.  Let the next kid enjoy your Casper mattress. I love it. Even with the springs, the Caspers are,  the hybrid mattresses are amazingly compact. They arrive on your doorstep. You open the box,  you've got a great night's sleep. And by the way, no airing out. No, I've had mattresses,  fancy, expensive mattresses from big brands where you really didn't want to sleep on it for the first  week because it smelled bad. Not the Casper. Smells great, feels great, sleeps cool, supports you,  and yet gives. It's amazing. Get a Casper mattress today.

The Pixel  XL 3A is just superior. What that phone does as far as photography. With one lens.  With one lens. And at the end of the day, if they have better marketing or if they just say,  you know what, forget this, we're going to sell this to you and charge you triple the rate.

On the camera. On the camera. Oh nice. And it has a dedicated camera chip, which the A does not.  No, I'll grant you that. But I have to say there is something to be said. Now this is the S10.  The Note will have it with multiple lenses. So with one lens, you get one focal length. This one,  I have telephoto zoom in normal and wide, super wide. I can get this whole studio in and that's  the lens. It's optical. And I have to say, I agree with you, doctor, that the software in the Pixel  3 is second to none. The engine that they put in there, the extra hardware, the chip, that makes  a big difference. But I think even in the Galaxy S10 Plus, the night sight, which they just put out  in their July update is, I think it's as good as Google's. It's not. It's not. You could say

So the 4 coming up,  why are you getting so mad, Leo? No notch in the 4. Just a big chin.  You can tell me. Oh, is that a forehead? I'm sorry. Just a big forehead. I'm going to tell you,  don't lie about that camera in that phone, because it's not about the size of the boat. It's about  the motion and the ocean. So you can say what you want to.

He was actually a little bit harsh this week on Apple. Siri, privacy,  and trust. He says, Google... He even praises Google. Who would have thought?  He praises Google because Google says, yeah, we record your voice when you use Google Assistant  and we save it and you can even go here and listen to your recordings. And yes,  humans will listen to it. But you could turn that off and you can delete them.  He says, that's what Google did. Apple doesn't even do that.  Apple should... He says, until the opt-in process is crystal clear,  Apple should delete all existing recordings and confirm it's no longer saving them.  They were keeping copies with identifying information for six months until The Guardian  published their story last week. He says, this defies everyone's expectations for privacy for  a voice assistant. And he says, especially for Apple. And that's the key. Apple... Is it  reasonable to hold Apple to a higher standard because they champion privacy? He says, Apple  literally advertises on the basis of its user-focused privacy policies.

At the very bottom of every transcription on iOS,  the iOS asks whether the transcription was useful or not useful. If you tap either of those,  you get a very explicit prompt. Help improve transcriptions? Would you like to submit this  voicemail to Apple to improve accuracy? Recordings will only be used to improve the quality of speech  recognition in Apple products. And here's a sentence he really likes. Do not submit recordings  if you believe the speaker would be uncomfortable with you submitting the content to Apple.  That's good. That's the way it should be. That's not what they do with Siri.

They say they're  the first and only platform that offers iOS, Android and Linux virtualization on arm.  Apple says you can't virtualize our stuff because that means you're using our code.  Corellium's business. Apple's suit says is based entirely on commercializing the illegal replication  of the copyrighted operating system and applications that run on Apple's iPhone,  iPad and other Apple devices. It's a virtual version. We've seen these. We've seen this before.  Right. Denise, there was a company that was doing windows virtualization that Microsoft shut down.

Transcript:  Yeah. And I think Apple probably wouldn't have much trouble getting it shut down. The sort of  side effect of that, if they were to get case law on it, I immediately thought of game emulations  that people are doing to try and keep old games alive that are no longer supported by their  developers but still have avid players. There's a museum in Oakland called the MADE. I forget  what that stands for. A museum, something, digital art. Anyway, that's one of its projects,  is helping keep old games alive. So I think that Apple will probably squash this, but if it does,  it also squash from a legal, precedential standpoint the ability to do what the MADE is doing.  That's really interesting. Or the Internet Archive.

Start time: 4088.02
End time: 4131.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was just going to say. The Internet Archive is keeping a lot of these classic games  alive for very, very good reason. They're art. It's as if we printed books,  but you had to have a special reader to read the books. Once the reader was out of business,  you could never read the book again. I think it's really important to remember that  these are more than just commerce. These are more than just capitalism. These are works of art,  just like movies are works of art. You've got to preserve them. Now, somehow the Internet Archive  gets away with this. There's got to be... Well, yeah, there are exceptions for things

Start time: 4131.38

Transcript:  like search. Search does copying. And courts have very early on carved out an exception.  Well, this is something in the public interest, and we're going to let that kind of copying happen  because we need search or else the Internet is nothing. So hopefully there would be room for  that kind of development too. But once something like this becomes law on the books, then it's  something that has to be overcome by someone like the Internet Archive or made and hopefully

I bookmarked this and I don't remember  where I bookmarked it, but there I just found a site that keeps alive the old user interfaces  for Apple and Microsoft and stuff like that. I think it's might be part of the Internet Archives,  but that's another example where that's part of culture. And I guess technically you could say  it's a copyright violation. I would hope that Internet Archive is protected. I remember asking  Brewster Kahle who founded it, and he said, we just don't bother. We just copy everything  and not worry about it.

I can't,  you know... But I don't think this is a mean article. This is Natasha Tikhu writing on Wired,  the happiest company in tech. And what it really is talking about is a Google that's a little  different, and I bet a little different from when you worked at it, Matt.  Yeah, I think so.  Employees walking out because they don't want Google, for instance, to do a defense contracting.  And that's one thing that Google's always been, is respectful for their employees because after  all, the valuable asset of Google, the most valuable asset is not the hard drives of the servers  or even Sundar Pichai. It's the engineers who write the code, who keep it running.  And so, more so than almost any other kind of company, employees at Google carry a lot of weight.

Start time: 4324.66
End time: 4360.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They do carry a lot of weight, and it's super fascinating that the culture of empowerment  where people say they can push the big red button and say, I think this is something evil,  and I've seen that happen where the company set a company-wide goal, and then one engineer stood up  and said, I think this is actually an evil goal, and it kicked off a huge discussion which changed  actually the course of how the company was planning to do some things.  See, that's great.  That's a healthy culture, but now Google is 100,000 people, and it's much harder to find,  you know, what is the thing that every single person at Google is going to agree on? You're  going to have folks all across the spectrum who have strong thoughts on all kinds of different topics.

Start time: 4360.74
End time: 4510.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and one of the problems that she writes about in this is that the troubles began in 2016  with the election of President Trump. Google wanted to keep, as any business would want to do,  a low profile. Not be critical because the president and the government can really weigh in,  as they have started to do now, on your business. It was kind of the strategy of Google to keep  their head down, but then came very early on the Muslim ban, the immigration ban, and Sergey Brin,  one of the founders of Google, goes to the San Francisco airport and protests.  He says, he was very clear, I'm not going as the founder of Google, I'm going as a private individual.  Google. Then there are walkouts at Google. Employees had a protest on a Saturday night.  Was it a Saturday night? It was shortly after the Saturday night protests at the airport.  Sundar Pichai kind of was collared. He went out and he spoke,  and then the crowd starts going, Sergey, Sergey, Sergey. And Sergey has to speak.  And this is pretty much what Google didn't want. This is that old thing, you don't want to get your  head above the crowd because then it gets chopped off. And of course, the latest is,  the president says, well, we're going to investigate Google and Twitter, but mostly Google for  blocking conservative thought in their search results.  And then there's also the conversation in this article about James Daymore. More than James Daymore,  an engineer who is less known, Daymore wrote that memo was fired. He has filed a class action  lawsuit against Google, but the memo was blatantly sexist saying women are not capable of programming,  and that's obviously wrong and inappropriate. I think that there's good case to be made that  that if an employee says, well, this kind of person is no good at my job, that's not the  environment you want to create at Google. But then there's also Kevin Cernicki, who is very active.  He has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board after getting a warning. He's  still working there. So it's a really interesting article, kind of a trouble in paradise article.

Start time: 4511.62
End time: 4593.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a slightly different take.  It's interesting because this is the story of the last three years and a lot of stuff has happened  at Google. Since you left.  Yeah. And it's almost like, I was starting in DC in June of 2016, so I missed a lot of this stuff.  I didn't see the internal discussions. But what is fascinating about it to me is whenever people  would leave Google before, a typical response would be, oh, yes, one person has left, but look  at these 12 amazing people who just joined. So the walkout is a different tactic. You only get to  quit once, but you can do internal protests or walkouts. And that can have a pretty sizable  impact without you actually leaving. But then my weird take is, I think we are at the point where  a company that is 100,000 employees, you can't just ascribe and say, oh, I'm a good person  and I work for this company and I think this company is good. I don't need to worry about  the impact of all of my ethical decisions. I'm going to outsource that to my company.  Instead, I think now you see that there are plenty of opportunities for technology people  to have more impact, not at a large company trying to change from within, but going and  doing whether it's a startup or a nonprofit or working in government, the kinds of things  where you can have a really big impact, where you might not be able to affect that change inside  the large company anymore. Because it's so big.

Start time: 4594.16
End time: 4612.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just so big. Plus large companies.  Agendas shift a little bit. For instance, you want to make nice with the government that's in  running the country you're in because they can make a lot of trouble for you.  I can understand why a Google engineer will say, well, that's none of my concern. I'm going to

Start time: 4613.74
End time: 4645.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  do what I think is right. It's fascinating to me that there are  thousands of designers and engineers and product managers at Google, but it is also the case that  a very small number of people can have a very large impact whenever you're tackling a problem  at a startup. That's me. Is that you?  Yeah. That's me. It was listening for the...  So it's fascinating to me that you can actually have teams of four or five people can have a  disproportionate impact in civic tech, for example. As it should.

This is classic HR and employment law issues. How are people going to express their views and  what can and should they be fired for? That's a judgment call on the part of management,

Start time: 4681.40

End time: 4744.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not only that, from the outside looking in from a regular Joe, I feel like Google has one of the  best mental health stability across the board as far as their employees go. The fact that you  hear this kind of story where people are voicing their opinions and are walking out,  protesting, whatever they're doing, you don't hear anything out of other companies,  which means people are terrified to speak their mind or to speak their truth or to do what they  feel is right. And then you find out that these companies do horrible heinous things because no  one thought to speak up and say anything against it. So in general, besides all the hoopla,  I'm like, whenever I hear stuff like this from Google right now, I'm like, well, at least  people are confident and competent enough to have a sensible opinion, express that opinion in a  certain way, and then move on, learn from it, grow from it, make a change, don't make a change.  But it's healthy that this kind of conversation is being had from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  shutting down its employees. They can't. No, they can't. And I think probably, well,  any large company in this day and age is in a point where there are going to be reactions,  not only to the news, but the events of the day, whatever it is. And the best you can do is try to  make sure that you have a supportive organization where people feel safe and they can bring their  whole self to work. I think that really matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is again, rumor, the idea. Pro Max, wow, that's a little much. Super Pro Max.  The idea is Apple has pros in all of its lines. The thought is there might be one high end iPhone,  bigger screen, type C connector, not a lightning connector, which I would frankly pay for.  Let's get rid of that lightning connector. Apple wouldn't do it all at once because people would  be furious they bought all those lightning accessories. So you just do it with the Pro  one, just like you do with the iPad Pro, right? The iPad Pro doesn't have lightning and it's type  C. So maybe get an analog to the iPad Pro. And then of course you've got the problem,  which is that the iPhone has regular sized and maxi. So you're going to have to, if it's a Pro,  will you have a Pro Max?  Oh boy.

I think that would have been cool.  Google Design Director. So Google's strategy with the Pixel 4 is pretty cool  because when the leaks got out, they just tweeted it.

He since clarified the photo was taken on a 3a and he cropped the image.  Although still, that's pretty good.  So one thing, oh doctor, you're going to have to give up.  The new Pixel 4 will have multiple lenses probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm fine with that. I'm just saying that I'm not against multiple lenses.  I'm saying that having multiple lenses and telling me that something's better  is just a crutch in a sales point. You keep putting these lenses on there,  but your software is still not as good. Again, it's adequate and it's great.  I'm not saying it's bad. Everything's even par.  The iPhone has very great photos during the daytime when you're outside.  I don't think any camera really beats that.  The Samsung has super sharp photos and if you want to take a picture of like 42 buildings at once,  you got the ultra wide. That's great.  But when it comes down to day to day, shot for shot, just taking pictures,  the Pixel destroys them over and over and over.

Transcript:  I'm sorry, search engine ballot, not a browser ballot.  But same idea as the old browser ballot that Microsoft had to do in the EU.  The idea is when you first boot up an Android phone, you'll be presented with a ballot  or just a box saying which search engine do you want to use.  But it turns out Google was charging to be on that ballot.  They had an auction.  Yeah, they were auctioning it off. We know that because there's an ethical search engine,  which we all learned about after this article, called Ecosia.  It's a German company. The whole idea is that every time you use a search engine, they plant a tree.  They planted a lot of trees. They said that Google auction was an insult to the European  Commission into the principle of equality in front of the law.  And they said, we are not participating.  So we won't be on the ballot.

Start time: 5573.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I hadn't heard of Ecosia before today.  Nobody has. This was brilliant of them to do what they did.  I do love their FAQ. It's like, does one search finance one new tree?  And they're like, no, it takes approximately 45 searches to finance the planting of one tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Once everybody else takes their cut, I'll get a penny.  Our show today brought to you by...  ExpressVPN.  I was talking about this with a caller on the radio show today  to explain he was asking about VPNs.  And I pointed out...  Okay.  So why would you want to use a VPN?  A VPN, we all first experienced these at work  because if you had a corporate internal network,  you couldn't very well log into it from the outside world  without exposing it to the outside world.  So companies created virtual private networks.  You would use software usually from Cisco on your computer.  I remember those days where it was such a pain to configure.  And then you'd use it and you'd log into the corporate network  and you'd have an encrypted tunnel of the corporate network.  And that way you could use it as if you were on the premises  even though you were at home.  It was very cool.  Somebody, some bright fellow said,  hey, the cool thing about this  isn't that I'm using the corporate network at work  because I don't want to work at home anyway.  The cool thing about this is no one,  my internet service provider, the hacker in the corner  at the coffee shop can see what I'm doing.  I'm in private.  We should create a business of VPN.  So they put a number, there are many companies that do this now.  They put VPN servers like the one you had at your company,  but they put them in the outside world  and you connect to it and then into the outside world.  But here's the problem.  It just kicks the privacy security can down the road.  Yes, the hacker in the coffee shop can't see you.  Your ISP can't see what you're doing.  You can emerge onto the internet in the country of your choice,  wherever that server lives.  That's really cool.  But you have to trust the host.  That's the key.  Because everything that the bad guys could do,  if you did it without a VPN, the VPN service can do.  So it's really important when you choose a VPN to choose carefully.  That's why I use ExpressVPN.  First of all, ExpressVPN has been audited by third parties.  So we know they do exactly what they did.  The third party even audited their new cutting edge server technology.  ExpressVPN calls it trusted server,  which prevents the operating system and apps from ever writing to the hard drive.  That's the operating system on the server side.  So not only no logging, no nothing.  It's a whole new standard of privacy and security.  The third party did.  The auditor said, yes, it works exactly as we said.  ExpressVPN cannot track you  and more importantly, cannot offer your information to anybody else.  And we know this is the case because ExpressVPN  authoritarian governments have come in,  happened in Turkey a couple of years ago,  and actually without subpoena just taking the ExpressVPN server,  they found nothing.  There's nothing on it.  So you are absolutely private.  You are absolutely protected.  ExpressVPN is easy to use too.  I like those days of Cisco and getting that thing to run.  Man, that was a nightmare.  It never worked right.  I had to get the IT department.  Now it's one button.  You download the app, you click to connect, you're protected.  It's the fastest VPN you'll ever use because they do it right.  Servers all over the world.  It costs less than $7 a month and it has a 30-day money back guarantee.  So you're not at risk.  Stop hackers, stop big brother, stop internet companies  from grabbing your data, hacking your systems,  take back your online privacy, protect yourself with ExpressVPN.  You're going to put trust in a VPN company.  Make sure you use the one I recommend everybody.  I recommend, everybody recommends ExpressVPN.  We're going to get you a deal too.  Three extra months free when you get a one-year package.  That's the best deal at expressvpn.com slash twit.  Express is spelled out E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com slash twit.  Three extra months free with a one-year package.  Or you could find out more about ExpressVPN.  Read the privacy policy.  Google search ExpressVPN audit and ExpressVPN Turkey.  And you can see, read the story.  And it's happened many times in the past as well.  No VPN company can prevent governments from coming  and taking the servers.  But ExpressVPN can prevent anything of value being on that server.  And thanks to this new trusted server technology,  it's even more private.  I just love it.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  By the way, they're out of the British Virgin Islands  where strict privacy laws also protect you.  It's really good.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.

The recognition face recognition software wrongly flagged 26 California lawmakers as criminals.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  That's pretty brilliant.  One false match is one too many.

Transcript:  It's the ACLU.  So, uh, Amazon's recognition does give a confidence score.  But the ACLU, you know, in other words, we think this is a hundred percent accurate or  this is, you know, 50% accurate, but the ACLU says Amazon knowingly misleads the public  about the software.  Amazon knows with 100% certainty that its law enforcement customers are using lower  confidence scores or no score at all when using the customers, uh, the company's system.  That's not good.  So face recognition has some problems.  I think there are reasonable places to use it.  Like, well, Taylor Swift uses it at concerts to keep, no, because there's known stalkers  and troublemakers and it just keeps them out of the concert.

He started typing Null pointer, but it's caught himself after he typed the first word and said,  you know, it'd be funny if I could get null or maybe void for my wife so that our cars  would be null and void.  Kind of a mistake.  He explained this at DEF CON last week.  Null is a text string that in many programming languages, as you know,  signifies a value that's empty or undefined.  Could be the false is null, right?  Yeah.  He was facing $12,049 of wrong traffic fines sent his way because  the Null plate didn't get him out of tickets.  It got him into tickets.  It broke the DMV website.  By the way, you can no longer get Null.  It's invalid.

There is now another, actually four more RDS vulnerabilities, the Remote Desktop Service.  They're all for wormable, which means if you get the exploit on your computer,  it will immediately go out through the network, worm its way to every computer on your company's  network and bring them all to their knees.  Microsoft's Simon Pope, director of indecent response, I'm sorry, incident response,  said, it's important that effective systems are patched as quickly as possible because  of the elevated risk associated with wormable vulnerabilities.

This has a little knob that's a USB knob.  You plug into the, you could put on either side if you're a lefty.  I'm a lefty, so I put it on the right.  And it has double, double knobbage.  You press the button, it opens the menu or mutes.  I don't know what's doing both.  If you turn the knob, here, let me show you.  I'll go to a website so you can see this in action.

Because that way I can listen to audiobooks while I'm bicycling around.  I'm looking at the phone which is searching for Bluetooth.  Not only does it see my helmet, but as I'm driving it sees hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of  Bluetooth LE implementations.  You're blue driving.  I'm blue.  You could be blue.  War driving.

So he's got a really interesting company and background.  I've talked with him before.  He's great.  And then also great coming up is Joey Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab.  I love Joey.  Oh, he's so great.  It's the first week of September.  September 6th.  And then it's just if you want to go back in the archives,  I forget the actual date, but it was episode 400 of triangulation.

But also, this is the right audience who often watches the show.  So for example, we just launched something at the US Digital Service.  Actually, it's better to describe it as a partnership with the Center for Medicare  and Medicaid Services because they were doing the heavy work and we were assisting with it.  But this idea of data at the point of care.  So imagine, okay, horrible scenario.  You get hit by a bus.  You're unconscious.  They rush you to the emergency room.  It is not the case that your doctors who are in the emergency room can tell what  treatments you've received.  So if you could set the standards such that you swipe the Medicare card and you're able  to pull up the medical claims that have happened, you're like, oh, okay, this person has diabetes.  This is when they had their last colonoscopy.  That's the kind of thing that is going to save people's lives.

Thank you Rocket Mortgage for supporting our show.  Thank you for supporting us by going to RocketMortgage.com slash twit2.  Let's see.  I always like getting to the bottom of the show because that's when all the good stories  shake to the bottom.  When Huawei is back in the news.  This is just another crazy story.  Huawei, you remember, everybody said, oh, they're dangerous.  You don't use them.  And in fact, there is a story in here that Huawei technicians have been helping governments  in Uganda and Zambia spy on political opponents.  This is according to the Wall Street Journal.  By the way, there's no evidence that Huawei or China even knew about Huawei employees  doing this.  And it wasn't that anything about the Huawei technology was doing it.  It's just that the employees were doing it.  I think that's kind of par for the course.  When you're in a country, you kind of have to do what the country wants you to do.  But what I'm confused about is we said Huawei is bad.  Don't use Huawei.  We banned Huawei.  And then three months ago, we gave them another 90 days.  Now we're giving them another 90 days, which makes me think it has nothing to do with Huawei.  It has everything to do with the trade war.  Either they are a security flaw or they're not.  A security hole or they're not.  If they're not, then don't ban them.  If they are, then do ban them.  But this, I'll give you another 90 days.  Makes me nuts.  Part of it is because, of course, if you ban Huawei from doing business with American companies,  it doesn't just hurt Huawei.  It hurts those American companies.  Huawei spends a significant amount of money with Google, among others.  They do Android phones.  They buy a lot of gear.  Of $70 billion Huawei spent buying components last year, $11 billion went to US firms.  $11 billion Qualcomm, Intel, and Micron, among others.  There's nothing to say here.  It's just extremely confusing.  It really looks political.  It doesn't look like it has anything to do with technology or security.

Because the whole strength of Instagram and WhatsApp is a lot of people don't know it's Facebook.

If Facebook was the stronger brand, it would make even more sense.  But this is what all strong mega corps do.  They have their flagship and then they have subsidiaries that are known with that and  associate with to build up the regular brand recognition.  It's just a car dealership move.  And I should fully understand why they did it.  They just did it super late.  They're way late on this rebranding thing because now Facebook's a dumpster fire.

Using incognito mode, it wouldn't know you'd been there.  Then the New York Times figured it out.  And it turns out that if you're in incognito mode,  it will tell the site you're going to.  He's in incognito mode.  So the Times started saying,  you're in incognito mode.  You can't read anything on the New York Times.  So then in the most recent version of Chrome,  they announced that they were going to stop doing that.  So that the New York Times,  all of a sudden this workaround worked again.  And now it turns out that this more private incognito mode  doesn't do it anymore.  Web developers have two new tricks to get around it.  And now you can't go to the New York Times anymore.

Start time: 9296.18
End time: 9442.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's another reason not to recommend it.  So if you use Kaspersky antivirus, the famed Russian antivirus used by the  Russian secret police and many more, one of the things it does now...  And by the way, Gene Kaspersky, who's beloved for some reason by tech writers,  I think he must throw a great party, has said again and again,  I don't work for the Russians.  I don't like the...  I am Russian and it's a Russian company, but the...  What is it?  The GRU doesn't have anything to do with what I do.  But there is a little JavaScript that Kaspersky will embed in every web page you go to,  giving a unique identifier, actually putting the unique identifier in the URL.  Oh, dear.  So this comes from hyz.de, which is a great magazine, computer technology magazine.  They discovered this.  main.js is loaded every single time you go to a website.  It's loaded from a Kaspersky domain.  And in every browser, Firefox, Edge, and Opera, same line of code, Chrome, every single browser  has a unique ID that it gives you, assigns you.  And of course, that ID is readable by every site you go to, which means those sites could track you.  Kaspersky can track you.  And when told about this, Kaspersky said, oops, it was apparently introduced in 2015.  Kaspersky says, oh, this would be too complex and not profitable for cyber criminals to use.  Well, maybe not.  So they turned it off.  They gave everybody the same ID.  But it's still an announcement to every site you visit that you're using Kaspersky,  which basically is a security problem all on its own.  So if you are using Kaspersky for reasons I don't understand, you don't really need it.  But if you are using it, click the settings icon in the bottom left, click additional network,  go to traffic processing and uncheck inject script into web traffic.  Apparently it's an option.  It's a setting and it's on by default.  It's kind of a red flag.  Inject script into web traffic.  You can't turn that off.

Transcript:  Inject script into web traffic.  It's innocuous when you say it like that.  It doesn't sound so bad.  What could possibly go wrong?  Meanwhile, I have to praise Apple.  They're going to change how WebKit works.  Apple has decided.  And actually, WebKit isn't strictly Apple anymore than Chromium is strictly Google.  But Apple is kind of supporting the WebKit project.  All the Apple browsers, including Safari, that's the Apple browser run on it.  Apple has, WebKit has said, we are going to interpret any,  we're going to do our best to prevent all covert tracking, all cross site tracking,  even when it's not covert.  And when we discover additional tracking techniques,  we're going to block them.  We are going to treat tracking.  We treat circumvention of shipping anti-tracking measures with the same seriousness  as exploitation of security vulnerabilities.  If a party attempts to circumvent our tracking protection methods,  we will add additional restrictions without prior notice.  These restrictions may apply universally to algorithmically classified targets,  or even to specific parties engaged in circumvention.  This is the policy you want.  They're basically saying, if somebody tries to get around,  circumvent our anti-tracking technologies,  we're going to treat that as malware, and we're going to block it.

But this is actually going to have much more impact than that other,  which is a small scale.  Real privacy.  Yeah, and so I have always been, in the last few months,  I've been wondering why we don't see more companies  genuinely dedicated to putting security first, maybe privacy right after that.  And it feels like with all the stuff we're seeing,  where Windows 10 is wormable right now, unless you patch,  there's room for that.  There's room for companies that are rebuilding the customer experience  with security first and foremost, like usability, customer experience, security.  And this is an interesting step in that direction.  And you know who's against this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But if you were rebuilding the Internet from scratch,  you probably in this day and age wouldn't make it so that the Internet was so trackable.  So, you know, re-architecting stuff and changing the pillar  of what has historically been the compact,  you maybe pay for consumption of your media via tracking or ads or something like,  you know, at least don't get the tracking part.  You still get to show the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should point out that Firefox does this as well and has been for some time.  They're effectively copying what Firefox does.  The IAB will undoubtedly not like this either.  They basically represent the ad tech industry.  One of the reasons it's a hot button for me is the IAB also affects podcasting.  And I'm afraid I was just back from the podcast movement,  which is the big podcast expo.  It was in Orlando this week.  Six thousand podcasters and a lot of IAB representatives.  Ad tech is very interested in podcasting.  We do not do tracking.  We get requests all the time for all sorts of little trackers that we could somehow  magically put in the, you know, sounds in the podcast that you wouldn't hear,  things like that.  We, of course, always refuse because I know you wouldn't want us to do that.  But the IAB has now created a measurement system,  which is rapidly being adopted, a measurement system that favors advertisers.

Transcript:  So, yeah, you know, of course, as soon as there's money in something  and podcasting is happening, right, it's a hot and happening thing.  Along come ad tech folks who want to introduce ad tech.  And right now there's no ad tech in podcasting,  but advertisers say, well, there has to be or we won't buy ads.  Fortunately, our thank you to our advertisers who are all here because they're willing not to do  that. And we think that's really important.  So pay attention when you hear about IAB and the new IAB 2.0 measurement guidelines.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.  Very afraid.  Very afraid.  A lot of said is a lot of podcast companies are now members of the IAB,  which is a very expensive membership.  I think it's ten thousand dollars and a percentage of your revenue.  What?  So the whole idea is I don't think they want broadcasters and podcasters to be involved.  They want advertisers to be involved.  They don't want us to have a voice.  That's the last thing they'd want.  I got a few fights with some other podcast companies about that one.  All week long, we were kind of debating that one.  But that's inside baseball.  There's no room for that in this fine show.  There is room though for Oh, doctor would love having Owen JJ Stone on.

Transcript:  More than 10 years ago.  I think it was 20 2007, maybe 2008.  And it is really exciting.  I'm really excited about all the new podcasters, all the people getting excited.  But you're also seeing big companies, big brands moving in.  And you're seeing a lot of pressure from advertisers and big podcasting companies  to change the way podcasting works.  I really love about podcasting is how we're just kind of doing our thing without ad tech.  And ad tech ruined blogs.  I don't want ad tech to ruin podcasting.  And one of the things it did with blogging is it really eliminated the middle ground.  You're either a big brand or you're not trying to make any money.  You're just a personal blogger.  And right now there's room in podcasting for companies like  Twitter, a lot of independent companies to do what we do and to make a living doing it.  I fear the same thing will happen that will be squeezed out.  It'll either be NPR and CBS and NBC or somebody who just wants to do a little hobbyist podcast.

I really appreciate it.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, as is traditional,  with Owen JJ Stone, whenever O doctors on Twitter,  we need to end up the show.  So I'm just going to do the really the end stuff.  You can watch Twitter.  We do it every Sunday afternoon, about 2 30 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern.  That's 21 30 UTC.  We have a live audio or video stream at Twitter.tv slash live.  You can be in the studio.  Just email tickets at Twitter.tv.  We love having a studio audience and some great people visiting.  You're always welcome here.  I love having an open studio.  You can join us in the chat room.  Talk back.  I'm watching the chat room the whole show.  IRC dot twit dot tv.  And of course, we are a podcast.  In fact, I finally gave up on this.  Do you remember, Denise, at the very first I've been I got up on stage and said,  don't call it a podcast.  That's Apple's trademark.  You're going to be sorry.  I was wrong.  We call it.  We call it a netcast.  And my staff has been pointing out to me for a few years.  That really hurts searchability because nobody's searching for netcasts.  I lost that battle.  So I'm sorry, but be prepared.  We're going to change all the verbiage, including the netcasts you love from people  you trust at the beginning to podcasts.  I'm going to give up.  So that is one big change for us.  Anyway, we admit to being a podcast.  Blu-ray one.  Blu-ray one.  That's us.  We were we were the the beta cam s beta s beta deck, whatever it was, beta  beta HD DVDs.  HD DVDs of the Internet.  We give in.  I give in.  I give up.  So it is a podcast which you can download by going to twit.tv.  All of our shows are there or subscribe.  I have to say the word podcast makes even less sense.  If you can get us on YouTube, if you're watching on YouTube, press the subscribe button.  So you'll know when the new shows come out.  You can get us on Amazon's Echo.  Is that a podcast when you say Echo listen to this week in tech?  What is that?  That's not a pod.  I don't know what that is.  It's an echo cast.  I don't know what that is.  Right.

Transcript:  So normally people in the chat or afterwards always ask why I'm on here.  What's my expertise?  I don't plug myself.  If you want to find out what I do for money, go to LinkedIn or something.  Don't worry about why I'm here, but I'm here to tell you a story.  Last week I was going to the grocery store and there was an older lady who was struggling  to get her water and dog food in her car.  I walked over.  I offered her help.  She started crying and she said, oh, thank you so much.  So I helped her put the stuff in her car and she just said, you know, nobody wants to help  anybody anymore.  This is a digital world.  I don't know how to live in it.  My husband passed away two months ago.  My mother, I'm putting her in a home because she broke down after my husband passed away  and my two kids live far away.  I still have a regular phone and I'm just so lonely and nobody will talk to me.  And so I took her across the street and we had lunch where we had smoothies and I talked  to her for like an hour and a half and she explained that she just didn't know how to  work technology.  She was like, maybe I can go take a class or something like that because she just wants  to be able to do the video thing with her kids.  So I happen to have that Facebook portal.  I never use it.  So I set that up for her, her house, and now she could call her kids.  I say this because everybody listening has somebody in their family that they're ignoring  that is older, that we have the technology to talk to them and they're lonely and they  miss you.  And as much as you're tweeting and texting and you think that texting is the way, pick  up a phone and call them.  And so since to encourage this, Uncle Leo has always been generous and nice to me.  He always gives me gadgets.  I have an extra portal that I'm going to give to someone.  If you live in the U.S., lower 50 states, send me an email.  You can find me on the internet.  Send me an email and tell me of someone that's older in your family that needs some technology  and I will send it to one person for free.  Wow.

Transcript:  And then secondly, we talked about it earlier.  For anybody who has kids or wants to make a cell phone, I have five Raspberry Pi Bees.  I will pick five people and send them to you again for free.  If you're in the U.S., if you have a kid, you want to tinker and make something or if  you want to go try and make your own cell phone, just write me an email.  Tell me why you want to do something with your kid and I will send five of these out to five people  because you're a avid listener and you deserve something special and I have it to give.  But just remember, call somebody that's older.  Tell them you love them.  Take time to get out of your own bubble and hug somebody, love somebody because it's not  always about the technology.  Isn't that sweet?
