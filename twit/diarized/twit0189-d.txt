And I like doing it that way because we can look deep into each other's eyes and see the madness inside.  Let's start with a first timer, a newbie, but he's fit in so very well right off the top.  Mr. Brian Brushwood of Scam Squad, direct from his engagement at the Jay Leno show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was fun. It was fun. It was a lot of fun. I mean, they treat you right.  I mean, they pick you up at the limo. They do the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what do you do felt that you were well managed, you know, for a show of that size?  Like they kept, OK, Brian, you stay here. Someone's going to come over, going to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do a really good job of that. What's the pre-interview? They do a pre-interview, right?  Yeah, yeah. And they work out the chit chat beforehand. And there's no there's no nothing's left to chance.  No, no, no, no. They have multiple, multiple outs on the chit chat.  And they found one that they thought they liked.  Did my people call you in pre-interview for this show? Am I supposed to say yes? No.  OK, no, no pre-interview. Everything's authentic here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so his chin as big as it looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, his whole body and face is. Yeah, he's he's gigantic.  I wear I wear like, you know, I'm a short guy, so I wear like two inch lifts and I got two inches on my hair.  It's ridiculous. But it's like, I mean, is that what the hair is about?  It's trying to give you height.  What's that? Actually, it's to look like Guile from Street Fighter 2.  OK, that's fair. That other voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We haven't heard this voice in a long time.  It's so nice to see Mr. Roger Chang on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Roger, we missed you.  Oh, I tried to make it up here more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And well, now that we know there's wine involved, I hope you will come up more.  No, you're not a wine drinker. I can get you fruit juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Or or rum. Rum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They go hand in hand, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger Chang is what you you are now at revision three part of the texilla team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do text produced texilla and system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's great. And are you on camera much?  Do you get much camera time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did the last system, and that's just because we're trying to manage our budget.  So it doesn't cost me to cost to book yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all fun. Yeah. And the pre interview is very quick.  Yes. Roger, do you know anything? No, I don't.  OK, fine. You're great for the show.  We're signed up. Well, so nice to see you.  I really appreciate you coming up. You're the greatest.  How's the folks in Modesto, the seafood galley is going well.  Fisherman's Galley is still going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's that whole town is kind of weird still.  It's it's probably gotten weird since it became a car theft capital of the United States.  They call it fat city.  Ph.A.T. or no, just F.A.T.  Oh, OK. And well, what's funny is because of the past 10 years,  so many people from the East Bay of San Francisco  were moving out there because housing was so affordable.  And now with the kind of now the crash, there's a bunch of you  literally have track homes, just rows and rows of it that are empty  because no one bought into them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's sad is in this recession is that people are stuck in their homes.  They buy homes, they get upside down.  And then the job leaves, but they can't because they're they're stuck in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in some cases, people are betting that it's probably easier  to to bite the bullet and just just leave, leave the keys, walk away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just walk away. Oh, that's sad.  Also here, ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful, the talented, the friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't going to say that host of a new soundboard.  Sarah Lane. Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to say I'm happy to say from this weekend fun,  which is soon to be a podcast near you. Yeah, tomorrow.  Yeah, we're going to make an audio version of that first one.  And we have old ones that will probably put out as well.  I would love that with Martin Sargent.  That's a show she does live here on Twitter live  every Friday at six p.m. Eastern, three p.m. Pacific. Correct.  Which is super fun.  What is the show's kind of like just kind of wacky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's you know, this this this is a good this weekend fun, really.  This this would be a this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fun could be, you know, if you want to add wine to this, we can fun.  Be my guest. I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just make sure it's from the right source.  Yeah, we've got to be careful with Martin because he's you know,  he's a real lightweight. That sergeant is is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny. Not at all.  Seems like he'd have really good resistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he's he's had many years of practice. He's pretty good. Yeah.  But yes, so we're we're part of the group here, but I am thrilled to be part of.  It's been a while since I was up here.  Has it really? On a Sunday. Yeah, I mean, I feel like we see you all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're right. Coming up on a Sunday is something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's I think it was 2008 last time I was here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? It's a totally different year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On a Sunday. Yeah, that's a whole different year.  That's a whole different. I mean, it's wow.  Seems like yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's talk a little bit about the tech stories in the news.  I have a few of them. Not a whole not a whole lot.  I think the story that's really irritating people  this week is Time Warner.  They've announced and it's irritating me because frankly,  everything I do requires huge amounts of bandwidth.  They they were trying it in Texas.  They're trying data caps and they've announced  that they're now going to spread them to some other Time Warner customers.  Really kind of send a signal. This is going to be permanent.  40 gigabyte caps per month on your on your download.  Now Comcast gives you 250, 250, 240, 250, 250, 250.  AT&T gives you 150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forty is a little low.  You know, I'm in one of those markets.  Austin, Texas, is going to be big.  Now, are you a Time Warner customer?  I am a Time Warner customer.  How do you feel about this?  Well, I've done I've always done the the Time Warner Roadrunner Turbo,  which which is awesome, like like they guarantee at least 15 megabits down.  And I usually get like 22 megabits down.  And that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now you may not want to have so much bandwidth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because that means you eat up your cap quicker.  Well, I did some detective work.  I actually called Time Warner this morning and talked to the folks over in tech support  and said, I'm a little bit concerned about, you know, crazy bandwidth caps.  Or actually, I guess, download caps.  And the guy had this kind of attitude.  You could tell that he had been dealing with this all morning.  And he was like, oh, an article.  And so it's not true.  Well, according to some faceless person, I spoke, you know, onto a phone queue.  Basically, he said, he said, no, his exact words were he was like,  well, we're trying it out to see how people react.  So that's BS.  BS. They're doing it.  But when I brought it up, he was like, besides it won't affect you,  you're a turbo customer anyway.  You could do whatever you want.  Oh, that's interesting.  And I was like, well, yeah, but if the cap is 40 and he cut me off, he's like,  the cap is not 40.  And so and I was like, well, how do you know?  He's like, we have internal.  I mean, the caps not going to be 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Let me read to you from Business Week magazine in April.  I'm business week. This is fairly credible.  We're not making this up.  Tom Lowry writing in April, Time Warner Cable will begin.  And you must like this, Brian, collecting information on its customers,  Internet use in the Texas cities of Austin and San Antonio and Rochester, New York.  Consumption billing.  Boy, those two words you don't want to hear will begin in those cities later this summer.  So what he's telling you is no, not not yet. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not yet. And now here's something quirky that that I don't know that I believe.  I could tell that they all had a team meeting and they wanted this to be the line.  But he said, well, if you sign up for two year contract, you get the price guarantee.  That's probably and there's no way even if we do put a cap in there,  we're not allowed to change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would look at the EULA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the same way because I'm just like, I know that's what you're telling me now.  And I would look like we're having a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm willing to bet the EULA says at any time we can impose additional  strictures and limitations on your use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he did. I felt him out and I said, well, can you give me some idea  what the cap would be for reals? He was like, oh, I don't know.  You know, 100, 200. No, that's what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said that and every gig you go over is a buck is a buck. Right.  And that's going to add up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how much do you pay right now for that complete service,  including taxes and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's over 50 bucks.  It's somewhere between 50 and 60 dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you pay 100 bucks if you had like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd have 80 gigs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or like no cap. Oh, no.  No bandwidth cap or a higher bandwidth cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me tell you, I probably would, because there was a time back in the old, old days.  Austin was not first on the high speed bandwagon.  And there was a time I paid 120 bucks a month for the satellite junk  for just the one way for dial up up and high speed down for like 1.5 megabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But you know what?  There are people in Japan paying 20 bucks for 100 megabits down.  I mean, this is not because it actually costs that much money to these guys.  This is anti-competitive.  This is Time Warner saying we're in the TV business.  And if you should download too much TV, we're not going to make any money.  So we want to limit you could surf, you could do email.  But don't you download any high def movies from iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you noticed how quickly they've given up the P2P straw man?  It's like they're not even acting like it's bit related.  But this is all who this is their real response. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it is. You know what?  It isn't just P2P. It's Hulu.  It's iTunes. It's all the other places you get it from the high bandwidth stuff,  which tends to be video and tends to be what I do, which is where  tends to be a lot more available than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I mean, you'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have cable cable modem and I get the 250 cap.  But, you know, I I'm probably going to cancel my expanded basic  and just go to with basic. That's what they hate because they don't want you.  I've already done that because I watch Netflix off my Xbox.  Exactly. Netflix on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, that's what happens. You stream high def Netflix.  This is what they're terrified of.  They don't make they don't make nearly as much money off of you  as they do with an HBO subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what it would take to change that.  Like, I mean, is the problem that that Hulu is just not charging enough  for their ads if they were making more money from the ads?  But all of a sudden they prefer that you watch the ads on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. Cable doesn't make money from the shows that get produced.  They get money from the carriage fees.  So if they don't have anything to carry other than data, I mean, then they're  the amount they can charge you for, like HBO showtime  or even like the like when they give you those special sports package  or the Discovery Science package, they make money off that.  And if people aren't going to watch it, well, they're not making that money  that they're that they have been making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cable's business model is based on premium content. Yes.  They're not a commodity service. They're not a utility.  If it just comes down to bits, they can't make enough money.  And they're screwed.  And so but this is to me, this is anti-competitive.  This is cable time Warner cable saying, well, you know, you better not do this  because we're going to we're going to charge a buck a gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you this much.  It sounded I got every impression from this nobody I spoke to on a tech line  that that if people make a stink, they're listening like this is a tentative step.  And, you know, who knows?  Make a stink. Yeah, make a stink.  Yeah, that's I mean, I told him I was like, look, if there's any cap,  I'm switching to a different company.  And the problem is, though, who do you switch to?  Well, that's what he said.  He said, well, you can switch to AT&T.  See, they know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They know this AT&T is one hundred fifty.  So they know this.  There's not really competition in this market, is there?  I mean, yeah, that's the real problem is that there's my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only have one choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't even have DSL. No DSL.  So that best you got DSL and cable, right?  That's it. And they're colluding anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeannie does like, you know, start supporting fiber through their gas lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to sign up for the gas fiber network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I was in college,  a couple of students from Belgium were saying that the the Zinantwerp,  that's the capital of Belgium.  Yes, they were running fiber optic lines.  The utilities were running fiber optics lines through the gas line  because it was the most affordable way to lay out internet.  You mean they like feed it into the pipe?  And because it's light, it's not going to turn.  It's not going to ignite the gas.  And you're running it over there.  That's a relief.  Well, I mean, you know, it's like it's like trying to light a candle  with a flashlight. It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going to ignite the gas.  You've got nothing to fear.  Wow. So they could like feed it into the pipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you already have you already have that, you know, infrastructure.  You just I never thought of that.  That's an interesting point.  And then they would come out into that residence or they would, you know,  put up the little unit and then just feed into the homes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just it makes me a little bit nervous because I just feel like  it's it's me and you, Brian, and you, Roger, that they're coming after.  And you, Sarah Lane, all the people who are doing internet video,  these are the ones that scare them the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what it reminds me of is when gas prices were high  and all of the airlines instituted carriage fees for the baggage.  Now you pay a first bag fee, a second bag fee.  And now gas prices are back down.  Well, yeah, the fees that they go away.  No, it's the same thing here.  It used to be the P2P was the big boogeyman.  It's all bit torn. It's all these losers fault.  And then now and now they're not even claiming they're like,  you guys are watching too much video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Netflix? They're right.  I'm sorry. Someone just corrected me.  It's Brussels is the capital of Belgium.  What did you say? That's it.  I don't even remember him saying that stupid that that company.  Yeah. The radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go to Antwerp to buy diamonds for your special lady.  The Shane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's funny is I didn't realize that was an ad you guys were quoting.  I thought this was a popular song that I was not aware of.  You're so unhip. Don't you know?  The worst song ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, that's the name of my new band, The Shane Company.  That'd be a good band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now it's just Shane Co.  Shane Co. Shane Co dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so sad. Is that sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually really want to meet Tom Shane.  I've been listening to him for so many years.  Don't they have a Shane Company ads in Austin?  I would know. They're California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're only California. Oh, I thought they were everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they go any farther south than San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of people listening who have no idea what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's great. Look up Tom Shane.  Yeah, he hawks diamonds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what? If you're planning to invest money, don't invest it in diamonds.  You're probably one of the worst investments you can make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  De Beers can take you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, invest in gold or, you know, platinum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I'm going to invest in fine wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Girls might beg to differ with you.  Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but gold will give you a better return over the long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No girl's going to want to hear that argument.  That's a great line.  You don't love me enough.  If you loved me enough, you'd get me a diamond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Marilyn Monroe sang it that way, did she?  Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But gold has a better return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you know what? If you can insert it at the end, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another one for the Roger Chang sound board, actually.  We're going to take a break. When we come back, I want to talk about Netflix,  because we were we kind of started a Netflix conversation.  They're two billionth delivery.  But there's trouble in the Netflix Garden of Eden.  There's trouble ahead.  I do want to mention our friends at Carbonite.com.  Carbonite is online backup done right.  I'm a big fan of carbonite, as many of you know, I use carbonite after after  the incident. We just hear around the Twit Cottage call it the incident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The incident. And you and you you're OK.  You're moving on. I survived the incident, but it wasn't it wasn't a happy incident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, by the way, do you know what the incident was?  You're sounding like you know what the incident was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I didn't. You know, I think I can infer that there was a problem.  There was a problem. I recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, first I recorded two Floss Weekly's with I think it was Brian Aker lost them both.  So we called him back said we lost your interview.  Can we do it again? We did it again. We lost it again.  Oh, I actually erased it.  And so I had to send him a basket of fruits and vegetables.  And squash like a hundred dollars.  Parsnips. Parsnips.  It was very no, I think I sent him a coffee basket, a lot of different coffee,  because I think it's a programmer coffee. Right.  Then this was worse.  I lost 10, 10 daily gizzwizzes.  And that was when I said, I got to find a better way.  And that's when I found carbonite.com carbonite.  You install it on your PC. I've got it running right now on the PC.  In fact, you could try it free for two weeks right now.  If you go to carbonite.com and use the offer code Leo.  No credit card, nothing. You just try it.  And what happens is immediately starts backing up your precious files,  financial documents, photos, music, in my case, podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I thought of carbonite when I heard about the the the incident, the caps.  No, no, no. The caps for time.  Well, there's a good example.  You got if you got a 200 gigabyte hard drive filled with valuable files.  How are you going to get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they measure uploads as well as downloads?  Yes, they do. I think that's pure usage.  Oh, carbonite's got to really listen and pay attention and do something about this.  Well, fortunately, most of us don't have caps yet.  It is unlimited from carbonite's end.  And I've uploaded, I think more than 50 gigabytes worth of podcasts.  Five dollars a month, less than five dollars a month.  It's secure. It's encrypted at your end, 128 bit encrypted and at carbonite's end.  And so your privacy is absolutely secure.  You don't have to worry about that restoration.  Just a couple of clicks in the mouse.  Now, look, your backup has to include local backup and we do that.  But it also has to include off site backup.  And that's why I really think carbonite is a great solution.  It just happens back back up in the background without you're paying any attention to it.  It's doing it right now.  I don't have to worry about losing podcasts anymore.  I want you to give it a try.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E carbonite.com.  If you do use the two week free trial and you sign up, you get two months free as well.  But you have but you have to do the trial.  Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  Two months free with the offer code TWIT.  Carbonite.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I ask one question about carbonite?  Yes, sir.  And maybe maybe I'm misremembering because my brain is is idiotic.  But I thought at some point that they didn't upload media like like if you have anything.  So it's anything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah. I mean, it's great.  Believe me, if it weren't to be threes, I'd be in trouble.  Okay, good. Well, good.  Because that was what my worries.  No, no, it is. No, absolutely.  The thing is, it doesn't do external drives is what's on your computer.  On the core drives.  On the core drives.  So what I do is we back it up to a NAS drive and it's on the hard drive.  I had to tell Dane this.  Dane said, well, it's on the NAS.  So I deleted it from my local computer.  I said, no, Dane, that's not a backup.  That's just a copy somewhere else.  You have to have two to have a backup.  Especially off site.  Yeah. So that's exactly right.  We let back up locally.  Immediately after the show, I put it on the NAS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so even like home movies like AVI, that kind of thing.  Okay, because I was under the impression.  Oh, no, I'm very excited to hear this.  This is good news for me then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Moving along Netflix notches, it's two billionth delivery, ladies and gentlemen.  The two billionth disk.  Two billion was sent.  It was want to take a guess what the two billionth movie was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it a recent movie?  I know already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know already?  I was going to say it's probably one of your favorites.  Yeah, it was a recent movie.  I haven't seen it actually.  You haven't seen it?  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's too rom com for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's rom com?  Romantic comedy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't have enough syllables.  Yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  My I'm moving too fast.  I can't say romantic comedy.  I have to say rom com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that it?  Is your life so fast that you don't have time to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's just something that people say.  Yeah, I read a lot of movie reviews.  Anything with Jennifer Aniston, rom com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally.  Anything with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a clue as to what the movie was?  Hugh Grant, rom com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the last movie Hugh Grant made?  Rom com.  No, he had a movie just came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did.  He did?  He did.  Four weddings and a funeral.  No, no, no, no.  They're all the same.  It's all Hugh, Bean, Charmin.  It's not Love Actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the one after that.  Oh, or some Notting Hill.  Notting Hill was good.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Runaway Bride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a two year old.  You know that one.  The Runaway Romcom.  What do you read to your two year old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She loves actually the old Laura Ingalls Wilder,  Little House on the Prairie.  You're reading her that?  That's very advanced.  That's a chapter book.  She loves it.  And like we sit down to have a meal and she goes,  this is as tasty as a bear.  And you know, because they ate a bear.  Isn't that cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Little House on the Prairie.  I read them all.  That is so cute.  1400 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read them and I read them on my daughter because they're great books.  So not Runaway Bunny, not Goodnight Moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She loves Runaway Bunny and Goodnight Moon,  but she's at that age now where she wants to get into more advanced stuff.  Chapter books.  How old is she?  She just turned five.  Oh, she's five.  Yeah.  But we started reading when she was barely four.  She's not quite reading it, but she wants to hear it read to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  She's not reading on her own.  More intricate stories.  Five is so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found, and somebody uploaded to my dropio the other day,  Henry and Abby.  When Henry was eight and Abby was ten on the screensavers.  I'm almost bursting into tears seeing that.  I mean, that wasn't that long ago, but they sure look different now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were tiny.  They were little.  They were really little.  I remember Abby being shy and having a lunchbox.  And it's just very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have those pictures when you brought Abby over to Santa Clara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you uploaded them.  Thank you so much for uploading those to Flickr.  I sent them to Abby.  She's in France.  I said, remember this?  That was the one where she said,  why are these people lined up for your autograph?  And I said, well, it's really not the signature.  It's that they want to have a moment with you and kind of talk to you.  She said, and she was what?  Eight, seven.  She said, why don't you give them a vial of your spit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said that at that age?  That's awesome.  You would do that, Brian.  I would, actually, especially if my daughter asked me to do anything for her.  Vials of spit.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't know how we got this.  Yeah, what was the two billionth disc?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It started at RomCom.  RomCom.  It was Nick and Nora's infinite playlist.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The two billionth disc was delivered to Clay Shannon,  a Netflix subscriber in Birmingham, Alabama, from the company's distribution.  Hello, Clay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure he's watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, Clay.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Can I just say, who cares?  I'll tell you why you care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You care because he just got free lifetime Netflix.  OK, well, good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Congratulations.  But it's like, aren't we all on digital distribution now?  Isn't that like saying who got the 100 millionth magazine the other day?  It kind of is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of over, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you rent Netflix?  You know what's funny is I signed up for Netflix because they're a sponsor of Scam School  using the Scam School code.  What is that code?  Go ahead, get it out.  I don't remember.  I think it's Netflix.com slash Scam School.  Roger, do you know?  You work for that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can just do slash Tekzilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's spelled T-E-K-Z-I-L.  No, that's not right.  But what's funny is I signed up for it and I have watched over the last year exactly one disc,  one physical disc.  Everything else has been there, digital distribution, which I love.  It's like I sat there a whole day watching nothing but weird documentaries.  King Korn, Who Killed the Electric Car, Fistful of Quarters, The King of Kong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I still use Netflix.  I do both, but there's still a lot of discs that are not available through their on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if they were available on demand, you wouldn't ever want the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you also notice that they swap out titles from the on demand.  You know about Feet Flicks.  Have you seen Feet Flicks?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, you got to see this.  It's actually really depressing.  Go to FeetFlicks.com.  And you connect to your Netflix.  Well, actually, if you all go, we're in trouble.  Don't everybody.  Don't.  Oh, it's down.  You killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to love wielding that kind of uncontrollable power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kick it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kick it on.  I'm on on the page that I went to before.  So anyway, Feet Flicks, what you do is you connect to your Netflix account and then it  tells you how much per movie you're paying.  So I did it based on how often you return it.  Right.  So I did it.  Ninety two dollars a movie.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the matter with you people?  How is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't return it enough.  You know what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Postage required.  You've got no excuse.  To me, it's like a DVD player.  Yeah.  Use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, some of the some of these.  I don't get it.  Why is it so hard?  On demand stuff, though, the quality.  They took a lot of stuff from Stars and their encoding kind of sucks.  Oh, really?  Is that how they got it?  Is it from Stars?  Not all of it.  Some of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So some of it when you start them up on that, you're talking about the digital distribution,  right?  Yeah, it starts off with a Stars movie.  My daughter watches the underdog movie a hundred times over and over again with the digital.  It's cool because we do it on the Xbox.  She goes up and she hits go and my mother's underdog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My other issue is I actually have a surround sound setup, so I enjoy surround sound.  You don't get that with the direct.  So, you know, unless I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, that's interesting.  Do you think that you're calm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a common situation or maybe for people who've invested money in their in their home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not.  It's not going to look good enough for you anyway.  You're going to want to see.  Well, now here's the thing.  Actually, the issue I wanted to bring up was I just got an email from Netflix.  They say, oh, by the way, you want Blu-ray discs.  You have to pay more.  Yeah.  Six bucks extra a month.  What the hell?  First, it was one buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to cancel.  I think I think there's not enough Blu-ray people.  What's the deal with?  No, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think for the most part, people just don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think the thing is there's not enough subscribers for the Blu-ray discs to make  carrying a parallel inventory worthwhile without charging.  That's why they charge more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uncertain.  When you're moving physical stuff, it's ridiculous.  Everything gets super expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have to carry two of the same movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's their business model.  What are you talking about?  That's their business model.  You have to move physical stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you have to carry inventory, you can't say you have 100 of the same movie.  Now you've got to carry 25 of the Blu-ray.  You've got to make sure the Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying it's because nobody's doing Blu-ray.  I don't think there's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five bucks more a month.  I think there's not enough.  I think also like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm canceling.  There's not going to be one fewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only other thing I think of is that they're not getting a deal on getting Blu-ray discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the deals with Netflix, isn't it?  That they have the Hollywood subsidizes the cost of the DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the Blu-ray could be a totally different.  The Blu-ray.  So starting April 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all the Blu-ray.  The Internet.  You're going to use Netflix.  I'm using the Google.  I use the Netflix to get my movies.  Sorry about that, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to me like Netflix has known since day one that the moving physical inventory  days were numbered.  And I think it's brilliant the way they got started with the watch it now.  And I love what they're doing for it.  But it kind of makes me sad that they're even celebrating, you know, Blu-ray.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Blu-ray.  I want Blu-ray.  I have a Sony PlayStation 3 and that's a perfect Blu-ray player.  And what I've done on Netflix when it was HD DVD, I said, OK, I prefer HD DVD.  Now it's Blu-ray.  And now they're charging me six.  I mean, six bucks a month is a lot.  I mean, what is the Netflix is 20 bucks.  I mean, that's a 50% or 30% increase.  I think it's.  I mean, again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six bucks a month.  I mean, no, it's not a lot of money, but too much for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes me what it what it does is make me say, OK, I'm just going to get DVD.  I don't care about the Blu-ray.  Right.  But that's exactly not what they want to do because it's not what the Blu-ray

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  consortium wants to happen.  But for Netflix, I mean, it doesn't matter one way.  They're going to they're going to charge you for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just have this picture of Sony, Sony for once ever actually winning a format war.  And they're just standing alone in the arena.  Yeah, nobody cares.  They're like, we want we want nobody's there watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is like, you know, the Blu-ray players are still pricey,  relatively speaking, to DVDs.  The Blu-ray discs are title for title are still more expensive.  It's just, you know, why would people want to upgrade?  I mean, most people, a majority of people, I still think, you know,  might have a regular TV.  They don't have any TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think there are a lot of those folks and then folks like me who just simply,  I know it looks better if I if it was if it was given to me, I'd be glad.  And I would watch it and say, well, it looks better.  But I don't care enough to pay extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the bigger issue, though, is especially with a lot of people,  they tend to watch movies not at home.  They tend to watch on the go on a laptop.  And then what's the point of Blu-ray for that?  If you're not going to if you can't if unless you have a Blu-ray drive,  you're kind of you're so well.  Right. So you get the one you can you drop it in while you're on a flight,  you know, from New York out to San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what is that six bucks as a percentage of the entire of the regular cost of Netflix?  We'll say 33 percent.  OK, are Blu-ray movies when you're watching them on your laptop?  One third better.  Yeah. Is it 30 or better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So is this the end of the line for Blu-ray?  Is this like kind of the nail in the coffin that puts them out of business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll still survive, but I think it'll be one.  It's an audio. It's a video file format.  And it's like a SACD or a laserdisc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it'll survive among video files.  I think among the people who for whom that is really important to get a cinematic experience  and they'll be happy to pay that ridiculous premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be funny if they start shipping those out to movie theaters.  Like, here's your movie that you're going to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The tracking we are.  So what is when you when you go to a like a digital movie theater,  the 4K ones.  Well, not 4K.  No, just when you're going to like the regular DLP cinema,  which we have here in Petaluma.  That's probably not that's 1080p, I bet.  Right. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I wouldn't you know, and the thing is, that's 2K.  If you sit close enough, you can see the aliasing.  So it's not.  Alamo Draft House.  How close do you sit there?  Usually like, yeah, like either at the first row of the middle aisle or like in the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where we'll find Roger Chang when we go to the movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I usually sit in the back because I can't stand sitting too close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't. I don't understand why they make seats like that.  I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make it for people like me who show up late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Late.  You know, I was in an IMAX movie.  It was the Monsters vs. Aliens the other night.  How was that?  It was pretty cute.  I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it like kid cute or adult?  No, it was adult.  It was adult cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't Pixar cute.  No, they're not quite there, but they're way better than they used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So who did it?  It's not Pixar?  It's Dreamworks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dreamworks is never quite Pixar.  It's nothing else.  They're getting close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how to put my finger on it, but there's something missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kung Fu Panda got panned by so many movie critics and I loved it.  No, I thought it was great.  It's like, what?  Wait, are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're officially off topic now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's weird to me, I understand, Brian, why you're seeing it.  Why is Roger Chang?  Why is Sarah Lane?  Why are they going to see kid movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they have adult, you know, they have those adult jokes where the adults go,  plus it's like, it's three Bs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Parents who are forced to bring their child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the parents laugh way too loud and you go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because we've reached the age where we want our youth back, Leo.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're in your late 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went because I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not in my late 20s anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you early 30s?  Yes.  God, I feel so old.  I feel so old.  That means I must be in like my 70s now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're 85.  Oh my God.  But you look great.  You know what?  The truth is out.  I'm glad you got your eyes done.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get the little talk.  He's late 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Late 70s and he's still.  Who's that?  William Shatner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's mostly bionic now, by the way.  He won a Streamy Award, didn't you see?  Yeah.  Was he there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He defeated my friend, Brett Rounsevel, the Amtrakr.  He got defeated by.  Did you go to the Streamy Sprats?  No, I wanted to, but I had a show in Michigan.  So I was in Michigan.  That's a kiss of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I really wanted to, but I had a show in Michigan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But my point, and I do have one, was that we went to the IMAX theater.  We got their lay.  We had to sit way up close.  And although I liked the movie, it was too close.  I was like kind of.  And it was 3D.  We had the 3D glasses and I was sort of sick the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IMAX is the worst for that.  You have to sit in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to the left, not to the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right in the middle.  There's one good seat in the whole IMAX theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm fine sitting all the way in the back row.  I said problem.  Did you have to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to see Superman Returns.  And the bad news on that in IMAX was that they put a little icon on the screen.  Put the glasses on, you put the glasses on.  Oh, it's 3D, it's 3D.  Take the glasses off.  Okay, take the glasses off.  Now it's normal.  During the movie?  Yes.  That is the reason.  Why was only part of the movie in 3D?  It spoiled the movie because I'm busy thinking,  am I supposed to wear the glasses now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had the exact same experience with The Dark Knight.  I saw The Dark Knight in IMAX and I wish I didn't because  the IMAX scenes look great but the moment I'm like, why is it suddenly so fuzzy?  And I'm like, oh, because it's not IMAX anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually went back and saw it in a regular theater because I couldn't follow the plot.  I was too busy worrying about my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This week in IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I watched Coraline in 3D.  Coraline would be probably good.  And it was great.  From start to finish it was all 3D.  But it was all 3D.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can do that with the digital movies, the computer graphics movies because that's just  automatic.  Sure.  But it's a big deal, I would guess, to film a 3D real live action film so they don't do it for the  whole movie because Christian Bale will scream at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they sort of can.  You're an amateur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You and I, we're done.  Professionally, we're done.  We're done.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're done.  You're a nice guy.  That's the best part.  You're a nice guy.  But we're done professionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For 3D, you just need to have two cameras less than a foot away from each other.  But it's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, because the Dark Knight folks certainly didn't have that kind of a budget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That movie was great though.  I really loved it.  It was a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't see it in IMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't like it as much as Batman Begins.  I agree.  Batman Begins was so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm curious, why didn't you like it better than Batman Begins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Heath Ledger was good, but that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I tell you what, Batman Begins pulled an awesome magic trick.  It was like three quarters of the way movie through.  And all of a sudden, I realized, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  This is a comic book movie.  How did they do that?  How did I not realize the whole way long that this is a comic book movie?  Dark Knight from the very first scene, I'm like, this is a comic book movie.  I mean, nothing wrong with comic book movies, but I thought it was such an exemplary.  It was all action.  Yeah, I disagree.  And realistic.  If somebody really was going to be the Batman, he was going to be like it was in Batman Begins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I liked Batman Begins.  I liked it.  Katie Holmes is kind of a stinker.  I like the Dark Knight a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other movies do we want to talk about?  Who likes The Godfather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I completely lost the thread of the conversation.  Okay, so anyway, Blue Ray is dead.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Digital.  I care because I spent a lot of money on watching Blue Ray and I'm a little disappointed.  Save yourself the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you buy a PS3 or did you buy a standalone Blue Ray player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I own two PS3s.  One for here, one for home.  See, there's one right there.  But I like how crisp it looks on a nice screen, but I have to say it's not worth six bucks.  Isn't that weird?  Because that's kind of chintzy.  It's not worth six bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, look at it this way.  I mean, is it worth paying if you use the discs as much as you do?  Is it worth paying double every time?  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, go to feedflix.com, enter in your credentials and you'll see how much Netflix costs.  Not only that, it tells you how you rank with the rest of it.  I'm like 99%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I don't return movies.  Sometimes I'll have a movie for six months.  I still have Michael Clayton.  I've had that disc for six months now.  That's a good movie.  You should watch it.  Well, I ordered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great performance from, what's his name?  That guy.  That guy.  He's great.  Love him.  George Clooney.  Isn't he great?  Yeah.  Even guys like George Clooney.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone has a crush on George Clooney.  Even guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not go bromance again because that really hurt my reputation on the Net at Night.  Oh, I'm sorry, Leo.  The Brodio?  Yeah.  Wasn't good.  What are you laughing at, Roger?  The Brodio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a funny word.  I say it when I can.  It's a ridiculous term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you watch Hulu, Roger.  Let's talk about Hulu.  Hulu, this is so pathetic.  Hulu is trying to eliminate piracy, I guess.  The problem with Hulu is that they've been, Boxxy will rebroadcast Hulu.  They want you to go to the webpage, right?  Even though the ads are still there, I don't know why.  It's for some reason they want you to go to the webpage.  So they've taken steps to thwart non-traditional browsers, aka Boxxy,  by using JavaScript to encode HTML sent to the browser.  It's like you could figure out a workaround in this in like three seconds.  They did in three seconds.  But it's interesting that they're really trying to keep people from doing the Boxxy thing.  They asked Boxxy not to do it.  It was hacked within minutes.  Is Hulu misguided and trying to eliminate this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a theory about this, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think it points to a bigger issue.  That's kind of the ad-supported model that a lot of these services basically base  their entire structure on.  Put the microphone right in front of your lips.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And whether or not it's something that can continue the way it is,  or do they have to actually insert their own ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not very many ads.  It's just a couple ads.  It's not too bad.  I like Hulu.  I watch a lot of calling.  Colleen watches Hulu all the time.  I like watching it on Boxxy.  I don't see what the problem is with me watching on Boxxy.  What's your theory, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hulu loves Boxxy, and they want to make it happen,  but they're bowing to pressure by NBC and the old school team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they say.  It's the content providers that are forcing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Hulu is winning share every minute that everybody continues to go to Hulu,  whether it's on Boxxy or whatever.  They don't care.  They get the eyeballs.  So they need to do some lip service to the powers that be.  So they pay some people to come up with the weakest attempts to move forward.  It's the old lip service content protection.  Hey, we're trying to fight so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Apple does.  You can never rip an iPod with its music.  Every idiot can do it, but it's lip service content protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  I think so.  I think it is in Hulu's best interest to continue to have Boxxy plus Hulu be the ultimate  set-top-box solution.  And if they could drag their feet, then all of a sudden, a year from now,  they'll have X percent of the entire video watching market.  That's what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want a good percentage of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  So then they could turn and say, hey, can we renegotiate the way we're doing this?  This is a little bit ridiculous.  I think this is all part of Hulu's master plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think for an end user, this confuses because I think of Hulu as NBC Fox, but it's not, right?  It's not.  It's totally not.  It's like it's its own business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They have worked very hard to establish licenses with all these guys,  and this is a case where they're having the pinch put on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was NBC Universal that created Hulu and that it was a division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could be totally wrong.  I'm an idiot who gets paid to stick nails in his eyes,  but I thought I remembered a Wired article saying about the guy who started Hulu  and about how hard he worked to establish all these partnerships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always complicated with these relationships to know who's what.  They probably put money into it, but at the same time...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, they could have been an initial investor and then turn around trying to establish control,  but I thought Hulu was its own animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're being very clear when they say,  oh, it's the content creators that are making us do this.  I mean, it's clear that they don't want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Hulu's been pretty straight up that there's a disagreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more and just a bit of nice...  Somebody sent me...  Or maybe it was in the chat rooms or it was on a forum,  but they said, you don't need to tease us through the commercials.  We'll watch them.  Well, we'll listen.  You don't need to tease us.  But coming up in just a bit, Wired.com is gutted.  Gutted.  And some of my favorite people laid off at the Chronicle.  I'm very sad about that.  This is a bad, the usual depressing media roundup of layoffs.  Before we...  I shouldn't do that right now.  Before that...  Before we do that, here's a fine commercial.  From our sponsor.  We're making money.  The new media is doing fine, thanks to people like Citrix.  It's really interesting how some advertisers are perfectly happy going,  no, no problem.  We'll go to new media.  And I hate to be kind of the agent of change, but the times are changing.  Citrix is a really good example.  Citrix does GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC.  They're a great company.  I've known them for years.  I remember hanging out at Comdex.  That shows you how long I've known them with the founder, Ed Iacobucci.  I mean, this has always been a great company.  They do the best remote access stuff with GoToMyPC.  And GoToMeeting is their meeting software, a new and better way to meet with clients  and colleagues.  The old way is you get on the phone, but the phone meeting...  There's always a guy on his BlackBerry answering email.  He's going, what?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Did you say something?  Or you meet in person, which means you got to travel across the country  or you drive across town.  It's expensive.  It takes a lot of time.  The new way to meet, the way to do it, GoToMeeting.  It's like meeting in person, but it's less time consuming.  It's less expensive.  And this is, to me, the big deal.  It's just more productive.  It's more engaging.  It's more fun for everybody, including your clients.  If you haven't tried GoToMeeting, I want you to try it.  We do it all the time.  We actually do it on some of our shows.  We use GoToMeeting so that, like, Ray Maxwell can show you screens  in Maxwell's house.  It's very simple.  He sets it up ahead of time.  So he sends an email, clicks a link, and then I get an email saying,  join this GoToMeeting at 2 o'clock on Wednesday.  But you can also do it when you're on the phone.  By the way, built-in, free teleconferencing and voice over IP.  So it's very easy to use.  You can already set up the conference at GoToMeeting and say, look,  I want to show you the PowerPoint.  I want to show you these drawings.  I want to show you the website.  You go to GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  Suddenly, your client or your colleague, whoever you're doing this meeting with,  sees your screen on their computer.  Real time, just like they're there.  They can follow along with you as you move among pages or applications for  sales presentations, product demos.  You can do it for training, for collaboration.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  Here's how.  You go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  30 days, absolutely free.  It'll give you a really good idea of what you can do with this.  But I do warn you, you're going to try it and you're going to get hooked.  It's that good.  We use it now.  I have so many GoToMeeting accounts.  We use it in so many different ways.  We just used a GoToMeeting meeting with Telos to talk about our new mixer system.  For technical stuff, it's really great.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  So now the bad news, kids.  What?  Condi Nast laid off a bunch of people.  And now I think, according to a Valley Wag, an esteemed source.  Oh, they're never wrong.  An esteemed source.  Even Leander Kahaney got laid off.  Which is really sad.  It sounds like the print magazine is trying to save itself by killing the digital side,  which is, I think, the wrong way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, really bizarre and backward.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my question is, how is the digital side doing?  Is Wired.com as a digital entity?  Well, it never does well, but that's all we've got, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, what's the future of a print magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I think that Wired, I'm one of the few people, I don't subscribe to the print magazine.  It's my favorite magazine.  That's what I'm talking about.  It used to be.  I happen, I read Wired.com, but I don't subscribe.  But people love Wired the magazine.  They really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that low contrast print.  You love the way it looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You love the way it's laid down.  The white on silver.  And I think that they're trying to sort of go with that.  There's sort of this love that people have for the print magazine.  They know they can get it online.  They don't want that.  They want the magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  And I bet what happens is they sit down.  They're like, look, we got to pick a side.  We're trying to be winners at two different games.  We can't play two games simultaneously.  How are we doing in online?  We're X number place.  How are we doing in print?  We're this number place.  And my guess is they say what we need to do is we need to specialize.  We need to focus like a laser and be just one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really think that's the future though?  I mean, in the long run of a magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the long run, no.  But what happens is, is magazines, there's still, I think, always going to be a place  for magazines because you get a depth of story in a magazine that you can't get in a daily  website type scenario.  Some of the best stories on wire.com are more the end up like, did you read about the diamond  high story?  Yeah, that was a good one.  It was phenomenal.  And that was that's classic monthly print media journalism right there.  And so I think I think it may be the right call.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a tough one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe they just weren't pulling enough revenue.  Maybe they were hoping that the website could be self-sufficient and they wouldn't have to  keep funneling off money from the print side in order to keep it sustainable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, in a perfect world, everybody wants both.  If you get to the point where you got to cut and you're wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't have that luxury, really, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they, you know, in the long run, they might have made the more solid choice by leveraging.  Really?  You think so?  I mean, if you're looking down three years and whether or not you're going to be solving  in three years, you're going to want to go with the solution that brings the cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine you had two futures, one where there is only wire.com and one where there's only  Wired the Magazine.  Three years from now, if you're going to place a bet, where are you going to place  your bet that which one of those will definitely be alive three years from now?  And I can't say that wire.com would be my first choice.  As opposed to Wired the Magazine?  I think the Wired the Magazine will be around three years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be very contrary to the rest of the world where, I mean,  print and the cost of printing these things, I mean, it's all going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I think it's a different branch on the tree of what people want.  I think there will never be a time that people, well, actually, I shouldn't say that.  When we all have our own portable Kindles and we're downloading stuff all the time.  But I think for right now, I get excited about plane flights when I know I have a new Wired  Magazine in my book bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two people in the chat room said the same thing just now.  And Wired just launched.  People love to have that physical.  I think they probably think-  It'll become niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll become, it's a smaller market than it was.  I'm not saying that people don't love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People love newspapers, but they're going out of business.  I mean, it's not an issue of whether people love it.  It's whether there's a financially viable model.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think probably if I were Wired, if there was something that you could cut and then  build back up, if it made sense later on, the online division is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're not killing the entire online entity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but as you start laying off these people, it becomes harder and harder.  It's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I think they think they're just keeping operations where they're sustainable.  And then they're going to build up their-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to build their runway is what you're saying.  They're going to try to survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're going to survive, you just can't place your bet.  I hope that's the case.  I think it's something that they're going to do in order to hunker down and weather  the recession.  Right.  And then when times are good, they're going to start expanding again.  But I don't think they have the luxury of spending more money than they can afford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. Nobody does.  I mean, look at the San Francisco Chronicle.  I mean, I'm crushed.  Joel Selvin, some of my favorite writers from the Chronicle have been laid off.  This company is losing a million dollars a week.  So they want to keep-  It's so heartbreaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yet I read SFGate, which is their online division of-  That's how I read my Chronicle during the week.  Sometimes I get it on the weekend, but that's how I've been reading it for the last few years.  It just kills me.  So it's like I'm heartbroken and yet I'm part of the problem.  You're part of the problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what?  I don't subscribe to the Chronicle.  You're right.  I don't get the bridge person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get on Saturday if I've got time and I want to sit down and read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting- I think that goes back to what Brian said.  In the model, a daily publication against a web model, I think the web would win out  because it's every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  How about this?  Ars Technica, 17 people laid off, including David Chartier, who was a great writer.  I mean, that's a big loss as well.  Here's my question.  Now all of a sudden you've got all these people laid off.  You've got these mainstream print guys gone and gals.  You've got now these online people gone.  Where are they going to find jobs?  Are they going to be working at Denny's?  Are they going to be building their flair collection at Applebee's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there'll be a lot more personal blogging.  That's a whole other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And can that support a person?  Can a human being make a living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe me, I've tried.  I don't think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's one of those things where you leverage the knowledge you have and you either  do something immediate like consulting or you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Consulting.  Yeah, there's the end of the line.  I'm a consultant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's hiring a consultant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, my dad was a structural engineer for like eight years before he got laid off.  And when he got laid off, he went into real estate.  Three years in real estate, he bought a restaurant and ran on his truck for 25 years.  Now he's a seafood guy.  Yeah.  So it's not unheard of to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's the future, isn't it?  Nobody's going to hold a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to be flexible.  That's already kind of come to pass.  In the industrial age, you had a job, you worked 40 years.  For life.  You got the gold watch.  You got the pension and you were done.  But nowadays, I mean, who works a job for 40 years?  You do five years one place and then you either jump ship or get laid off.  Five years is a long time.  Nowadays, yeah, it's forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you look at even broadcast.  I mean, I've talked to a lot of the shooters who like, you know, now they've-  Oh, they're all out of work, aren't they?  They're not just the ones that are still around.  They've picked up editing.  They've done a lot of audio.  They've picked up new skills in order to be able to offer a client, you know,  a entire turnkey solution instead of-  The predator.  The what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The predator.  The predator?  What's that?  It's the producer, shooter, editor.  The predator.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm everything, but it's also eliminating jobs.  As I sit here switching cameras, recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doing it all.  I do it all.  There's no camera operator.  There's no tape operator.  You're a predator in the-  I'm the worst kind of predator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no Leo.  There's just a distortion field of various hiding there.  I'm not even here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm down drinking wine at Gary's Wine.  Yeah.  Wow.  But, you know, in a way that is what we're doing here because I couldn't afford to do  what Revision 3 is doing, let alone what, you know,  Krone is doing, what Channel 4 is doing.  I had to do something really cheap.  So we have locked down cameras.  I'm running the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it works.  It works.  It works really well for you, but-  Is it going to work for everybody?  You know, 10 years ago to put this together, there'd be a lot more jobs in this cottage.  Well, and there is also-  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there isn't the revenue to support all those jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the audience has changed now too to where it's not a detriment to know that you're the  one changing the cameras and doing the processing and the hands-on stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The expectations have shifted, especially with online people are so used to watching,  you know, really shaky YouTube cameras and like people doing podcasts from their bedroom  with a big white wall behind them.  Yeah.  You know, a yellow screen-  Is that going to work?  I mean-  But, you know, I think people as, you know, try things, see what works and go with that.  You know, things that don't work will automatically just kind of bust out by themselves.  I don't know.  We're going through a tremendous change period, not just because of technology,  but because of economic concerns.  It's a complete inflection point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything is changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you imagine the shift to the industrial revolution for people who did nothing but work  on a farm from sunup till sundown, now you have to be somewhere from these specified hours,  you have to work for five hours and maybe you can get a lunch for 30 minutes and then you got to  finish out the rest of your day working in this line, pounding the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you guys are dealing with this.  I mean, you've been kind of in this transition, but Sarah and Roger, I mean,  you were in mainstream media and now you're in new media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roger and I were in college together.  We majored in broadcasting.  Oh, that's at San Francisco State or-  Yeah.  Graduated and thought we were going to be broadcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they taught you in 98, what did they, did they think that the world was going to  continue as is?  I mean-  No.  Oh, definitely not.  They knew it.  Even in 98, it was obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the tools were for, yeah, we took a desktop video class.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CJ Grant's desktop video.  But that's an interesting question.  Well, can you teach somebody-  It was Adobe Premiere.  It was Adobe Premiere 4 on a Mac, power Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was all we had access to and it was like, whoa, this is a pretty cutting edge kind of a  thing. This is the future. They knew it was the future, certainly, but it wasn't when we  got out of school and got jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, was what they taught you useful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Definitely. I took a web class.  We were ahead of the curve getting out of school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were offering HTML scripting courses. They were telling you, you could take a web  course, learn how to build a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems like that stuff changes so fast that what you would have learned though isn't, I mean,  how many people use HTML anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see, that's the thing is it's not just the detailed stuff that you learn. You understand-  It's the concepts.  It's the concepts. It's understanding how things can work together and ultimately,  it's not, you don't necessarily need to know how to code three different languages per  old PHP or C all at the same time, but you do know what each of those languages can provide  and why you would want it to support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I'm kind of thinking about this myself. I actually have been asked to talk to my  daughter's high school about what they should be teaching to kids, 15, 16, 17 year old kids now.  One of the things I wonder is, well, is there anything you could teach them  from a technological point of view that will make any difference in eight years?  It's going to, don't we know it's going to be completely different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that there is value to them knowing what's going on now so that they can understand  when it changes how it's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. I mean, all you can teach is what-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I mean, your only alternative is just to not teach them anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking maybe you teach them things that you know aren't going to change  ethics, like critical thinking, how to write, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to focus on the concepts and the principles because camera technology has  changed a lot since I left state, but the principles about shooting, how things are shot-  Some things don't change. Three point lighting.  Yeah, that's true.  Why things look good, why things don't look good. One of the things I think they should  really bring back, and I don't think people kind of laugh at me when I say this, is they  need to bring back home ec. I think people- People don't know how to cook anymore.  People don't know how to cook.  Yeah, who needs to cook?  People don't know how to manage their own-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never sew home ec.  Free packaged meals.  Everyone I've dated has done it.  Can you sew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Can you? Do you darn your socks, Roger?  I can't even sew a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I can sew- See, that's the thing. I can sew a button, but it's things like  being able to balance your own budget.  Balancing your checkbook would be nice.  The economic side of home ec.  I've met four-year graduates who still cannot get their heads around balancing their-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's pretty pathetic. You need to be able to balance your checkbook.  But that's the thing. It's not instilling in people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in what class does anyone ever teach you sort of the basics of life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or they teach you how to make enough money, as I have, to hire somebody to do that for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even understanding the basics of business, being an entrepreneur, you need to know-  I have people to do that.  ...how you make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think that's the thing is we've entered the age where everybody needs to think  of themselves as an entrepreneur. Even if you work for a major company, you need to  think of yourselves as a personal services corporation with a staff of exactly one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bingo. Actually, as I've been thinking about that, that's exactly what I was going to tell  this school is teach people entrepreneurship. It's not like you're going to start your own  business, but that's how you- Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Self-sufficiency is-  Very good.  ...there's nothing more important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Being able to cook for yourself, being able to manage your own finances.  People think, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, people, well, that's kind of a given, but  there's lots of people who really don't understand that. They don't understand why they don't have  any money at the end of the month when they're blowing 50 bucks on drinks every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of working for somebody else-  Why the credit card's gone out of control.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think of after all this time, credit card debt, you think, well, we all know better,  right? It's a huge, huge problem. Gets away from everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now it's not a problem because it's over. No, you're not getting another credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you saying, Brian?  I was just saying, thinking of employee productivity and taking responsibility for yourself.  That reminds me of another story about employee productivity involving Facebook and YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny that you can say that. Go ahead, tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, just that there's a study that says-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, you've become the Dvorak on the show. I think that's great, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm here with a mission.  Yeah, keep us on track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Brian, we talked about this on Twif on Friday. I guess you weren't watching.  Oh, did you?  But do go on.  I missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I missed that as well, and I was in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then you're uniquely qualified to comment on it.  The study says that Facebook and YouTube at work make people better employees.  What's the story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could that possibly be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole idea is that it's a very, this is not a new concept. The concept is employees need breaks.  They need to mentally get away from their work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need a break right now.  That's from all this wine.  I actually have some more wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is hard. I need a break.  This is hard work.  But the point is that people, productivity will go down if people are worked to death.  And so Facebook is an escape. It's a chance to hang out with friends in a virtual sense.  YouTube is a place to watch a video of a dog running around in circles.  Yeah.  Yeah, or people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're just saying they need a better break room and that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, the study is that people, they get something out of taking breaks and they're  choosing to take breaks online, sitting at their desk rather than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we ask them to listen to podcasts and watch to it live?  I certainly would like that.  This Week in Fun is an excellent break from your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A 90 minute break for everyone.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know what this made me think of the moment I read this? Have you read...  Fire Eating?  Dan Ariely's book, Predictably Irrational.  Love that book.  Isn't that a great book?  Love that book.  One of the things he talks about in there is the difference between  market norms and social norms. And he talks about the way, this seems like the other side  of the coin. A lot of businesses are asking people to take personal responsibility and  apply social norms and saying, hey, we're a family here. I understand that you're off work right now,  but if you could use your Blackberry to check in on this one problem that we have, since we're all  family, would you mind doing that? The flip side is, if you're going to start using social norms  to get people to work in their off hours, the flip side is you got to keep social norms during  the nine to five times and allow people to act as socially people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In other words, you can't just use it when they're on their off hours and then turn off that  social dynamic.  Oh, that's interesting.  I actually agree with that because when you can build that bond, I think people will automatically  be more conscientious about things like, oh, I better send that to him. I know I'm on vacation,  but he really needs to know. I better send it out right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're building credit in their personal bank. The more that you allow people to act like an  adult while they're in the cubicle, the more that you can expect them to act like an adult and be  part of the family while they're off at the beach.  Instead of chattel.  Chattel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, instead of-  Chattel.  Instead of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it. You are my chattel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, if you're in a position where, okay, they're just looking at me as a  worker bee, a drone from nine to five, then screw it. After I get off, that's my time. Whatever work  has with me, they can deal with that. I'll deal with that tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was another good thing in that book, Predictably Irrational, where they asked,  what was it? They asked doctors, first they were going to pay doctors to do something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It was lawyers. They said, hey, the elderly need legal services. Would you mind providing  legal services for only $40 per session? And all the lawyers was like, are you kidding me?  40 bucks? What? I don't do that.  Then they set out the exact same set of lawyers. They're like, listen, elderly people need lawyers.  Would you mind doing it for free?  For free.  And they're like, yes, of course we will.  Pro bono.  We love the elderly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what was the rational-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point is the moment you involve money, monetary interaction, all of a sudden we have  different rules that we apply socially. For example, and the example they gave is if you  sit down to Thanksgiving with your grandmother and at the end of the evening you're like,  that was really good. Can I give you something for this grandma for about 40 bucks?  That is so insulting.  Exactly. And so we have different sets of rules for social norms versus  business norms, financial norms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's along the same lines. That's actually a great book. I want to recommend it as our Audible book  actually this week because it is on audible.com. And that's where I read it. I really loved it.  Dan Ariely, Predictably Irrational, The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. You can get  this for free, by the way. In fact, I'm going to set it up so you get two books for free. If you  go to audible.com slash twit two, the number two, that's where you sign up for the platinum  plan. It gives you two books a month, which is what I do because I need two books a month.  It's funny. I don't commute anymore, but I listen at the gym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I am a crazy audiobook nut.  Do you like them?  Because not only do I drive because I'm doing these shows all over the United States. So it's  like I'm driving and then I have to get through security and then I have to wait for my flight  and then I'm on the flight. It's like there's always time. And I love doing two things at the  same time. If I'm doing housework, I love just tuning into an audiobook and doing the dishes.  Well, are you a member of audible?  I am.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say you should really join here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I wanted to plug my favorite audiobook reader. Do you go by readers?  I do.  Will you read books just based on who narrates?  Who's your favorite reader?  He's passed away recently, but his name is Frank Muller. You knew exactly who he was.  As soon as you said he passed away.  He's phenomenal. And in fact, I was heartbroken when he got in that motorcycle accident and lost  his ability to read. And in fact, they set up the wave dancer foundation. I will read anything  that's been read by Frank Muller, which specifically that's what got me into Stephen King's The Dark  Tower series, The Gunslinger. Have you read those? He's phenomenal. In fact, Stephen King said  that his voice are the voices in his head as he writes The Dark Tower series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from the Shawshank Redemption.  Oh, so good. So good.  Yes, it really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you can trump Morgan Freeman, then I'm on board.  He sounds like Morgan Freeman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He kind of does. Listen, this is Frank Muller reading a little bit from the Shawshank Redemption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thousands of other items for men doing time here, some of them perfectly legal,  yet hard to come by in a place where you've supposedly been brought to be punished.  There was one fellow who was in for raping a little girl and exposing himself to dozens of others.  I got him three pieces of pink for a while.  That's what I'm saying. Good timing on there.  Welcome to raping a little girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's doing a character voice there, but he is such a good reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he's got a great voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And a wide variety as well. Like in The Dark Tower series, you hear him,  there are four primary characters. You hear him do a grizzled Clint Eastwood Gunslinger.  You hear him do a 12 year old boy. That didn't sound right. You hear him.  Don't do a 12 year old boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You hear him do a Southern black woman and a kid from New York. It's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frank Muller. Well, that's what's interesting about Audible is that you do.  It's a performance. It's not just somebody reading a book to you. It's a performance.  And Frank is one of the, was one of the greats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I ask a maybe stupid question? How does a man like Frank Muller become an  reader? Usually they're an actor.  And people recognize that he's got a voice that would be great for an audio book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it really is, I think it's a job for out of work actors or actors in between jobs.  And Audible's in near New York City. So they have studio, nine studios.  I've actually recorded a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they say, would you perhaps consider reading the Stephen Kings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so a lot of people make living doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it sounds like a great job.  Does this sound like fun?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Frank Muller would do cool tricks where he would actually, you could tell they're doing a  little bit, not, not enough for you to really notice, but a little bit of digital chicanery  where he would interrupt himself. Like when a character interrupts themselves in the book,  they would make sure to edit it that way. It was phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, I think there would be no better compliment than for someone to say,  I loved that book, The Shawshank Redemption. Sarah Lane was the best reader.  Yeah.  I mean, that would be really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when he does the other characters, is that like, I guess everything's written on a script  form and then they read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He reads it from the book. Some people, it's interesting when somebody like Jim Dale,  who does the Harry Potter books in the States, has a lot of character voices. He actually records  the voices and when he gets to that character, he'll listen back to the tape and say, oh yeah,  that's the voice and do the voice. So everybody sounds really different. And then some readers,  don't sound so different. And that's fine too. In fact, Stephen Fry, who reads the British version  of Harry Potter, doesn't do quite such a dramatic difference between characters.  And it's just a matter of taste. It is really interesting to hear different people do it.  It's a performance. These guys are actors or gals or actors. I mean, they're really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's tough is to go from when you're reading a series and somebody else does it.  Oh, and you're like, you're saying the names wrong. What are you doing?  Yeah. Do you find yourself like, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a while to get back to it? Let me ask you this, Brian. I don't know. Maybe this is just me,  but when I'm listening to a book, if I go back, I can remember where I was when I heard that part

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of the book. There's some sort of weird memory. You'll think of something like, I'll read a book  or I'll hear a phrase. I'd be like Nebraska. I was driving across Nebraska. Yeah. That's like a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There'll be a song that the first time I heard it or a certain moment on the radio where I was  going, you know, certain curve and sabbatical. And I always think of that, that curve, that curve  every time I hear it. Okay. So you do that with books. I've never done it with songs.  I never did that for me. Yeah. Oh yeah. It'll come to a moment in time and it's not even a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very significant moment. No, no, no, no. It's just where you heard it. It's just,  it's like a deja vu thing. Isn't that weird? Yeah. People often say that about songs and  it never did it for me, but books, it definitely does. Let's make our pick this week, predictably  irrational, the hidden forces that shape our decisions, Dan Ariely, but because it's a platinum,  you get two. So which one is the best? Frank Muller, you think? Oh man. If you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you really need to do the dark tower series. A lot of people, it's the only series as far as I know  that Stephen King did. And if you've read it, you know that all of his other books are secretly about  the dark tower. Isn't that wild? Cause there's all these weird little crossovers. You're absolutely  right. I never thought of it that way. Definitely read the dark tower series. Okay. There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two great audible picks. You join audible right now, audible.com slash twit two. We thank them  so much for their support. And by the way, Colleen, you know, she does this twit picks thing.  She's so great. I love Colleen. So she picks something. She listens to the shows and she  hears something and she's made predictably irrational. Our twit pick. So you can follow  twit picks on Twitter. It's twit picks, twitter.com slash twit picks, or go to twit.tv slash picks.  And we'll make that our, our pick of the day. Every day, a new pick from Colleen. She's,  she's so funny. She just, she just picks whatever gets her, gets her going. She just loves that.  Moving right along here. I think we're almost coming to the end of the show. Oh,  oh, this is a sad one. And I want everybody to take a moment.  Grab a glass of wine. Grab a glass of wine. Everybody got my C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this a solemn? We don't have to pour our wine out. Do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Solem occasion. No. Why? The end to our throat. Like, no. Yeah. Right. The end of Encarta. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh my God. The end of Encarta. By the way, this to me is blu ray story. Part two. Yeah. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The exact same story. It's the same isn't it? It is. I have to say I haven't used Encarta in a long.  No one has. That's why. I, I, back in the day, back way back in the day, we're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody got it free. 93 or. Yeah. No, no. Was it that far ago? Was that, maybe it was. Maybe it was.  Yeah. Yeah. Because I was still. That was when CD-ROMs were huge. Right. And how old were you? 12?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Well, no. I was a little older than that. You were pretty. You were 16.  Well, yeah, I was like 15. Yeah. But I mean, I love, I thought it was the best thing in the world.  I would look up. Do you have an age where you would have used it in school?  Yes. And in fact, I did. I did. I used some out in the Carta CDs. Look over here. I have every,  I have the world book encyclopedia. Yeah. When's the last time you pulled one of those out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I bought it for the kids. I thought when I was a kid, I use, I read the encyclopedia. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  loved reading the encyclopedia. And you know what? And then you realize that, especially when you go  do research papers for high school, you go through five different encyclopedias. You realize none of  them has all the. They're all crap. Yeah. But look. Wikipedia is so much better. But look at what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  kept Encarta alive was that it brought rich media. It brought the video files and stuff at a time  when the bandwidth of the internet was not sufficient to do that. There wasn't really much of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of like Blu-ray right now. You know what, Brian, I think you really have touched on an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  absolute analogy. Encarta going away is basically 10 years from now. Five years from now. We're  going to have that half the time. Here's to Blu-ray. Remember Blu-ray? Let's do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We miss it. We got the wine. Pour out a little liquor for our dead homies. Are you saying Larry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ellison was right about the whole. What did he say? Net computing or cloud computing, remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think he is. That's where all. We talked about this last week, but I didn't ask you guys,  what do you think of this on live thing that they announced at the game developers conference? And  it's from Steve Perlman, the guy who did Web TV. It's gaming in the cloud. Conceptually, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it could work if you had enough bandwidth. The problem is you're going to have. People don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have enough bandwidth. Not after the cap. This is so. Well, here's my. Here you want my conspiracy  theory. Yeah. Yeah, they're doing the cap unless you buy this special gaming package.  And that's, I think part of the reason you're seeing all of this is not just gaming,  premium services, but especially on live. I think online is going to need a couple of more  years of work. Here's what I think. I think Steve Perlman has already made the deal with Comcast  and Verizon. And they've said, maybe time Warner, you, you did give us quality service. You prioritize  our packets. You can charge 15 bucks a month extra on your cable bill and people will be able to play  on live better than they would be able to if they didn't. So net neutrality is now official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Net neutrality is dead because of online. I'll tell you, man, I've been infected by some games  and it's like there are times I would easily pay 50 bucks extra for prioritized packets. If I could  know that I had the better thing, I bingo that competitive nature. Now you don't pay 60 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for the game anymore. You're paying 15, 15 bucks a month. You get all the games you want. It's great  for a casual gamer, but serious gamers are going to say, well, this is pretty cool. If, if, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's a big if Roger. It's a big if, if it worked. I mean, the thing is you're essentially  allowing a remote server to process the game. So as soon as you do a little, you know, control,  that's the point you have to wait for that. You know, it's, you think it's not going to happen.  I don't think it's going to happen for another couple of years. I tell you in the meantime,  they think it's going to happen this fall. I, they're very optimistic from everything I've  read about everyone's experience with it. It's going to need a couple of years of tweaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, if you want an example of what they're doing right in video games, you use steam, don't you?  Yes. Steam is phenomenal. It is brilliant. It is so funny to watch Valve beat Microsoft at their  own game. They took the exact model that made Xbox live, king of the consoles. Doesn't everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  beat Microsoft at their own game ultimately? No, no, no, no. But see, there's a difference.  Microsoft's model on gaming has always been selling you the media. Right. Steam was basically removing  the entire distribution model and then just storing it online, which makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they were the ones to foster the community to where now you're sitting there, you're doing  a word processing document and then your buddy hops on, hops on left for dead. You're like, well,  hell, I want to, I want to be zombies with them. Steam, steam actually, I mean, there were instances

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of that before, but steam actually successfully married that aspect along with the download sales

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aspect of the games. What's amazing is they're also releasing all of their sales data or not  some of their sales data based on like these weird sales that they'll do. Like they'll just,  the game will come out in a month later out of nowhere. They'll say next three days,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this game's 20 bucks. You know, that's been a huge success for them too. They've made,  you know, they'll cut the price in half and they'll sell 10 times more, 300 times more.  So it's really been, I mean, I wait for the sales now, don't you? Oh, totally. And what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exciting too is like take a game like team fortress two, where they've released it. It's been out  forever, but they released tracking information that shows they'll come out with an update.  They'll just randomly add another map. They'll update a character and all of a sudden the sales  go through the roof again. This is a brilliant model. And it's, well, the best thing about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  steam is it's portable. So I have it here. I have it at home. It doesn't matter. Yeah. You can play  it on any machine that you want. You're not limited. And that's kind of, I don't have it here. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually don't play games here, Colleen. I don't, I don't play games. My brother came over and I had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  steam both on my laptop and my desktop and he was able just to log in. And because I had already  downloaded all the same games he had, he was able to just type in his name and start playing  on his account on my computer. It was phenomenal. No, it's, it's, it makes, that's ideally what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  video gaming industry should look like. I think the current issue is you basically have these  vertical, vertically integrated markets between Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. And you know,  it's, it's very, it's a very high barrier of entry for people want to develop games and, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sell them. It's, I don't know. That's my favorite thing about steam is how they're making  the sub $20 games economically viable. Like world of goo. You've played world of goo.  Haven't you? It's phenomenal. And I just started, somebody got me infected with a defense grid,  the awakening. It's phenomenal. It's, it's, is it like a real time, a real time strategy. They call  it a tower defense. Yeah. It's a tower defense. If you like tower defense games, it just scratches  that itch. What's it called? Defense grid, the awakening. Oh, you're going to love it. You're  going to love it. It's on steam. Yeah. It's probably like 10 bucks, right? It's like, I think it's 19  when I bought it. But I mean, who knows though, maybe a sale any minute now. Defense grid awakening,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the awakening. Yeah. Uh, you know, this is, it's interesting. Is this a model that others could,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is it just games? What they're doing just games right now. There are other people who are hopping  on it as well. Uh, Stardoc has a product called impulse, which has been essentially a carbon copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Impel. They had one before and then they overhauled it to be a little more, um, but it's just gaming.  It's, it's games, but I think they're Stardoc also writes their own software. So it's not hard to see  that they're going to start integrating. Impulse is not bad though. I liked, uh, I played the  political machine. That was a lot of fun. The bigger issue though is like, do you, I see two  models emerging. One is subscription based where you have game tap, where you pay a monthly fee,  you get access to everything versus steam, where you pay for the whole game and you can play it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  indefinitely. You just have to be online. And I'll tell you, I think steam is going to be the  winner there because I love knowing that I don't have to touch a disc. I love knowing that I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  never want to compete with if you, who cares if there's anybody else. We got steam. Yeah. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if game tap actually really works on getting enough AAA titles, I don't see it not having,  if you have both memberships to both, I used to now I just have steam because I own the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So let's steam's free. Like you can, you can sign it, you buy the game forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess if everybody did it for free, then you'd have accounts everywhere and you just get the game  that you want. And then you don't even have to care. But if you have some like game tap, where you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ideally would, you pay, you pay your monthly fee. You get, you get access to the entire inventory  of games that they have whenever you want. It's just, it's like, it's basically like cable. You  pay, you pay your fee and then you can play when you want. Now I tell you what, uh, there was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  time that, you know, steam was so good. I assumed, okay, digital just resumed. That's where it's at  from now on. And I made the mistake of buying spore over there. Direct download. What a crappy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  game that was. I was so sad about spore. The game itself was, was, was fun, but the download

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  experience was miserable. I still have. That's because of the copy protection, right? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cause it was an EA product. It broke my computer. EA tried to do their own digital  download services. Terrible. It was just horrible. It was wonky. It was kludgy. And the user experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was horrible. I had to, I had to reformat my laptop because it was, it did such a poor job and it got  mixed up. And every time I booted up, it would just freeze. I just want to point out, this is why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gamers never get laid. Cause Sarah Lane is like, I am so bored. I couldn't be more. I love Bejeweled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. There are a few people in the chat room who were like, notice Sarah isn't  talking anymore. And I was like, well, I'm reading you guys. And I was like, actually, you know what?  I'm not that interested. Couldn't care less. Is there any game you play at all? Um, honestly,  right now, um, I mean, there's a few like silly iPhone games that I play, but honestly, I'm,  I, I, I'm much more sort of entrenched in sort of the web app, social network sphere. You've

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  played Peggle, haven't you? Surely you love Peggle. Peggle is a good game. No, dude. It's like crack  for the brain. Yeah. Peggle is a good game. I haven't played crap. I haven't played crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't, I don't think so. What happened? Scribbulous is gone, right? But they replaced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to play that, you know, game. Yes, absolutely. You like Scrabble because you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  an intellectual. You like the word highly evolved humans. Yeah. Yeah. I used to have one of their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  flash games was a word jumble game where you had to come up with the words as the letters were

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Molly would like a word. She plays word all nonstop. It was kind of similar. Yeah. And it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, Scrabble and that's the thing. No, it's, you know, when people think games are thinking  FPS or think casual games, you need, you need this. I get the stupidest magazine. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why they put me on this list called the casual gamers association magazine. Oh, that's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like people who only cooked sushi. This just ends people like bright colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Solitaire, the next generation. It's like, it's so sad. 3D Solitaire. Finally. Yeah. It's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's like shuffleboard basically. Yeah. Yeah. I know I think there are a lot of games that are  really fun. I mean, the word game, I mean, that's a very, it's a very broad term. There are certain  games. I like certain games. I don't. I think I just happen to be one of those people who doesn't  like, you're not a gamer. I'm not. There's plenty of women gamers. We've had gamers in my mom is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like first person shooters make me nauseous. Yeah. Cause of the head movement head bob. Yeah. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just, I don't know. I've never been able to click into liking it. I actually think like my mom may

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually spend more hours playing games than I do. What games? Well, she plays these, these niche.  I didn't even know existed. Like the mystery, find and hunt the clue games. Oh yeah. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what I'm talking about, right? So basically these are PopCap games where PopCap's very smart.  Remember how you, it's like a where's wall though. You have to find out all these clues. Oh, I can't  wait. In a giant jumbled image. See, I like that stuff. You would love it. You would love it. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  feel really smart when you finally figure it out. I found the scissors. I'm a man. Remember Highlights

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  magazine for kids? Yes. In the back they would find all the sales. CSI highlights. At the orthodontist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  office. I would, I would. It's the exact same thing. I would own those highlights magazines. It is so pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are a bunch of losers. Not you mom. It's okay. If you're a mom, it's fine. But you guys,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  come on, find the scissors. Do you play Zuma? Would you just basically mail the? We were 11 years old, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're not doing it now? Highlights, no, I haven't picked up a Highlights in quite a while.  I don't even know if they exist anymore. Remember Goofus and Gallant? One of those guys could never

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get his act together. No, Goofus was a cool one. No, Gallant was a cool one. He's being, he's telling  a joke. He's acting like, I'm sorry, I missed the highlights for children inside humor. Yes. Well,  it's high brow. This might be a good time to end the show. I want, you can all have more wine though.  I want to thank Brian Brushwood for actually being here. You are fantastic. Will you please come back  on to it? We could do it via Skype from where in Nebraska or anywhere you are.
