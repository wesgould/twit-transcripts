Transcript:  This is it right now.  Florence is also a host of All About Android, and both of them were at Google I.O. this week.  Yes, indeed.  But we thought to balance the panel, we should also talk about Microsoft Build.  So we have Mark Sullivan from Fast Company.  Are you going to take the Microsoft side of the show for us?  I'll try. I'll do my best.  By the way, we can get you a computer. I see you're using your iPhone to keep notes.  If you'd like, we can provide you with a laptop.  This is a big week this week. There's too much to remember.

Transcript:  So I had the misfortune of getting up early to cover Microsoft Build on Monday.  We streamed the keynote.  It began in the saddest way possible.  It was the worst demo fail I've ever seen.  I've seen some really horrible demo fails.  But it broke my heart.  Andrew Chaikin was there. He wrote Man on the Moon, which was the story of the Apollo 11 landing.  It is the 50th anniversary in July.  John Knoll was there. He's special effects at ILM.  But before that, he invented Photoshop with his brother Thomas.  And the great article in Variety, credit to Yanco Records for doing the research,  I think Yanco thought, oh, this is going to be great because everybody will see the demo  and then want to know the story behind it. His story changed a little bit.  But the story was that in 1999, John Knoll, who was at the time doing Star Wars special effects  and Star Trek special effects, discovered he had always been an Apollo 11 fan,  as anybody of our generation was. He was seven.  I was 12 in 1969.  And he found a treasure trove of telemetry data that NASA had and never published  of the moonwalk, of the landing on the moon, the actual numbers that go with all of this stuff.  And he started a project, now 20-year project, to take that telemetry and image it,  3D imaging, to actually create a CGI of the moon landing.  Along comes Microsoft and HoloLens. This is going to be a HoloLens 2 demo.  And weirdly, Tim Sweeney of Epic Games, who used to hate Microsoft  and has now completely come around, said, you can use our Unreal Engine.  And they created a HoloLens demo of the moon landing, starting with the launch of the spacecraft.  They explained how the stages worked. They followed it all the way to the moon.  They showed the lem, the lunar module landing on the moon.  They showed Neel's. And you can actually see it, fortunately, they taped the rehearsal.  Because when it came time for the actual keynote, it's at 8.30 in the morning,  Sacha Nadella is standing off stage, and the show before it was a bunch of college science projects.  The guy who was hosting the show was getting in his ear, stretch, stretch.  He stretched for 20 minutes. We couldn't figure out why the keynote took so long to get started.  He stretched for 20 minutes because the demo wasn't working.  Finally, according to records, he ran out of things to ask the college kids.  So he said, and now let's go to the keynote.  Chaikin comes on stage, Noel comes on stage, they're wearing the HoloLens 2.  And they say, never mind. And they walk off the stage.  And they said, this just shows it's harder to do a HoloLens demo than the land on the moon.  It was just like, horrible.  That is a brutal idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, I only say that to refer people to the Variety article.  And there's a video there. You can also see it on YouTube.  It's on the Epic Games YouTube channel of the actual demo as it was supposed to go out.  And it was really good.  At least they had a backup.  At least, yeah, right.  Thank God they did this.

Transcript:  So if it's doing the moon landing, are they also showing the green screen backdrop in Hollywood?  How they faked the whole thing.  And how they put the wind or flag or whatever. There's no wind, I think.

Start time: 432.77
End time: 442.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't they say they thought Stanley Kubrick helped with it?  Helped shoot it.  Do you think people still believe that? I think there are.  There's a lot of people who still believe that.  Plenty of people still believe that.  They believe the earth is flat, too, because they saw it on YouTube.  A few do, yeah.

Start time: 450.62
End time: 459.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was weird. It's like, I mean, that demo was over before anybody even knew what was going on.  They bailed on it so quickly.  They didn't waste any time.

Start time: 460.12
End time: 474.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was kind of like, well, come on, try. At least, boot the machine.  But they, no, I think they knew that it wasn't going to work.  And it really was kind of a fitting kickoff for the worst keynote I've ever seen.  Oh.  You agree, Mark?

Transcript:  We do have years of Samsung keynotes to pull from. They used to be really bad.

Start time: 487.20
End time: 493.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't Samsung bad. It wasn't bad in that way.  It was just kind of lifeless and dull, I felt like.

Start time: 493.38
End time: 497.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of it was. I mean, I think it was very geeky, most of it.

Start time: 497.26
End time: 500.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, which is good. It's a developer keynote.  And it is Microsoft's niche.

Start time: 502.49
End time: 514.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's... I read somebody was writing. That's what they're trying to return to.  They're trying to return from...  Your roots.  Yeah, to Bill Gates and, hey, we're a bunch of nerds and we're going to make the best tools out there and you're going to love us for it.

Start time: 515.00
End time: 547.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I should give them a pass, maybe. Because it's not showbiz.  Steve Jobs keynote is not with me.  We've been trained.  It was more like a pre-Steve Jobs idea of a keynote.  And given that it's a developer conference, that's probably all right.  They did make some very big announcements at Build.  The one that I think is going to end up being the hand grenade lobbed into Microsoft's business model.  They're putting the Linux kernel into Windows.  Anybody want to say anything?

Start time: 548.20
End time: 556.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it turns out this Chromebook that I have in front of me also has the Linux kernel on it.  And if I wanted to, I could run a Windows app on it, too.

Start time: 556.48
End time: 664.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it turns out the... and your Android device is running Linux.  So it turns out really the year of desktop Linux happened.  It's interesting because Microsoft has been trying to woo developers.  And one of the ways they did it was with something called LSW, the Linux subsystem for Windows, which allowed you...  It was an emulator, though. It wasn't really Linux.  It allowed you to run Linux binaries on Windows in a way that really, honestly, was not ideal.  But it was to make developers feel better because they have their tools.  But there were some real performance, significant performance issues.  And I mean, I really gave it the benefit that I put on a very fast computer,  really tried, and even with the most recent version of LSW,  small file handling was so slow that you could just watch the grass grow while you were loading files or compiling things.  All the things developers want to do, which is process small files.  So I think Microsoft... I asked Christina Warren about this a couple of weeks ago on the show.  She said, yeah, we know. We know it's a problem.  And so their decision, she must have known this at the time. She was very cagey.  Their decision was, why do an emulation? Why just put Linux in Windows?  So it's a special version of the Linux kernel that Microsoft...  It's actually a fairly old version of the Linux kernel that Microsoft's going to modify to fit well within Windows.  I'm going to go out on a limb. I think build 2025.  Microsoft's just going to say...  And now Windows is Linux. Honestly, they're just... Why not?  Why not abandon the Microsoft kernel entirely? You've already got the Linux kernel in there.  This is just the beginning of the end for Windows. What do you think?  That's crazy? Am I crazy?

Start time: 664.46
End time: 670.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think that's necessarily crazy. I think that's a possible future.

Start time: 670.34
End time: 686.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what we saw at build this year was really finally Microsoft saying it's not about Windows anymore.  It's barely even about Office. It's about Office 365 and Microsoft Dynamics.  It's about enterprise, about Azure, it's about the cloud.

Start time: 686.44
End time: 696.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's where everything starts is the intelligent edge.  Azure is the center of the universe for Microsoft right now.

Start time: 697.22
End time: 727.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And for years, Nadella would say things like, when they first announced the Touch First version of Office,  it wasn't going to be on Windows, it was going to be on the iPad.  What he said was, well, we want to be wherever our customers are.  That might be iPad. They have great Android apps, right?  I mean, Microsoft's apps on Android. Outlook is great on Android because they're complete, but that's another story.  He used to say, but the best experience will be on Windows.  He hasn't said that in a couple of years. He just says, we want to be wherever our customers are.

Start time: 727.70
End time: 752.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just him. I mean, everybody I talk to at Microsoft is kind of telling this story about openness and customer friendliness  and going where people are and not trying to leverage products and not trying to twist customers' arm to come to this platform and do away with that one.  And I think that's part of Satya's thing.

Start time: 753.26
End time: 760.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It might be why the Build keynote isn't as exciting because infrastructure is not as exciting as the things Google showed the next day, right?  The Surface stuff.

Start time: 761.20
End time: 810.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, really, there wasn't...  It was about plumbing.  Yeah, it was. And it was about developer-focused stuff.  And there was some consumer-facing things, but not terribly exciting things.  And some of it was kind of future tense.  There was a few interesting things like they're working on...  We have spell check in Word, but they're going to...  They're going to build a tool. They're building a tool in there now that will correct your, I say political correctness, but that's kind of a shorthand way of doing it.  You told me you were on right-wing radio yesterday.  I didn't do it. They asked me to do it.  But they'll check your writing for inclusiveness or gender bias.  That is political correctness.

Start time: 810.50
End time: 813.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a much better way to say it because I think politically correct is...

Start time: 814.22
End time: 822.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably shouldn't have done that. I probably shouldn't have had it like...  It's a new category.  Yeah, I was hungry for clicks, so I did it.

Start time: 823.90
End time: 831.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Finally, somebody admits it. Microsoft Word is getting politically correct. So it's not a grammar checker. It's not a spelling checker.

Start time: 831.52
End time: 860.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's way past that. They had a team of linguists and professors in to define these 10 or 11 different ways of reading your writing for you, and on inclusiveness and cultural differences.  Their thing is they're going to try to warn you against saying something that you don't know you're saying because you're saying it incorrectly.

Start time: 860.54
End time: 906.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As an old guy, I often stumble into traps like that.  Yeah, I have to.  For instance, I have said in the past, let's hear from the distaff side. Let's hear from a female perspective.  Then somebody said, rightly so, you know where that phrase comes from. It's a dis on women and you shouldn't say that.  I went, oh my God, because that's just a phrase that I grew up with in literature and stuff.  You give an example, Mike, in your column on fast companies. If you write, we need to get some fresh blood in here, Microsoft will suggest new employees instead.  Honestly, fresh blood, that's a common phrase, but you're right. If you really think about it, it's kind of disgusting.  It has a little brutality to it.

Start time: 906.24
End time: 912.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I need to get some fresh fruit in here, some papayas, some luscious mangoes.  That's going in a completely different direction now.

Start time: 912.81
End time: 917.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a filter for that, too.  You're not allowed to say fresh fruit anymore.

Start time: 926.00
End time: 962.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're really getting more and more accustomed to allowing our computers to write for us. This is not something that only Microsoft is doing.  Hello, Grammarly.  Well, absolutely. Sponsor Grammarly. Also, Google has their smart replies.  These are things that I think when they announced it, I thought, at least as a result, refers to Google's solution.  That sounds neat. That's neat that computers can do that, but I'll never use it.  I actually use it pretty reasonably, and I almost don't want the person on the other end to know.  You know what I mean? Because it's dead on.  I hope you don't know when I do it.  I think I know when you do it. I think we know that we're doing it.

Start time: 962.20
End time: 969.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't actually say, OK, sounds good, but Google tells me to respond, OK, sounds good, because it sounds like a good reply.

Start time: 969.92
End time: 1003.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an example of where Google has lapped Microsoft, because they've gone from doing it correctly to doing it somewhat incorrectly.  An English teacher would say, OK, sounds good is wrong, right?  Well, it's OK, comma, sounds good.  I just think Google's being very colloquial, and in a way that's for what you're using it for, which is texting or email.  That's better. You say, Mike, if you describe in your prose disabled person, the AI says a person with a disability instead.  I didn't know that.  I think that's good, because it's first person instead of a passive voice.

Start time: 1003.34
End time: 1007.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it puts the person in front of the disability in the phrase.

Start time: 1008.36
End time: 1017.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, disabled qualifies person. They're a person first.  I don't mind that, and I think that maybe that's me, because I'm pretty politically correct.

Start time: 1017.76
End time: 1062.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a response to where society is going, new societal norms, and a lot of us are learning a lot of new things now.  I'm learning things I didn't know. It's not like I was born being able to say the right vernacular.  But I do appreciate that it's something Microsoft is taking into consideration, because I think in tech we often forget to put people first in an effort to innovate, etc.  But I think sometimes the innovation is as minor as making sure that everyone is referring to each other in a way that is not insulting or intimidating.  I think it's important, because those little things do contribute to a larger picture.

Start time: 1081.38
End time: 1087.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course you could reject the suggestions as you can with Grammarly or any spell checker. You don't have to say anything.

Start time: 1087.20
End time: 1113.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, certainly not. I think the reason it kind of struck me as interesting is just that it's kind of what you were saying, Flo.  I mean, this gets into some areas in linguistics and culture that are very much in flux right now.  And we're learning to talk about things differently with different sensitivities.  And because of that, these are things that people argue about. They're a bit controversial.  It's not a given.

Start time: 1113.90
End time: 1150.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, the other day I was listening to a book or an interview or something, and somebody said the word retarded,  which of course we don't use about people who are developmentally disabled. That's obviously wrong.  But as it turned, and I kind of went, hmm.  But then I thought about it, and actually they were using it in the original meaning of the word to retard somebody's progress, to slow it down.  And it was OK. You know, I think some of it comes back to intention and meaning.  But there are times when you can. So it's not always obvious if it's politically incorrect.  I think it's good to think about the words you're using. I don't have a problem with that.

Start time: 1150.36
End time: 1162.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's intention versus impact. What are the what is the impact of your intention?  And if your intention hurts somebody, it's a bad impact. Then it doesn't matter what the intention was because it hurt somebody.  That's something I live by.

Start time: 1162.46
End time: 1190.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And yet I could also see Facebook's kind of doing this.  Word saying, well, that's fake news. Right.  You asserted something. Oh, man, didn't land on the moon. Well, that's fake news.  It just erases it. At some point you don't want.  I mean, I don't want any corporation to start asserting its cultural values on the culture, do you?  I mean, that's that's exactly we've gone too far making corporations people as it is.  But now to have them assert their values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's one of the things that's keeping Zuckerberg up at night right now is, you know, I think there's in some ways Facebook  and I'm sympathetic to them about this is I think they are being asked to devise a set of values.  It's impossible. You can't you can't.

Transcript:  Well, and it's a global environment. So what we consider in the United States is a given.  You know, women are equal. That's not there's plenty of countries in Facebook where they would say, what are you talking about?  So this is literally, I think, an impossible task.

His his former college roommate, Facebook co-founder, wrote an op ed piece, Chris Hughes, an op ed piece in The New York Times, saying, in fact, Mark's a nice guy, but he has too much power.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Mark has 60 percent of voting control.  That is unprecedented for any publicly held company.  It is a lot of power.  Hughes writes, Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook's algorithms to determine what people see in their feeds, what privacy settings they can use, even which messages can be delivered.  He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent speech from the merely offensive.  He can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring it, copying it or blocking it.  This is the thing I found interesting.  Mark is a good, kind person.  Yes.  But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.  A lot of people took shots at Chris Hughes saying, well, now that you're a billionaire, thanks to Mark, it's easy enough to say, well, we should stop.  Yeah.  You know.

And that's that's what kind of perked my ears a little bit.  I was like, OK, I understand completely where he's coming from.  And I think this message coming from someone like Hughes carries a little bit more weight considering he was a co-founder.  But man, he really wanted everyone to know that he was talking right now.  And that's that's a little suspect.  Yeah.  But maybe maybe there's a reason for that.  Right.  If this is if this is what needs to be heard by the most people, then maybe he is the right person to spread that news because it really did get a lot of attention.

Transcript:  He says that Facebook he agrees with Elizabeth Warren and others that Facebook should be broken up.  But a lot of people pointed out Facebook is and Facebook pointed this out immediately.  We're not a monopoly.  There's plenty of competition.  And any trust law does not apply if you're not a monopoly.  There's no legitimate legal basis for the government to break up a company just because it's big and powerful.  It has to be a trust.

Transcript:  Again, what Chris Hughes is saying and what Elizabeth Warren is saying, we should break them up not because they're a monopoly, but because they're too powerful.  And I don't know if there's any precedent for that.  What is the precedent for that?

Start time: 1528.60
End time: 1551.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could also, I mean, you can also look at it as, well, Facebook's really an advertising business.  That's where they make their money.  And when you look at that part of it, Facebook and Google are in a duopoly.  And the reason they're in a duopoly is because they own the data that's used to target ads.  Right.  And in that sense, there's some monopoly power there.

Start time: 1554.21
End time: 1580.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not a monopoly because Google, as you say, is a duopoly.  Google is co-equal.  Google and Facebook together share 80 percent of all digital revenue.  But digital is not all the ad space either.  There's plenty of billions and billions of dollars in other spaces.  Even we do digital advertising, but I don't think we worry about Facebook and Google eating our share because we do a different kind of digital advertising.

Start time: 1610.22
End time: 1652.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one way to harm the public good would be to say, hey, if you get too successful, we're going to nip you in the bud.  And we'll decide what that line is.  That would be a harm to public good as well.  Right. I mean, that's what some say is break them up.  You're sending a message to entrepreneurs.  Well, don't be too successful.  Don't get too big.  Yeah.  Maybe is that a message you want to send?  I don't know.  I don't. This is really an intractable problem because as you point out, Mark doesn't know how to solve this problem.  There's no structural problem.  Mark and the geeks in general say, well, the technology will fix it.  We'll get AI to fix it.  And we know that's not going to work.  Right.  Yeah.  Government's not going to fix it because I don't think there's even agreement within government that they should be broken up.

I haven't seen the movie, by the way.  It's completely Wicca Media.  You know a lot about a movie you've never seen.  I read a lot about it last night.

Transcript:  It happened to me in college.  Everything was just like whatever I read last night.  It's just like that.  It is just like Robocop.  Absolutely.  No, I think that the somebody said you sure perseverate on this subject, but it is the I think it's the number one problem in technology.  The big thing right now is it's clear that these big companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, are so dominant that they are potentially harming society.  But we have no idea what the effect is, what the effect of changing that would be if there even is a way to change that.  It's almost as if we're set on a road at full speed and have no way of changing direction at this point.  Right.  That's what it feels like to me.  Mark, you feel like that?

Start time: 1740.20
End time: 1779.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's been a long time coming.  I mean, we have chosen a way that we're going to pay for web services.  We'd like to freeze things.  That's how it works.  And we have been on this track for a long time.  And I'm, you know, you know, it's not always going to be like this.  You know, we're going to have different interfaces in the future.  Computing is going to be different.  We might all be in a world, you know, and, you know, HoloLens when it works.  Right.  You know, and if if that does happen, somebody was reminding me the other day, we might really screw this up.  I mean, it might be just ads everywhere in virtual space.  That's what Philip K. Dicks thought.  Right. Right.

End time: 1802.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So not to get too far out, but that's yeah, it's a business model that I think has come into serious question right now.  And I think people are looking for ways out, like paying paying people with Bitcoin for viewing ads and things like that.

End time: 1833.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But once you give away something is really hard to start charging for.  You just really you can't.  Yeah.  Hughes says it is there is a window of opportunity right now to force Facebook to give up Instagram and WhatsApp.  He said until recently they were independent.  But time is of the essence because Facebook is working probably because of this to quickly integrate.  I thought that was interesting.  Make it harder for the FTC to split them up.  It wouldn't be so hard to reverse the mergers that I think the FTC could perhaps do.

Start time: 1834.62
End time: 1841.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if Facebook gets to a point to where these services are all merged and grouped together on a deeper level, how do you then pick it apart?

Start time: 1841.54
End time: 1855.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It feels to me like you're just chipping off a little bit of Facebook.  If you chip off WhatsApp and Instagram, Facebook just creates those kind of services internally.  It's not a huge deal.  Which it loves to do.  And it's not a huge deal.  The blue Facebook is still the problem.  Yeah.

Start time: 1857.00
End time: 1872.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what confuses me about all that like Warren's thing about breaking up Facebook and you know, the idea.  The idea I hear all the time is breaking off WhatsApp and Instagram.  But the core business like the big public social network is still there.  Yeah.

Start time: 1874.28
End time: 1888.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, Zuckerberg's even said that the future of the business is not the core app.  It is the private communications, the private messaging.  Maybe that's just like Chris Hughes.  I feel like that's a message of opportunity.  It's like, well, I better say this now.

Start time: 1889.20
End time: 1889.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1890.30
End time: 1899.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd love to.  Do you think there's reality there?  I mean, do you think there's I mean, maybe there's there's data suggesting that people are migrating to private rooms?

Start time: 1900.32
End time: 1946.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't I don't know if there's reality there, but I think that's a pretty convenient thing given what we're talking about right here.  If if there is a time where suddenly WhatsApp and Instagram or whatever are broken off, I think I think the big blue app is probably doing a heck of a lot better than what Mike what what Zuckerberg is saying there.  And there's potential, you know, like you said, Leo, to build these things in any ways.  Ultimately, I think a lot of people are aware that something is wrong, that there is something I think everybody's exactly.  And so so maybe there isn't a reason, a specific reason, an antitrust reason to go and investigate and to do something.  But we all agree that something needs to happen.  Right. And so I don't know what the solution is, but that's a really frustrating place to be.

Start time: 1946.38
End time: 1978.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And one more thing, Hughes says, just breaking up Facebook is not enough.  We need this one really scares me.  A new government agency empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies.  Its first mandate should be to protect privacy.  That's fine. That's GDPR. I don't have a huge problem with that.  He mentions GDPR and says we should have a similar privacy bill that would specify what control Americans have over their digital information.  This is the one that bothers me.  Agencies should create guidelines for acceptable speech on social media.

Start time: 1979.20
End time: 1983.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what did people say before they formed the FCC?  How is this any different from that?

Start time: 1985.20
End time: 2061.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  I mean, the First Amendment says government should make no law to abridge speech.  The FCC was able to because it was a tit for tat to broadcasters in order to use the public airwaves.  We are going to require you to be licensed and to act in the public interest.  Video stations and then later TV stations had certain requirements, things like public service announcements, but also keeping the seven bad words off, things like that.  That were because it's like our responsibilities on the highway because you're using the public infrastructure, the frequencies.  We're going to limit you.  But it didn't mean that the FCC could then say to a podcaster, for instance, who's not using any spectrum.  You can't say the seven bad words and they never asserted that they could.  So I'm going to say that the FCC is doing something like a highway patrol would do.  But that isn't offending the First Amendment because you still have the ability to speak out.  It's just you can't do it on the public airwaves in any way you choose.  That's an interesting question.  An agency that should create guidelines for acceptable speech on social media.  I guess you could say, well, social media is the public's airwaves.  I don't know.

Start time: 2061.66
End time: 2073.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's kind of the argument that I was trying to make.  Is there a similarity there?  I mean, are we just talking about we're not talking about the telephone system or broadcasting.  We're talking about another platform.

Start time: 2074.20
End time: 2098.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I notice the FCC does not restrict what you can say on the phone.  And if they did, that would be the end of the world.  Even though terrorists can use phone calls to plot.  We've never gone there.  And I don't think we should ever go there.  Even though you could make the case, well, we know that people are using phones to do terrible, terrible things.  We should have some restriction on that.  But we've never gone there.  And I think that that's because of the respect for the First Amendment.

Start time: 2099.32
End time: 2135.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what the phone doesn't have in common with the TV or with the Internet is that it's in essence a private conversation.  Person to person versus a wide broadcast.  And it's ephemeral.  Yeah, right.  And as far as we know, yes, put your voice out there.  It's gone forever.  But like yelling fire.  There are a few examples in here.  Yelling fire in a crowded theater, child pornography, speech intended to provoke violence and false statements to manipulate stock prices.  Language, language around these things.  Like it's in my mind, it's pretty relatively easy to identify language that would fall into those categories.

End time: 2172.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  What I'm saying is like yelling fire in a crowded theater.  That's a pretty easy thing to say.  Don't do that.  And we have a really good reason why you don't do that.  You cause panic.  So if you're yelling fire in a crowded theater, I can hear that.  I can know that that's wrong.  Cracking down on any of this stuff in a social media perspective.  Like, I just don't know how you do it for exactly the reason that you're talking about that language is like, like, what are the rules and ramifications?  And where do you even draw those lines?  I don't even know if it's a government agency.  I don't even know if it's possible.

And this is in my mind, the only possible and correct solution, which is that we turn our back, ultimately turn our back on these things, that we as people,  start to realize the destructiveness of these social media networks and start participating.  I mean, that's all it would take.  I want to bring my mother into this.

It's just like, this is my way.  I'm an older person.  This is where my family is.  Yeah.  This is my way of staying connected to this world.  This is where the people are.  This is where the people are.  And it's like, what do I say to that?  I don't think it's the tech that is in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I think the tech has definitely contributed to the problem.  I think Mark Zuckerberg was a young person who had a big idea and did not think about the social ramifications of what he was going to do.  Any person who took an international relations class in college would have known the kind of like gates that would have been open by connecting the world together.  But not Mark.  We've had these problems in the world since humanity has been on Earth.  We suck.  We do.  Humanity is terrible.  We're awful to each other.  And social networks just let us see that suckage.

No, but they use TikTok.  They use Instagram.  They have Finstas.  They have very different ways of communicating with each other.  And that's going to evolve as they get older.

You know, it's an endless conversation, which we see a lot on our shows.  But I just this again, it's come up one more time.  And then Chris Hughes piece really, I thought, brought it to the forefront.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  There's no answer.  And it's just very difficult.  Very difficult.  I want a soapbox.  Facebook is going to get a big fine.  They said three to five billion.  I think now the the Vegas odds are five billion dollars.

Transcript:  That's what some legislators are saying, that that's a bargain.  A slap on the wrist.  It's a bargain.  Richard Blumenthal and Josh Hawley are trying to pressure the FTC to increase the fine and,  more importantly, to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible.  Billions of dollars would be a bargain for a company as large as Facebook, say Blumenthal  and Hawley.  By the way, Blumenthal, the Democrat, Hawley, the Republican from Missouri.  The tech giant says it could be five billion.  Lawmakers said even a fine in the billions is simply a write down for the company.  That's right.  Just helps them pay no taxes.

Transcript:  They did.  Last three billion they took.  Yeah.  Most large penalties have done little to deter large tech firms.  Limit what they want the FTC to do is limit data collection.  And I think that's actually not an unreasonable thing.  I agree.  They want accountability targeting individual executives.  In other words, Zuckerberg or Sandberg would be personally liable if any Facebook executive  knowingly broke the law or its pledge to improve privacy practices, which they told the FTC  they would do eight years ago.  Can you believe that?  That was 2011.  I don't know.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by WordPress.  Actually, that's my blog host.  I love WordPress.  Me too.  Yeah, of course it is.  Everybody.  33% of the internet is running on WordPress.  I remember when Matt Muller came out with WordPress, early days of blogging, early  2000s.  I'd been using Blogger and stuff and I found WordPress.  I said, this is it.  I'm here.  I hosted it, self-hosted it at the time, but then WordPress.com came along.  I just got my 12-year chip from WordPress.  That's how long I've been on WordPress.com.  And I love it because they do all the hard stuff.  They keep it secure.  They keep it up to date.  They have thousands of themes, all the powerful tools of WordPress.  They've got 24-7 support from actual WordPress experts, people who use the platform every  day and know it.  That's the best kind of support there is from WordPress enthusiasts.  WordPress.com lets anyone pursue whatever it is they love by launching a site that's  free to start and room to grow.  I'm not talking two-week trials.  Nope.  No hidden fees.  And most importantly, the reason you want to have a website, you own your own content  forever.  It's not Mark Zuckerberg's.  It's not Jack Dorsey's.  It's yours.  Put pictures, video, music, text, whatever you want on your WordPress page.  You can upload it any time.  You can download it any time.  It is always there for you.  Everybody needs a place on the internet that they say, this is where I am.  This is where I live.  And it's not on Facebook.  It's not on Twitter.  It's on your own website.  I tell this especially to teenagers who are just getting started in the world.  your best stuff up there so that when people Google you, they find you, that you control  your image.  WordPress.com is the easiest place to do it.  And as I said, great 24-hour support, a very flexible platform, so powerful, so flexible.  A lot of big publications use WordPress.  Fortune.com is based on WordPress.com on their VIP platform.  So as Quartz, millions of people use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality.  leolaport.com, that's a WordPress site.  What's your site, Florence?

I don't know if that's the case.  Google did.  I mean, their quarterly results were down a little bit, right?  They didn't grow as fast.  They only grow 16%.  Oh, please.  Poultry.  You call that growth?  I'll show you a growth.  Yeah, got a growth right here.  So, I thought they did a good job.  The ending was a little weird.  The ending of what?  The keynote?  Yeah, because Sundar Pichai never came back.  No.  He was like, I'm done.

Transcript:  And they had a nice momentum leading up to it.  I mean, they showed some, I thought, really cool stuff.  They showed how Google's lens was.  I mean, they've been showing Google lens for, seems like, for years.  Yeah.  But it's getting better and better now.  It can read menus, translate menus.  They had a really moving video of an Indian woman who was illiterate, but could use Google  lens, the camera on her phone to read things for her.  She said, I don't have to ask anybody to read for me anymore.  I can get around.  I can take the train.  I can do stuff.  It could translate foreign languages.  It could read things out loud, which she needed.  It can calculate the tip or even split the pill.

Start time: 3200.48
End time: 3205.46

Transcript:  Oh, and they shrunk it down.  They shrunk down all that a bit.  That was the real, like, technological feat.

Start time: 3230.18
End time: 3248.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They talked about machine learning, the database from the machine learning being hundreds of  gigabytes, which they could then shrink down to half a gigabyte.  Kilobytes.  Kilobytes.  Get it on your phone in a usable amount of space.  That's pretty huge.  Did they at any point talk about how...  They didn't in the keynote, but maybe later talk about how?

Start time: 3249.60
End time: 3281.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talk about how they were shrinking those data sets?  No, not necessarily.  They just said they were able to compress with a lot of work down to a point to where  they can move these onto phones and not just with the language translation, but also they  showed off an incredible demo, I thought, of Assistant working entirely on device.  That was the demo where the woman had the phone and she just rattled off command after  command after command with no pause whatsoever.  She was able to do basically Bixby-like controls over her phone because Assistant hasn't done  some of these phone control things.

Start time: 3281.52
End time: 3284.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said Assistant is ten times faster thanks to this shrinkage.

Start time: 3285.92
End time: 3302.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that that's what's going to be a big selling point of the Pixel 4.  I think the Pixel 4 is going to hinge a lot on having the space and the computational  power to manage a lot more in the ways of the machine learning tasks that they're showing  off there.

Start time: 3308.76
End time: 3321.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of is.  When I used to talk to Google people about this, they would always talk about the speed  of the experience if it ran on the device.  It would be faster.  But they are...

Start time: 3322.50
End time: 3324.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that always has to go out to the net, get the response, come back.

Start time: 3324.78
End time: 3333.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now they're definitely talking about the privacy aspect.  Absolutely.  It's not just because of speed.  Huge shame.  It's because this is your stuff on your phone and we have nothing to do with it.

Start time: 3333.74
End time: 3363.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They even made points about Anonymous that you could build the knowledge base.  You could do more training, but you could do it in an anonymized fashion.  But on the other hand, I think Google was particularly unapologetic at this event about  hey, we can do more because we know more about you.  They almost took the opposite tack to Apple saying, yeah, privacy is fine, but if you  really want us to know what your favorite meal is, you're going to have to give us some  information.

Start time: 3364.82
End time: 3405.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think even at one point they mentioned, I had to check the quote exactly to see what  they were saying, but my takeaway from it was we've been collecting your data for 20  years.  Of course we can do great things with it.  We know everything there is to know about you.  Which obviously if you're very privacy minded and living in, I don't know, 2019, that kind  of perspective is going to give you pause.  But then at the same time, as consumers, we ask a lot of our technology and have for  a very long time.  And some of this stuff requires access to that data.  And I think Google going into this was just kind of saying, yes, okay, we've got a lot  of your data, but look at all the wonderful things we can do with it.

Start time: 3406.92
End time: 3482.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's actually smart tech because Apple Siri is just not very good.  And whether that's Apple's fault for some other reason or just that they don't know much  about you, the fact is the fact.  Right.  So why not say, hey, look, you can choose not to give us any information.  And by the way, and Pachai said, this is a quote from the talk, privacy cannot be a luxury  good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services.  Privacy must be equally available to everyone in the world.  They double down on that.  But at the same time, I think it's a reasonable thing for them to say, look, we do know a  lot about you.  Sorry, we're going to give you the tools to delete it, which they attempted with Dashboard.  We're going to.  They changed the setting in search that lets you delete information instead of keeping  it forever.  You can delete it after three months or was the other a year, 18 months or keep it forever.  Right.  I mean, it's not the most granular switch ever, but at least they you can say to Google,  okay, keep my data for three months.  We need the data, but you only will get it for 90 days.  So I think that that's a good thing to say, look, we'll give you control.  Honestly, if you want us to do all this cool stuff we can do, you got to tell us some stuff.  We got to see your schedule.

Start time: 3482.48
End time: 3522.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there I was kind of impressed with that.  That's the right approach.  I mean, you have a choice.  He was just very frank about it.  And, you know, I like this idea of and this is kind of what you said about personal data  being a transactional thing between human being and big tech company.  If I get more in return than I have given and if they are honest with me about what  they're taking and what they're giving me, then I'm kind of okay with that.  You know, and I'm not like Facebook did the opposite.  Exactly.  And that's why I'm that's why I quit Facebook.  It's mealy mouth.

Transcript:  See, that's mealy mouthed.  I mean, if it's true, he should just say, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's for teaching the machine.  We think you want ads that reflect your interests.  We do that.  We give you switches to turn it off if you don't like it.  OK, but honestly, we can't do our job without getting all that information.  I would love to see Google say, hey, if you don't like it, go to Apple.  Honestly, I mean, they're right across the freeway.  Consumers do have the choice, right?  I mean, choices couldn't be more stark.  Really, the question mark is Microsoft, which is not known for privacy, but it's starting  to say, well, we want to be the privacy company, too.  It looks good for Apple might be good for us.  I think Google and Facebook might as well just say, look, you have a choice.  You can go to Microsoft, you can go to Apple, or you can go with Google, Facebook, and you tell us which experience is better.  Are you right?  Are you willing to pay that price?  I think most people don't.  Does your mom, is she aware of that?

I know they collect information about me, but it's worth it.  Because look what I'm getting.  And I think Google could do the same thing.  Maybe that's foolish.  Maybe you can't.

Transcript:  Google at Google I.O. kind of went in both directions.  On one hand, they were stressing the fact that, hey, look at all these cool things we can do with access to your data.  On the other hand, they did lead the keynote, at least as far as the Android part was concerned,  with a heavy emphasis on the fact that Android Q has privacy and security as one of its main focuses.  So you think they can do that fairly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think they can do that fairly.  But I think that it's beneficial to them to be able to point out both sides.  Because if you sit on one camp, you feel fine about the fact that your data is being used,  is basically your currency for all the wonderful things Google does.  If you sit on the other camp, on the other side of the camp, then...  Which camp are we at, by the way?  Then you've got controls within Android, just as one example, that are improving in Q,  to where you can button down on location sharing so that it's only running when you're inside of an app.  They've moved privacy to its own front line item in the settings pane.  So it's right there. When you go in there, there's add controls immediately.  They're making it a little more visible for you to know that,  oh, hey, I can go in there and actually make some corrections here.  And they know most people don't care.  Most people probably are not going to even go in there and make a change.

In a way, Pachai restated the mission statement of Google, which used to be, and he did put this up on the screen,  our mission is to organize the world's information.  This is from Ben Thompson's Strategory article.  Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  But really, the new mission statement, I think, is, and much shorter, much sweeter, building a more helpful Google for everyone.  We want to be helpful.  And Pachai says, when we say helpful, we mean giving you the tools to increase your knowledge, success, health, and happiness.  And we're going to make a little money in advertising. Big deal.

It's not, you know, we're doing stuff, and as a side effect, we're going to make billions of dollars in advertising.  It's a strategy credit.  It's not a bad thing, Thompson writes.

And that's just going to happen anyway.  So why not go ahead and say, or, you know, hit back at Tim Cook and say, you know, your devices are meant for rich people, you know?

He's the guy with the Russian action and the speech impediment.  And they showed him training the assistant that I could barely understand. The assistant could understand him easily.  What they what they kind of mentioned was that it took fifteen thousand voice samples from Dimitri.  That's why I think he probably works at Google so that he could understand him.  But I think that that's euphonia. That was project euphonia.  In fact, they even said we're looking for more people.  So if you have a friend or relative or, you know, with that assistant doesn't understand very well, G.co slash euphonia.  We want you to help us so we can make better speech recognition.  You've got to praise them for all that. I honestly don't think they're cynical about promoting this.  I think they sincerely do want to be more helpful.  And they understand that the engine that makes this all possible, the thing that pays for the moon shots and the research and the artificial intelligence is advertising.

I like sixty dollars a month.  Don't you make enough money on the terminal?  Come on. You're rich already, Michael.  No, no, it's fine. He can charge.  He can charge.  But I think we prefer an ad supported world if ads would work.  The problem that journalism has right now, I'm sure the fast companies facing this is that people are using ad blockers.  Ads aren't working. And so it's harder and harder to good journalism on an ad supported model.  That's why I drink Nestle quick.  You should try Sport Team.  You know what? When we do our ads, I pull out the blue paper.  I say, here's an ad. I don't. I'm not embarrassed to do ads.  We try to pick products that are good and all that stuff.  I think that's a virtue.  And it is unfortunate that advertising, partly because ad tech has gotten such a bad rap.  Facebook has done us a disservice, right?

Search. This is just the beginning.  At some point, it's going to be possible for you to plug in a search and to have the content, the actual content of podcasts to be pulled back because that's easy for Google to index at that point.

Where are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you're doing that in the Google I.O. app.  Actually, they had a little preview of this.  They had map terminals throughout the whole spread at Shoreline.  And in order to orient it, it wasn't showing the actual layout because, of course, it was a temporary layout for just those three days.  But you would go away, assistant.  You would point it at this almost like this, this, this sign that which had something that kind of looked like a QR code, but it wasn't really.  And that was how it oriented.  And then when you lifted your camera up, all the tents and everything, you saw these little balloons popping out of them that said sandbox or live demo or whatever.  And so that, you know, in that true AR mode, you knew exactly where you had to go from it.

But I also love the idea that it says turn left here and shows an arrow on the sidewalk that says that way.  I need that. It's only walking directions.  It's not, you know, while you're driving.  I mean, it's probably less useful, but whenever I'm using maps for walking, I always turn left when I should turn right.  It's never obvious.  Same, same, same.  So having that arrow go that way, dummy.  By the way, I found your $17 wedding dress.  I've been searching.  And thanks to Hello Beautiful, I'm Monica.

Transcript:  You know, one of the things people do and I did is with Google is we're a little nervous about Google holding all of our mail.  I finally got off Gmail and the solution is difficult.  You can go to another email provider, but then they've got all your mail.  It's not that I don't trust Google particularly.  It's just that no one should have all my mail.  That's 12 years of my life and I never delete anything on Gmail.  I found something so cool.  They actually came on the show on the screensaver show.  This is called the helm.  It is a personal.  Well, it starts as a personal email server.  Actually, now they've added some new features that make it a file server and a photo server as well.  So there's a real challenge to doing your own email.  This is the helm.  It looks really cool, by the way, doesn't it?  It's a pyramid or a triangle shaped server, 128 gigs of storage, SSD, very fast SSD, upgradeable to five terabytes.  It takes about five minutes to set up.  It has Wi-Fi or Ethernet.  The challenge in doing your own email server, though, is complicated.  First of all, almost certainly on a residential Internet connection, you cannot send email.  They block it.  They will block it.  And even if you could send out email, almost all email providers, including Google,  reject it if it's coming from an IP address that's a personal IP address because they're almost always in the black holes for spam.  So what helm does is very clever.  Your mail is lives only on your server.  But in order to send it out, they route it through their own IP address at Amazon, the route it through.  And that IP address is a specially conditioned IP address so that your email be accepted everywhere.  They also use email authentication, the big three, DMARC, SPF and DKIM.  By the way, I just saw a study of the top 20 Democratic candidates for president.  Only one of them is using email authentication.  They all need a helm.  DMARC, SPF and DKIM.  That helps your email get through because it says, yes, this is who sent it.  The data is fully encrypted.  Keys are stored on a secure enclave on the server.  In fact, there's a really cool feature when you first set up your helm.  They have a very cool looking USB key you attach to the helm to copy your recovery keys off.  Put that somewhere safe.  Even if you lose your server, if your house burns down, helm is backing the encrypted data up.  They never have access to your data and you can get all of your email and data back from the helm servers.  But you'll need that recovery key.  It's secure boot.  No one can hack it.  And the authentication is proximity based.  Two factors through the helm app.  You put the helm app on your phone.  You authenticate by standing next, using Bluetooth LE, standing next to the helm server.  And that's how you create the account, create additional accounts.  Unlimited email accounts.  I set up my own domain for email, but you can have multiple domains.  You know, the interview, Micah Lee did a great piece on the interceptor.  I highly recommend it if you want to know more about the helm.  Micah is an expert who taught, has taught like journalists how to protect.  You know, the intercept is of course where Glenn Greenwald and Snowden stuff ended up.  Micah has taught journalists how to protect themselves.  He set up an helm server.  He wrote all about it on the April 30th article about helm.  So read it.  It'll give you all the information at theintercept.com.  If you want a more technical look at it.  He really drilled down.  Now they added Nextcloud.  This is really good.  Nextcloud is the open source file server.  So you can get file sync, file sharing.  You can back up all your photos to the helm.  Which means you can upload, view and share your files and photos securely.  This is a great replacement, not just now for your email, but for Google Drive, for Dropbox.  I am just such a fan.  Privacy is a right, not a setting.  Protect what matters with helm.  Right now we've got $50 off the helm personal server.  The helm.com slash twit.  I only have one thing to say though.  I see on the site.  It says sold out.  That's temporary.  They're making them as fast as they can.  These ads work too well.  I apologize.  But if you go right now, they're accepting deposits.  So the minute they get more shipped in.  And actually you'll get the next generation, which is nice.  The minute they're in stock, you'll get yours.  It won't be too long.  This sometimes happens with our advertisers.  They sell out.  The helm.com slash twit.  I can totally vouch for it is what I'm using for my email now.  It is so, by the way, it's good looking enough that you could actually put it on your coffee table in your living room.  There's going to be more all the time they're adding to it.  It has two type C connectors.  So there's really some extensibility built into this.  These guys are really smart.  Gary and his team did a great job.  The helm.com slash twit.  If you're so inclined and the intercept.com, if you want to read Mike, is really, I thought, a very good piece, a very balanced piece on the helm.  You can see all the details.  I was really pleased to read that.  Hey, you got a phone at least, right?  Google did not hand out new Pixelbooks because there aren't any.  I'm sorry.  Did not hand out new Galaxy Wear or not Galaxy.  Android Wear watches.  Oh, man.

Start time: 5000.90
End time: 5032.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, this really, in my opinion, this places a lot of pressure on Google to come out with a 4 that is much different than what we're used to seeing.  Because the 1 through 3 all have the same design approach, all have kind of like a minimalist presence from Google as far as features are concerned.  Four gigs of RAM on their flagship Pixel 3 always seemed like not enough RAM compared to other flagships.  And then now they're showing that they could do four gigs of RAM in something that's half the cost with the same camera that everybody knows is why you buy a Pixel.

Start time: 5032.56
End time: 5042.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 5061.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The display.  So apparently it is a Samsung display.  I like the display.  It's a 1080p display.  If you've got the smaller version, if you've got the regular 3, they're both 1080p displays.  If you've got the 3XL like I have, this is a higher res display than what you'll get on the 3AXL.  But still, 1080p, it looks fantastic.

Start time: 5061.68
End time: 5068.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even on my Galaxy S10 Plus, I don't use the full resolution.  I don't get 1080p because it's better battery life and I can't tell the difference.  Yeah.

Yeah, they put the speakers on the bottom instead of on the front.  Do you think that's Google saying, yeah, we might have made a mistake with the notch and the headphone jack?  No.

Start time: 5091.48
End time: 5139.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just cheaper to do it this way.  You know what I mean?  They were aiming for a cheaper device here and they had to make some sacrifices in order to do that.  Not to mention the 3, not the XL, the 3 had no notch, right?  Right.  I don't have a notch on mine.  So they don't have to do the notches on their displays anymore.  They better not.  Yeah.  We'll certainly find out what they do.  I just feel like it places a lot more pressure on Google to really do something different  with the 4 because right now if someone asks me, someone on Twitter asks me, I've got the  one I want to upgrade.  Do I get the 3 or do I get the 3A?  And I'm like, if you have to buy now, 3A.  At this point, no one should buy the 3.  No, you don't buy the 3.  Unless.  If you can wait, wait for the 4 because maybe there's going to be some really cool stuff.  Why should I spend 300 bucks more for a 3?

Start time: 5179.70
End time: 5205.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And on that note, I will say that I was very frustrated with my Pixel 3 over Google I.O.  because that's like the real stress test of these phones.  Oh yeah, you've got to take a picture real quick.  But also because I'm going between Android Auto and just like jumping out of my car,  I was just moving everywhere last week and I had to restart the phone a couple times  because Bluetooth would break between my car, RoV, and my watch.  Sometimes things would just slow down to a crawl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So did Google ship this because...  Okay, I'll give you a multiple choice question.  Yes.  Did they ship it because the 3 was too expensive?  They said in their quarterly results, we were facing some headwinds at the high end phone.  So they weren't selling them very well.  No kidding.

Start time: 5222.52

Start time: 5256.90

Accurate, but some people are saying now that it's the well-being, the digital well-being  that is recording everything you're doing on the Pixel phone.  If you turn that off, it's much faster.  Huh.  I haven't read that.  But I think there's memory management issues on the Pixel 3.  And I think that's part of this.  There have always been memory management issues in stock Android.

Start time: 5319.48
End time: 5339.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They never fixed it.  It's been like that since the Nexus devices.  That's true.  Quite honestly.  Because all the Pixels have treated me the same.  It's by the time I.O. would come, which is a good halfway after they launched them in  October.  You got really comfortable with that phone.  I would start to really feel the slowdown.  And then I would say, well, you know what?  I'm doing this for a living anyway.  I guess I'm going to buy the new phone in October.

And I really would not know the difference.  In my daily use, I've been using the 3A and it's very rarely that I'm like, oh, yeah,  that's right, I'm on the 3A.

End time: 5419.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think it's...  Yeah, it's kind of interesting that they did that because in some ways they're shooting  themselves in the foot on it.  Why pay more?  Because it's free.  At this point, most people are going to say, well, you get the camera and that's really,  at the end of the day, that's the big selling point of Pixel right now, is that excellent  camera.

Start time: 5469.90
End time: 5481.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the other problem, right?  So, in fact, you started saying that.  How are they going to...  How is Google going to get people into the stores in this fall?  What are they going to do with the Pixel 4 that's going to make people buy one?

Start time: 5481.76
End time: 5546.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm curious to find out.  I think that they kind of hinted a little bit to what we'll see in the Pixel 4 in the  keynote where they were talking about moving more of the machine language onto the device.  That assistant demo, from what I understand, was done on a device that's still unidentified.  And so, I'm guessing that the 4 is going to hinge a lot more around speed along with the  smarts of their software, of their AI happening on device.  So, that you've got your mid-ranger that can do a lot of really neat things.  But if you get the premium one, you can do things faster.  You can do things more securely.  So much more of that has moved onto the device.  And not to mention, they really need to...  This single-camera approach has been awesome.  I mean, they've done a lot with it because they have the software to back it up.  But they need to get with the times and realize that these other phones that they're competing  with do have multiple cameras.  And those are actually in demand.  People want a wide.  People want an optical zoom.  So, take your software, your amazing image software, and apply it to these multiple cameras.  And then people have more of a reason to believe that Pixel is the phone camera.

Oh, playing a long game.  So, I doubt very much Apple's...  Meanwhile in Europe.  Apple's probably not going to do a 5G phone next year, maybe not even for a few years.  I doubt...

Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's pressure on carriers right now to start getting some of the money  back out of their investment in 5G because the equipment is expensive, the radio density  is higher, and I think there's pressure from Wall Street on them to start.

And I predict even if you do, because of the cost of putting in enough 5G cell sites to  make it faster, you won't even see faster.  Maybe you'll see lower latency.  But honestly, nowadays, if you've got LTE, you're probably as fast as you need to be.  What are people doing that they need to be more than 20 or 30 megabits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People overestimate the anonymity of Incognito mode, by the way.  It's not really Incognito.  It's just really hiding your history from your spouse, I think.  Mostly.  Google knows where you are.  Your ISP knows where you are.  The police know where you are.  Let's see. What else?  This is a surprise.  Cross-site tracking is going to be blockable in Chrome.  Google's really balancing this.  What does AdTech need with what do consumers want?  So far, I kind of like the direction.  They're moving a little bit more towards consumers.  They're also solving this big problem with Android security by moving more and more components into the Play Store.  Absolutely.

Transcript:  You're talking about Project Mainline.  Mainline, as far as my walk away, one of the things I'm most excited about is Project Mainline.  I think it promises to be even more along the lines of what Project Tango started a couple of years ago.  Sorry, not Tango.  Tango's long gone at this point.  Too many projects that Google killed, by the way.  Treble, componentizing the OS.  Mainline is further doing that and updating in the background.  I just think as far as security updates, which has long been such a huge critical thing with Android, failing miserably at keeping phones updated when it comes to security, this has the potential to help because they worked with OEMs.  So essentially, if an OEM is going to install Q on the device, it has to be okay with the fact that this is happening underneath the scenes.  And if this was in place when stage fright happened, then Google could have easily pushed out an update to the media codec and it never would have been an issue.  It would have been a fright.

Start time: 5928.54

Start time: 5951.48
End time: 5967.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a way I thought, oh, Treble and Mainline, the idea will be to get these old Android phones at least up to snuff.  They'll never be up to snuff.  It's here forward.  So it's kind of a trailing edge.  You're going to, well, in a few years, phones sold from now on will be upgradable.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Living in America.  Anything else?  Oh, this is a big story.  And I didn't fully grasp this.  I'm hoping that maybe you can explain it.  I thought this was just rebranding.  Basically, Nest is now Google Nest.  But what is dying really is works with Nest.  Yes.  And the notion of IoT divide.  For a long time, Google said Nest is going to, when they acquired it, it's an independent company.  Tony Fidel, when he was still running Nest, said, don't worry, we're never going to share the information from our cameras, our smart thermostats.  We're never going to share that with Google.  Last year, Google said, come here.  And made Nest part of Google.  This year, they're even basically saying the works with Nest thing is dead.  It's all Google now.  And I wonder if people are going to be aware of that.  I mean, they're going to be aware of the very infelicitous naming like the Nest X Yale lock with Google Nest Connect.  It just rolls off the tongue.  The Google Nest Hub Max.  But more than that, I think that...  The Google Nest Cam IQ is out.  Nest is gone, right?  This is the beginning of the end for the idea of Nest as a separate company.  Ish.

Start time: 6060.05
End time: 6066.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ish.  It is the beginning of the end as a separate company.  So I'm actually looking into this right now to kind of because...

Start time: 6066.80
End time: 6069.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ronam Audio said Nest's smart home platform is dead.  Yes.

Start time: 6070.48
End time: 6110.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's okay.  Fine.  Nest is dead, but it's not dead.  It's still there.  It's just the Google Assistant now.  It's not dead yet.  It's just unifying these two different platforms to make it easier.  First of all, for marketing, it's going to make it much easier.  It's going to make it easier for smart home novices to kind of understand what works with their products.  And it's also worth mentioning that the technology that's in this Nest Hub Max, which has a camera in it,  is not at all like the technology that's inside a Nest security camera, which costs about the same.  So I asked for some clarification on this and how it works.  It's a completely different facial algorithm.  Oh, interesting.  So you actually...

Start time: 6110.50
End time: 6112.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it sounded like a Nest camera built into the Hub.  It's not.

Start time: 6113.50
End time: 6125.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't know about that.  I said, okay.  So from what I understand is that you can go into the Nest app and view the camera feed just to have it there if your concern is security, because you still have to have it.

Start time: 6125.56
End time: 6128.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they did say it would recognize people like the Nest IQ does.

Start time: 6128.48
End time: 6136.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, but you have to record the face.  So you have to teach it the faces in your house.  Oh, so it's all done on device.

Start time: 6137.70
End time: 6143.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the Nest IQ, and by the way, it never worked as far as I could tell.  Theoretically, it would start to recognize you after a while.

Start time: 6143.60

Start time: 6144.91

Start time: 6147.82
End time: 6163.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Nest Hello works particularly well.  That's the doorbell.  Yes, the doorbell, which is the same camera infrastructure.  And you don't have to pay for this camera either.  So you don't have to pay for Nest Aware if you want to keep any of the security footage.  You don't have to have the subscription.  Nope.  It's just completely the idea.

Start time: 6164.52
End time: 6183.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Amadio says that Works with Nest is the website.  The website says Works with Nest is winding down.  Yes.  The Nest ecosystem, and this is the concern, will shut down August 31st.  Does that mean if you have Works with Nest, things like this IQ camera, it's going to stop working?  No.  They're going to transfer it over to Google.

Start time: 6185.07
End time: 6228.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We need to get...  I'm working on getting clarification for that.  I'm actually doing some independent reporting of my own right now.  Thank you.  I know that everybody is very tired of Google I.O.  So we're giving them a break right now.  But from what I understand is you're still going to have to pay for the Aware subscription  to be able to have those features because there's a security system to take into account.  There's a thermostat.  There are smoke detectors.  It's a whole ecosystem of home things.  And I think they're just bringing the Nest in because that brand loyalty exists everywhere now.  People know Nest.  They don't necessarily know maybe that Google is a big driving force behind it.

Start time: 6228.64
End time: 6276.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Lutron, which is a Works with Nest light switch thing, sent a notice to its customers saying  the ability to automate lighting function based on the Nest's home and away status,  person alerts from Nest cameras or smoke and carbon monoxide detection from a next protector  will be affected by the change.  It will remove the ability to control the Nest from within the Lutron app.  This is Dan Seifert writing on The Verge.  Echo won't be able to adjust the thermostat anymore after August 31st or display Nest cam feeds.  So this is that ecosystem, a third party ecosystem.  Logitech Harmony remotes won't be able to change Nest alarm and home away modes.  Hue lights will not be able to change color when Nest detects smoke or carbon monoxide.  These are things I didn't rely on, but I bet you a lot of people set up homes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To do all this.  Yes.  No.  You think Google is going to come, we're going to get a second post from Google that says,  oh, don't worry, we're going to take over those features.  Yes.  Okay, good.

Start time: 6289.54
End time: 6304.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because from what I understand, it's like IFTTT.  So a lot of these things that are mentioned are little IFTTT triggers.  And that is going away because Nest.  They did say that's going away.  Yes, because Nest is just going to go away, but they're going to replace it with the Google Assistant.

Start time: 6304.64
End time: 6315.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they have a Google, in effect, a Google IFTTT inside the Assistant.  They already do with routines.  But does that mean you're going to have to go through all of these devices and set up new triggers?

Start time: 6315.78
End time: 6325.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

We're still working on ways for our customers to continue to use other systems with their nest products after account migration.

We have plenty of room to use it as an everyday car.  And especially when you consider all the standard features, especially the safety features like  the adaptive cruise, the lane keeping, the blind spot monitor.

Transcript:  I was impressed just with her presentation.  I have to watch the show.  Yeah.  And that's neat.  By the way, the Niro car of the year, according to popular mechanics, EVs are taking off.  Our show today brought to you by Hot Cloud Storage.  It's so hot, it's Wasabi Hot.  If you...  It's the best name.  Actually, I have to say, good friend David Friend who created this, he was the CEO of  Carbonite, a serial entrepreneur.  He created the ARP synthesizer way back when.  He's really a neat guy.  His CTO, Jeff Flowers, invented and patented something at Carbonite that is huge.  The ability to lay data on disks, not in blocks or sectors as your computer does, but sequentially,  which speeds things up about six times faster and 80% cheaper than the better known, oh,  let's say it, Amazon S3.  Wasabi.  People are moving to the cloud.  I understand that.  The cloud is the focus of so many businesses.  According to the Gartner Group, by 2025, 80% of enterprises will have shut down their traditional  data centers.  That means they'll be migrating to the cloud because of cost savings, operational efficiencies,  the ability to scale.  And I would submit that data in the cloud is often more secure than your on-premises  data.  Well, especially if it's Wasabi.  Let me talk about Wasabi.  11.9 is a durability.  And they have something called immutable storage.  You can say some of the data you've stored in Wasabi cannot be changed.  It's immutable.  It cannot be harmed by ransomware.  It cannot be affected by fumble-fingered employees.  They've got multiple data centers.  It's as secure as can be.  And it's enterprise-class cloud storage.  It's 80% cheaper and six times faster than Amazon's S3.  And it uses the S3 API.  So it's just as easy to use.  You already have all the tools you need.  This is disruptive technology.  But they've got a problem.  People know Google Cloud.  They know Azure.  They know S3.  I want the world to know about Wasabi.  And I know you're going to look at the other ones.  But please add a fourth name to that list.  Wasabi.  W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  HIPAA FINRA compliant.  It's totally secure, totally reliable.  And the price is right.  Not only is it less expensive, they don't charge for egress.  So it's much easier to plan because you know exactly how much it's going to cost.  And you have access to that data at no cost.  Egress is free.  You've got to check it out.  Calculate the savings for yourself.  You can try it for free with unlimited storage.  Normally the trial is one terabyte for a month.  Unlimited storage for a month when you go to Wasabi.com  and use our free trial link.  Use the offer code TWIT.  TWIT.  Join the movement.  Migrate your data to the cloud and do it with confidence.  By the way, they make it even easier if you have petabytes of data.  You can move petabytes at once with the Wasabi ball.  I love the name.  Get a nice hot ball of Wasabi.  Put all the data on there.  Mail it.  It's amazing.  Wasabi.com.  You can use the offer code TWIT.  All I ask, all I ask is you try it out.  Just consider the alternative Wasabi.  A bit of a shock to some Tesla owners.  Roadshow had this story today.  Tesla uses an old friend in their media center, EMMC Storage.  But there's a little bit of a problem.  It turns out that EMMC's memory can only be written to a certain number of times.  And when it fails on the Tesla, you pretty much add a lot.  It doesn't quite brick the car, but it makes it so that you can't really drive it.  You can't really charge it.  And here's the worst thing.  It's not covered.  If you're outside a warranty, Tesla does not stock the part, nor will it service it.

Start time: 7063.24
End time: 7074.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just thinking about that on the way here with all the Teslas on the road, because  there are a lot.  I was just thinking about, oh yeah, I guess there's a huge problem.  Yeah, I guess there's a huge team of people that are programming for these cars.  This is an Achilles heel.

Start time: 7075.02
End time: 7112.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the funny thing is Tesla really locks it down.  If you get known as somebody who's doing this, they can literally disable your vehicle.  And Elon has been known to do things a little different.  He's a bit of a hothead.  So I don't know much more about it, but if you look at Roadshow, when the EMMC fails,  your car will be limited on how fast it can go.  Your climate control won't work.  The charging could fail.  And this can happen in a couple of years.

Transcript:  That's the point of the book is the big cost is getting out of the Earth's gravitational force.  That gravitational well is what costs you all the money.  But once you get out there and mine the asteroid, and so, well, I don't want to spoil the book.  It's a great book.  Highly recommended.  We'll talk about it with Daniel Suarez on Friday at 1130 a.m. Pacific if you want to tune in for the next triangulation.  But that's the point is that they don't bring it back.  They go out, they mine the asteroid, and it becomes material for continued space exploration, including water and vital essential elements.  Sorry, I brought it up.

I thought it was an interesting leap of faith to make to add in the music service when everybody else was charging for it, and that was one of Bezos' kind of decisions that everyone was like, wait a minute, why would you just include this in Prime?  Amazon's music service has never been amazing compared to the competitors, but still it worked out all right.  Somehow they were able to make those numbers work at scale.

When someone orders a three dollar toothbrush and we send them send it to them to deliver,  there's no way we can make money on that.  So that's why they created the add ons where and this always pisses me off.  Well, we can't really ship that to you, but you got to order something else.  Right.

It's a perspective piece.  Amazon has been eavesdropping on you this whole time.  Well, come on. Of course it has.  And he's not even saying it's listening to you all the time, although he's kind of that.  It kind of implies it's always listening to you.  What he's saying is whenever you send anything to your Echo, Amazon keeps a copy of it, as  does Google.  We know and Siri.  And this is how they train a eye.

And when I saw this first kicking around online, I was like, OK, yeah, I feel like we've known  this for a long time.  But, you know, there's probably a whole lot of people that have echoes that don't know  what exactly is happening to their voice data that it's actually stored somewhere.  They don't even think, you know, maybe they don't even know that it's it's sending it  to a server in the cloud.  Maybe they think it's all happening.

Here's a first Hamas.  Cyber attacks Israel.  Israel responds with bombs.  This is, to my knowledge, the first time there's been a physical bombing attack based on a  cyberspace attack, a cyber attack.  I don't know if that's what you would consider that proportional, but get ready because this  is the beginning.

Start time: 8144.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

You know, Israel could just say that there was a cyber attack.  How do I know that?  And it doesn't matter who the players are, by the way.  You know, it's it's it's troubling.

Transcript:  Now, the attack was against the people who made the cyber attack.  It was against the Hamas cyber units headquarters.  So the idea is, well, we're going to take those hackers out.  And actually, I was wrong.  The U.S. did it first in 2015.  We sent a drone strike to kill Junaid Hussain, who was a British citizen in charge of ISIL's  hacker groups.  He had dumped personal details of military forces online via Twitter.  So we took him out with a drone.  So it isn't the first time that we've used force or anybody's used force to counter hacking  attacks.  I it really worries me that we're going to see that.

It's not if if we get into a habit of this reaction with overwhelming physical force  in response, that's a that's a bad rule to have in place.  That's a bad president.

Transcript:  The U.S. Justice Department has indicted a group of Chinese hackers for, among other  things, the anthem attack.  You know how I didn't realize this, but now the way we know that it's a nation state,  particularly the Chinese government doing these hacks, is when the information doesn't  get on the dark web.  So if a normal hacker attacks an insurance company and gets a lot of information, they  would sell it on the dark web.  When a nation state gets it, they're getting it for other reasons.  They're not getting it for financial gain.  In case of China, they're apparently collecting information about U.S.  military, about Chinese citizens abroad and medical research, medical.  There's lots of reasons for them to do it.  So the anthem attack, which we I think we suspected was in fact, I think the U.S.  government had said was a Chinese effort, is now, according to the DOJ, there's now  an indictment.  What was the number of 78 million records from anthem, which is a big U.S.  insurer, 78.8 million records, including names, health identification numbers, dates of birth,  social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment  information, and income data.
