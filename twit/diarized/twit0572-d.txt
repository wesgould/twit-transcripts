Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know what is Verizon done with a OL?  It's really made a well more exciting more modern more innovative and that just makes me think what are they gonna do with Yahoo?  I don't really I understand that they're trying to build themselves into a media company into a fully fledged tech company  and not just you know dumb pipes per se as a telecom provider, but I  Just you know  I don't really know what Verizon's vision is with Yahoo based on what they've done or not done with with a OL

Start time: 419.16
End time: 458.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Oh 90 yeah, and they're already delivering you know video content  and  You know I guess if you're controlling the pipes you know Comcast NBC's trying to do the same thing  I don't know

She's got I think I think she had it was put in a position of really something that was impossible

Start time: 876.40

Oh, man. You're made was a motor. Oh before yeah  And this is a major major part of that is is his team is it's it starts with the phone and branches out to  Things like home maybe some tablets and Chromebooks and VR headsets if you want to get wacky  But I mean it starts with the phone and I mean as we know they have this major update problem and Samsung and HTC  And the carrier partners can't get it together  So they're gonna take matters in their own hands now  And it's gonna be really interesting next year to see what kind of phone they build first and then build out from there

It's BSD  Yeah, yeah, and so what this was doing is it was using  The the API that iOS uses to render images right and taking advantage of that very similar that yeah  So you get something in you think it's a TIF you render it as a TIF and then and then it changes into into malware  so  You know all all the all the software updates went out on Monday  So if you have any kind of Apple device like it's not advice is instruction  Update it to the latest operating system you have it's free. Just take the time to do it  You know the fix is already there  But this was a serious enough thing that it pushed Android to issue  monthly  OS updates, you know Google to push monthly OS updates to Android last year, so it's not a joke  It's definitely something people could take advantage of especially with Cisco the way they explained it  They kind of detailed how how the exploit works and and and really you know now that it's publicly known  It seems like folks would would actually take advantage of it's really important that you updated.

I want to talk a little bit about Windows  We're only a few days away now from the end of the Windows 10 free upgrade and Microsoft's in one last annoying push  Getting even a little bit more  Little bit more a little bit more aggressive  Getting you to Windows  10 lots to talk about I got a great panel for you mark million from Bloomberg Business Week  Bloomberg comm slash tech from the Wall Street Journal Nathan Olivares Giles and from tech insider  tech insider dot IO  Steve Kovac we got a new sponsor to tell you about you know actually I'm gonna show you  Framing have you ever done framing like framing a picture? Yeah, like you got a poster no  No, you don't because you just put it on the wall with thumbtacks cuz you're a young guy frames are expensive  Oh, you're right. They're horribly expensive. Yeah, unless I got a new sponsor my walls are just empty  It's no but because you should you know, you should put some stuff up. I'll tell you about frame bridge  This was actually founded by somebody who did a frame  Week, I think what did she have she had a drawing. What was it?  We heard the story she had a poster and the frame cost more than the poster  She said well, this is this is cookie  So she started frame bridge, which is the easy way to do custom framing online and you know  I I've been I've been doing framing of crazy things like this is look at this  This is an a 2fx motherboard framed. Oh, that's right. That is cool. You know, it's not just pictures you can frame  This one I gotta get reframed. I'm gonna send this to frame bridge. Look at this. This is core memory  Remember the old you don't remember it but the old days memory was wires around magnetic cores  So motherboards make a great thing you got pictures you can get your Instagram pictures  They have many frames for Instagram pictures. We have I  Thought since they're a new sponsor. I'm gonna show you what it looks like pricing starts at $39 for an Instagram  If you've got a giant movie poster  $139 now if you check the frame store two or three times more so this is very affordable  They have a happiness guarantee. They guarantee  That they will give each piece personal care and attention and if you're not happy full refund so you're never at risk  So what I forgot what we framed now, I sent this away and I forgot what we're trying to see here  They pulled on screenshot by the way, they package it  Because it's your precious thing right very well. So you'll have to forgive me here as I tear into this  packaging  You know bubble wrap and everything. Oh look at this. This is nice. This is a family photo that we got  Think Lisa took this picture and how much did this cost Lisa it was under a hundred bucks at that, right?  So it's a small frame  Instead of spending hundreds of dollars at a framing store. Let frame bridge  Take care of you call them you can walk through it or you can do it fully online for diplomas  I have now I'm gonna send this off next a map. I love it of all the undersea cables  It's huge and we looked at getting it framed at our frame store. It was so expensive. I said I'm not doing that  So we got frame bridge now whether you're looking for eclectic frames for the photos on your phone  You need help planning a gallery wall frame bridge has you covered and we've got a deal for you  Get this out here. Look at that. That's isn't that beautiful. Look at that. It's a nice shot beautifully framed  I think Lisa took that of Michael our son and his friend Tanner, right? That's beautiful. That was in Newport Beach and  It's look it's all framed  They send you in in that with a kid everything you need to hang it on the wall  They even put little felt stops. So this is this is a quality framing job. This is not a budget framing job  But it is a budget price. They use premium real wood moldings acid-free matte  So that it won't decay the thing you're framing as the as the matte decays foam board  Shatterproof acrylic glazing so it looks it's as good as glass but less glare and it protects you from UV  So it really protects your artwork  their delivery timeline is  Incredible they get it to you fast and you're gonna get 15% off when you go to frame bridge comm and  Use the promo code to it 15% off your first order  This is a  Something that people don't do because it is so expensive. I  Can tell you having framed art whether it's yours or framed photos is awesome  And what a fun thing to do to take your Instagram photo and get a frame instantly  framebridge.com and  Make sure you use that offer code twit so you get 15% off  you could safely ship your art to the studio and their prepaid packaging or  Upload a picture on the framebridge site or use the framebridge app and you can even upload directly from Instagram  framebridge  Comm we welcome them to this week in tech nice to have you  moving along  talking about more tech news  Elon Musk's master plan.

It wasn't part one. It was just master plan master plan  So he did this ten years ago and actually I give him a lot of credit because he's he's always been very upfront about what  Are we trying to do here?  And it's not I don't it's not I want to build a rocket company with SpaceX or I want to build a car  Company with Tesla or I want to build a solar panel company. It's all about kind of looking at the future  I really admire this guy  looking at a  Sustainable future for our planet getting us off fossil fuels getting us on renewable and in order to do that  He says we got to own all the pieces of the puzzle. We need to move to electric vehicles. We need to make  So solar panels everywhere  This the power wall is interesting Tesla makes a giant home battery that allows you to completely get off the grid  You charge the battery during the day with your solar panels. It keeps your house running at night  It's it I think it's pretty impressive  Now the plan also includes and this is the most interesting thing now. We're starting to look forward with part duh  Making semi  Tractor trailer trucks electric trucks  buses people movers  He also has in the plan  The idea that you might not use your car all the time that you might let others use it kind of rent it out

Transcript:  What do you think all of this? I like it that he dreams big I think it he did actually fulfill  Quite a bit in the original master plan was we'll build a very expensive small volume car  Sell that to bootstrap a medium  Expensive luxury sedan luxury sedan. That's the model s. I don't know about the crossover the model X SUV  I think that was in there. Is that in there too expensive?  Yeah, and then the idea being to use all of that to bootstrap an affordable. Yeah, model 3 model 3 although

Start time: 2148.88
End time: 2169.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's in the second master plan  He did sort of acknowledge that he's abandoned it because the original goal was both the model 3 and then keep pouring all of the  Infos of cash into creating cheaper and cheaper vehicles, which he's now he in the new plan  He said I think the three is cheap enough. We're gonna do something about doing like a pickup truck

Start time: 2170.00

Yeah, he's a big shareholder anyway  Yeah, so it kind of is his right? So yeah, I would say success in part one  It's time to start thinking about part two

Start time: 2198.98
End time: 2217.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there was quite a bit of trying to sell the solar city deal that he proposed that the shareholders hate  Why do the shareholders hate it?  Because they feel like it's risky and that it's it's largely disconnected from  Building a car company. Well, I think that's part of why he released part do

Start time: 2218.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His master plan now is to show like hey, I have a vision. This is how these things tie together  this is where it's all going and  you know, I think it he's making his public argument and  Especially with with him coming out recently saying he thinks it's this is gonna pass by a two-thirds vote  To approve this he believes that the stockholders will go for it. Well, he believed he believes that  Yes, it seems he also leaves were in a simulation and it's not real, right?  Yeah, but he's trying to sell people on that like he this is his pitch and he's saying it's gonna be two-thirds  And even if he doesn't believe it, he's trying to make it a reality  He's trying to swing people around I God bless him and I I should disclose

Transcript:  I bought into this because I put a deposit down in October for a Model X and picked it up yesterday or Friday  Took the factory tour. They're already remodeling the factory. They're already making it's a big factory  They bought the old General Motors new me plant which has ten times the capacity  That it's using right now. And so a lot of it's just store storage warehouse. It's empty  But they but they were they were starting construction for the model three part of it. It's kind of a cool plant  It's all a lot of robots a lot of big giant German and Japanese robot arms doing arc welding  Moving the car on and off conveyor belts. It's pretty amazing  So I may be a little bit of a Kool-Aid drinker or what is it?  eponema pomegranate  Drink when it comes to a Tesla, but I love the idea and I have to say  You know, we have solar city panels. I've ordered a power wall the idea of when I drive down the street  It's being not just zero emissions from the car  But zero footprint because I made the energy with the help of the Sun I made the energy myself is kind of a nice feeling  And I I think that this is a reasonable

Transcript:  Place to push the world, right if we're gonna save it. It makes a lot of sense. I'd like to see a little bit more accessibility  I'd like to see him not nicely  Yeah, yeah  But I mean, you know  That's that's where things start and even though he did like Mark said pull back a little bit on that plan for cheaper  Electric vehicles it still seems to be part of what the overall vision is  But I mean, I think that that's super important if it's gonna catch on  There needs to be no barriers based on your income level to take part in this sort of thing  Which there those are real and those exist today, but I think the the the semi trucks  running on electric power is actually pretty huge because that's kind of an economic, you know backbone  It's something that's that's not gonna get replaced anytime soon as far as like shuffling things around the country and internationally and  If you can sell an entire industry on that to support electric vehicles  You know, maybe that can help subsidize some of the consumer facing business

Start time: 2385.74
End time: 2504.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's also really still all in on autonomy, even though there have been some negative headlines  He points out worse. We're terrible drivers  The automotive fatalities are up 8%  in 2015 to one death in every 89 million miles  He pointed out very quickly that Tesla's autopilot has been death-free for 100 was death-free for 110 million miles  So even by that measure, it's safer. He says autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and  System gets better every day  He says consumer reports said you should disable it or at least relabel it autopilot is  Giving people's confidence in something  They shouldn't have confidence in he says it would make no more sense to disable autopilot as some have called for  Than it would to disable autopilot and aircraft after which our system is named and he points out it's beta  And he said we're gonna keep it beta till the autopilot is ten times safer  than the US vehicle average at that point will remove the beta label and  When self-driving is approved true self-driving is approved by regulators  It will mean you'll be able to summon your Tesla from anywhere  Once it picks you up, you'll be able to sleep read or do anything else en route to your destination  This is by the way people read this and they think they can do it now and that's why  Really maybe shouldn't be pushing this so hard because there are people doing that don't do that. You're not  You'll also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet by tapping a button on the phone app  And have it generate income for you while you're at work on vacation  Significantly offsetting at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. There's a real problem right now  We're building a lot of cars and most cars are not sit there utilized more than 10%  So that's a that's a huge waste of natural resources the idea of sharing can make a massive difference as well  You know what you don't you isn't it great that you have people who dream big I?

Transcript:  To put a little reality check it's not just Elon Musk who's thinking about this like I mean  He put out this cool master plan is Elon Musk so we kind of glorify it a little bit  But Ford and GM and all the traditional car companies are thinking exactly the same way  Especially when it comes to those services and car sharing and leasing out your own car  So it's not just an Elon Musk thing. I think we're a little

Oh, I know and I've talked I've talked to  Brad I can't remember his name Templeton who is an autonomous car expert  He was one of the creators of used net  He's been around a long time and I talked to him five years ago  He said none of this really makes lives up to its potential until you can have a car come to you when you need it  And then take off when you don't need it. That's the ultimate hope for autonomous vehicles  It's not about us not driving as much as it is about a much more even distribution of transportation

Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think you have to give Musk a ton of credit for like you said stimulating driving this conversation  It would probably be taking place whether he was there or not  But I mean a good example is that that new me plant that was a Nissan Toyota Toyota slash GM, right?  Yeah, that he bought they were making some electric cars there, right and they shut it down  They pull very famously right famously General Motors has seen the movie who killed the electric car exactly  I mean there's there are a lot of reasons why automotive companies don't want us to leave fossil fuels behind  There are a lot of reasons why energy companies like, you know, the oil companies don't want us to leave these things behind  They're they're they're dipping their toes in the water  They're saying this is the future of everything and they're going that direction  But you know, no one is is doing just this the way that Elon Musk's companies are  Which you know whether or not that makes good business sense at this point is remains to be seen, right?

I love her. That's like when Wi-Fi became ubiquitous on airplanes. Yeah  And and to be clear  Microsoft has come out and said that they are working on some of these things  I think good with Ford and others to make you be really productive in the car and to make your car more like an office  And they're I mean, so this is like real stuff

I'd come home from tech TV  Be exhausted after the screensavers have to drive an hour or two back to Petaluma from San Francisco  And I was getting scared towards the end  I was cuz I was getting very sleepy and I knew I was gonna nod off someday and just plow into something  Yeah, it's not a good way to feel scary and and I had to get home  I had kids and I had to get there, but I didn't feel good about it  in fact  I was very relieved when I when I got fired because I  Thought that may mean I just saved my life there because I'm not gonna be making that commute anymore  If I were driving at that time if I were driving my Model X that thing you don't want to let it drive  But it seems like it would help you an awful lot. Mm-hmm that  You know it's stop-and-go traffic particularly on the highway. I let it drive for 80 miles almost 80 miles  And it really did it performed very well  Well, there were a few incidents where I was glad I was paying attention a bag of cement had fallen into the highway  That happens a lot here in the Bay Area. I don't know about where you live  There's always crap  Gardener's I've run into rakes  Lawnmowers bags of cement sofas. There's always for some reason on the Bay Area highways  so I saw the cement the car was driving and  Maybe it would have gone around it, but I wasn't gonna take the chance  But it's easy enough you have your hands on the wheel you steered around it  Then I tapped the stem twice and put it back into auto mode a couple of times  I did that where I didn't have the confidence that was gonna do it probably that doing the right thing  I don't think you should necessarily assume it's gonna well

Thank God  They do say by the way that if you're using assistive technologies on Windows 7 or 8.1  You will be able you will the deadline is extended, which is a good thing  Okay, so if you're using a screen reader or something like that you have a little more time to go to Windows 10  I I fully believe them when they say that what they are gonna start charging on  July 30th do not like assume ah  No, they're just joking.

Transcript:  $119 yep from July 30th onward and here's why you should do it. I  Fully respect anybody's decision to stay with Windows 7  Maybe not so much Windows 8, but I understand your decision to stay with Windows 7  And it's your right  Absolutely, it's your computer. Maybe you have software that doesn't work. Maybe you just like it better  Maybe hardware that doesn't work, but you are gonna want to acquire the license  I think so that in a year or two you at least you you're not stuck forever  Or you don't have to pay 119 bucks  You can if you want you could back up your machine  Because you don't want to take a chance make a good backup of everything  Accept the invitation do the upgrade you in theory have 30 days to roll it back  Yeah, if it doesn't work well you got the that's why you made the backup  If as soon as you've activated Windows 10 as soon as you go to you know my computer, and it says  Windows 10 activated  You can now go back because you can go to Windows 10 anytime from then on and there  I think the other reason you want to do this is I also believe and I'm curious what you guys think I also believe  Microsoft when they say this is the last version of Windows ever I  Don't  You know you think they'll be a Windows 11 yeah

Start time: 3497.32
End time: 3507.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean for the simple fact that like you know people are gonna get tired of the brand and someone in marketing is like  We need to refresh things and makes things exciting and even if it's based on the same exact thing they'll give it a new name

Start time: 3507.60
End time: 3520.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's kind of what they've been doing. I mean to be honest  Windows 7 wasn't so different from XP yep or NT or even Vista  It just had a different UI, but it was the same under the hood pretty much

Start time: 3520.66
End time: 3541.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been on OS 10 forever on the Apple side now. It's gonna be called Mac OS  It's it's the same operating system with iterative updates about every year or two  And it keeps things fresh and exciting and you know they skipped Windows 9 they called it Windows 10 and  They say it's the last version of Windows  It's ever gonna come out, but they're gonna be updating it regularly. There's gonna be new features. No guarantee

Start time: 3542.32
End time: 3592.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's why I believe them when they say this is the last version what they say  They're gonna do is two or three times a year. They'll update it so you  You're gonna get a new version of Windows yearly or maybe even more often than that  Just as you're getting the anniversary update is coming out roughly the same time frame August 2nd. I say  That's that's gonna continue. I think they don't they they still can set they'll still be selling Windows License  To business which is the big part of the profit center. You got it. It wasn't they'll still be selling it through OEMs  Because if you buy a new computer it will have Windows 10 on it and they'll get whatever they get  We don't know fifteen twenty five dollars. That's not gonna change how many people upgraded windows. I mean paid went upgraded windows  That's a small portion. That's the only money they're losing on this if they don't if they don't make you pay

Start time: 3592.59
End time: 3638.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  There is an argument and when you look at PC PC sales and analysts and stuff  They say that that a new operating system is for some a reason to buy a new computer and with the the PC  You know market sales kind of sagging a good point however many years  They're gonna have to do something to give people a reason to buy a new computer  So it might not be the name of the operating system, but it might be like okay  Well this this this laptop is gonna be able to scan your eyeballs and this one wasn't able to do so so you got to  Get Windows 10, you know Super Vista or whatever the hell it's gonna be called and  There are gonna be reasons for you to upgrade right or this one is the HoloLens compatible version of Windows 10  Where Cortana will actually talk back to you instead of just listening or whatever right so

Start time: 3639.70
End time: 3659.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean actually you might be right. Here's the here's the this is from net market share. This is operating system  Market share so much Windows 7 look at it 70 at 40 almost half 49% Windows 7 yeah, but a lot of 10  when 19% 10 which  Finally is Eclipse 8 and XP

Transcript:  I think there are a lot of people with older computers that can't or won't upgrade  There's also a lot of unattended computers and closets and running servers and things that people aren't gonna mess with but of course  They're huge security risks. They're not updating. It's be anymore so although  We haven't heard of a lot of XP exploits not in a while  So maybe it is safe to run XP. I don't know I  Could see Microsoft just saying this isn't our business anymore our business is not selling shrink-wrapped software of any kind mm-hmm  not Windows not office that used to be our business our business is  Software as a service is subscriptions to office 365. It's cloud services  We want everybody on Windows 10 so that we can make money on all that stuff  And it's more in our interest to get everybody on Windows 10 and if it means giving away  I don't know what percentage it is of people who upgraded themselves, but it's got to be less than 10%

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they well they had that goal to get to a billion Windows 10  2018 now they're saying they're not gonna make it after all but I think that's what it is  It's rather than you spending money on Windows or office once a year once every couple years once every three years  Give us a little bit of money every month and it's it it makes sense  you know, it's a it's you know, it's if you're trying to build a  if you have a publicly traded company and you want to show some sort of a  Consistent user user revenue coming in having the same amount every month from a lot of people  Seems like a like a healthy business to build so that does that make sense?

Transcript:  But you know what I think is interesting and and and just this is just me, you know  Wondering and thinking out loud and I'd be curious to see what you guys think is, you know  When you buy a laptop traditionally you hold on to it for four or five years, right?  When you buy a PC, it's the same thing whether it's a desktop laptop  Whatever you buy a phone you replace it about every two years  Even if it doesn't have that many new features in part because the thing slows down and it doesn't work as well  right, so if we're moving to kind of a mobile centric world anyways  and if you're gonna rob the PC manufacturers essentially of  operating systems as an excuse to buy a new PC  I wonder if there's gonna be some more engineered obsolescence happening and on the PC side for those who still buy them  I wonder if PCs aren't gonna last as long. How do you do you just have wear out? Yeah  I think they're just gonna make them lousier then nobody will buy that company's computers

Yep, because the first  Three were such classics were there three two. There was two  Such classics. I don't think that but anyway  And I think he didn't like  That it was women right if you're gonna remake it at least have guys

He was kind of stoking this subculture in twitter that was saying all these things and that's why he got bumped off  Um, it's not necessarily you don't think it's him  Well, I think it's definitely him  I mean he he knows who his followers are and he's been like the hub of a lot of and I also think he doesn't have

Start time: 4334.26
End time: 4355.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which I thought was an interesting response. It's very it's very hard to know what to do with trolling  Do you ignore it?  A lot of people say just ignore it. Don't give them any energy at all  Yeah, but it's hard when people are tweeting pictures comparing you to a chimpanzee and then you're an african-american  Do you really do you want to ignore that? That is I can't imagine anything  hateful stuff death threats horrible stuff

Start time: 4356.22

Retweeting the bs which just got more and more of those. Believe me. I don't have to imagine. Yeah, you know, it's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm there. Yeah  so, uh  twitter  His response to this is to buy to ban milo  Permanently permanently ban ban them. They have punished him before by taking away his blue check taking away your blue check  Um, but now they ban him now on the one hand, of course because he is using his real name  I mean at nero's not but it's attacked. He knows everybody knows it's him. Yeah, he doesn't hide that  It's him and even says in his bio  They could ban him the trolls they can't they can kill that account, but they just come back  They can't effectively stop and they're literally the abuse you cannot stop the abuse. Yeah, so in some ways  I  Feel like he's being punished for doing the right thing which is abusing her with his real name  It's not his never right to abuse but at least he's using his real name, right?

Start time: 4440.38
End time: 4468.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's using his real name and yeah, he's not hiding behind anything. Sure. You can give him credit for that  Well, I don't want to give him a lot of credit  But the fact the matter is is if you're using like twitter's terms of service say very clearly if you're using it to abuse other  People you might get kicked off the service. Yeah, I like  And you know his argument of he says I am the most fabulous super villain on the internet  I mean he he did he forget about martin's what's her crilly or like his name martin schreli. Yeah, there's another villain

Transcript:  But but but milo loves this he thinks it's fun. He enjoys it. And in fact, there's this this is an article on medium  By lori lori penny called i'm with the band  Uh, she went to milo's party at the republican convention  The the night he was banned and he was thrilled. Yeah, best thing that could ever happen to him  He loved the publicity. So it's not a punishment  Right. It just validates him gives his brand mileage. We're talking about him. I wouldn't have talked about him. Otherwise, he's in all the media  he says  so um

Start time: 4507.28
End time: 4512.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, let's see. Well, he was claiming that's the end of twitter. She says, yeah, she says how does he feel about his suspension?

Start time: 4512.58
End time: 4527.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's fantastic. He says it's the end of the platform. The timing is perfect. I thought I had another six months  But this was always going to happen  And he yeah, he thinks it's the end of twitter. Yeah, which is not shows how overblown his own ego is  You know, it doesn't

Start time: 4530.10
End time: 4582.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, honestly like I think I think it's  in some sense  It's good for twitter to do this because if he is one of those kind of figureheads of like a really terrible  Community that exists on their platform on their service  um, you know take down those those those big folks because those people  Who do use twitter in that capacity to promote themselves and to build a business and to build a reputation as in this case  If you want to call him a journalist or a vlogger, whatever  Um, he can't use that that platform anymore. He can't reach millions of people that way anymore  The other choice is an effective punishment. However, yeah, because the other trolls that were falling around they don't have millions of followers  Point they're just having fun. Exactly. They're just a bunch, you know, so so if you're you know  You can't get rid of trolling altogether, but you can get rid of of the folks who are leading some of this really hateful  Bs, you can't you can't let it go without any punishment without any sort of recourse. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh plenty of people deny it. Are you kidding me? Really?  So oh my god, you should see the I wrote a column about this and you should see the hate mail  I'm getting about this people think it's a violation of free speech rights. These people have a fundamental misunderstanding  Of what free speech is, especially on a private platform like this  Um, oh my god, plenty of people think uh  Don't disagree with this decision for that. Uh, do you just send them the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually link to that in my column too, but I mean it's still these people are so whipped up  They don't they don't pay attention to any of these facts. Yeah, but I mean the real thing  I kind of disagree with nate to a degree  and that's because  We wouldn't even be talking about this had it not been a very famous movie star and snl star  Retweeting all these images reaching and jack dorsey reaching out to her personally this happens every day  I have so many friends who have gotten death threats  Of a really close friend of mine. She runs a feminist website  Um, she's been death threaded and and you name the worst possible things you can think of she's had it tweeted at her  And she's reported these accounts for abuse and has gotten oh, sorry. Nothing can happen back  um, and so  You know, it's nice that they can do this and maybe this can be like this  Galvanizing point that nate was talking about and they can start doing something. But honestly, i'm not  Optimistic they've been talking about their line for the last two years since dickas solo was ceo  Has been oh, we're not doing enough to combat abuse and then they just leave it at that and do absolutely nothing. But  um, I think one move they did make this  This week that could be like a hint of laying the groundwork towards something is allowing anyone to apply for verification  and maybe you can see them getting to a point where  Everyone has their own real identity on twitter  You can still be anonymous if you want to but you're kind of like cornered off in this dark corner of twitter where?  Everyone else gets to see a verified identity and a filtered  You know troll free twitter, which would be great. Um, I think that's one of the  Answers to this problem not the answer but you know approaching the answer. It's an interesting response because of course twitter

Start time: 4725.24
End time: 4790.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is based well, there's a couple of issues here. First of all twitter to keep their stock price up has to continue to grow  So it's right on their interest  To ban users  It's against their financial interest to ban users on the other hand if you're a celebrity and this is where  I think it is a double standard if you're a celebrity and you get attacked you can almost always get your attackers banned  Yeah, because you're a celebrity you're robin williams daughter or you're leslie jones  But I think they have a fundamental issue, which is twitter was created as an anonymous platform  Facebook has issues but nowhere near this degree of issues, right?  Google plus same thing nowhere near this degree of issues. In fact, google plus now lets you use a fake name  And it hasn't descended yet, but it started to there's a lot more spam. There's a lot more ridiculousness on google plus  partly because it's an abandoned platform  um, I the problem I see twitter facing is  They're built around anonymity  I think the verification is an interesting way to kind of slice it so that they can have  Basically two twitters now

Start time: 4790.90
End time: 4813.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but have a dark twitter, yeah, but the verification is as they've explained it so far because I covered this this week  Anyone in the public can apply for it, but they've made it very clear that the the oh you won't all get it  You won't all get it. So you only get it if you're a journalist or something exactly  So you have to be a public figure you have to be a celebrity  You have to be like an influencer online  You have to be a youtube star you have to be some sort of well

Start time: 4813.94
End time: 4828.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I don't want a twitter where and this by the way everybody can do this you can look at your  Notifications feed and say I only want to see verified. Yeah tweets and it's nothing  I don't want a twitter where it's only celebrities talking at me. That's the worst and leslie jones was verified

Start time: 4829.14
End time: 4835.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know she like that didn't protect her at all verification doesn't protect you  So so it's like it's cool. They're opening it up to the public but

Start time: 4836.60
End time: 4839.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would have to take it a step further is what i'm saying. Exactly. Yeah

Start time: 4840.32
End time: 4877.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did do one thing earlier this year where they before if you would report, uh,  Harassment in tweets you'd have to report them one at a time  Which who the hell could do that if you're getting thousands of these a day  Which as steve pointed out, um, not only celebrities get those but a lot of women and people of color and just in general  but uh  Now you can report I think it's up to three at a time  Which is still like insanely low and difficult three people or three three tweets  So you can't even report like an account like this person is hateful. You have to report those specific tweets  Oh, you're reporting tweets now. Yeah interesting. So they've got a long long long ways to go. I they're really torn

Start time: 4877.66
End time: 4884.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could see how torn they are  Uh, and by the way, i'm torn too because twitter is a valuable platform, isn't it? Yeah

They're mostly pretty civil  Yeah, uh people like to most trolls prefer to do it in the darkness, uh under uh,  anonymous names  But as you point out we need some anonymity  Twitter at this point is the last anonymous platform for except for reddit. It's okay  And by the way, guess what rhetoric has similar problems, don't they? Well instagram and if you've looked at like any

Transcript:  Do they have better controls you can you can block some you can block your accounts? Yeah  Yeah, yeah, but they can't if you block them. They can't comment on your exact picture  That's the difference on twitter anybody can use your ad handle even if you've blocked them  As long as they have an account they can at you  But you won't see it you can block it so you don't see it right?  But that's like sticking your head in the sand i'm not seeing all these horrible abusive tweets, how does that help anything everybody else sees them, right?  I think they have a structural issue that it's very difficult to solve because unless they're willing to go to turn their back on anonymity  Which would then break twitter in some ways. It's a unique problem. It's a unique problem  And uh, and uh, uh, I don't know how do you guys have ideas? How would you solve it?

Transcript:  They uh twitter owns periscope the live streaming video platform. I hate saying platform app service, whatever and um,  They actually have a feature that they rolled out not long ago where they have essentially like a small jury  So anytime that that's an interesting approach. Yeah, so let's say i'm hosting a video  You know mark leaves a hateful comment and you see it you can report it and then um  Randomly selected randomly selected three other users will see it and then they can vote as to whether it's abusive or not  And if it's decided as abusive then that person mark in this hypothetical situation would get kicked out for the rest of that  Session session or or you know what it is is they would they would be banned from commenting for like 30 seconds  Like they get a warning and then if it happened again, they get kicked out of that specific session

Start time: 5027.56

Start time: 5031.96
End time: 5082.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I bring it up is I think they're they're you know, this is an issue on periscope  This is an issue on twitter twitter is their main core product and I think they're they might bring some of these ideas over across  If it's successful  Um, but I think I think doing things like that maybe banning people temporarily  You know maybe putting them in a kind of situation where they can't interact with that other user  And like you said if you block someone  Maybe not not allowing them to even use your at handle, you know  I mean the whole point of twitter is that it's kind of a conversation unfolding  Online in front of everybody right and when we have those conversations with with people that follow us or with each other  Everyone can see it essentially unless our accounts are private  Well, if you block someone who's being hateful to you and if they have examples of and proof of that  You know, why not allow that person to not even be able to send you a message publicly using that at handle?  You know, maybe there's well, I can tell you that doesn't fix it

Start time: 5083.02
End time: 5093.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least in my experience because they can still use other people's handles exactly and use your name exactly  And and slime you to other people which is what they want to do

Start time: 5093.14
End time: 5121.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but making this but if so, so why do trolls at this point?  Really like twitter a lot more than they like these other platforms as we brought up and we're talking about  Now this stuff still happens on facebook this stuff still happens on youtube  It seems to be shut down a lot faster. Well youtube's actually right  But so so why does it happen on twitter more because it's a lot easier to do and go unchecked on twitter than anywhere else  Right, so if it's more of a pain in the butt to do and if it's more difficult to do on twitter  They'll go somewhere else you're going to go where it's easier to do

Start time: 5122.30
End time: 5131.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's it's it's why do you make it harder to create new accounts? Maybe have a waiting period?  You're right. There are ways that they could make it. Yeah, they don't seem to get rid of it all together

Start time: 5131.98

Transcript:  I like the idea of a jury of your presumably peers. Maybe if it goes over well on periscope, maybe they'll get it over  Who knows? That's very interesting. But it you know  Whether they're putting enough resources into it or enough attention into it. I think I think all of us would probably say no  But they are doing something and they are trying to figure something out. Are they moving quick enough?  I don't think so, but you know, it's not as if they're ignoring it all together

I mean we were we just heard a bad rumor that turned out not to be true that a celebrity had passed  What's the first thing you do? I check twitter  And you know if somebody's passed that's where you're going to see it and we were able to find out that that was a hoax  Because it wasn't on twitter.

It's worth noting that you know, uh a lot of times things are  Intercepted as data is being transmitted  So it's not just about what's on the servers like all the snowed in nsa links and stuff like that  And in those cases, um, the united states government was working with foreign governments, especially in the uk  To to share some of that data back and forth and so it's like hey you do some snooping for us  We'll do some snooping for you

Transcript:  This is about  What what we get to know about?  As as users, I mean, you know  The the secret agencies are always going to be operating in secret  But this here is is whether or not we have the right to to be told by the companies when the government requests it from them  Which is a little different one than they're intercepting it along the way. And so to me, I view this one slightly different and  You know not everyone would agree  But I think it's important to know just just in the same way that if someone wants to search my apartment  They need a warrant. I get to know who's who's about it  But uh, but yeah, we'll see how this all shows out

Transcript:  Google's transparency report  This is one of the reasons many companies now are doing these transparency reports just to at least let you know  They can't tell you personally that you're being investigated  But at least yet, you know that there are these investigations going on government requests for user data  According to google hit an all-time high in the second half  of 2015  These are governments not just the u.s. Government governments around the world  40,000 677  Requests for data google in many cases fights them as as much as they can that's up 18  From the half year pre prior to that  So, you know, they're asking most of the requests did come from the u.s  12,523 requests  And by the way that impacts 27,000 users or accounts  Because many of these requests have multiple users multiple accounts  So it's we're going in that direction  um  You know one of the one of the ways i'm responding to that is more and more i'm  Investigating ways of keeping my data off the public internet, but using my own private server  I think for email I think for i'm looking at replacing the entire google cloud.

It'll be on my server in my house  And that's what we're going to use for and sandstorm allows you to use  Uh ad apps there are a lot of apps  Uh, i'm gonna replace evernote for instance have a have a evernote like  Notebook app that is web accessible from any device including my mobile phones  But encrypted traffic and encrypted storage  Where are you uh backing up?  Uh, that's a good question. I haven't decided about that clearly backup is going to be important  You can do an encrypted backup. So if you do an encrypted backup  You know you I could store it somewhere like dropbox that the government had access to it  But at least they all they would have access to is  The encrypted files my encrypted files. Yeah, so I you know, I have to i'm installing this this later this week  Uh, it's it's it's as much of an experiment as anything else. Can I replace?  Uh commercial clouds with a private cloud. Yeah, it looks like I can and they have email servers. It's all plug and play  Uh, they have dropbox style file servers  Um, it's really an interesting open source project called sandstorm sandstorm dot i'm excited easy to set up  Very easy. You need a linux server  They have a setup script and you're pretty much done  I'm gonna uh, you you can use them for dine dns because most people don't have a static address  In their house, so it may float around  I actually have comcast business class service. So I have a static address  You can also use them and their certificates to do https. Although i'm going to buy  By the way, not a not a small cost. It's several hundred bucks a year a wild you need a wild card  SSL cert  For your site, but I think you know again, it's an experiment  But it'll be I think an interesting experiment. They have a lot of apps apps are easily ported  to it and um  Word processing spreadsheets drawing  Uh, like I said evernote  You they've got some games crm  Uh, you could do a lot of stuff there. You could have your self-hosted gith or mercurial repositories  wikis websites  Quite quite a complete thing. I think it's very very intriguing

Start time: 7829.60
End time: 7862.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  are  Doing this wholly based on the expectation of this game generating a lot of money  But it's a very recent thing like a year ago that nintendo said we're going to finally do mobile and and have smartphone games  And I think this is like the first indication that nintendo's intellectual property is extremely valuable  And will translate to mobile and so I think they're I think investors to some extent are betting on you know  When they do this for mario and zelda and some of their other properties that it could have  a similar effect

Start time: 7863.00
End time: 7875.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 7875.70
End time: 7889.24

I completely understand people's uh concern about that  Well if they had access but most of the things that are interesting and new about the internet are going to involve  some  In some degree you giving up some information. Yeah, whether it's the internet of things  Uh, siri or cortana or a google now  um  You're gonna have to give  Some companies some information that's why apple is so challenged to figure out how they can compete with google  And microsoft and other companies because they say we're going to protect your privacy  But that means they can't do google now, right?
