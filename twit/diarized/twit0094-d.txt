Transcript:  This is TWIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, episode 95 for April 16, 2007.  Tastes like chicken.  It's time for This Week in Tech and we're assembling a panel of opposing forces.  It's going to be interesting.  In one corner on the left we've got CNET in the face and shape of Mr. Tom Merritt of  Buzz Out Loud.  Hey Tom.  Hey, how's it going Leo?  Thanks for having me on.  Always good to have you on.  I love doing it.  I'm in return.  I'll do Buzz Out Loud on Monday.  It's a deal.  And also from CNET, a guy who's not been on TWIT before but is a revered name in broadcast  news.  He's a famous news director at KPIX in Channel 5 in San Francisco.  Then he was our news director at Tech TV.  And now, what do you do Harry Fuller at CNET?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good question what I do.  I worry about the front door and video and all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're an executive editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I edit all the executive stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's got to.  Somebody's got to watch them.  It's great to have you Harry.  Thank you for joining us.  Get closer to the mic because we want to hear every bit of your pearls of wisdom.  You got it.  I'm going to try to get any closer to Mr. Patrick Norton.  He's always right up on top of the mic.  Mr. Patrick Norton from DL.TV.  I turned my volume down.  He's in the Ziff Davis corner.  We've got two over there.  Also, the cranky geek himself, John C. Dvorak.  Dot org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dot org slash blog.  You know, it has a ring to it, a cadence.  And somebody's got a bicycle bell it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has a ring to it you said.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.  John's always want to be a shock chock.  I hear there's an opening now at CBS.  Yeah, I heard that too.  Dymus used to, every time he did the time checks when he worked at WNBC, would play  the duck quack.  He'd say 653 on WNBC.  I'm going to miss him.  You got his voice.  You can take that job.  I grew up, well, not grew up, but I used to in college, I would get up early just to  listen to Don Imus on WNBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just can't believe it.  Dr. Reverend Billy Saul Hargis of the First Church of the Gooey Death and Discount House  of Worship has fallen so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he do that?  I don't think he's been doing Billy Saul or any of those characters.  No, but I mean when I was.  No, not in this administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but when I was listening, when I was living in North Jersey and he was all over the morning  show that was a huge part of it.  Nuking people.  It was fun.  Great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think Imus will find a job right away?  It's not a tech story, but I'm just curious.  He'd go right to the satellite place.  That's what I figured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  50-50 chance they won't touch him because they've got to get through Washington, D.C.  politically correct.  They want their merger and they're not going to infuriate any of the politically correct  people in Washington right now.  Politically correct?  You mean incredibly uptight.  Well, however you want to translate, I think Imus is radioactive until after the merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, well that's fine, but he's still going to end up there and besides, it's not that  he needs the money.  He could be picked up by one of the earthbound stations.  I don't see why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He should just start podcasting.  How about New York?  He may do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  He's going to be a bunch of people.  Advertisers won't touch him with a stick and the Brucker's basketball team has accepted  his apology but not forgiven him yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a nasty thing to say.  It wouldn't go online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't anything worse than something Andrew Dice Clay would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Andrew Dice Clay isn't on radio.  There is a tech angle to this because it was the Media Watch blog that picked it up.  Ruckus' statement was at 6.15 in the morning.  Nobody really heard it.  There was no Ruckus raised except by Media Watch.  They immediately sent out email blasts to newspapers and news editors and blogged it  and I think it was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree.  He was targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a lot of blog sites posted video once they finally got onto it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it the worst thing he's ever said?  I really don't listen to the guy ever.  Seems unlikely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't remember him saying anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The basketball team just comes out of an NCAA match and he says something that's obnoxious.  It was a crummy thing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure he said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About a year ago, in fact almost exactly a year ago, when the female reporter that worked  for the Christian Science Monitor had gotten released by whoever's holding her hostage  in the Middle East, he basically accused her of sleeping with her captives.  That's pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the idea that that's what he built his career on, saying stuff like that to get people  all riled up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Used to call David Borman pant load.  I thought that was...  Remember Borman?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was the NBC vice president or executive producer who put Imus on MSNBC.  I'm sure he's long gone.  In fact, he went to CNN.  So he's long gone from there.  Alright, big story of course.  It's a story we missed with our Mac show by one day.  We seem to be doing that a lot with the Mac show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mac's always a day late and a dollar short.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple, and I'm very curious what you guys think of this.  Apple goes to the PR Newswire releases a story, very simple story.  Maybe I'll read the actual Apple copy because they've been accused by Herb Greenberg and  others now of spinning the story.  Basically saying we've been working so hard on the iPhone.  And, boy, by the way, incidentally, the iPhone has passed several of its tests so far and  we are still on track for a June release.  Late June.  Late June.  Yeah, yeah, that's not the June 11th that everybody's been saying.  We've been working so hard on the iPhone that, oh golly, we just don't have the resources  to work on Leopard and we're going to have to delay that for three months till October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, which of course assumes that the same people that would work on a phone, a mobile  phone, would be the exact same people working on Leopard.  What would they do?  Pull those guys off a Leopard?  Of course not.  Of course they would be on iPhones running Leopard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the phone is running OS X.  Didn't you remember?  Steve Jobs says the iPhone is running OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think despite Apple's positive, you know, Pollyanna spin that they put on this press  release, there's almost no way not to interpret this negatively.  Either they're such a small company that they've only got ten people working for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've so misallocated our resources or, conversely, we've so realized we make so little money  off of the operating system, we've decided to completely throw in in the consumer electronics  direction.  Well, that's what Macworld says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Macworld says the iPhone is in a distraction.  It's the point.  Who cares about the OS, says Macworld magazine.  I do.  I do too.  I care more about the OS than the iPhone.  Wait a minute, Macworld magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of all people, said that.  Of all people?  Yeah, that's kind of a surprise.  I didn't know that.  That is weird.  This is Peter Cohen.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What percentage of Apple's revenue comes from the iPod and iTunes now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, but Macworld magazine is supposed to be about the Macintosh, not about Apple,  not a company who cares about the company's bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because they're Macworld and they're an enthusiastic publication doesn't mean they  can't have a strong sense of reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I got another sense of reality for you.  I think the problem with Apple, if they're having problems with their operating system,  is the fact that Steve Jobs runs a feudal system and nobody can do anything on the plantation  without his permission.  And he's only got so many hours a day and he's running two corporations and he's on the board  of ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is not that there's only ten employees.  The problem is there's only one Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  There's one decision maker and I'll bet he has to sign off on anything bigger than a  paperclip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or other negative possibilities.  Leopard is in such trouble, they were going to slip it anyway.  And I've heard a lot of people kind of behind the scenes saying, Leopard not looking so  good.  It crashed at Macworld Expo.  I remember when they were demoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we saying spotty performance from Leopard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about this for a more obscure idea?  Although in reality, I agree with Harry.  But how about this for an idea?  Leopard was having nothing but problems to the point where they dreamed up the whole  iPhone scam just to distract people from Leopard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I smell a column.  And they will never release the phone.  I smell a column.  You know, here's the other negative scenario.  A phony phone.  I like that.  That's better than Leopard's spots.  Here's Herb Greenberg's scenario for MarketWatch.  He says the iPhone is in trouble.  He says, notice they say, we've passed some of our tests, but not all of our tests.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're trying.  That 22 minutes of battery life is really killing us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and he says, and I think this is credible, they pre-announced the iPhone prematurely  to cover up poor iPod sales.  They fooled the stock market, obviously.  Apple stock's been on a tear.  And now they're in a little bit of trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think it's time for them to rip up OS X and start over again?  If they're really having trouble with Leopard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think the core of OS X is solid.  I think maybe Leopard was more ambitious than it ought to be.  But OS X as it stands now is a very solid operating system.  It certainly competes well with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, while we're dealing with conspiracy theories, the fact that their house organ,  which is really the Wall Street Journal and not Macworld,  hasn't said anything positive about iPhone in a while makes you very suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.  You're talking about Malt Wasper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the one. That's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I noticed Walt wrote an article,  his most recent tech column is about how to get all the crap off of PCs.  And he manages to sneak the Mac in there anyway and say,  but this isn't a problem on Apple's software.  Interesting. Boy, talk about house organ.  So what do we say? Is this a, what's the vote? Bad news for Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They always get through this stuff. I'm not worried about it.  I'm still thinking that the real problem is the fact that they want to get into the phone industry  in the first place, which is my argument. I think it's just a bad business to be in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what about the Mac faithful?  I mean, doesn't this really say we aren't a computer company anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? That's what they're trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think maybe they shouldn't be.  I think that's a scary thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with John on that. I think, yeah,  I think they've realized that they can only go so far with the computer side of things  and they can make a lot of money on devices.  I don't know if the iPhone's going to be the next iPod for them though.  That's the big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're up against some big players in Samsung and Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just bought a Nokia N95.  Motorola and Nokia, the big two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, one thing that's one little bit of FUD out there is my wife's trying to find a phone to go with her Mac  and everything she reads says, well, you can get the trio, but it's not great.  Really the best one for it's going to be the iPhone.  And just counting every other phone if you already have a Mac,  which that totally plays into that Apple way of thinking, which is,  you know, the only good things that really work with our products are our products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not true. I have to say Blackberry works fine.  My Nokia syncs fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can pick up the missing sync, which will actually sync most of the major phones with OS X applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've heard some people complaining that even the trio syncing doesn't work that well with the Mac, that others work better.  Well, no, that's just syncing is always a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Syncing is a horrible thing.  But there are ways to, I mean, does your, does Active Sync or whatever they call it now in Vista work with Windows Mobile 5?  Not very well.  Uh huh.  Syncing is always a problem.  Sync stinks.  Bill Gates heading into space, a Russian cosmonaut said.  Yeah, no way.  No way. He says that Charles Simonia, he's up there with them right now.  The current space tourist, Simonia is a Microsoft program, was a Microsoft programmer.  Cosmonaut.  I've vloged it.  Wait a minute, give me a chance.  I got to do the accent.  Oh yeah, well, I'm sorry.  Really, John, I'm shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because my timing's off today.  Fyodor, your chichkin says, Charles says to Bill Gates also preparing to visit space.  So next time someone will be with Bill Gates, for me, this is biggest surprise of flight.  Russians could say the letter V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why, what is that?  You know, you do those accents so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the main, the two best ones, your Indian one isn't any good by the way, but your Russian and your German.  And the Russian accent, I don't think is that easy to do because I've been trying to do it.  I know people that have that accent and I can't copy it.  Apparently.  You're going to have to teach it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Очень хорошо.  Apparently Gates visited Star City just a couple of months ago, the cosmonaut training center.  To buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually to sell Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no way, I blog this by the way, you can check it out, dvorak.org slash blog.  But anyway, I wrote that I don't believe there's any chance in tarnation, as it were, that Gates would ever do this.  It's not his style.  It's not his style to waste money like that.  He's kind of a, you know, he's a guy who doesn't like to be that way.  He doesn't like limos.  He doesn't...  Hey, you know what?  I think it's going to...  He doesn't have a yacht.  He doesn't use to fly coach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, John, John, this is the best midlife crisis ever.  Forget the sports car.  Forget the bogus 482 foot yacht.  He's basically just looking at all these schmucks with a billion dollars that are peeing away their money and just going, you know what?  A quick $20 million trip to the space.  I'm good.  The Russian rockets are red.  It's perfect.  I'm going to buy a chunk of a, you know, launch company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will he board a trustees?  Will the stockholders let him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the other question I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He won't go until he steps down from the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's his retirement.  The stockholders cannot let a guy like Bill Gates, who is Microsoft, do this kind of a joyride.  It's just too...  I mean, I think that if he did the stats on it, it's probably a risky trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think with $30 billion in the bank, he can figure out a way to, you know, absolve himself of fiduciary responsibility to the stockholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's that.  They'll just tie him down.  Who cares?  Why is everybody so interested in, or so positive about these guys throwing away money like this on these ridiculous trips, which are meaningless?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think it's better than some of the other ridiculous.  I mean, first of all, if you got the money, you know, it's your right to spend it, you know?  But the thing about this way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no social responsibility anymore in the United States or anyplace else, apparently, listening to you.  And Leo, by the way, exactly has your opinion, so you should think about that for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a... first of all, I haven't finished what I was saying.  You know, Gates has given away more money than anybody else in the history of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Gates basically, if anybody deserves a quick 20 million shot into space, it's Gates.  Look at the amount of money he's giving.  He's basically stamping out entire forms of disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What diseases has he stamped out?  Oh, gosh.  Give me a moment and I'll get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Space fever, for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He hasn't stamped anything out, but he's planning to stamp out AIDS in Africa.  Yeah, you think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, at least he's trying to...  Compared... yeah, I mean, John, yeah, you know, people waste money constantly around the world, you know, ridiculous young people.  Ridiculous yachts, pathetic homes, you know, stupid efforts.  But, you know, if Gates wants to go to the moon, I mean, considering what he's trying to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was he going to the moon or is he going to the International Space Station or is he just going into orbit?  I was just getting...  Well, you know, they say these people are going into space and half the time they're just going up on a suborbital flight and getting weightless and coming down.  And that's not going into space.  Now, Somonia is still up there, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they're going to the space station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, they're going to the space station.  That's...  For 20 million...  I said moon by accident, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A million, you should at least get to stay in a three by four cubicle and pee into a bag for a couple of weeks.  I think that's only fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's only fair.  There's something funny about that part.  He powdered Neapolitan ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and $25 million and be, you know, crapping in your own pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you... honest question, do you think he'd pass the medical to get up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gates?  Yeah.  Somonia can, I imagine Bill can.  I think he has low blood pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Somonia's a little more athletic.  You know, Bill's not, you know, in... I mean, golf's a lot.  He can jump over a chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the test?  And he's certainly saner than the astronaut lady who tried to shoot her boyfriend.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he's got the diapers to prove it.  Can you... can he still jump?  Remember that he used to do that, Patrick?  He would jump... it was his trick.  He would jump over a chair from a standing start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wonder if he can still do that.  I mean, I'll put it this way.  If Gates needs to get healthy to go have this place...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to call up Crisp Carmichael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carmichael's going to recommend, you know, he's going to buy a training team, you know,  and he'll be the fittest bazillionaire on the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What just always hits me when you hear about these people buying their way into space is  you have to be in pretty good medical condition to go up there.  It's not like you just need to have the money.  I mean, that's no easy thing to do.  That's pretty hard on you.  Pull a G sucks.  Yeah.  You know, you've been up in one of those blue angels, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He passed out.  We got video to prove it.  Well, I don't think it's going to happen.  That's it.  I'll put money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul Graham, the man who began the fad for Bayesian filters and the spam, he's really  I think a very bright guy, says, Microsoft's dead.  He now works for Yahoo, by the way.  Well, now Bill doesn't have to worry about it.  Doesn't have to worry.  A few days ago, says Paul, I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.  It happens when he happened when he was talking to a young start kicking the corpse.  He is.  And he has four reasons why Microsoft's dead.  You want to hear him?  Sure.  What killed Microsoft?  Number one, Google.  There can only be one big man in town there.  Clearly, Google is the most dangerous company now by far.  Both the good and bad senses of the word.  Microsoft can at best limp along afterwards.  Number two.  Sound like Paul Harvey there.  Do it as Paul Harvey.  Paul Harvey.  Page two.  Page two.  Page two.  Hello, American.  Stand by for.  Number two, Ajax, of all things, which ironically is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We all laugh at that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's.  He means the cleanser.  Yeah.  Mr. Clean.  No, what he's saying is that web services have become so good that desktop applications  don't make sense anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate that statement.  We're going to do everything on the web because everybody's always connected all the time.  Hello.  Oh, it's the bell again.  Stupid.  Like it's like the whole web 2.0 is coming next week.  It'll be here.  We're sending.  We're sending Roger with a camera to just just go off on it.  Lock them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using Google spreadsheet for work for some things, and it's really limited still.  I mean, you can make it work, but it does not do the things that you can do in Excel  or even open office.  So they are not ready to move everything on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  That thing.  We're 20 years away from what that.  And your six hour flight on New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you going to do?  Play games on your laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they got one.  Number three.  You could probably download most of the stuff, including like a.  Well, and you're going to have broadband on planes anyway.  I was playing with Ajax, some Ajax thing the other day, and I was.  But you know, people get too carried away with this.  So I had a drop down and then a slide over.  And then if you drop down and you didn't move the mouse fast enough, it popped back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Websites are like those old magician tricks now with the boxes that slide and doors open.  It's ridiculous.  It's crappy.  Yeah.  Third cause, broadband Internet.  Anyone who cares can have fast Internet access now, by the way, even on airplanes.  That's coming any minute now.  And what are you laughing at?  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like that, that, that power jack in every seat.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, you know, they mentioned we mentioned that story about the broadband on airplanes.  I buzz out loud and everybody wrote in from Europe saying, yeah, we had that a Lufthansa.  I used it and then they took it away because they couldn't make any money on it.  Yeah.  So enjoy it while you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Last nail in the coffin.  Apple.  Thanks to OS 10, Apple came back from the dead in a way that's extremely rare in technology.  Their victory is so complete, says Paul Graham.  I'm now surprised when I come across a computer running Windows.  Oh, that's real.  That's that's the biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple came back from the dead because of the iPod.  Well, OK, the Mac first, the iMac, but the iPod's what's made them a relatively.  Yeah, that's what made the stock rocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, I'm glad Microsoft is dead.  They were like Nero or Komodus, evil in the only in the way only inherited power can make you.  Remember Microsoft Monopoly didn't begin with Microsoft.  They got it from IBM.  So I suspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so IBM, by all this logic, is dead as well.  I guess Microsoft asking for work, they told him to shove it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then so now he went to Yahoo and gave this remark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, makes sense.  Here's how he suggests Microsoft could revive itself.  Are you interested?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would just suggest one thing at five years from now, Microsoft will be worth a hell of a lot more than Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only technical death.  It's not biological death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Resurrection is possible if Microsoft buys all the good Web 2.0 startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wait for John.  Let's have a piece of one of them.  Probably a piece of all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He runs Y Combinator or Combinator, however you pronounce that.  Y Combinator is the Yahoo startup incubator.  He says they could get substantially all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.  Just buy everybody.  Number two, put them all in the building in Silicon Valley surrounded by lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.  I think we'd all agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because Redmond's really hasn't been making money for years.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know if they can squash creativity pretty quick, I guess.  I'm not arguing that, but I'm just like, you know, with all due respect, most of the most of the websites are still looking around to be bought.  That's the business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's not much else you can do.  I mean, with Sarbanes-Oxley, which is a destructive force that needs to be repealed, there's not much else these companies can do.  This is Got to End, the Sarbanes-Oxley thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Got to End, Tim O'Reilly says, uncivility on the Internet, it has to end.  Shut up, Tim.  F you, Tim.  He's so full of it.  This all began, of course, with Kathy Sierra.  He should talk to Don Imus.  Who was civility here.  Civility? I got you civility right here.  That's a good point.  Action Cooper wrote over that.  Kathy Sierra is the blogger who was threatened with pretty nasty death threats and pictures.  She decided to skip O'Reilly's eTech conference in fear for her life.  And this is kind of prompted.  You've seen mainstream media stories all over in every venue on what's wrong.  Why are people so rude online?  And O'Reilly wants to solve it with this blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we talked about this the other day.  And I concluded that they're not as rude as they used to be.  I think things have really mellowed out compared to...  If you go back to the 80s when you were on one of the news groups or doing anything online,  the kind of unbelievable flaming that went on was nothing.  I mean, it was just way beyond.  It was magnitudes worse than it is today.  I'll tell you where all the flaming is going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People flaming Tim O'Reilly for this idea.  Maybe he's trying to stir it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the idea isn't such a bad idea.  A code of ethics for bloggers is fine.  I mean, it doesn't carry any legal weight or anything like that.  It doesn't carry any weight.  It reminds me of what they did with the code.  They did a code of ethics for journalism back in what, the 50s or late 40s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The code of ethics for journalism has been co-opted by the New York Times  for the sole purpose of promoting the New York Times.  I can go, I could give you a, don't get me started on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when it came out, it was a good thing at the time, don't you think, John?  This isn't exactly ethics, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is more like, this is a, yeah, I mean, this is, we're going to be,  These are manners, right?  Yeah, it's manner.  Here, I'll read you a little bit of the first draft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a difference between ethics and manners.  Rule number one, don't threaten to kill people because you disagree with their opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We celebrate the blogosphere because it embraces, Frank, an open conversation.  We celebrate.  This is very, I think, unicorn here.  It's totally unicorn.  But Frank, this does not have to mean lack of civility.  We present this blogger code of conduct.  Code of conduct.  Code of conduct.  I see the dolphins already.  In the hopes that it creates a culture that encourages both personal expression  and constructive conversation.  We sang the blogger electric.  Yeah, well, I tried to use the word blogosphere the other day,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and a friend corrected me, and I think he's right.  It's bloggistan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, according to this.  You step out that building, they'll blow you up.  Number one, we take responsibility for our own words and the comments we allow on our blog.  I think that's fine.  I don't know.  A lot of bloggers would not like to be held responsible for what other people say in the comments.  Yeah.  You're not held responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should take responsibility for moderating the comments.  Best you can.  Yeah, we moderate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As best you can, but you can't.  I mean, this stuff is very difficult to root out.  Number two, we won't say anything online we wouldn't say in person.  Yeah.  Number three, good luck with that.  We connect privately before we respond publicly.  I think that's not such a bad idea.  No, that's good policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree.  Well, it depends on whether you're trying to make a show or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I called George Bush before I published that blog post the other day.  Did you? What did he say?  Knock on debt.  Let's see, when we believe someone is unfairly attacking another, we take action.  That's a little scary.  A little bit mob mentality.  The blogger code of conduct has a little sheriff's badge where it says,  This is the badge he's proposing.  It's a little sheriff's badge that says,  Civility enforced.  And then there's a little firecracker where it says,  Anything goes for blogs that don't want to do this.  We do not allow anonymous comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything goes.  Anything goes.  How can you not allow anonymous comments when people can fake an anonymous comment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a great idea, and I actually do that on most of my blogs.  I don't allow anonymous comments just to keep the spam down,  but I don't think that's something you should force people to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he says,  You know, the person Joe Smith, who says he works for Boeing,  and he's got an address at Hotmail, and he says he's Joe Smith at Boeing,  he's not an anonymous commenter, but in fact he is an anonymous commenter.  How do you stop that kind of anonymous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't. You always get an IP address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, because it's Gmail.  How can people spoof that? Of course.  We require commentators to supply a valid email address before they can post,  though we allow commentators to identify themselves with an alias rather than a real name.  Well, I could tell you I get spam all the time.  Now, spammers will sign up with a real email address.  They'll get authenticated, and then they'll still fill you with spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, it's a nice speed bump, but it's not really going to stop anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't slow them down.  Number six, we ignore the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just good policy. Sure. Don't feed the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We ignore the trolls. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like from Atlantis. It's horny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how do you solve the fundamental issue, whether it's an email or whether it's anonymous blog postings,  of somebody receiving serious harassment?  They harassed Cassie Sierra. There's no question about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to FBI if you've got something like that going on, if it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, she in fact says she pursued it with real effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you have to do that.  In the real world of celebrities offline, people who actually walk around in flesh and blood, they have to hire security guards.  If you're a TV anchor or a star in sports or Hollywood, you've got to have security.  That's just the way it is.  If you're ex-sh-  Not good, but you've got to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to have security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is a fine idea because it focuses the debate and gets people talking about it.  And some people who are just getting into blogging, who really don't understand what they're getting themselves into,  can look at this and find out, oh, these things could happen.  OK, now I know some basic, like, don't feed the trolls sort of stuff.  But I don't think it's really going to change anything.  I think the fundamental thing is that people have to learn, as we pointed out, and we have on the Internet over the years,  how to deal with this sort of anonymous community.  Because when you have that anonymity, even if you're logged in with your email address,  you have that feeling of an anonymity that you can say anything.  And I don't know how many times people have emailed me these horrible, flaming, hate-filled emails.  All I do is write them back and say, oh, I'm sorry I upset you.  Here's why I said that.  They write back, apologize.  Yeah.  Because they realize, oh, you're a real person on the other end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  I have that same experience.  I get these guys, not always, but because some of them just don't like you.  But you get these crazy comments from somebody who say, well, wait a minute.  I didn't even, you know, I think you took it the wrong way because I meant to say this.  And then the guy's like, you know, he's like a lion.  And the second email you get from him, he's a pussycat.  Usually.  Oh, thanks.  Well, thanks.  And the first thing, they fall all over themselves thanking you for responding.  Yeah.  I responded like 99, unlike Leo, I responded like 99% of my email.  And so people are always shocked by that because I think they expect to send me some nasty note.  And I'm not going to read it or it's going to be read by some secretary, which I don't have.  And, you know, I just read it myself.  I've got nothing else.  I really don't have much of a life.  I just sit and read email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to train those chickens to read it.  I think it is a good idea.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a good idea to raise the conversation, at least say we care a little bit about this.  There's obviously nothing you're going to be able to do about it, but it's good to say you care.  Webby Award nominations are out.  Did anybody, has anybody read them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does anybody care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are over a hundred nominees.  There are so many categories.  It looks like a phone book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope they all win twice.  Wow. It must be the phone book in Greenville, Illinois then.  It's well, it's small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were very aggressive this year because I got solicited to enter the dvorak.org slash blog uncensored website.  And I told them I wasn't interested.  This thing is not an award winner.  You know, and to be honest about it, because I've been a judge and enough competitions to know what's a winner in terms of winning something like that and what's not.  And I wasn't about, well, go ahead and try anyway, she says.  You know, maybe you never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an honor just to be nominated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an honor just to enter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, of course, it's a fee.  It's a fee based competition.  And then you come to the dinner.  That's a deal.  Yeah.  And then, you know, I mean, that's why, you know, there's so many people.  I mean, wine competitions are the same way.  All these wine competitions that are all over the place are all with rare exceptions.  There's a couple that aren't, but most of them are fee based.  So you pay a hundred bucks and you have to enter two K.  You have to bring in two cases of the wine you've entered.  And I've talked to some PR people in the wine industry about this.  Hey, it's an investment of 200 bucks or an investment of 100 bucks in a couple of cases of wine.  You win, you win, you lose, you lose.  What there is to make is if you win, it is worth way more than a hundred dollars in publicity.  And so that's kind of the thinking with these competitions.  I'm not just like lists as everyone listens to me complain, you know, those that I complain about lists.  I this is the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to hear the categories?  Actually, we don't have time.  It's only a four hour podcast.  But I mean, it's it is every part, every, you know, activism, art associations, automotive, banking, beauty, best copy, best home, best navigation, best practices, best use of animation, best use of video, best visual design, best blog.  I mean, that's just best use of Ajax, please.  Did you, are you on the list, Leo?  Is there a what?  The tweet, the tweet website?  There are there's one podcast category.  The nominated podcasts are The Guardian Unlimited, NPR, Scientific American, Spout and the Onion, all of which I don't know, Spout, but all the rest about a film podcast I hadn't heard of until they just read the nominations.  I'd agree with the rest of them.  I mean, is the award still pretty San Francisco centric?  No, this is in New York now.  It's in New York.  Yeah, they moved it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they have a category for best awards show?  Webby's not withstanding.  I would like to make mention of the fact that in this month's In-Flight magazine for Southwest Airlines, they had the listing of the top 10 podcasts of in various categories.  And guess who is on tech?  The number one tech podcast, according to this magazine, which is a pretty substantial publication, was guess what?  Twitter.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd have given it to Buzz Out Loud.  Oh, shucks.  You're making me turn red over here.  Actually, it's not you, it's the girls.  Oh, yeah, I know.  That's why I'm turning red.  Angry.  You're just there to keep them apart.  I'm token.  So yeah, right.  When is Molly coming back, by the way?  So what can you say?  When is Molly coming back, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Molly, I just saw her actually the other day.  She's doing very well.  If anybody doesn't know, Molly Wood is one of the co-hosts of Buzz Out Loud who just had a baby about a month ago.  And she will be back to work for good in June.  Around the time the iPhone comes out, she'll come back.  And then she's going to try to start calling in for the podcast before then when she gets time.  So she had a boy or girl?  She had a boy.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's already got his order in for an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like the other million people.  Yes, like the millions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My 15-year-old daughter has ordered me to give her an iPhone.  It's kind of like getting an order in.  Let's see, what else is going on?  Nielsen says they're going to follow TV viewers out of the house and into the streets.  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ratings for TV viewing in bars, hotels, gyms, offices.  Dorms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They added dorms earlier this year.  And it revolutionized cable ratings.  Does it change the numbers?  Oh, is that right?  Harry, tell us about that.  Hugely, hugely.  Because people in dorms watch completely different things than old retired people in trailer parks.  And all kinds of the younger demo cable networks now are raising their rates and realizing they actually have an audience.  Too bad they did that after TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, after TV.  We were all dorms.  We were the dorm channel, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people don't realize that the dorms were not rated for years and years.  I didn't know that until now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They never rated anything. Bars, hotels, nothing but houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read there's a couple of really good websites that break down advertising splits and break down the whole Nielsen rating system.  And it's some of the most depressing reading you'll ever do when you realize it's exactly how restricted and how controlled those are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder when they're going to start monitoring showers.  Shower televisions?  A Geek Squad repair member is being accused of videotaping one of his clients while she was in the shower.  Best Buy is being sued because apparently the Geek Squad guy came in.  He started work on the computer, then asked to use the bathroom.  Later, the lady of the house showered in the same bathroom.  When she stepped out of the stall, she noticed a cell phone propped up on the sink.  When she returned, the phone was gone.  She removed the memory chip.  She found a lighter, removed the memory chip, took it to the Verizon store where they watched the guy set up the camera and then leave the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did he know she was going to take a shower?  Knit wit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe he told her she stinks and she took the hint.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just be careful next time you invite the Geek Squad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, how is she going to sue him if she stole his memory card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point. That's vigilante justice right there.  That's good.  Yeah.  He may get off on a technicality.  A British man has met a 22-year-old woman after he says, dreaming of her phone number and then sending her a text message.  David Brown, 24, woke up one morning after a night out with friends.  He had a telephone number running through his head.  He decided to send her a text message saying, did I meet you last night?  The random recipient, Michelle Kitson, was wary and confused at first, but decided to reply.  They began exchanging messages and fell in love and now they're getting married.  Best pick-up line I've ever heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He found her on the internet somehow.  He found her MySpace page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I dreamt of you.  Yeah.  Anybody believe that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a bridge, I'll sell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I fell asleep next to the phone book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And your name was in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Samsung says they're going to make a combo HD DVD Blu-ray player like LG is making.  It has a lot of potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because it'll have the full interactive Blu-ray player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, the joke of this is that Samsung was the first one to announce that they were going to do this way back when.  If you remember, Twit number three or whatever.  And then they bailed out.  Now they're playing catch-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they were bailed out so much as Sony told them they weren't going to do it.  No, I think that's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Samsung's got a lot of marketing problems.  Samsung's lost one of its main marketing guy, Peter Weedfold, about a year or a year and a half ago, who went to Circuit City.  And then they lost their other top marketing guy who went to Westinghouse to do the LCDs there.  And I think it's a rudderless ship.  And people inside, kind of in and around the company tell me that what happened was just a political thing.  And the company's really got some issues, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be good news for consumers, though.  With two of these, prices have to drop.  LG's charging $1,200 for its dual player.  And the Samsung one's supposed to have full functionality, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Blu-ray interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's two things.  One, it's actually streeting for a lot closer to $850 if you shop around carefully.  Two, it actually does a pretty good job.  If you can give up not having menus, it does a pretty good job with HD content.  But with the lower price on HD and Blu-ray players, or an HD plus a PS3,  PS3 is a fantastic Blu-ray disc player.  There's just not much point right now for the LG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could get an Xbox and a PlayStation 3 almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Heron just did a great roundup for PC Magazine of all the second generation players.  And now he's actually putting together a third one for all the third generation players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Toshiba's now down to $300 for the second generation.  Is that a decent...does he like that one?  Yeah, it's a pretty good price.  $300 is...now you're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has anybody modded the PS3 to accept the Xbox 360 external HD DVD drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's going to be problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so much is in software, don't you think that that would be a tough thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, probably, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd have to create an application that could play the HD content on the PS3.  And I don't think anybody's...I think we're a long way from it.  Because it's pretty easy to take that HD drive and buy third party software,  some of which is better than others, to play the HD content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of which, we've seen the first key revocation now on WinDVD.  That was the software most people believed was being used to crack the AACS Hi-Def disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it ends up being a moot point because they've got a workaround already.  Already? Yeah.  That's what I've been told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one of the reasons I think it's important is there was some speculation,  oh, they'll never do a key revocation. You don't have to worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think about it this way. They'll probably never do a hardware key revocation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they may not need to.  I mean, it's much more likely that you'd be using software to do this copying, right?  Right.  So, I mean, how are you going to use a hardware DVD player anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a workaround.  You could get the digital out of it somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you could use...  Let's be whang loose on it, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, true.  Bunny can break anything.  So let's get to talk about Karl T. Rove.  Here you go, Harry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those emails are not lost. They're just sitting in servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four years worth of email from White House Senior Advisor Karl Rove to the Republican National Committee disappeared.  It's being sought as part of the investigation into the Bush administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it may have gone to hundreds of different people.  It was just on the National Committee's servers and using their email system.  We don't know who they went to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was the email system? What was their back end? Does anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but I'm told that almost everybody in Washington uses Microsoft Outlook and Exchange.  And so it's probably pretty standard stuff.  It was the ISP.  Is that whatever you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it seems to me if you're going to do kind of a surreptitious outside the purview kind of email system to keep people from snooping,  which is what they were trying to do, or trying to keep your back channel is what it was,  that you would use something nonstandard that was even proprietary when you weren't backing anything up ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're giving them a great deal of credit for being a lot more sophisticated than they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fact that they use the email in the first place.  They should have asked me.  Senator Leahy of Vermont, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said,  You can't erase emails, not today.  This is on the Senate floor. He says they've gone through too many servers.  You know, he sounded pretty good. Leahy has always been pretty good on tech issues.  He says those emails are there. They just don't want to produce them.  It's like the infamous 18 minute gap in the Nixon White House tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually, the Republican National Committee, to their credit, has admitted that they've now got forensic software going in looking for this stuff.  Because what Carl Rove and his buddies obviously did or somebody did for them or somebody did accidentally, who knows what the real story is.  But they just all they did was delete it, which means they took out the index.  But the emails are all still there.  Right. Yeah. So they're going to snoop around with forensic.  We heard the same story about Ken Lay a few years ago. You know, all his emails were gone.  All they were there. He'd all somebody just gone through and quote deleted them, which means they're stuck in the server without an index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino says, We've been forthcoming, honest.  We're trying to understand to the best of our ability the universe of the emails that were potentially lost.  And we are taking steps to make sure we use the forensics that are available to retrieve any of those that are lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the word lost. Now, if you could do that with a Valley Girl voice, I think you'd have something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Senator Ted Stevens needs to help out. They just need a plunger in the tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you guys seen the story that Google's buying double click?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Three billion plus. So that's it. There were rumors this was going to happen. So is it official? Yeah, it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is Google now officially evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is double click good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the other side. Well, as I was pointing out to somebody today, having come from the old media world until Google's to the point where they can start to compete with the real big media companies that make billions of dollars selling professional sports to other guys who watch it on television.  There's still going to be a minor media company. They cannot get the kind of rates you get for the Super Bowl, for the NCAA playoffs, for a single Tigerwood golf tournament until they get into that league.  They're still just a little Internet company. I don't care what their capital market cap is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The $10 billion Internet advertising market doesn't compete with the $65 billion United States television advertising market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't even begin. And you add the international television market, the Internet market starts to look like a little pea way over on the edge of the dinner table.  You don't think it could become as big in a few years?  Not unless they control video, because we all know that ultimately that's where the money is.  The money is in video, whether it's sports, whether it's movies, whether it's entertainment.  Google's trying to get into video.  And if Google can't sell the ads on all the video on the Internet like they can around text, then they're just a little Internet company.  They're selling it on Dish and DirecTV though.  Yeah, but they're not. They're not selling spots into the Super Bowl.  Or to soccer games.  I'm not saying they can't get there. I'm just saying they're still a small company until they do get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just trying to make a blogosphere joke.  That's a good one. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blogistan, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blogistan.  Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Society.  Wait, wait, wait, Liam. Let's get back to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google DoubleClick, you got more?  Well, I'm thinking, how come they couldn't replicate what DoubleClick was doing in the first place?  I didn't think that their technology was so outstanding that they would have to spend $3 billion in a make-buy decision to buy.  Is it worth twice what YouTube was worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I think in this case, it's purchasing the relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to say, they're buying market share, which is what you always do if you're trying to build a monopoly in America.  You buy the clients.  If you're an airline, you buy the other airline and take their customers. Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what you're telling me, which I'm not going to disagree with, but what you're telling me in a nutshell, or an eggshell as it were, is that Google can see actually deciding to compete with a company like DoubleClick and maybe take a few years to beat them down, but instead just buy them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, why bother when you've got that big barn of cash? You just go shovel some into the back of a truck and go buy DoubleClick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all funny money from Google's point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't they kind of have to spend it? I mean, what are they going to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not worth anything unless they spend it.  Which is by the Twit podcast.  We're for sale at the right price.  $1 billion.  $1 billion!  Right.  That'll go a long way in Petaloo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sure will. That's a lot of chicken and eggs.  You could buy an entire trailer park for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of little T-Rexes running around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Leo Laporte Butter and Egg Festival brought to you by Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tom's referring to the fact that it's kind of interesting.  Paleontologists have been able to harvest actual protein from a T-Rex bone, a million-year-old T-Rex bone, and analyze it.  And it turns out it's very similar to chicken protein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read that story. My first thought was, how cool is that?  My second thought was just the whole moment in the second Jurassic Park movie where, oh yeah, it's neat.  Then comes the killing and the screaming and the biting on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've already decided, I think, that many of these dinosaurs, including perhaps the T-Rex, had feathers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some thought to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's like a giant chicken.  It's a big chicken.  So now if it's a giant chicken, the eggs must have been... I mean, you could feed a regiment with one of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they were huge. Well, we've seen the eggs.  Tasty.  Dinosaur eggs are gigantic, you bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think of the size of the stove you'd have to have to griddle one of those babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Colonel had a big challenge back in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No way. You'd knock a hole in the side of it and aim a flamethrower at it and everybody gets a hard boiled in the shell egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When they sucked eggs, they sucked eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, talk about predators. I grew up in the country, you don't want to be a grasshopper in the chicken lot.  They last about two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not an aphorism. That's literally true.  That's literally true, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to think about that for a second.  No, no, you don't want to think about it.  I've got to put that on Jaiku.  You don't want to be a grasshopper in the chicken lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it Jaiku? Is that how it's pronounced?  Jaiku, yeah.  Not Haiku or Yaiku or Yaiku or Jaiku.  It's not Spanish.  They're Finnish. They're from Finland.  So it's Juust, but they pronounce it Juust instead of Juust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's Jaiku, I believe.  Okay.  According to the founders, it's pronounced like Haiku with a J. Of course, that doesn't really answer anything.  How do they pronounce a J?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do they pronounce Haiku?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Haiku.  Haiku. With a J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, like you have like Hefe, Haiku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I've forgotten the aphorism and I'm never going to get to that.  You don't want to be a grasshopper in the chicken lot.  Okay, that's going to be the name of the show.  Today the RIA, not today, some day, a couple of days ago, I'm just reading.  The RIA and MPAA lobbied legislators for permission to lie and steal and cheat.  State of California apparently considering a bill, a privacy law, banning the use of false statements, pretexting particularly, and other misleading practices to get personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're asking for a stay that they will be allowed to pretext.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want to waver. We want to be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they promised they wouldn't use it for anything bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So you could trust them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We all love the RIA. Did everybody see that little survey that a website did?  It was mostly among technical types, but they had a sweet 16 for the worst corporations in America.  And the final four included, of course, three that you would guess right away being Exxon, Walmart, Halliburton, and Halliburton.  And guess who beat them all in the finals? The RIAA was the most hated corporation in America.  They have displaced lawyers as the worst professional group in the country.  That's how low they've gone.  So we trust them a lot. They're number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're number one.  I bet they could spin it.  The RIA gets beat on all over the place. The best one I've read so far is a bunch of smaller, basically somebody did an article about a lot of smaller record companies that directly blame the RIAA and the RIAA's efforts on behalf of the major labels and the major distributors directly for just killing their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two small record store owners in New York wrote an editorial. I think it was at the New York Times.  That's exactly right.  I read that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have done more to destroy the music business and all the crappy recordings in history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's amazing is that you realize pretty much 50% of all CD sales in the United States run through Walmart, Best Buy, and Target.  And 20 to 25% of that is Walmart.  So, you know, they, they, they, Walmart, especially they do the loss leading on disc.  They get cheap prices, get people in there to buy other stuff.  And, you know, all of a sudden, everybody else looks expensive by comparison.  It's a really interesting conversation.  I don't know.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it is.  I think it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sad because it's getting harder and harder to find.  You know, I mean, it's great because we have Amoeba Records here in town, but it was a real bummer to see Tower Records finally die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks, Patrick.  Nice buzzkill.  Man, all right.  I think I just want to go home and get a bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, there's a new Windows DNS flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Target's Windows 2000 server, Windows Server 2003 systems through a hole in the domain name system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IPv6?  Is it the way they support IPv6?  I'm not sure.  Or is that a different flaw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dangerous DNS server bug in Longhorn code 2, says Microsoft.  So it's not just 2000 and 2003.  What a shocker.  You know, Vista popped its cherry last week, the first critical update for Vista on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was that comment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was just rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could have called it a never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I better not say it.  Don Imus' producer working for you again.  Even I don't have the nerve, even on a podcast that no one listens to, I still don't have the nerve to say that.  I wanted to.  You know, DJ just got fired for making that the phrase that pays, I think somewhere in Massachusetts.  Really?  Yeah.  So there was resonance.  It's echoing all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Resonant evil.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to wrap this sucker up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate it when you do that.  Now that we've got it back on a high note, Tom Merritt, you can hear that kind of humor and more on Buzz Out Loud.  That's bol.cnet.com.  It is, despite what Southwest Airlines says, the best tech podcast in the world.  And you hear it every single day.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Leo will be on it on Monday.  And I'll be on it on Monday.  Which will make it twice as good.

Transcript:  I like the old log rolling.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're keeping that alive, John.  This is it.  Harry Fuller, of course, is also at CNET.  He is executive director.  Are you kind of in any way responsible for Buzz Out Loud or CNET TV?  I try not to be.  He tries to disavow.  I try to stay as far away as I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm mostly on the news end of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got it.  CNET TV is looking good.  I like it.  Yeah, it is.  CNET is back in the TV business, baby.  Yeah.  Where it started.  Back to its roots.  Yeah.  It's funny, isn't it?  Yeah.  You know, I was a third employee at CNET.  Did you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  We were the first station in the world to put CNET television programming on television.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In 94.  But that's because it had your guy.  Yeah.  What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, they were using Kate Kelly at that time.  Oh, it was Kate.  Hart was from Channel 4.  Richard Hart was from 4R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Talk about an inside baseball moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very inside baseball moment.  Richard Hart, I think, is retired and living in Montana on his millions.  Yeah.  I think he got quite a bit of CNET stuff.  He got in on the right part of the tech boom.  Well, I got in a little early, see.  It was me, Halsey, and Shelby.  And Halsey and I just didn't hit it off.  That's when I went to ZD.  And the rest is...  Toast.  Toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The rest is an empty bank account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think you did all right, Leo.  All right.  You know, having...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've done all right over the last few years.  I got a check.  I am holding in my hands.  I wish you could see this, but you can hear it.  A check from Cafe Press for $39.38.  Wow.  That's one month's revenue on Cafe Press.  I just want one month's revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is exactly 100 times my yearly income from East Meets West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a record, that $39 that anyone's ever made from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $39.38 on Twit Thongs.  I don't know.  Oh, thank you very much.  JohnCDivorek.org.  Ladies and gentlemen, you may take another drink.
