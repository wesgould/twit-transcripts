Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mahalo to you.  Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, thank you.  It's kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the first time you've been on since you've been of Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  Well, I was on that one time.  Was that right after I left CNET?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it might have been.  You hadn't left yet, but you'd announced it.  Okay.  So it's kind of fun to say.  How's it going at Mahalo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going really well.  I'm doing a lot of shooting and we're getting everything going for our September launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because we're waiting for the new Veronica Belmont show.  Where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to go back east for a while for some vacation, so workup put off for a little bit  for family stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw the stuff you did from the game from the Blizzard con, Blizzcon or whatever it  was called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was fun with Leroy Jenkins.  That was good.  Good.  Well, we can't wait to see that.  What's the new show going to be called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mahalo Daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So it's going to be a daily gadget news thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the plan.  Yes.  Daily is very hard, but we're going to work to make it happen.  It is difficult.  It's not just going to be about gadgets though, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  News too.  Yeah.  All right, great.  Look forward to that.  Robert Heron from DLTV has joined us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Robert.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His hand poised right now over the buy button at amazon.com.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you do it?  I'm looking at the...  Did you do it?  It is in my shopping cart as we speak and I'm debating if there's anything else I need  before I hit the buy now button.  What am I picking up?  Hero season one in the 300 HD DVD version.  A bundle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  $98 for Sparta and for Heroes.  A great season.  I have nothing to say about either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really either now that you mention it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good stuff though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to keep me busy weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're getting it on HD, of course.  Oh, certainly.  Of course.  Well, we have some questions here from...  I don't know what to say.  From where is Will, I guess.  But we know where Will is, but it hasn't started yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  So at the moment, channelflip.com just redirects to my blog.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll send people to channelflip.com just to get used to that.  So just type channelflip.com and go wherever it goes.  Wherever it leads you, that's where you should follow.  That's where it is.  That'll be Will's new IPTV channel, which will launch sometime in the next few months.  Next month?  Next month.  We're all in transition here.  And Ryan Block is also here on the phone.  Ryan from Engadget.  It's good to have you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey.  Thank you so much for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we've got you on for one reason, Ryan.  One reason only to make Will Harris a very happy man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it because you like my charming antics and my fantastic radio voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you remind me of Christopher Walken, actually.  Not so.  That's just...  That's Dvorak's own little pet thing.  No, remember that Will, when he went to New York City, did two very important things.  He bought an iPhone and he got engaged.  But the iPhone is still in his possession, unusable in the UK, although we now know that  you at least will have a carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I hope the fiance is still in his possession as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's the fiance doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, she's okay.  She's not as excited at being unlocked though, as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the big news.  In fact, I talked to Franklin Harris up in Toronto yesterday and he used the TurboSIM  method.  He ordered a TurboSIM, got it in the mail yesterday, flashed it.  You actually have to copy the data over to it, put it into the iPhone, unlocked.  He's on the Rogers Network.  I probably shouldn't have said that.  He's been using an unnamed cell phone network and it's been working great.  Well that's method one of unlocking the iPhone.  Now, Ryan, you broke the story today that there's another method.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  There have actually been a few methods.  The TurboSIM one I think has probably been the most widely used one to date.  But pretty much everything thus far has required some kind of physical hack.  You have to hack a SIM or you have to hack the iPhone itself to actually get it to unlock.  Now there's actually finally software that is about to be released.  It's not actually out yet, but I got to play with it on my iPhone.  Software that will soften lock it.  It means that you don't have to touch the hardware.  You can just pop in the SIM and use an application and you're off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So a SIM from another carrier, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will, are you going to do that?  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am really, really going to do that.  But aren't there two different methods of doing the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have two stories going on.  So there's iphoneonlocking.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well I mean there's a second group who is claiming that they're going to have  an iPhone, a software-based iPhone unlocking system out tomorrow.  And then yesterday a kid named George Holtz from New Jersey discovered a way to hardware  hack the iPhone and literally trace, solder some traces on PCB of the device and inject  some code into the hardware to make that unlock.  There are a number of methods, but what we're talking about now is the software unlock.  This is the mass market.  This is what you need to have in order to make these devices unlock in bulk and for  people around the world.  You would have to have a massive Chinese factory working 24-7 to produce a decent amount of  hardware hacked iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is really interesting.  They say between noon and two, now we're recording this on Friday, this will air on Sunday, so  between noon to Saturday they'll offer this software.  You said that you've tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I haven't tried the other guys.  I've tried the first team who, they were the first to announce that they had reached a  complete solution and that was iPhone SIM-free.  And that software also?  Yeah, that's the software base.  They did it on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they came over and they did it to you and you suddenly are using T-Mobile for your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  I was able to use a T-Mobile SIM in my iPhone.  I have a video on my phone so everybody can see it.  It's not a fake or anything like that.  So they were the first team and they're not going to be by any means the last.  This other team is called Unique Phones and they have iPhoneUnlocking.com and they say  that they're going to be the next to have a solution.  They might actually have the first solution that people can go in and buy an unlock and  do it, right?  Because this iPhone SIM-free, the one that I tested and actually works and all that,  it's not available to the public yet.  And it won't be, I don't know, for a week, two weeks.  I have absolutely no idea when they're actually going to start accepting orders for distributing  software to unlock people's phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you get the SIM card out of the iPhone?  Oh, it's easy.  It is?  You just pop that thing on the top off?  It just comes right off?  Yeah, paperclip.  Paperclip.  But you don't need to do that with this software.  You just run software on your computer?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no.  You have to actually run it on the iPhone.  So there is a very nominal amount of hacking that I think will be involved.  So you've got to get an app on your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to unlock your iPhone to the extent that you can get an app on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And I mean, they haven't shown me the final release of whatever they're going to be releasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll probably be a little more user-friendly by the time they release it to the general  public, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, I can't really speak to detail about the process that they use to unlock my phone  because they ask me not to really discuss in, you know, deep terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any detail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, kind of.  They're working really hard on monetizer right now and they want to get a system set up where  people can come on and order iPhone unlocks for their phone.  And I don't know what the final release will look like.  I mean, it could just be a small app that you download and you run it and with your  iPhone plugged in and boom, it's unlocked.  Or, you know, it could take some other form.  I don't know right now.  But what Unique Phones is claiming is that they're going to have a solution they can  buy and do tomorrow.  They say it'll be between $25 and $50 and already 450,000 people, according to you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Engadget have signed up for this thing.  This is actually Sean Cooper writing in Engadget.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's amazing.  I mean, that's what they claim.  We have no way of verifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I believe it.  It doesn't cause anything to sign up.  I mean, there's obviously interest in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure half of those people are probably spoofed Apple employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'd like to get one.  So a couple of questions come to mind.  You have to have activated the phone first using iTunes and AT&T or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  The method that I tested and just so we're clear because there's all these hacks are  coming out about the same time and I know it's really hard to keep track of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why we're having you on, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  That's your job.  The method I tested, the iPhone SIM free method, the application that they gave and ran on  my phone, that's software only and it is able to be used on any iPhone device regardless  of activation.  So if you went into an Apple store, bought an iPhone, walked out with it, never called  activated online, never turned on iTunes with your iPhone plugged in, you would be able  to get on, run the software presumably given whatever their final release looks like and  get that device activated offline and start using it with a different carrier.  So you would never have to interact with AT&T, you would never have to call or sign up for  a contract or cancel or anything like that.  It would really basically just be pop it in, run some software, do a couple quick things  and then put in your new SIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But would you be able to use iTunes?  I mean, as soon as you plug in iTunes, doesn't iTunes have the potential of saying, hey,  what is this?  We're going to erase it or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, so I tested that among a number of other things.  I put in the hacked iPhone and iTunes with a T-Mobile SIM.  It didn't detect the phone number because normally when you bring up your iPhone and  iTunes it shows you your phone number and some information about the device.  Everything looks fine.  I mean, it syncs fine, it moves content back and forth.  It's a normal iPod.  Yeah, no, I mean, it treated it as a regular iPhone.  It had absolutely nothing different about it except it no longer was able to show my  phone number in iTunes.  But the sync was fine.  I was able to copy media back and forth.  You know, I was still able to make calls and do everything I needed to do with it.  So, I mean, it was really a very seamless experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long before Apple, though, tries to push something down that says, you know, that,  you know, couldn't, obviously they can't do an over the air patch, but they might be able  to use iTunes as a vector to get into that phone and do something to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or not?  Right.  So, I mean, the one thing I can verify is that it's restore resistant.  And that is to say that if you have to restore your phone to factory defaults and reload  all the iPhone software, which people occasionally have to do, the hack is persistent.  I restored my phone last night and when I came back to it, the T-Mobile hack, you know,  is still present.  I was still able to get on my T-Mobile sim.  I didn't have to activate it through iTunes or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anybody have any idea how they're doing this and why it's happened all of a sudden?  All of these people are figuring it out all at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's just coincidence.  I mean, the software, this was the first software hack that we've seen so far.  So that we can say with some certainty, like this is the first true and proper software  hack.  We've also seen these sim hacks as we've gone.  We've seen the Turbo Sim and there was another sim reprogramming hack.  They've come out like, you know, once a month.  This hardware hack came out yesterday.  I think that was just by coincidence.  But the iPhone sim for you guys initially announced a few days ago.  And then the Unique Phones guys, they announced, I think, first a couple of days ago and now  they're announcing that they're going to be doing it on a Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So which one, Will, are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whichever one I can get first that works.  Probably both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think most people probably feel that way though, right?  I mean, it doesn't matter who's providing it or even in some cases what the cost is.  If you've already paid $600 for a phone.  Exactly, you know, $50, $100.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And for me, it's like no money anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I have to ask though, how, well, first of all, AT&T must be dying here.  Because they had a five-year lock on this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  In America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In America.  So that's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What has been the response from AT&T and Apple to any of this?  Have you heard anything from them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they haven't said anything, which is not surprising because they don't usually comment  on these kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're pretending it doesn't exist is what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, to them, they want to call as little attention to this as possible, which is hilarious  because it's obviously all over the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is only going to be geeks though, right?  It's going to be the hardcore geeks that are going to do this.  Do you think the general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AP, Reuters, every major news agency has picked it up.  New York Times is going to have a story tomorrow.  It's going to be in the New York News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's really easy to do, I guess, I mean, people are already, people buy unlocked phones  all the time or go to unlocking services to unlock their phones.  So that's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think ultimately AT&T is alarmed by this because that means their US competitor  T-Mobile, you know, they're going to be able to start using iPhones on that carrier, which  is not so good for AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'd be still a T-Mobile customer if it weren't, if this had been available when  the iPhone came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of people would have switched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me too.  I wouldn't have switched.  But Apple, believe it or not, probably has more to lose than most people might think  because unlike almost every other cell phone manufacturer out there, Apple has a really  amazing deal with AT&T where they get a cut of activations, they get a cut of new customers  and they get a cut of the monthly fees.  So every activation, every customer that isn't going AT&T, that is going to T-Mobile  in America, Apple is actually losing money on that.  So yeah, they're still selling the handset, but they're still losing cash.  Maybe even more cash.  They have a deal set up.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe even more cash than they made on the phone itself.  Let's say they made 300 bucks on the phone.  We're talking thousands over a two year period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's very likely.  That's kind of the, you know, the exact alarm out there is not really known, but it's a  little known fact about the situation that I don't think people really take into account  is that Apple, believe it or not, isn't just making their money on the iPhone by selling  the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I can say is I'm thrilled.  I mean, not just merely because people will be able to get an iPhone, but frankly, I was  angry that Apple sold this locked down phone and forced us to go to AT&T.  And I think this is the revenge of the nerds.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, all this always seems to do is really just show everyone that the will  and the perseverance of the technology and hacker community will always give the end  user what they want.  Never underestimate that.  And that's openness and, you know, just cross platform openess that everyone deserves.  I completely agree.  That should have been there since the beginning.  Yep, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the harder, the harder you lock something down, the harder people are going to try to  break it back open again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've seen that again and again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only if it's a really desirable device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Nobody's unlocking the Zune at this point.  Yeah, I mean.  Although you could get it on Woot.com for 150 bucks.  Any takers?  No.  So just real quickly, I want to ask you one more question about the iPods because you  ran a story and now that story has been taken down.  It started at 9to5apple.com, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was 9to5mac.  Yeah, it's one of the newer Apple rumor sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's, you know, at first you look at it, the whole thing didn't even look real.  They had pictures of a fat little iPod that they said was going to be the next Nano.  But see, Apple should just ignore these things because it didn't even look real.  And Apple sent out a cease and desist letter and said, no, you better pull that down.  That's our property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty funny because when we got the image, we were extremely skeptical.  It doesn't look real.  It was a photo of a screen and on the screen was a Photoshop document.  You can see it said, it was like nanoflower.psd.  So you know if somebody's working in Photoshop, the likelihood of that being real is obviously  greatly diminished immediately.  But yeah, I mean, as it turns out, we as did a number of other sites received a cease and  desist order.  And as it turns out, unlike usual leaked images and photography and information that comes  from Apple and other sources, this one was quote unquote stolen.  I don't really know exactly how that works.  But the end result is that normally we don't ever take any content down from a gadget.  But in this instance, we were advised from our machine gun and lawyers to actually take  it down.  But we just replaced it with an exact mock-up replica of the image itself, including a version  of the iPod Nano that is supposedly depicted there.  It's ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope they don't sell this thing.  It's ugly.  But boy, it sure lends credence to the story when Apple says that this image has been stolen  from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, they don't come calling or knocking if it's not a real image.  They automatically confirm it there, which is so very uncharacteristic of Apple.  But at the same time, they don't always send a cease and desist or send their lawyers after  people when sites break news.  We had the first images of the new Apple keyboard that's in the new iMac, the really thin aluminum  one, and we never heard from them.  They never came knocking on that day when we had that big scoop.  So it's here or there.  I guess they decided this time they would have lost more to inaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say that even I don't think they're going to release anything that looks like  that.  It's just not.  It's too ugly.  Any speculation?  I mean, will there do you think?  Now, I know you're speculating here, Ryan, but do you think there will be an iPod announced  next month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I wrote an editorial a couple of weeks ago stating that I firmly and strongly  believe given how long it's been since the last iPod release and the kind of trends that  they put themselves in the last couple of years that the next and future iPod releases  will continue to be in the September, October time frame.  That's typically when they like to get these devices out.  I think it's very likely we're going to see an iPod in the next couple of months.  I would recommend people hold off on their iPod purchases because I think it's almost  guaranteed that there's going to be a new model iPod before the holidays.  Whether this is it, I don't know.  I mean, if you're thinking about buying a Nano and you're concerned that that might  be what you're going to wind up with, I'd buy the old one.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who wants a fat Nano?  All right.  Well, hey, thank you so much for joining us, Ryan.  I'm going to let you go.  I know you want to get back to work.  Ryan Block is the, are you the editor in chief?  Is that your official title at Engadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my title, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Editor in chief at Engadget.com.  And you could see the non-real, non-stolen images of the ugly iPod there, as well as  all the information on unlocking.  Thank you, Ryan.  I appreciate it.  All right, gang, what do you think?  New Nano, new iPod?  What do you think, Veronica, next month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about next month, but I'm really hoping for that.  We've discussed so many times that non-iPhone iPod, the one that looks just like the iPhone.  The touch thing.  Exactly.  And I've heard, we've been talking a little bit, I was on Buzz Out Loud the past two days,  and we talked today about a click wheel, a virtual click wheel that would be on the new  iPod.  And that's pretty neat, I think.  It seems a little strange to me, but at the same time, it goes with their whole aesthetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't feel the need, though, on my iPhone for a click wheel.  Do you feel like that's missing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't missed it.  You know, like, I'm not nostalgic for the click wheel, but I can see why they might  throw one on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you do the finger throw, and that gets you kind of zipping through that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that would really be intuitive.  I mean, because you're sort of making a fake thing to interact with when you can just interact  with the actual thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But haven't our thumbs learned to do that whole motion by now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The roll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that like built into our DNA at this point to do the scroll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know when I first held a Zoom, that's the first thing I tried to do.  Click through it.  Well, I think, Ryan's right, there will be a new iPod or two or three, but who knows  what it's going to look like.  And I doubt if very much it's going to look like that picture.  It's strange that Apple was so anxious to get them to pull that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, it's weird.  They don't usually act like that.  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love an iPod though with the iPhone's glass surface and that big screen and like  120 gig hard drive in it.  That's really what I'm waiting for.  And an FM radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's also part of the rumors is that they are going to go away from these hard drives  and they're going to start all being all flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but the flash is kind of prohibitively expensive at this point to get up any higher  than eight gigabytes.  So maybe hard drive and maybe a little bit thicker than the iPhone is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, I don't know.  I tell you, they would sell a lot of them, but would they stop selling iPhones?  Maybe this whole unlocking thing is perfectly timed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they planned the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I wouldn't put it past Steve Jobs, would you?  I could totally see him doing that.  Hey good news, our friend Justine is Zarek.  We had her on last week on MacBreak Weekly with her 300 page AT&T iPhone bill in a box.  I think all us iPhone users yesterday got that message from AT&T saying, we're not going  to itemize your bill anymore.  I think that's good for them.  Yeah, victory.  Victory is ours.  Save some trees.  Yeah.  AT&T, by the way, dropping the fewest dropped calls slogan because apparently it's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had no idea that they dropped that.  That's really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, fewest dropped slogans maybe.  I don't know.  Apparently, I guess there was a legal fight with Sprint over the issue and AT&T has just  decided it's not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were arguing over the numbers of who actually has the fewest dropped calls.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, all the cell phone companies basically claim to be the best coverage and none of  them have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all a little bit different though.  Like the largest coverage plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verizon is like, you know, that's the one where you, can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?  Best reception?  I don't know.  It's bogus.  The whole thing's bogus.  Let's see, the other big story was Skype last week and I guess John C. Dvorak scooped me  on this on Cranky Geeks because when Skype announced that it was because of a Windows  update, I thought that is just passing the buck.  Skype said it right up front, no, no, no, no, no, nothing nefarious.  It was not an attack.  It was just a problem with our network.  And then on a blog, one of the Skype guys said, well, we actually think it was because  everybody downloaded the Windows update and rebooted at the same time, logging out of  Skype and then back in causing huge network traffic and we didn't handle it well and we  collapsed.  I agree with John, bogus.  Anybody, I mean, what's going on there?  Robert, do you think that Windows is to blame for Skype's problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If that's true, that would just, that would be kind of a, in my opinion, just critical  of the IT department itself for allowing that to happen in the first place, for a critical  system to respond that way to a Windows update.  Well, and also these things are rolled out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not all at once.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, even so, but even say all the systems were set up to just receive the automatic  update and to reboot that that for a mission critical server of any kind is unacceptable.  And I have a hard time believing that myself.  I would believe more.  They didn't say it was their systems that rebooted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was saying your systems, all the people out there who had Windows that rebooted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The users would cause their end to fail somehow.  Yes.  That makes even less sense to me.  That's pretty sure.  I think it all has to do with the Friday beer kegger that the IT department at Skype is  having and it just got in the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you insinuating that someone got drunk and unplugged the cable by accident?  Or it was spilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A good spilled beer in the right rack.  It's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need that computer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now somebody said that, Will, you said that Skype's backing off on that, that they actually  don't, sorry, we've got the Hells Angels going by here.  Excuse me.  You said Skype is backing off on that, that they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think in a, I'm trying to find the Skype blog.  Totally backward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're saying now that they were saying that it was the users' computers rebooting.  They said that worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because everyone was rebooted like after the patch.  So everybody reboots at the same time after downloading all those Windows updates.  And then there's like millions of machines all trying to connect to Skype on login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's on the face of it, Bogus, because first of all, if you accept the automatic  reboot it happens what, at 3 a.m.?  Well, 3 a.m. is different every single time zone.  So it would be a rolling reboot anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said-  My Windows Vista box seems to do its update whenever I first turn it on.  As soon as it finds it, it'll give me about 10 minutes of warning if I don't hit a key  and then it'll do its thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you leave a computer on all the time, it'll do it at 3 in the morning.  Right.  Unless you change that default.  So I'm looking at the Skype blog.  I see the August 20th posting saying that it's Windows fault.  Well, they say it's our fault, but it's what was caused by Windows.  But I don't see any backtracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what they're saying is that as of August the 21st, their latest thing is not that it  was Microsoft's fault, but the Skype network couldn't handle the amount of reboots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it doesn't make any sense anyway.  It just seems crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This makes me think that it is something evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This makes me think it was an attack.  That they're covering up something now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would you need to cover that up?  They're admitting either way that they have a weakened infrastructure that can't handle  either a rolling restart of Windows machines or an attack.  Why put it on Microsoft and not just tell us what really happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said it's a bunch of supernodes that got rebooted.  It was a perfect storm.  And this storm had never happened before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See again, supernodes being rebooted, how does that relate to the end user though?  Or the end users being supernodes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  And it looked like what was broken on Skype was the ability to register with the Skype  server.  So I was able to launch Skype, but I was never able to see anybody on Skype because I wasn't  able to log into the Skype server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My client does show 5.2 million people currently on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of users.  But I don't, well anyway, I just, to me, I think we need a, that's not the explanation.  And I think they're, I don't know if they're, I don't get it.  Maybe we'll get somebody from Skype on.  Maybe we'll get Ville Auroch to talk about how this could possibly have happened.  Just seems crazy, doesn't it?  It doesn't seem right.  It seems, you know, if they just left it alone and said, hey, we had a server problem.  Sorry, we screwed up.  Then I wouldn't have been suspicious, but now I'm suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well there's somebody posting, uh, talking to these crazy blogs.  Um, was the Skype outage caused by government monitoring?  Oh, that's it.  It's the tube.  The Skype network has been a concern of government intelligence agencies since its inception.  How coincidental is it that 10 days after Bush signed into law a bill giving the government  authority to track foreign calls to go through Skype, it suddenly has a massive worldwide  hit.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course.  It's a pretty good conspiracy.  I got to give them credit.  As far as conspiracy theories go, that one's pretty solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's played, who's played Bioshock?  Anybody played Bioshock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm behind.  That's, that's my whole weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're saying it's the game of the year.  Is this, is, would you say that's true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Really?  It's this year's Gears of War for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally.  PC only?  Audio and video are gorgeous in this game.  Just, I'm playing the PC version and I downloaded it through Steam and so far I'm barely scratching  the surface of the beginning of it right now, but so far I have to say the audio and video  production and the storyline and the environment and everything, it's, it's working for me.  It's definitely an adult only title, but it has the creep factor and the fun factor that  I'm just, I'm into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have it on the 360 and it's just been a really fun experience just to even watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to run out and get it.  Is it on the Half-Life engine or is it a new engine?  Yeah.  It's available through Steam, but I forget whose engine it is.  It's the new Unreal Engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's the new Unreal Engine.  It's the same engine that powers Gears of War, but apparently the developers have done  like a whole bunch of work making like water effects and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The water and the fire effects are unbelievable.  Like it looks real.  The fire is amazing and whenever you go underneath water you get like this sheath of water rolling  down and it's really artfully done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The heat effects too, like when you get that slight wave of like you fire a weapon or something  and the heat that comes out of the end of the barrel actually distorts the air and it's  subtle but it adds on top of everything else that's going on and it really, really draws  me in.  The lighting effects too I find are just top notch.  It's a first person shooter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And all the Art Deco architecture.  Ooh, Art Deco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  I've always loved the Unreal Engine.  I always thought the Unreal Engine was a great engine.  I'm glad to see it's being updated and kept alive.  Indeed.  It's a first person shooter?  Is it kind of like Half-Life story or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally.  Well, I mean the story not really but the style of play, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the closest thing is to say it's like is it's sort of like the spiritual success  to System Shock if you remember that?  Yeah, I loved System Shock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very much like that.  Scariest game ever.  Yeah, System Shock was a fantastic game although it predated really these great visual engines  so I'll be glad.  Or System Shock 2 at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The scariest game I think I've ever played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought Half-Life was scary.  Those things that jumped out of your face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were points in System Shock 2 where I just I couldn't finish the game.  I just there was something behind a door making a noise and I jumped out of my chair like  three times in ten minutes and I couldn't do it.  I said put it away.  You can't make me.  I played with the lights on and a blanket around me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Wii is still tops in sales as long as we're talking gaming.  Let's get the latest gaming news and the Sony PS3 price drop though did give them a bump  in sales.  Not enough to take over.  Not enough.  The Wii is really amazing.  And still last.  Yeah.  Number two was the DS.  Yeah.  Nintendo's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody's buying DS's man.  It's like the ultimate console for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now why?  What is the DS game that's driving this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all the casual stuff.  It's the fact that you know anybody can just go in and find a DS game that they want to  play right.  Boy, girl, young, old, you will find something on the DS that you're going to love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either it's Nintendo or the Brain Star.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or it's something more hardcore like Zelda or whatever.  And it's so easy and intuitive that that pen interface anybody can get to grips with that.  What's your brain age?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same.  Let me ask the 20 somethings.  What's your brain age, Will?  Oh, my brain age is like 40 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your brain age?  I suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  I haven't tested myself on that one.  My brain age is 26.  I just want to let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think I'm in the mid-20s too.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You and me, Robert.  Us old guys.  Well, you're not as old as me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Us old guys.  Hey, there's a new Brain Age 2 now.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think my Nintendogs are all dead.  Do you have a Nintendog?  I think I killed them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What kind of dogs did you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're probably hanging out wallowing in their own filth at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, come on, really.  Do you visualize them as inside the DS, just living there?  If you don't open the DS, they're still there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't played with my DS in a while.  I'm a little embarrassed.  I have an original, the electric blue one.  And so I'm embarrassed taking it around because everyone has the DS Lite.  Oh, yeah.  So I feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have two DSs and I haven't played with them in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The professor in Brain Age also admonishes you when you've been away for a while.  He's like, have you been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny, isn't it?  I'm still playing clubhouse games though.  It's like a general pack of different backgammon card games, board games and things like that.  But it's got a really sweet Wi-Fi or just online play or local link play where you can  hook up with someone else and either do a random game or hook up with friends of yours  and play real easily.  And I dig that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you have to say the DS is the winner since it's the oldest of the four and it sold  405,000 units in July.  I mean, that's amazing.  425,000 Wheeze sold.  Now you compare that with 159,000 PS3s.  I mean, that's up 61%.  Just look at the price difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it like?  $99 for how much you pay for a DS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Is it $129 still or did it drop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, versus like $499 or whatever.  I mean, it's just so much more affordable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Xbox $170,000, down 14%.  So it looks like people are not buying Xboxes.  That's probably because of the three red rings of death people have been talking about.  I bet you that hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  I think it's more of a kind of saturation type of thing.  Maybe everybody who wants one has one?  I mean, other than Guitar Hero 2, there haven't been too many games lately.  But that just came out like what?  The day before yesterday?  Yesterday?  It hasn't really had a chance to catch up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody who's playing any kind of racing game though is playing Forza 2 on the...  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to get a big bump next month for Halo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm waiting for Team Fortress 2 on the PC.  That's what I'm really waiting on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to turn on my Xbox 360.  I'm not going to turn it on because I want it to work when Halo 3 comes out.  I don't want to kill it before then.  I want Spore.  Spore.  Yeah, apparently the folks at 1UP got a copy of Spore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they played it somewhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Played it somewhere.  It's done.  It's not polished and finished, but it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is an actual working game at this point, which is very hopeful for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God.  That's the game I'm looking for.  But it's still coming out next year, huh?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 2008.  Probably spring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's got to be Will Shortz being just a perfectionist, right?  Will Wright, yeah.  Right.  Will Shortz is the guy who just puzzles and crosses puzzles in the New York Times.  Will Wright being a perfectionist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know what the reason for the delay was.  I can't remember off the top of my head.  It's either him really wanting the game to be wonderful, which I think it will be no  matter what, or it's just such an intense game and such a system eater because it has  so much stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, you've got to think that it's going to require some hardcore bug testing because  the amount of ways there are to play through the game, if you've got to try and find all  the problems with it, you're going to have to play it for hundreds of thousands of hours  to sort of do the different iterations and stuff, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, because it's got the single player and the massively multiplayer.  There's just tons of different ways you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The screenshots look so spectacular.  I just can't wait to play it.  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be fun.  Monster.com says, oops, it looks like Thursday intruders swiped 1.3 million names and job  seekers information from the employment website.  They used a program called Winspoem, which is, I guess, a hacker tool that sniffs sensitive  data from Windows memory.  So an email must have gone to Monster.  Somebody must have opened up the email.  Probably a recruiter that patronizes Monster and they got 1.3 million records.  Ouch.  That's got to hurt.  Maybe Craigslist got a real big boost.  Yeah, really.  At least if somebody steals it from Craigslist, you feel like, well, it was just Craigslist.  Monster seems like it should be more secure.  They shut down the rogue server where the stolen data was being stored and only names,  addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses were found.  So they believe that that's all that the guys got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No social security numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Would you put your social?  I don't think you'd have your social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people do.  Some people do, but their social, their resume.  Yeah.  I don't think you'd have that idea.  It is a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are you doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, really.  Why would you put that in?  I haven't seen the ads yet on YouTube.  Has anybody seen the ads there?  They're putting ads now on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard about this too and I haven't seen one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went out and looked at all the popular videos.  But apparently it's going to be kind of lower thirds.  The bottom 20% of the screen will have an overlay, which will not stop the video.  It's not a pre or post roll.  You actually watch the video and that overlay is there and then it disappears.  But if you click it, you can watch an ad.  Seems like a good idea.  Video Egg's been doing this for a while.  In fact, Video Egg really deserves credit for coming up with this kind of overlay system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, YouTube didn't claim to have invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, but this is a, although I have to say on the YouTube blog post where they asked  for feedback, a lot of negatives.  A lot of, in fact, a number of people said, I'm never posting another video on YouTube.  That's just the normal noise you get when you do anything different.  Or do you think this will hurt YouTube?  I don't think it will hurt them at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the biggest video distributor out there.  And they have to make money somehow.  And they have the name recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what people object to is like ads, like pre or post roll, it doesn't mess with  anything that you're doing.  Whereas like putting stuff over the bottom of the video as it's playing is sort of like,  it's just, some people feel like it ruins the video.  If you've actually already got lower thirds in your content, then adding like an overlay  over the top of it is going to mess it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one of their defenses is that TV shows do that all the time.  And I know if you ever watch G4, I mean, they constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People hate that though, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And that's what I'm about to say.  Like I can't stand it when an ad comes up in a lower third or when G4 squishes down their  programming to do a ticker underneath with all info about other junk.  Like I just want to watch the show.  If there's commercials before and after, that's fine.  If I'm watching a web video and there's post roll or pre roll, I'm okay with that.  But don't cover up my content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you watch it?  I mean, the truth is this is in response to the fact that people just skip these ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's pre roll, I'll usually watch it if it's short enough.  If it's 15 seconds or less, I'll watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen like one minute pre rolls and you're just saying, oh, stuff that.  I'm not watching a one minute pre roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate the websites now.  There are websites that make you watch these ads before you get to the website.  I bet you a lot of people click off of sites and video when they do that.  I do.  That's probably why they're doing these inserts.  Because I mean, this is the real problem for advertisers.  How do you get an ad in a show that people won't skip over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We make it interesting or relevant or good advertising is not obtrusive.  Good advertising adds value to content.  And people just need to be more imaginative and creative about how they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which reminds me that this broadcast is brought to you by the folks at audible.com.  There you go.  Well done.  Yeah, I slid that in there.  Audible.com slash twit.  No, we're really glad to have him.  I think this is an example of an ad that works because people who listen to podcasts might  well be interested in audiobooks.  One of the reasons I decided to make it a book pick every show is that there's something  of interest there.  Even if you're not interested in audible, there's something you might want to read or  hear about.  Anybody have a book pick?  I should have asked you ahead of time.  I have plenty, but I just thought I'd give you a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got a good one if you fancy it.  Yes, I do fancy it.  Which is A, I've got two.  In fact, number one is William Gibson's Spook Country.  Did you do that already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Patrick did it last week, but absolutely.  Have you read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just in the middle of it at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it good?  I'm such a Gibson fan, but it's not sci-fi, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's a little bit different from previous stuff, but I still think it's pretty fun.  If you've already done that, then I would definitely recommend the Alastair Campbell  Diaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that about?  I haven't heard of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tony Blair, he's basically his guru for all the years that he was in office as this guy,  Alastair Campbell.  He was the Carl T. Rove of the...  Yeah, basically.  He's got this massive memoir out, which is just stunning insight into how on earth politics  gets run in the real world.  There's loads of good stuff about Bush and Clinton and all these kind of things.  It's just a fascinating insight into politics if you're into that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have it abridged, which is probably okay, because I find non-fiction often, it's okay  to have it abridged, frankly.  It's called The Blair...  Yes.  The Blair Years Extracts from the Alastair Campbell Diaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and he actually reads it as well.  He's a pretty good speaker, so it's very well worth the listen.  So fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a great book too.  I've been reading Ron Susskind's The 1% Solution, which is kind of the inside the Bush administration  during the anti-terrorist stuff.  It's a little chilling, frankly.  Highly recommend this.  This is actually 1% doctrine.  Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Enemies Since 9-11.  Ron Susskind, another great book.  Anyway, these are all audiobooks, which is nice because you can kind of get your reading  done without stopping your life, whether you're driving in the car or you're doing yard work  or working out in the gym.  I do while I'm shopping.  You listen to these books and you get a lot more reading done.  It's really great.  Audible does a nice job.  They make it 35,000 plus titles on over 230 different devices.  Of course, all the iPods and the iPhone, but lots of other devices too.  I think it just really works great.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twit.  If you subscribe today, you get a credit toward a free book.  It could be any of the books we've mentioned or any of the other 35,000 volumes.  Audible dot com slash twit.  We do thank them for their support of the twit network.  I've just learned that they're going to stick around for some time.  They've been very happy with the response.  Thank you, Twit Army, for supporting the show by supporting Audible.  Excellent.  Excellent.  Nikon has decided they're going to enter the full frame fray.  How do you like that?  The awesome.  Yeah, I just got a 5D, which I love.  The idea is that the pickup's a 35 millimeter.  They're full size, which means a few things.  Of course, a bigger pickup means better images, but also you don't have to multiply by the  lenses.  Nikon has kind of held back from this, but they finally have decided to do a D3.  12.1 megapixels will go on sale in November.  Little pricey.  It's for the pros.  Five grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There I'm going with Canon's new 1D Mark III, the 21 megapixel.  You believe that?  It's like eight grand though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you, shooting billboards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it's like crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shooting outer space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's so gorgeous.  It's like crack.  You get more, the 5D, now I can't go backwards, see?  You get more and more clarity.  You get broader tonal ranges.  It's just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't talk.  I have a Canon G7, which I enjoy quite a bit.  That's a great camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great camera.  Are you going to talk about that kind of stuff on Mahalo, or is it going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do some gadget stuff, but it's mostly how-to videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting, because that's what Mahalo is.  It's kind of articles about subjects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right.  And they have a how-to section that's really great that they're developing.  And so I'm going to be doing some videos about the how-to guides, but also just a lot of  general interest stuff.  I talked to Josh Wolfe last week, so he's going to be on a future episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's running for mayor of San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correct, yeah, and about how you can get involved with local politics.  So it's very wide-reaching, a lot of different stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  That's great.  So we'll look forward to that.  Big news in the DRM world.  Boy, lots of it.  First of all, for internet broadcasters, good news.  SoundExchange, which represents the record labels, has dropped the DRM requirement, and  they are offering a reduced royalty still to broadcasters.  Broadcasters didn't like the DRM.  And they're not crazy about the terms, apparently.  So there's still some argument going on.  At least there's some movement, which is encouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems very give and take.  They'll give in on one area, but then push a little harder in the pricing or whatever.  It just never seems to come to a conclusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to get Rusty Hodgson.  He was a webmaster at TechTV, now runs Soma FM.  He really hates the offer.  For instance, the latest is in order to qualify for these reduced rates, you have to earn  less than $1.25 million.  That seems reasonable a year.  Rusty says that's way too low.  They should use the Small Business Administration's standard cap, which is $6 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you ever want to have a guy from SoundExchange on, I had a gentleman on Buzz Out Loud one  time that's on the board of SoundExchange, and he gave a little bit of that side of the  whole story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was he pretty good, or was he the evil, was he the devil incarnate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was not the devil incarnate.  No, he was a very well-spoken, intelligent guy.  It was interesting to ... Because we automatically side with the webcasters.  I mean, at least I do personally.  I never even thought about it.  But then talking to him, I got a little more of a sense of how they're seeing things.  It's good to get that other side of the coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Good.  Yeah, I'd love to do that.  In fact, maybe I'll get Rusty and somebody from SoundExchange on.  That would be a great back and forth.  We'll work on that.  I'll get ahold of you after the show.  Okay.  We're doing DRM free downloads from Universal and EMI, and it's 94 cents for 256 kilobits.  Watch out iTunes.  Anybody want to buy their songs from Walmart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  94 cents, MP3s without encryption, 256 kilobits?  What kind of selection are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they going to have popular music or is there a specific library?  It's all Perry Como.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the time.  Jackie Gleason, Perry Como, all your favorites.  No, I think it's Universal and EMI.  I think it's the same things.  It's their entire library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's just the same stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's not clear.  I mean, they didn't say what songs, but I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just going to be the same stuff you could already get on iTunes, I would think, in which  case you might as well just get it on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm wondering about is what's the pricing deal difference in terms of what they're giving  to the artist as compared to iTunes?  Is Walmart just taking a bigger loss or are they giving less money to the artists and  to the labels or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good question.  Now, I want to point out that you cannot get these Universal songs on iTunes DRM free.  Universal didn't do that intentionally on iTunes.  Basically they're trying to get companies like Walmart to compete with iTunes.  They don't like Apple's dominance of this business.  So in fact, it's expected that they'll go to Amazon as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes me think then that probably Walmart was able to give Universal more money per  track than Apple is currently giving them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think really what we're seeing, we certainly are seeing the end of DRM.  It's unfortunate that Apple, Steve Jobs did recently step up and say, I don't want to  do DRM.  They're making me do DRM.  And now he's losing that battle because they're not doing DRM and they're not doing it on  iTunes.  There's a lot of enemies in the record business in pushing back on this.  And this is unfortunate, but I think this is going to shake up iTunes.  Now the problem is, of course, iTunes owes its dominance to the success of the iPod.  But you could put these unprotected things on iPod.  It's just not as easy.  It's not as straightforward.  And I think people do like that ability to push a button and have it appear.  What's not as straightforward?  Well, like you could buy the songs from Walmart and import them into iTunes, but it's just  an extra step, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like one extra step.  Not horrible.  Not horrible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So you think this could undermine iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I download a lot from Emusic and it doesn't really bother me to have to  import those after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this could, so you think this could undermine iTunes?  It's possible.  It's possible.  I don't know.  It's possible.  Anything could happen.  Anything could happen, my friends.  Flash is going to support H.264.  You excited to care about that?  Probably not.  I care about it.  People who do video, you should care about it, Veronica, because it means your flash  video quality will go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's always a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Always a good thing.  Google says they will participate in the auction, the 700 megahertz auction.  We now know that it'll be January 16th, 2008.  The bidding will be anonymous.  FCC says that the reserve price is $10 billion for all licenses combined, but bidders have  to put up a $4.6 billion reserve.  Amazing.  Is that the Google phone?  Well, Google, yes, it's very good if Google does participate.  They haven't said if they're going to participate.  They seem to be leaning in that direction.  Remember, they said we won't participate unless it's open and that you can reach, they'll  requirement to resell.  FCC didn't go for all of the open conditions.  I'm hoping that Google will still participate.  I really want them to get in there and undermine the wireless companies.  But we shall see.  At least we know when that auction will be.  Coming up soon, January 20, January 2008.  Movie pirate.  This is your story, Will.  Movie pirate forced to ditch Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talk about a fate worse than death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scott McHughlin is the ex-admin of the elite torrent tracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This judge obviously has a sense of humor.  This kid gets busted basically for uploading Star Wars Episode III.  He's like seeding it out on his torrent client.  Obviously he's like a hardcore Linux user because that's what a lot of these guys are.  The judge, sensing him, says, I'm not going to stop you using a computer.  But obviously you're super elite hacking.  Computer with its Ubuntu operating system and all this stuff, that's too high powered.  You've got to use Windows if you want to do anything in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a fate worse than death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty harsh.  Ow.  This kid is busted there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he can enjoy some good Windows games now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think he can hack on Windows just as well?  Of course.  Honestly.  I don't know.  In fact, this could be the law of unintended consequences.  This judge could be unleashing this guy on Windows and all of a sudden he could create  all these hacking tools on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just, he's obviously going to be able to do just as much damage.  You know, torrent as well on Windows as you can on Linux.  It does just seem like for a Linux fanboy that's going to be a fate worse than death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the judge knew.  Hey, I actually want to get you on this, Robert Heron, because I thought this was very interesting.  Paramount has announced that it's not going to put out its movies on Blu-ray any longer.  It's going to do them on HD DVD.  By the way, Michael Bay was not happy about that.  He said, that's it.  I'm not putting out, no Transformer 2 for me.  Some reason he doesn't like this move to HD DVD.  And then he changed his mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then he went back?  Yeah, he drank the Kool-Aid according to Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did he get some of that money that supposedly was put up for this exclusivity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's interesting.  He said he's back on Transformers 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They showed him the check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No problem, Michael.  We can cut you in.  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what happens?  I take it back.  So HD DVD, which is mostly Toshiba, right?  Yes.  Yeah, Microsoft.  And Microsoft paid $150 million to Paramount and Dreamworks to move from Blu-ray to HD  DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Exactly.  To ensure some exclusivity for titles.  I don't know if there's a time limit on this.  I imagine there is.  It's probably for like a year and a half or so.  But that's the way it works.  Both camps have been doing similar things.  I mean, we talked about a couple of weeks ago how Target was switching their end caps  to be Blu-ray end caps when in fact, you know, it made big story and it sounded really great.  But it turned out you could still get HD DVD movies from them as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And obviously Blu-ray paid them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly.  There's that reason.  That is the primary reason for any movement.  Either of these sides are doing it.  Neither side is going away.  They are trying to secure some exclusive titles for each format to make them both seem, you  know, better or to give them a little unique feature when in reality, neither format has  a technical advantage with, I guess you could argue that the size capacity version of Blu-ray  itself is one advantage, but it's minor when in terms of just the quality of HD video itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got it.  I, who loses?  Of course, it's us, the consumers, right?  I mean, all of this shenanigans.  Okay, they got 150 million dollars, but who loses?  We do because there's two formats still.  And I just, it makes it so irksome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I continue to tell anyone who will listen, we went through this with the last recordable  war, quote unquote war with Dash R and plus R. And eventually we had dual format players  where suddenly the discs themselves really didn't matter.  We have a dual format player available right now.  It's granted it's LG's rather disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus more than buying two independent players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true as well.  However, there will be a good one.  Well, I assume it will be a good one to seeing from the specs I've seen so far, at least  from Samsung that's coming out, but it too will be over a thousand dollars initially.  That's a lot of money.  You still can buy two separate standalone players for less.  So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's Warner Brothers who's releasing their films in both formats.  And they also have that dual format disc that they were working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'll be at CDN next early next month.  And that was one of the meetings I have scheduled.  They want to show me this disc format.  They're being kind of, they haven't, they haven't come flat out and said, yes, on one  side of the disc, we're going to have HD DVD on the other side.  We're how blue, right?  But I'll be curious to see if that is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can't figure out how else it would work.  They didn't do it on either side of the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not because they're very incompatible formats.  They're not right.  Unlike DVD plus or dash and the plus, which were very similar.  These are not that similar.  So Sony, Disney, Fox and MGM.  This is the scorecard.  Just if you're following along at home, Sony, Disney, Fox and MGM or Blu Ray  Universal and Paramount now are HD DVD Warner Brothers smack dab in the middle  with both. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.  I mean, it really is.  It's going to come down to dual format players that remove the confusion of what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  format to buy or or getting these players down a sub 100 bucks and you just buy two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally. Totally.  That will it's it's quickly approaching that for HD DVD.  I think that's going to happen. I think that's that's the main advantage right now.  What the HD DVD format is cost is just some of the players out there now are just about to  break the $200 mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think they're subsidizing it?  This is again an example of kind of trying to boost the market by offering

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they very well may be losing a little bit, especially on some of the low end players  that they're selling.  I can't imagine that they're making very much of anything off of those low sale prices,  but it is getting the players out there and just prices for both formats is pretty much a wash  as far as I can tell, at least looking at Amazon and I mean, for my own use and collection,  it's like I don't even pay attention to the format anymore.  It's just whatever one is available, I will get it on either high def disc format.  But I guess I'm an early adopter for that particular case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you know, you can just buy a console that plays one or the other, get a PS3 or get a  Xbox 360 with the HD DVD drive and then get a separate Blu-ray player or HD DVD player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally. It's just that adds just another layer to the home theater mess that I'd rather not have  to deal with. It'd be nice to have that as just one standalone player that'll do both or even a  single player with both drives in it. Two distinct drives would be kind of funny.  But yeah, it's a shame that people have to worry about this or even think about it.  Still think the sales numbers overall are still pretty small for both formats,  especially when you compare them to the DVD, the entrenched DVD market that's out there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really great idea. Why don't they have players that have two separate drives?  Well, the PC drives.  Why don't you just put out that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say the LG just has one disc drive, right? And that's why it has crippled HD DVD  playback. It doesn't play all the features on the HD DVD discs.  Right.  The BH100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. And as well as I believe their super multi-blue player. Although I think that would  be more of a software thing. If you're using the PC drive itself as a playback device,  that would probably depend more upon the software features than it would on what's supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The drive mechanisms are cheap enough now that you could easily build a box with both drives.  Why doesn't some third party come along and do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And pay me as a consultant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. We can ease you somebody. Just make one box with both drives in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd still be a pretty expensive box. I mean, it could easily roll up into being more than $1,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I can imagine that at least then you wouldn't have the crippled features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. True. That's where I'm really having... I'm holding out hope for Samsung's new player  that's coming out here before the end of the year. That should be a full feature drive for  both players. And it'll have the persistent storage. It probably will also have the new  features in Blu-ray, including that match what's currently available on HD DVD, namely,  the network connectivity for online interactivity and for easy updates of the firmware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I could be wrong though. It might not be a hardware issue. It might be a  licensing issue for the HD DVD stuff. I think it's licensing. So that's all. Null. Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the case of the LG player, it isn't an officially licensed HD DVD product, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple having a very good quarter. Their laptops now are 17% of the market. They are the number  three manufacturer after Dell and HP. There is definitely a halo effect from the iPod  and the iPhone. In the last 90 days, up from 12% in June to 17% of laptop sales.  That's got to help a little bit. The desktop sales were 7% down though, from 8%. So it's the  laptops that are really moving the Mac. And that makes sense. In fact, I know a lot of people  who bought Mac laptops might still use a PC for work, but they like the laptops, the Mac laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think pricing probably has a lot to do with it as well. Those are some of their more affordable  entry systems as far as Apple goes in their hardware listing. You compare that to the G5  desktop series and you can blow a lot of money on one of those boxes. Granted, they're beautiful  and nice, but it's not easy. Dell is still number one, but their market shares dropped 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm sorry. 7%. 30% of purchasers said they bought a Dell desktop in the past 90 days. That's  a seven point drop since June. The second lowest percentage is recorded for desktops in this change  wave survey. Laptop purchases, 24% have fallen four points. So Dell's struggling a little bit  still. HP, pretty solid, but Apple coming on strong. Also an update on a story we talked about  last week. Comcast categorically denies that they are throttling BitTorrent traffic. He says,  well, I don't know. He says, the company doesn't actively look at the applications or content its  customers download over the network, but they do reserve the right to cut off service to customers  who abuse the network by using too much bandwidth, which they won't tell you how much that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they just, what did they do? They quadrupled my upload speed recently. Yes. For no fee. And then  they, I think they more than doubled my download speed. It is just insane how fast my Comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  connection goes now. Competition's a good thing. They're looking at Verizon with their Fios coming  after them and certainly DSL. And so that's good. So anyway, just to update, we talked a lot about  that story last week, but the response from Comcast is no, we're not doing any bandwidth shaping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And time to set up that, that tour connection with your encrypted everything. And it'll slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  down to a crawl, but at least it won't open DNS. Start using it. The storm worm. Anybody get any  stormworm spam? I think, you know, everybody now is running so much anti-spam software and  anti-antivirus software. It seems unlikely that any of you guys would be getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to the talks I saw at DEFCON, it's not even viruses anymore. It's all about malformed  web pages, drawing people in and getting click on something. That's the big target right now.  I don't even, I don't run antivirus software on anything I own personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is exactly how the storm Trojan is, you're getting, is getting on your system. You'll get  what is essentially a phishing email that gets you to click on a link, which then has the Trojan on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it. The Trojan just heard you say that now and it's coming for you, Robert. No, no. I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spotter. So according to- That's why I use open DNS though. It helps me mitigate some of those  bad websites that are out there. Oh, cause they block them? Yeah. Well, it's also a whitelist too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whitelist, blacklist system. Yeah, but using open DNS as well. I like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Free and I like their 404 stuff. It's helpful. And it's a quick and easy change anybody could  do to either their router or their personal computer. And it doesn't affect your ISP  performance. At least not, not any way I can tell. No, it seems very fast. So what Robert's saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  instead of using your internet service providers, DNS settings, you just use open DNS. You can either  do it on your system or I put it on my router that way. All my systems are covered. And you know,  I had some problems with it a few, like a year ago where it seemed like it was a little slow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's not now. It seems very fast. No, see, I thought I was having a DNS related issue with  Comcast. So I went and changed it and I never went back and changed it again, but I've been satisfied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OpenDNS.com. It's really simple. They have this instructions. They also-  Comm or word? I never remember. It's .com. .com. Okay.  Cause they make some money, but I don't know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't figure it out. I'm not certain either. I think it's the searchers. I think when you get,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you enter in a bad address, you get a, what they do instead of giving you just a plain old  404 is you get search results and then they have ads at the top of those search results. And I  gather that's how they make their money. Simple enough. The great mystery of the internet. How  do you make your money? So you're in the Twitter offices now. I am. Do you ever ask them that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we don't talk about business too much. I'm just using their desk space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got Ev and Biz. That's a good, there's a good bunch of people over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. They're great, great guys. Yeah. Doing some great stuff. They just sold

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MTV. The MTV video awards are going to be on Twitter. Very interesting. That's, I think really  the first mainstream use of one of these micro blogging services. Yeah, they have, they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  partnered with Human Giant in the past, who is a sketch comedy show on MTV and they covered the  music awards or the movie awards. I think it was. And so now they're going all out with the VMAs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this year. That's great. So what that means is that somebody backstage will be Twittering? Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess so. I guess I probably have a dedicated Twitter person. A Twitterer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter Pounce or Jaiku? Which is it for you, Veronica? I am on active on both Twitter and  Pounce. I like Pounce. Yeah, I see you on Pounce all the time. I really like Pounce a lot. I use  it differently than Twitter. But Pounce is still private beta for some reason. Oh. They haven't  opened up, have they? I don't think so. You still have to get it open. No, they haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You still have to get it open. There's still a few bugs every so often. That's a good way though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to make it something cool and the cool kids. For some reason, whenever I post things, it posts it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like 30 times. Oh, that's not good. So then I fill up a whole page with one comment and it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you what is quite cool though, is if you can make a cross post between Pounce and Twitter,  if you use this, there's something called Twitter feed and you set Twitter feed to pick up on the  RSS from your parents and post it to your Twitter. Right. And so you get automatic cross posting so  you can use both. That's why I use Jaiku. I see why that's good. I see why that's good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I find it really redundant and I feel like it annoys people more than anything. Yeah. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like seeing people's Twitter feeds on Jaiku, but I do that on Jaiku. Jaiku, you could put any RSS  feed on there. And then same thing with Facebook. You got your Pounce and your Jaiku,  and you're on your Facebook and your Facebook status message.  Yeah. It's all very circular. It's all circular, self-referential and very self-absorbed and I'm  embarrassed to even admit I do it. But that wraps up this edition. We thank you so much for joining  us. Veronica Belmont is now at Mahalo, M-A-H-O-L-O.com. And we look for your-  M-A-H-A-L-O.  I'm sorry. My Hawaiian is rusty. M-A-H-A-L-O.com. And Mahalo Show debuts next month.

He's going over to revision three. He admitted it.  So it's all, you know, again, once again, incestuous, self-involved, all circles within  circles. We don't really know anybody. We just know each other. Big happy family.  And we are one big happy family. We're so glad you're part of that family.  We thank you for joining us and we invite you to come back again next week.
