Thank you for the gifts, some pictures and little kangaroos  and more importantly, Tim Tams, which we are going to share with our panel.  Not you, though. Patrick Béja, he's in Finland.  The host of Le Rendez-vous Tech.  Exactly.  I wanted to turn tech into a French word and I couldn't.  So, Le Rendez-vous Tech.  Why isn't it Le Rendez-vous avec les ordinateurs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you get it?  All of that.  Yeah.  I choose not to be paranoid.  We're just going to.  I'll get my mask later.  Let's talk about Jeff Bezos.  This is a really interesting story that has developed over the past week.  Of course, you remember last year, Jeff Bezos, who was at the time married,  was busted over his relationship with Lauren Sanchez, his new girlfriend.  He's gotten divorced since.  And you remember probably the National Enquirer attempting to blackmail him  with pictures and texts from his romantic liaison.  And he went very public with it.  Went to Medium, published an article saying,  I will not be blackmailed.  Here's what they're doing.  It was great.  I enjoyed it.  And when you're the richest man in the world, you can do that.  Right.  Talk about privilege.  You can do that.

Start time: 550.20
End time: 564.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, not only did it give us some great headlines,  which is what The Reg is about, but it was that just like,  yeah, OK, publish and be damned.  You want to write this, I'm not going to submit to blackmail.  I give a lot of respect.  Good for him.

Start time: 564.42
End time: 654.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, respect.  Then at the time, the Enquirer said,  we got it from Lauren Sanchez's estranged brother,  who got access to her phone and then was able to get the stuff off it  and send it to the National Enquirer.  Gavin De Becker, well-known security expert,  was hired by Bezos to do an investigation.  That seemed to be the result of the investigation.  And then all of a sudden, new news came out last week.  A security firm that I'm not familiar with, maybe UR, was it RTI?  Was that their name?  FTI.  FTI, that's right.  FTI did an analysis of Bezos' phone and concluded  that he was hacked by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Muhammad bin Salman, MBS.  He was apparently in a WhatsApp conversation with MBS.  At some point in the conversation, MBS sent him a file  which, according to this investigation,  then exfiltrated contents of Jeff's phone to the Saudi prince  and presumably at that point passed it along to the National Enquirer.  The FTI said, we're medium to high confidence on this.  And a number of security experts, including Matthew Green  and Alex Stamos, who used to be at Tech Security,  CSOS, Chief Information Security Officer at Facebook, who owns WhatsApp,  he said this is a little suspect, this finding.

Start time: 654.28
End time: 682.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he's been very critical of Facebook, so it's not like he's just  He's not defending his feet.  ...supporting the company.  So for the news-consuming audience at home,  I want to clarify this from a news analysis perspective.  So what we're talking about, all of this noise around this  is based on the claims, the unproven claims of a single  person and theoretically his organization.  You mean FTI?  Yes.

Start time: 682.76
End time: 683.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is one guy?

Start time: 684.10
End time: 691.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To be fair, they did finger the Saudis a couple of months ago  with the initial investigation and that was from Bezos' own crew.  But I take your central point.

Start time: 691.56
End time: 701.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Furthermore, we know that WhatsApp is vulnerable to precisely this kind of hacking.  So that's not new.  Even an iPhone, and Jeff Bezos had an iPhone X, is vulnerable.  So this is not impossible.

Start time: 701.52
End time: 710.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The way you do a forensic analysis on something like this is  first of all you have to decrypt the loader and all that stuff, which he didn't do.  The best thing to do is to go out and look.

Start time: 710.66
End time: 721.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this was the thing that puzzled Stamos and Green.  Why didn't he?  The keys would be on the device.  Why did they not decrypt the bootloader?  That's right.  See the evidence of the hacking.

Start time: 721.59
End time: 735.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  The story goes that he received this file, he opened the video,  and then suddenly his phone just started pumping data out.  The amount of data that was being pumped out supposedly is less than 500k.

Start time: 736.98
End time: 739.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I read 500 megs in one case and 500k in another.

Start time: 740.36
End time: 742.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd heard his baseline data use was 430kbps.

Start time: 747.00
End time: 750.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  But after the after the invention that jumped up to gigabit levels.

Start time: 750.95
End time: 753.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see.  So the baseline is even lower.

Start time: 754.22
End time: 759.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which also sounded really dodgy because if you're using a mobile phone,  you're easily sending out more than 430kbps.

Start time: 760.22
End time: 765.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that would indicate maybe this wasn't his primary phone.  It was a phone he used just for WhatsApp perhaps?  Yeah.

Start time: 766.18
End time: 791.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, okay, I misread that part.  But the fact is that there's something fishy going on around FTI  because they need to go to Facebook and or Apple  or somebody else who will do a real analysis and find out what really happened.  What we think we know is that he sent him a file  and then his phone started acting funny.  Yeah.  That doesn't necessarily mean that that video file,  they found no trace of malware,  which doesn't mean there wasn't malware that didn't erase it.

Start time: 791.86
End time: 793.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lots of malware erases.  Exactly.  Yeah.

Start time: 793.72
End time: 803.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But just from a news analysis point of view,  this is entirely based on a claim and that claim is entirely unproven to date.  And I would love to see it proved.  Yeah.  I mean, because security.

Start time: 805.36
End time: 809.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In other words, there's circumstantial evidence,  but there's no smoking gun at this point.

Start time: 809.62
End time: 836.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook's argument is WhatsApp was not backdoored or was not vulnerable to this.  And on the grounds of it, I would say that's probably correct in that  if you're going to bundle simple malware with something  and you're the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,  you are going to get it through to the richest man in the world  because he takes your phone calls.  So I don't think it's a flaw in WhatsApp itself.  I think possibly the video file.  But again, we need more.  We need evidence that this actually happened.

Start time: 836.56
End time: 846.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one possibility that isn't discussed enough  is the possibility that there was no hack, no malware, nothing.  Right.  We have not seen evidence.

Start time: 846.86
End time: 850.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That it's solely down to his paramour's brother feeding this to the National Guard.

Start time: 850.90
End time: 854.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the timing doesn't fit either.  So there's the problem with the timing of this whole thing.

Start time: 854.52
End time: 862.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why so and Patrick, just chime in if you have anything you'd like to say.  Why would somebody make this up?

Start time: 864.36
End time: 875.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one person who has a motive here is the sister of the of the girlfriend.  I mean, I'm sorry, the brother of the girlfriend who he'd like to get off the hook.  And accused of leaking information about their affair.

Start time: 875.84
End time: 877.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he know the FTI folks?

Start time: 877.78
End time: 878.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Start time: 879.52
End time: 883.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a TV producer.  I can't see him having that many sort of contacts.

Start time: 883.60
End time: 923.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is, unfortunately, a political undercurrent to this as well.  And the nexus is between Saudi Arabia, the president, the National Enquirer and Jeff Bezos.  And the Washington Post.  And the Post.  And Kasoji.  In particular.  So we know that the president is not a big fan of Bezos and or the Washington Post.  We know that Saudi Arabia is implicated in the murder of Kasoji, a Washington Post.  I think implicated is going a little bit easier.  We pretty much know that.  There were hacksaws involved.  Yeah.  We know that Saudi Arabia has a close relationship to President Trump because of military weaponry.

Start time: 924.42
End time: 928.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Saudi Arabia is also invested in the National Enquirer.  They run a very positive Saudi edition.

Start time: 929.96
End time: 938.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you start tearing people with that brush,  Saudi Arabia has invested in almost every Silicon Valley startup we talk about.  This is true.  Because their sovereign fund is a very active venture capital.

Start time: 938.80
End time: 940.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of whom hate Amazon.  Oh my God.

Start time: 941.76
End time: 945.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess if you're looking for motive, there's multiple possibilities.

Start time: 946.24
End time: 949.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like knives out.  It's like knives out.  Everybody did it.

Start time: 949.44
End time: 956.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody is a suspect.  Don't tell me I haven't seen it.  So that's interesting.  Do you have a thought about this, Patrick?

Start time: 957.68
End time: 961.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it sounds outlandish.  It sounds outrageous.

Start time: 961.72
End time: 969.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why it sells copies of the newspaper because it's great.  The Prince of Saudi Arabia hacked the world's richest man is a great story.

Start time: 970.08
End time: 1021.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the thing that is really surprising is that the case that you just laid out,  which is the case that everyone is laying out, does make it make sense.  It could actually be a motive for,  of course, the secret service of Saudi Arabia to go to MBS and tell him,  hey, if you want this done, maybe we can do it like this.  And he might agree.  It wouldn't seem completely outlandish that that would actually take place.  Which is why this story kind of has legs with all of the caveats we need to apply.  Yeah, it could make sense.  And it's so outlandish that it shouldn't, but it kind of does.  So I guess that's the world we live in.

Start time: 1021.68
End time: 1026.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We live in, unfortunately, a post-fact world where it's very difficult to get to the truth

Start time: 1026.50
End time: 1038.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of anything anymore, which is precisely why we need a real forensic analysis.  The evidence is sitting there on somebody's desk.  And everybody's speculating on these.  Why would we care?

Start time: 1039.72
End time: 1045.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat was saying it's just another, it's just a rich guy being hacked.  Why would we care?  Wait, no.

Start time: 1045.92
End time: 1058.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  This is an attempt to manipulate one of the richest people in the world.  And so that means one of the people who has the most power in the world.

Start time: 1058.32
End time: 1063.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And furthermore, owns a newspaper that is currently at odds with the President of the United States.

Start time: 1065.64
End time: 1068.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, obviously, we care.  This is why it's a big story.

Start time: 1069.92
End time: 1103.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the fact that they were...  Okay, for me, the thing that got this was if this was going to work, then the crown prince  of Saudi Arabia must be sending out malware.  Now, we haven't worked out who it's from.  NSO Group's been mentioned, Gamma Group's been mentioned.  There's a whole bunch of companies who will cheerfully sell to government's decent quality  malware capable of getting through most mobile phones.  But it's just, yeah, a, a bloke gets hacked.  But why are they doing this?  And the fact that Bezos went so public with it.  You know, he's definitely not going to lay down and take this one.

Start time: 1104.54
End time: 1110.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why doesn't Bezos confirm or deny or his team confirm or deny that report?

Start time: 1111.32
End time: 1139.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the same old problem that you get with any computer intrusion problem in that there  is never any concrete proof.  Yes, this definitely came from, you know, from here or from there.  I'm still hearing people saying with very little proof that, oh, the North Koreans are  responsible for this.  So the minute you hear advanced persistent threat, you know, that's basically an excuse  for a security company saying our code didn't work.  And this is now being applied to the highest echelons of government.  And that's why we should be concerned.

Transcript:  The report.  OK, you want to add more conspiracy?  This is just made for conspiracy.  FTI consulting is Anthony Jay Ferranti.  He's a former FBI investigator who also worked on the hack of the Democratic National Committee  in 2016 by the Russian nation.  On the side of Obama.  He investigated on the side of Obama.  He's one.  He wasn't involved in the hack.  Just to give the facts, according to the report from FTI, they couldn't figure and they couldn't  find any malware, but they were able to find what looked to be a video of telecommunications  video that had been sent to Jeff Bezos with an encrypted downloader.  The file shows an image of the Saudi flag and Swedish flags arrived with an encrypted  downloader.  Investigators decided that it was suspicious only because immediately after receiving within  hours of receiving the encrypted downloader, the amount of data being sent from the phone  leaped from 430 K, as you mentioned, to 126 megabytes and then maintain an unusually high  average of 100 megabytes of egress of data a day for another month, including many massive  and highly atypical spikes of egress data.  So that's why it's circumstantial.  The phone started behaving differently after receiving this video.  We couldn't find anything wrong with the video.  We couldn't find a malware.  But there's this evidence that the phone started to do something.  Of course, there's many ways you could explain that.  Maybe Jeff just decided to start using that phone more.  We don't know.  And you're right.  That's why Gavin De Becker and Jeff Bezos need to kind of get in the way.

Transcript:  De Becker is actually a good security guy.  From what I've seen of his past work, he knows what he's talking about.  But he's also paid by Jeff Bezos.  So you have to include that into your calculation as to whether or not this is true.  But I don't think they'd be making the accusation unless they had some fairly solid claims.  I'm seeing a few people.  Rob Graham at the InfoSec.  You know Rob.  He's professional contrarian.  He's coming out against this.  But some of the stuff he's coming up with sounds,  there are questions to be raised over this.

Transcript:  There are two black boxes, actually.  One of them is the phone itself and the evidence that it contains that nobody's getting at.  The second one is the palace intrigue of the Saudi government.  We really don't know.  The idea that the crown prince himself, he's a bloodthirsty evil murderer, but he's not stupid.  For him to directly send malware sounds far better.  It's been really nice knowing you, Mike.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I've lived a good life.  Fah-twah!

Transcript:  By the way, FTI kind of bungled this because during the initial attempt to  collect the forensic information, FTI determined that DICE had an iTunes backup encryption enabled.  Good. That's what you should do.  And that full analysis of the content would require the encryption password.  Now apparently Bezos or whoever backed it up never gave them that password  because then the investigators, quote,  tested options for bypassing the password encryption.  We don't know of a way to do that and ended up resetting all settings on the iPhone X  to factory default, thereby removing any encryption password while preserving the  file system and relevant data.

And we do care because I don't, I think this is a, you're right,  you made a good case, Patrick, for caring, but I don't know if we'll ever know.

When you think back to, you know, for all of human history,  up until the invention of the railways and the telegraph,  the internet was a guy on a horse.  And that was the fastest way you could get your data.  And then in the last 200 years, we've just gone from that to just getting it from a few  newspapers to TVs and newspapers and now the internet.  And there is some very interesting psychological research saying  that human beings cannot handle that level of information.

Transcript:  And I intuitively, I disagree with that.  I think we need to evolve the way we think about things.  And one of those things is we need to embrace the power of ignorance, Leo.  So here's what I mean.  What is the power of ignorance?  So people are walking around after reading all these stories and in their minds,  they're thinking, oh, the Saudi crown pins hacked Bezos and tried to blackmail him.  That's what I think.  That's what happened.  Yeah.  Okay.

Both of those we probably know everything else.  I'm doing a little bit of an over exaggeration, but the problem when you get to that is that  to that way of thinking that you're describing, Mike, which I think again,  is very reasonable is that it's very easy then for anyone to claim the opposite of what someone  else is claiming and most people who see arguments that seem reasonable presented to them are going  to go, I don't know, but how can I sort it out?

I don't know if you have it in this country, but in the UK, when I was growing up, we had  an A-level course which was taken of 16 to 18-year-olds called Media Studies, where you  focused on the media, how they're portraying certain things, what imagery is used, that  sort of thing.  And that was tremendously useful.  And before you read any information source, you've got to ask yourself, who wrote it?  Why did they write it?  Who paid for it to be written?

Transcript:  Actually, I'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate, Mike, because I agree with you.  But even us on this were baffled, and we're not sure where to land.  Imagine what regular people, about a myriad of topics, have to…  No one has time to actually go and investigate and think about and decide how they feel about  the story where they're getting…  Of course, if it's something that is easy to determine, and maybe for some people it's  going to be Breitbart versus someone else.  But there are also many, many different topics that are covered from different sides on  one media.  It's not as the lab situation.  I think a little bit what you're describing, Mike, is the lab situation where the parameters  are ideal.  And in real life, people have jobs and food to cook, and they don't have time to do all  of this.

We don't talk enough about this, where we had the solution and then we abandoned it en masse.  The solution was you find curators you trust, i.e. editors for publications that you trust.  So you read the New York Times for a few years, and after a while you're like,  you know what, I've been led astray too many times.  I'm switching from the New York Times to this other paper that I trust.  You trust those editors.  And if you really pay attention to a single publication,  it's not just whatever comes across your feed.  You're getting a balanced diet and you're getting follow-ups and corrections and revisions.  And it's an ongoing thing that goes week after week, month after month.  And we just abandoned that en masse.  And now we just respond to like rats and some kind of weird experiment to whatever  the algorithms throw in our face.  And we get this unbalanced diet that favors emotion and outrage.

The problem is that we're hardwired for that digital crack.  We do. We want that hit.  Get that dopamine hit.  And so this is the problem.

I wonder if we shouldn't...  I don't know that we should wait,  but the real effect is going to be understood  in a generation or maybe two.  It might be very difficult until then,  but I wonder how the kids who grew up with this  react about all of it.  And more importantly even, how will they approach it  when they are in a stage of life where it matters,  when they're 25, 30, 35, even more.  I wonder if we're too old for it anyway,  and we're reacting to it with the mindset of the previous...  Before that paradigm shift existed,  so we're panicking just the way maybe someone  who lived before electricity  then doesn't understand the world anymore  because everything's so fast and that kind of thing.

I think this is a great discussion.  It's a fascinating discussion.  It's been on my mind lately.  I wish I could remember the article  that I read about this guy who said,  you know what, you got to give up news and social media.  He called it, there was the pushkin effect or something.  There's some effect.  And you should really just evaluate something  by how long it's survived.  The more ephemeral, which is of course news, social media,  the more ephemeral something is,  the less you can judge its value,  the less valuable it probably is.  But if it survives, for instance,  the Snowden effect has survived.  And so we know that that was important.  I think we'll see.  The Panama Papers is to be determined.  But I think that that's not a bad,  the problem, the big mistake would be to give up,  to say, I give up, I can't, you can't.  Truth is not determinable because there's so much noise now.  Everything is so fuzzy.  I just give up.  I'm going to go make dinner.  I have a relative who is at that stage

It's the journalists who are digging into this stuff,  asking these questions, finding out the facts.  All of the liars and the political cheaters  have turned radically pro in the last few years.  And there's this massive new world  of super sophisticated propaganda.  And it's the journalists who are uncovering the facts  about all this stuff.

You're trying to get to the truth, though.  Yeah.  So you put all the facts in there  so the reader can make their own decisions.  You're objective.  And you try and give some guidance  as to what's accurate and what isn't.  But certainly in the last five, 10 years,  you've seen whole publications, whole news organizations  who have abandoned objectivity completely.  And it's enormously destructive.  Because that is the foundation on which you make rational decisions.  You know, it's like you don't go to a scientific research and say,  I want that vaccine approved.  Find me a way to do it.  Or some people would say that.  But I mean, the whole point of scientific thinking  is that you weigh up the pros and cons of each argument.  You look at what works, what doesn't.  And then you make your decision out there.  And yeah, there are a lot of bad journalists out there.  There are a lot of good journalists out there.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  Lots more to talk about.  Great panel.  Smart panel.  Love that.  Ian Thompson from theregister.co.uk.  Our gastronomad, Mike Elgin and Patrick Béja from frenchspin.fr.  And it is an honor to have all three of you here.  Our show today, you probably noticed we're coming to you from the last pass studios.  It's kind of a nice thing to have to sell the naming rights for the studio  to a company that I've used and believed in for more than a decade,  long before they were an advertiser.  We're really, I feel like it's almost a public service announcement to tell people,  use last pass.  You need to have a better strategy than writing your passwords  on Post-it notes that you stick to the side of the screen.  You need to have a better strategy than using the same password over and over and over  on every site or making it your aunt's maiden name and your dog's birth date.  Those don't work.  And in this day and age of breaches,  where a password you use on one site could suddenly be available to a hacker to try on  every site, this is just a strategy for disaster.  Last pass solves the problem by helping you create long, strong passwords,  storing them in a vault that only you have access to,  that's only decrypted on your devices, never anywhere else.  And then letting you get access to all of that by just remembering one password.  Imagine, imagine if you only had one password to remember and yet  had a strong, secure system to have passwords, unique passwords for every site you visit,  every app you use.  That's last pass.  17.8 million people use last pass.  That's individuals, businesses too.  So we use last pass enterprise, 61,000 businesses.  And if you think about it, if you're a business, you need last pass because  your employees are the ones with all these bad habits.  They've got the keys to the kingdom, the keys to your bank accounts,  your databases, your website.  You need to lock those down.  Last pass is an award-winning security solution that helps individuals and businesses  navigate their online lives easily and securely.  We use last pass family at home because it's very easy for me to share passwords.  I just drag it to the shared folder.  So anytime I create a new password or a new account that Lisa needs access to,  I drag it there.  Last pass families also offers emergency access.  Very important.  If anything should happen to me, my wife and my daughter would both be able to request access  to my vault and there's certain security features built in to make sure that they  can't do that unless something's happened to me.  But that's, I know you don't want to think about it, but vital, vital to protecting  your financial assets should you become disabled or die.  There's also last pass premium for a single person.  There's last pass business plans like teams, enterprise, MFA and identity.  I love the single sign on that last pass offers that make, that does something normally impossible  to make you more secure and make it more convenient.  Strong passwords.  I keep everything in my last pass vault because it's the most secure thing on my drive.  I have lots of various crypto solutions, but the last pass vault is where I put my driver's  license, my social security.  When I travel, my passports are in there.  Our corporate credit cards, everything I need can be stored in last pass because only I  have access to it.  And by the way, it works everywhere I work.  Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android.  You're going to love last pass.  If you're not using it, use it.  If you are using it, tell your friends and family to use it and tell your company to  use it last pass.com slash twit.  You need last pass for amazing features that improve security in your business and your  home last pass.com slash twit.  It's a public service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's a quick thing about last pass.  One thing is since you named the studio, there's like 150 hackers outside and they can't get  in.  It's amazing.  It's really made it more secure in the studio.  I write about cybersecurity as one of my jobs.  And if people are confused about the complexity of security, there's three things you need  to do.  You need to use VPN like ExpressVPN, which is fantastic, which is what I use.  You need to use two factor authentication for everybody who offers it.

Start time: 2668.90
End time: 2700.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the third thing is use last pass and don't just use it for passwords.  Let it create the passwords.  You never even need to know what your passwords are.  Let last pass create your passwords, but use it for all those other things.  Put your credit card stuff in there.  Put your everything that you don't want anybody to get in.  Put it in there.  There's a place in there for it.  And then the fourth of my three things, Leo, is a Chromebook.  It's a Pixelbook.  So I'm using all those things right now.  Basically, I'm unhackable.  I can't think of any way that somebody could hack me.  Because of those four things I'm doing.  Go ahead, kids.  Give me a shot.  See if you can hack me.

Just today, I was trying to log in to enable the Fox sports app,  so I could watch the Super Bowl in 4K on Sunday.  And it wouldn't work.  And I realized it's because third-party cookies are turned off.  Because you have to do a cross-logging through your cable company.  I turned it on, and it all worked fine.  And I'm seeing, and they even say,  make sure you don't have privacy tracking on, because that's going to make-  Well, no, I run privacy-

Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want you to run any of that stuff.  No.  And of course, it's hysterical.  We talked about, I think we talked about it last week,  but we certainly talked about it on Twig on Wednesday.  Google has announced that they're going to turn off  third-party cookies in Chrome in 2022.  Kind of, once they've got another system in place to do that.  Well, that's the key.  Google, which is, of course, one of the number one violators of this with ad tech,  I mean, they're an ad company.  The only reason they would turn off third-party cookies  is if they had a better system that no one else has access to, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Yep, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is why they're doing this two years down the line, rubbish.  Let's talk about Sonos.  Yes.  I have rants available on this.

Start time: 2843.44
End time: 2980.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is an interesting story.  And I think that it's more than just a Sonos story.  So Sonos, which makes those internet-connected speakers,  they've been making them longer than anybody.  In fact, I think it probably was my first IoT device,  because it was a speaker system that would play internet radio,  streaming services, and in those days,  it wasn't Apple Music or Google Music.  I don't remember what my first streaming service was,  but it was probably maybe Spotify.  It was a long time ago.  You could stream it through these speakers.  You could have, and this was their magic, their secret sauce,  whole home audio.  They called it party mode.  If you turn on the speakers all over it,  we have them here in the studio or all over the house,  you wouldn't get weird echo-y experience because of latency.  Somehow, they managed to sync all the speakers up,  and it sounded like your whole house was just one big speaker, one big party.  It was a really great system, but it's an IoT system,  and that's the key, and I think that's the key to this Sonos story.  Sonos is, well, by the way, they've backed down a little bit  since this article on the 21st.  There's a fast-progress ferret going on there.  If, so Sonos has a newer platform that does more stuff.  It uses Amazon Echo or Google Assistant,  but it also, I guess, in some way has some improved capability.  I don't know what that could be, because it does everything else fine,  but somehow the new systems are incompatible with the old systems.  Sonos tries to get everybody to upgrade.  I got the email, we'll give you a 30% trade-in,  but in order to take advantage of this to buy new gear 30% off,  you have to agree to brick your old devices, making them unusable.  They're speakers, but unusable as speakers.  You basically had to send them to a recycler.  You couldn't sell them.  Sonos said, well, we did that because we don't want anybody to buy them  and then find out they don't work with the modern platform.  So much rubbish.  I agree.  Then they announced, and something they've taken back,  oh, all of your older stuff is going to stop getting updates  and if you have newer stuff on a network with older stuff,  the newer stuff won't get updates either.  Basically, strong-arming people to get rid of their old Sonos gear,  which is very pricey.  I have thousands of dollars invested in it.  And replace it with equally expensive new Sonos gear.

Start time: 2980.78
End time: 2989.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of the gear they were end of life in was five years old.  Growing up, I had speakers which lasted 50 years.  Okay, so this is why I think it's...  Go ahead, Patrick.

End time: 3007.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What prevents...  I'm again, going to be a little bit of the devil's advocate here.  Nothing prevents you from using them just as they are,  just as the old speakers from the 1700s you had when you were growing up, Ian.  Yes.  No, Patrick.  They don't change.

Start time: 3008.04
End time: 3029.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot feed them line in like a speaker  without going through the Sonos software.  You have to use the Sonos software to say, monitor the line in port.  So as soon as that...  But you can't use the Sonos software anymore.  You can't use the line in port.  And also you're not getting security updates.

Start time: 3029.56
End time: 3035.40

Start time: 3091.62
End time: 3111.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can use them as speakers.  Again, I don't think…  Until at some point Sonos disables the software.  Well, okay, then we'll talk about it then.  But this story, everyone is talking about it  as if Sonos was going to come in your house  and dismantle your speaker.  No, they're not.  All of this is optional.  Only if you take the 30% upgrade.

Start time: 3113.01

Start time: 3115.34
End time: 3129.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not doing the security updates for the speakers.  So you've now got insecure IoT devices in your house,  communicating with your main computer  and with your other IoT devices.  Effectively, yes, you can carry on using them,  but it's a really, really big risk.

Start time: 3129.44
End time: 3132.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3133.12
End time: 3141.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What you're talking about, Ian,  is the support for those speakers,  which is a different issue from the problem  of not being able to use it with your new gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If, Patrick, there were a wire,  and there may be a wire I could cut in there,  that would make the line in go directly to the speaker  without interference in the software.  I could disable the software so there's no security flaw.  Then it's a speaker.

Start time: 3158.08
End time: 3216.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then it's a speaker.  But I don't know if you can do that.  And there is a great hazard to continuing to use them  as standard speakers because they're still online.  They're still connected to your network.  And I guess you could maybe, could you take them offline?  You still need to get, no, you can't,  because you still need to get into them to say use line in.  I made the mistake of giving my son a single Sonos speaker  in college four years ago.  And I realized, I thought, oh, he could just plug his phone  into it or use it, but he couldn't.  You had to go through the Sonos software,  had to join a Wi-Fi network.  I suspect that's still a problem.  So what you should do, and the right thing from now on  to think about is decouple software, computer stuff  from durable goods stuff by speakers that are dumb speakers,  buy a TV that's a dumb TV.  Oh, I will say.  And watch dumb shows.  Get an external box that drives,  that has the Sonos functionality that drives those speakers.  Or an external box like a Roku that drives the TV.

Start time: 3218.20
End time: 3246.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The one thing I will definitely agree,  well, I actually agree again with a lot of what you said.  And the thing that irks me the most about those devices  is that you can't just plug in with the line in something  and you're good.  And I think that is an issue.  And hopefully competitively, Sonos will be encouraged  to do it down the line because this is just frustrating  for no really good reason.

Start time: 3247.28
End time: 3267.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, what really stuck in my core about this  was Sonos was saying, if you look on their website,  it's like, we believe in environmental qualities  and helping to save the planet.  Oh, and by the way, we're bricking these  for 30% of the cost.  The main environmental cost is building new kit.  Allow it to be resold, allow it to be repaired,  allow it to be updated for goodness sake.

Start time: 3267.56
End time: 3286.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not, okay, sorry, I'm going on about this again.  They are not disallowing it to be resold.  They're only disallowing it to be resold  if you take that 30%.  And I think it's-  But a company promoting that?  If they give you that 30%  and then giving you the ability to sell it anyway.

Start time: 3286.94
End time: 3365.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Sonos got a good education.  They backed down a little bit.  I think they understand people's concern.  There was a lot of hatred, a lot of anger on Twitter.  Of course there was, that's Twitter.  But I also think, and I'm defending them,  believe it or not, Patrick.  The problem is they're an IoT device.  And all IoT devices, this will happen to all of them.  And so it's like saying, well, why can't I use  my security camera after the company stops working?  Because you need the software,  you need the service.  So I think a really important lesson for us all would be  if you're gonna buy a durable good,  there were Samsung refrigerators  that had a screen and a browser,  but it was IE8, and after that they never updated it.  So you had a durable good, a refrigerator,  attached to a computer system that wasn't up to date.  Now that was annoying because you have a big screen  on your refrigerator that does nothing,  but you still had a refrigerator.  And maybe, Patrick, maybe you still have a speaker,  but really the thing is this is a moral  that all of us need to remember, which is decouple.  If you want a TV to be a TV,  I mean you can't not buy a smart TV,  but you shouldn't pay any attention to smart TV.

And I tend to think that all this smart stuff  is taking control away from us, which is not what we want.  Another thing is that Sonos is a dinosaur  and they'll be gone in 10 years.  I don't think this is gonna kill them.  They don't have any secret sauce left  and everybody can easily copy everything that they do now.  And smart speakers.  They're suing Google because they said Google did copy.  I'm kind of rooting for them.  I'm kind of rooting for them  because they're from my hometown of Santa Barbara.

Transcript:  Right, exactly.  And I thought Stacey Higginbotham had a great point on Twig,  which is that technology, anything that has software in it  should come with an expiration date like it was milk.  Yeah, because it will expire.  I think this would be good for the companies too.  So Microsoft ships a product and says,  okay, the expiration date is five years from now.  If you know that when you buy it, then we're good.  We have it.  I think there's a rise.

I actually think that what they did was a mistake.  But I think the lesson here for them is  the end of life came way too quickly.  And that's the huge issue.  If it was a 10 year old device,  I think the rumblings would be a lot less audible.  And that I think they won't do again.  Now whether or not that will be enough for them to survive  in a world where everyone is a connected speaker,  I don't know.  But I think they will take that part for sure to heart.

Transcript:  I do think this is the future of IoT though.  The myriad problems that are coming  when we have IoT devices everywhere,  not just in our homes but factories  and enterprises and so on,  it's going to be such a mess.  The security issues are going to be a mess.  The updates are going to be a mess.  A lot of IoT devices actually run on batteries.  If you're a big company and you install 10,000  little sensors all over the thing  and then the battery's beep, there goes one,  there goes another one.  AirPods are a good case in point.

People are, particularly after I come on these shows, Leo,  people are just like, you don't have any IoT devices  in your house whatsoever.  It's like, no, but you're a technology journalist.  It's like, yeah, that's why.  You speak to security people,  they don't have this stuff in their house.  It is untrustworthy.

Transcript:  You know, one way to address this a little bit  would be to do something that I think  half of the panel will dislike  and the other half might be in favor of.  Make it a requirement, legal requirement,  for companies to specify on the box  how long they support the device.  Yeah.  And I think that is a number.  A sell-by date.  Or a dead-by date.  A dead-by date, yeah.  And when you see that some phones have, you know,  five years guarantee or six years guarantee support  and others have one or two or three,  that would affect a lot of things significantly.

Start time: 3704.82
End time: 3739.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the industry would love this too  and I support what you're saying.  And like I said earlier, I think an expiration date  would be great and we should all push for it.  There should be a movement in favor of that.  But it's a little bit like the,  I don't know if you read about the jaywalking laws.  Jaywalking laws existed because when they first started  having cars on highways, people were getting killed  because they didn't understand how fast they went.  And the car company was like, let's have jaywalking laws.  Let's make it their fault.  You're not supposed to walk on the street.  That's why people are getting killed.  And so this would be the same thing.  If they put expiration dates, they'd be off the hook.  You bought it, it said right on the package, five years.  Five years went by, we're out.

Start time: 3739.44
End time: 3802.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but people don't know though.  People don't know.  I think if you put it, it's like the information  about energy consumption that is required  to be on any device you buy now.  We're discussing something which is a little bit similar  maybe to what we're talking about.  Repairability indexes in France are going to be on the boxes.  And I think there is an element of consumers  not having the information,  so they can't make the decision.  And if you don't tell them that their device  is not gonna be updated and gonna be dangerous in two years,  that is an important part piece of information to have  when you make your purchase.  And it invokes a lot of competitivity  which is currently not being put into the game.  And so companies can do whatever they want with that  because it's not part of the conversation  or the purchasing decision.

Transcript:  Do you support the EU's charging brick rules?  So it's a little bit, it shows the mismatch  between the time it takes to make legislation work  and the speed with which the tech industry works.  When the EU proposed these rules,  there were something like 30 different charging standards.  We're not talking about the connector.  In fact, early on these news stories implied  that it was something about the lightning port.  We're talking about the charging brick.  There are now three, but nevertheless,  there's several, what was it, 61,000 tons of charging bricks  in the landfill every year.

Start time: 3840.78

Transcript:  I spent half a day this new year  trimming through my electronics  and I got it down to just the last box of cables.  And then you were just spending half a day,  does this work in that?  Right, okay, right on that, that's what that's for.  And I still ended up with half a bunch of things  you've got to throw away, they turn into landfill  and you can do nothing for them.  A standardized cable makes sense for everyone  except the company that produces the one that doesn't.  Looking at you, Apple.

Start time: 3880.08
End time: 3903.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure that the EU proposal will do the trick though.  I think what law would be required  is to have a law that says that charging cables  have to be sold separately at a separate price.  Disincentivize the purchase.  Because even if you have perfectly standard cables,  if every device comes with yet another cable, right?  If it's in the box.  It's not the cable, it's the brick.  The brick, right.  If every device comes with a charging brick,  then how have you solved the problem?  Well that's why you have a standard,

Start time: 3903.86
End time: 3909.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3909.34
End time: 3916.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Yes.  Because you know you're going to have a screaming child  and there's nowhere to buy batteries on Christmas Day.  It would suck and it wouldn't be as convenient

Start time: 3930.90
End time: 3949.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  as having the thing come in there and everybody would hate it,  but that's how you would solve this problem.  What I'm saying is that the problem is there's a one to one  ratio of devices that need charging bricks  and charging bricks.  It's one to one.  And if you make that charging brick standard  and they still all come with a charging brick,  you have exactly the same problem you had before.  Exactly.

Start time: 3949.88
End time: 3965.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think in the case of chargers as well,  after about two days everyone has a charger anyway.  So I don't think it's as bad as the  battery's not included problem.  We all have 15 million chargers anyway.

Transcript:  So do you think there's anything to Tim Cook's claim  that freezing in time the charging port,  because again, I don't know that we've made it clear,  but the EU wants everyone, every manufacturer,  especially phones, to use a USB-C port on the charger.  Not what they do on the phone, whatever they want.  But on the charger, they have to use a USB-C port.  And Tim Cook was saying, if you freeze that in time  and no one can change it ever, well that's not exactly  what the EU wants to do.  That's not what they're saying.  Yeah, then you stifle innovation.

Start time: 4032.08
End time: 4053.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tim Cook's full of it, and here's why.  So Apple would be able to support any standard  on the phone side, and then they can innovate  any way they like on the brick side  in a way that supports the standard.  And that would be a value add.  He just wants, Apple has this.  He makes so much money on these accessories.  Absolutely, and they want to put microprocessors  in things.

Transcript:  In the EU, they originally did say that you had to have  the same connector on every phone.  It was micro USB, which was crappy.  But they've now updated that, right?  Tub-C is acceptable, is that right, in the EU?  So they've updated it.  And I'm glad because until that EU law,  every phone, every computer, every device  had a unique connector.  And none of them matched.  I have phones I can't charge in my museum  because I don't have that connector.  And that's, by the way, what led to the cable box.  This fear of, oh, I'm gonna never be able to charge this  again if I lose this cable.  I can't throw out any of these cables.

I don't trust Silicon Valley  because they're too self-interested and selfish.  I don't really trust anybody  to get these charging ports right.  And so I think what's probably gonna happen,  is EU gonna do their thing,  Apple's gonna support it and we'll all move on  and it's not gonna be a big deal.

And everyone who is an expert in their field  is gonna find issues with any law  that concerns their field.  The problem is, if you go that route,  then you just sit down and cry  and don't write any law about anything anywhere ever.  And that cannot be the basis for-  You can make a strong case

You have to support, you can't have the perfect situation.  So you have to support the least bad.  Maybe GDPR isn't perfect.  Maybe the Charger USBC law isn't perfect.  Maybe another one isn't perfect.  The cookie or the right to be forgotten.  But if you hate all of them and tell the government  don't legislate anything,  then you end up in another extreme,  which I think is the US,  where there are a lot of serious issues  which you were talking about all the time on these shows.

I mean, with the whole Facebook saga,  which they're still fighting in the courts, by the way,  five billion of fines for Facebook, they were laughing.  They'd already set aside three billion.  That cost them less than three months' profit.  And their share price rocketed when they found out  they were gonna get away without extraculation.  This is the kind of thing that just doesn't work.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books.  If you are a freelancer, it's up to you  to get your pension together,  to get your act together,  to get your books together.  And that's why I ran to Fresh Books.  This has actually been now 15 years  since I started using Fresh Books.  I had to send out invoices.  I hated it.  It was painful.  Turns out, as much as people hate paying bills  at the end of every month,  the people who send you the bills,  at least if you're a freelancer,  hate sending the bills just as much.  Fresh Books saved my bacon.  They made it easy for me to make beautiful,  professional looking invoices.  But then something magical happened.  In the process of making the invoices,  putting the expense report into the invoice  by taking pictures of receipts,  I actually was doing, don't tell anybody, accounting.  I was actually, that was doing the accounts receivable,  the accounts received.  I was doing expenses.  The beauty part of Fresh Books with that,  just doing the things you would normally do,  suddenly you can go on the front page  of your Fresh Books account  and see whether you made money this month,  this week, this year.  I didn't even know whether I was making money  until tax time.  Why be surprised at tax time?  Fresh Books is always adding new features  because it's a SaaS, a software as a service,  so you use it online.  You can not only get invoices out the door faster,  you can create customizable proposals  that will impress your clients.  You can give clients the ability to approve a proposal,  but just clicking because it's a website.  They can click on it.  You can view and respond to client feedback  about an estimate.  You can preview estimates in quotes  before you send them off.  You can easily add discounts.  You can send estimates in any currency.  I loved that.  I was sending out invoices in Canadian dollars  and that was a pain in the butt for me.  Fresh Books took all the pain out.  They just said, no, no problem, we converted.  Create an email, an estimate from anywhere  within the Fresh Books mobile app.  The mobile app is fantastic.  That's how you take pictures of your receipts.  And then you get these reports  without doing any extra effort.  They show you just what you need.  Color coded breakdown of spending,  a summary of the most recent activity,  profit, loss, sales tax.  Coming up on tax time, you're gonna need to know  how much sales tax you paid  so you can take that discount.  That saves you money.  Fresh Books will pay for itself, honestly.  Accounts aging, payments collected,  all that accounting stuff.  I don't even know what it means.  You don't have to.  It just works.  And by the way, don't forget,  your private data is their top priority.  Of course, protected by 256-bit SSL encryption.  They store everything on secure servers.  You can feel confident running your business  knowing you have the help of Fresh Books  and that they're protecting everything online.

But you send an invoice and you always think,  what if it gets lost?  They send a BML as an attachment,  but it tells you below the invoice,  okay, they opened it.  Yeah, you know when they saw it.  They printed it.  They frowned a bit when they saw the amount you charged,  but they went ahead and printed it and submitted it.  You see updates.

Transcript:  Nice.  Speaking of regulation.  Okay.  Sundar Pichai, the new CEO of Alphabet,  he was of course for a long time the CEO of Google as well,  is calling for regulation of AI.  He published this in the Financial Times.  I can't pull that up because it's got a paywall.  Paywall, yeah.  Ah.  He said artificial intelligence needs to be regulated.  There's no question in my mind.  It's too important not to.  The only question is how to approach it.  And that's, of course, yeah, easy to say, regulate it.  A lot harder to say how.

Start time: 4882.60

Illinois at the moment has probably the strongest  biometric safety laws in the US,  which is why Clearview's being sued there at the moment.  Because they've said if you're gonna use  my biometric information, you need to ask me first,  which seems kind of logical.  Call me a wild, wacky regulator,  but if someone's using my personal data,  I want to say, and says whether or not that works,

Start time: 4918.34

Transcript:  that should be enough.  I have to say, Bruce Schneier had a really good opinion piece  in the New York Times in which he said,  it's a mistake to focus on face recognition.  Yes, yeah.  Because that's just the tip of a very big iceberg.  That's right.  He says the issue is we're being tracked  in thousands of ways, whether it's the MAC address  on our phone, our heartbeat,  and gait can be measured at hundreds of feet by lasers.  We can be identified in so many ways.

Transcript:  And the future of ID, of AI-based ID,  is multiple versions at once.  The Pentagon put out a call for contracts,  whatever they call it, DARPA,  for a system that would track somebody at 500 yards  using thermal imaging.  And thermal imaging can track somebody in a fog,  both face ID and gait recognition and other things.  Through a windshield, just their specs are amazing.  Of course, anything the Pentagon does,  they will have this in the field within a year  and it'll be available at Best Buy within seven years.  Because that's how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is though, face recognition is being used  everywhere now and more and more.  So I think it's not unreasonable to say,  all right, just wait a second, what do we do about this?  And down the line, maybe it's gonna be five years from now,  there are gonna be other ways to track people as well,  and maybe we need to address them then.  But if you just let face recognition,  facial recognition run rampant for another five years  as you wait for everything else to be figured out,  I don't think I like the picture I'm starting to see there.

Transcript:  Well, I'm not making a case for non-regulation.  I'm just saying that basically, I'm basically,  I'm alerting people, because I wrote a piece about this  also behind the paywall at InsiderPro on January 17th.  The facial recognition backlash basically has,  the biggest source of it is the fact that AI recognizes  people of different skin colors and races unevenly.  So if police are using it, then there's a fear  that black people specifically will be more likely  to be falsely accused of things, et cetera, et cetera.  However, the fact that AI is imperfect is a temporary thing.  AI recognition is gonna get to be 99.9% accurate  at some point across-

Transcript:  I mean, in this country, NIST has just finished  doing a series of studies into the relative efficiency  of different AI systems.  If you're using an AI built in China, for example,  or Japan, it's great at recognizing people  from Southeast Asia, but not so great at white  and black people.  If you were due on developments in America,  it's great on white people, but not so good  on black or Asian.  These things are gonna work themselves out,  and it's gonna take some time, but you're right.  It's going to become very accurate.  Are you guys subscribing to the school of thought

Start time: 5138.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is not face recognition.  The problem is the authoritarian government says,  in the case of China, they use it.  Isn't it?  I mean, isn't that what we should be worried about  is how it's used, not the fact that it exists?

Start time: 5149.88
End time: 5178.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the problem is if you use it,  then someone's gonna use it in that way,  and that's why the concern is there.  And that's why it's not only about biases,  which, of course, is a huge issue,  and skin color that changes how reliable it is,  but it's also about using it at all.  I do wonder, though, if we can do anything about it,

Transcript:  because it's just a different world now.  I'm working on a long-form piece on smart streetlights,  and this is something that's affecting cities  all around the US and around the world,  but basically, here's how it goes.  A city goes, oh, we're spending all this money  on electricity for these lights.  They're incandescent with a much more efficient LED bulbs.  Let's replace it, and if these light things  are internet-connected, then we can see which bulbs are out,  and since it's internet-connected,  why don't we put some sensors in there to check smog,  and we can put cameras in there to check traffic  and foot traffic and parking, and we'll have all these.  One thing leads to another, and next thing you know,  it's frickin' Orwell.  The city is tracking everybody with face recognition,  mapping where everybody goes.  The cameras are getting license plates, faces,  gate recognition, all this kind of stuff,  and just a slippery slope to like, oh, look at that,  and then the city gets addicted to the money they made.  They put a red light camera on every block.  You know what I mean?  It's like a slippery slope, so how do we arrest?  We had the same thing in the UK,

Start time: 5237.78

End time: 5318.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, okay.  Catch criminals.  Yeah, I mean, it's basically down to, you know,  we can identify if someone's got an outstanding warrant  against them, that sort of thing.  But one thing we learned with CCTV cameras is it doesn't  stop the crime from happening.  It just makes it slightly easier to identify who did it.  You know, so a CCTV camera won't stop you being mugged.  You know, you can still get mugged  and have the living hell beaten out of you,  but they might have a slightly better chance  of finding out the person who did it.

Start time: 5318.98
End time: 5357.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, down the line, when would-be criminals understand  that it is more likely they will be caught,  and it might reduce crime.  But I think that is potentially  an interesting approach to this.  The arguments for and against are both valid.  You know, saying it helps fight crime.  If it's true, then maybe we should have some  of that technology put in place.  The fact that it reduces freedoms  because it reduces privacy is also a valid argument.

Start time: 5357.18
End time: 5398.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a more abstract argument.  I mean, I think there's a very concrete argument,  which is offered by Assistant Commissioner  at the Metropolitan Police, Nick F. Grave.  He says, as a modern police force,  I believe we have a duty to use new technologies  to keep people safe in London.  Every day our police officers are briefed  about suspects they should look out for.  LFR improves the effectiveness of this tactic.  Similarly, if it can help locate missing children  or vulnerable adults swiftly  and keep them from harm and exploitation,  we have a duty to deploy.  I think that's concrete.  That's not abstract.  Compared to the abstract, oh, but our privacy be invaded.  I think the concrete benefits kind of outweigh the abstract.

Transcript:  There's a larger conversation about policing.  Policing is the only undemocratic aspect  of a municipal government.  The public should be telling the police  how the public wants to be policed.  The way that anybody involved with security  or policing approaches the job is like,  oh, we're doing safety and security,  and therefore we decide how it all goes,  and we're gonna get our way.  As a journalist, my job would be so much easier  if there was a law that said when I called Jeff Bezos,  he had better answer the phone,  and that would make my job easier.  Except my demands, my professional demands  have to be balanced against other demands.  But we give the police that power.

Start time: 5434.24
End time: 5450.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we have been.  I don't think we did give them that power.  I think they've taken it.  We said we wanna be safe in our homes,  and if this helps us, I think that's clearly a cost,  but the cost is minor compared to the benefit.  Well, that's the claim.  But we don't give them that power.  But we know what the benefit is,

Start time: 5450.88
End time: 5493.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and what we need is once those things,  because they are happening,  and they're going to happen at least as tests,  and what we need is to know how well they work,  because we keep having those theoretical conversations.  Oh, it would make people safer.  It would invade our privacy.  We don't know how safer we are,  and I would love if the London Police Department  comes out after six months of tests and says,  okay, listen, we've managed to arrest 17 more people  thanks to this system specifically,  and it's audited and it's verified.  It's truthful.  Then that's a specific kind of conversation.  If they say we've arrested two people,  and one of them was released because it was wrong,  then it's a different kind of conversation.

And this is actually,  I think this is an interesting argument  militarization of local police in the United States  because so much of this gear is made for the armed forces  and because budgets allow,  a lot of cities, municipalities have basically  strategic arms.

The concern that Mike and others are worried about,  legitimately so I would say, is the other effect,  which is no privacy.  And how do you illustrate no privacy?

Do you feel like, and that's an answer  that could be interesting to ask,  would you want everywhere to become as public  as the most public place,  and so you don't have the freedom  to act the way you would  if you knew you weren't being watched.  And that's not about committing crime, just being yourself.  And I think that is a concern that is important.  When you're in your house, you behave a certain way.

Okay, so we're gonna use this equipment,  and you want to catch more bad guys,  you want to be more effective.  Everybody wants to be better at their jobs.  It's just that for some reason, when it comes to policing,  we don't do a good job of balancing the need for them  to do their jobs against other concerns.  And especially, we have to consider this slippery slope  problem that we're gonna get to the point where  all this recognition is perfected.  Everybody's gonna have it.  The bank's gonna have it.  The store's gonna have it.  The streetlights are gonna have it.  The police, the drugs, everything.  And so everywhere you go, you're gonna be recognized.  And do we want that?

Transcript:  for the possibility of transgression.  There's an argument to be made  for the possibility of transgression to an extent.  If you live in a society where no transgression  is even possible, I think that is something that is chilling.  And that's where that technology leads potentially.

Transcript:  My classic example of this is  if we have a Moxie Marlin spike, the creator of Signal,  came up with a great expression,  which was in order for society to advance,  you have to have the ability to break the law.  Now, the classic example of this is America.  If the British had had the kind of capabilities  that even the NSA have now,  let alone facial recognition,  there would be no America.  They would have been a rogue for the Hemp tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a really, so philosophically,  that's a very interesting.  And somewhat profound argument,  which is that perfect law enforcement  is not a goal to be desired  because transgression is important for creativity,  for growth, for innovation.

Start time: 6098.04
End time: 6162.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we need a balance.  Let me tell you a little story.  So years and years ago,  there were no cameras in police interrogation rooms.  There was a room and the police go in there  and they talk to them. They can do whatever they want.  And then at some point, they invented the video camera  and they started installing those.  And we've all seen the cop shows.  They go and unplug it before they do the police brutality.  And then they plug it back in or whatever.  But you have a technology that gives a huge advantage  to one side against the other.  But a few years ago,  maybe 10 years ago or something like that,  some kid had a music player that could also record audio.  And he went into an interrogation room and he recorded it.  And so he had this big interrogation.  And then when it went into the court,  the police lied about everything that happened.  And he's like, oh yeah, listen to this.  And then they played what really happened.  The police was fired and actually served some time  and all that stuff.  But that was a case where the argument is not  that he should have been allowed to break that law.  The argument is that if one side gets surveillance power,  okay, great.  The other side gets surveillance power too.  That's in a way the really good thing about technology

Start time: 6163.16
End time: 6176.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is it isn't complicated.  It isn't expensive.  It can be in everybody's hands.  Moxley, Marlin Spike is a perfect example.  And so if face recognition is gonna happen,  let's make it happen to everybody's benefit.

End time: 6219.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reason Florida man stories exist  is Florida has a law that says that every single call  the police get has to be public.  And so journalists just go through the thing  and they're like, oh my God, look at this.  Another naked drunk guy on a tractor.  How'd you find that so fast?  Been a police dog.  And so that's why.  We need full disclosure about everything  that the police are doing with surveillance.

They've picked up an awful lot of stuff  and it speaks volumes now to juries  when those body cams malfunctioned  or happened to be turned off.  And then the joke, because it used to be,  certainly in the UK, if a policeman gave evidence in court  they were believed almost unquestioningly.  And now you've got body cams and it's just like,  ooh, maybe they told fibs on that one.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Health IQ,  a life insurance agency that does things  a little bit different for people who lift,  people who get a good night's sleep,  people who eat right,  people who care about their health.  Lower life insurance rates for people like you.  For example, a million dollar life insurance policy  from $36 a month.  See, the thing is the people who are healthy,  people who know and care about what they eat,  what they do, what they exercise,  have always subsidized those  who are not so health conscious.  It's not a conspiracy, it's just statistics.  It's how life insurance works.  You might be healthy, but does your insurance company know?  And it's a perfect example.  Because he lifts, his body mass index is very high,  which the insurance companies say, oh, you're fat.  They don't know that it's because he lifts.  That's why you gotta go to Health IQ.  Health IQ is a concierge life insurance agency.  They give you white glove service,  they walk you through the entire process.  And your policy will be underwritten  by one of the top 30 insurance companies.  But here's the difference.  They will go to those insurance companies and say,  look, this guy qualifies  for those special Health IQ savings.  This gal takes care of herself  and they will go to bat for you.  And that is amazing.  It starts with the Health IQ quiz.  You can do it right now if you go to healthiq.com slash twit.  It's a proprietary Health IQ quiz  that assesses your health literacy, your knowledge.  It's not self-assessment, it's a knowledge assessment.  They put it together with a team  of the nation's leading medical, health, and fitness experts.  It's a cutting edge analysis.  Then, depending on your score,  as well as other related qualifying factors,  for instance, completely voluntarily,  but you can say, hey, I'll give you my Fitbit  or my Apple Watch data.  You can save up to 41% on your life insurance premiums  compared to other providers.  There's no commitment.  You'll learn even more about the potential opportunities  to be rewarded for your commitment to living healthy.  This is a really great idea.  Healthiq.com slash twit.  They will go to bat for you.  They will go to bat for you and that's really cool.  Health IQ's concierge service  will help you get the life insurance you deserve.  See if you qualify.  Go to healthiq.com slash twit, take that quiz,  and then once you complete the quiz,  the team will call you, walk you through the process,  and you can get those savings you've earned  for your healthy lifestyle.  I love this idea.  Healthiq.com slash twit.  We thank them for supporting this week in tech.  We thank you for supporting this week in tech  by going to healthiq.com slash twit.

So I went to El Salvador recently,  and while I was there, my nieces were there,  we had a bunch of family there,  and I showed them the featuring Pixel phones  where it'll take a picture if you smile.  So I held it in front of their faces,  they were both wearing sunglasses,  and then when I did an ego search on Google,  does the face recognition within Google Photos,  it showed that picture as me.  What?  Because my arm was in the reflection  of one of their sunglasses.

And if you look at the,  there have been some very interesting articles.  If you look at how Kate Middleton was treated  versus how Meghan was treated,  it's pretty shameful.

And there's some lovely open mic moments,  you can imagine with Prince Philip in particular,  some lovely open mic moments  where they see one of the royal correspondents  and he goes, there's that goss little man again,  we're going to have to talk to him.

Transcript:  Apparently this is a meeting  that was held in the Obama White House.  People are trying to figure out who he was talking about.  Kotaku thinks it might be electronic arts  then CEO Joe Ricciatello.  I'll give you the full quotes  because you wouldn't want to quote this out of context.  When asked about the Silicon Valley's expansion of power  during his time in the Obama administration,  during this interview with the New York Times  and their vetting candidates, he said,  and you may recall the criticism I got for meeting  with the leaders in Silicon Valley  when I was trying to work out an agreement  dealing with them protecting intellectual property  for artists in the United States of America.  At one point, one of the little creeps  sitting around that table,  who was a multi close to a billionaire,  who told me he was an artist  because he was able to come up with games  that teach you how to kill people.  Teach you how to kill people.  And then, oh Biden went on,  one of these righteous people said to me,  you know, we are the economic engine of America.  We are the ones.  Fortunately, I'd done a little homework before I went  and I said, you know, I find it fascinating.  As I added up the seven outfits, everyone's there,  but Microsoft, I said, you have fewer people on your payroll  than all the losses that General Motors  just faced in the last quarter of employees.  So don't lecture me  about how you've created all this employment.  You know, he's not alone, by the way.  I think there are other candidates,  Bernie Sanders, I think is one of them,  who are not fond of video games and video game developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it is a generation.  Now, I will say we just got the,  I think it was the NPD, yes,  that released the numbers of the most,  the games that generated the most income in the last decade.  And I will make the story short,  seven out of the top 10 games are Call of Duty titles,  first-person shooters, military first-person shooters.  That's in the US.  If you go to the top 20, 10 of them are Call of Duty.  So I understand how some people could get that idea, but.

Transcript:  It's also somewhat ironic that Call of Duty type games,  they're essentially building a world  where people get to fantasize about participating in wars  that Biden, as part of the Obama administration,  actually had a hand.  Actual violence.  In conducting and not ending and so on.  So it's kind of weird that these games kind of imitate  Biden's work to a certain extent.

Transcript:  It's the old, old dog whistle, you know?  And it's like, we had the same thing when arcade games came out  when I was a teenager.  Oh, it'll rot the kids' minds, it'll take them super far.  The only thing it did, okay, playing Pac-Man did lead,  it might have been construed to lead into a lot of people  bouncing around dark rooms.  And over-eating, inspired over-eating.  But yeah, I mean, this has been going on  since time immemorial.  There is no evidence to back it up whatsoever.

Start time: 7481.87
End time: 7550.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also very interesting that to back you up even more,  I'm a big video game fan.  I talk about video games on podcasts.  And I was actually an employee of Blizzard,  which is part of Activision Blizzard.  Part of the problem, yes.  Part of the problem, sure.  The problem seems to only manifest in the US  if there is a problem at all,  because actually, ever since the video game generation  started happening, violence has been,  actually, it's not since then,  but for a long time, violence has been going down.  And in Finland, there's a funny side effect as well.  Alcoholism has been a problem for a long time.  And that has been decreasing because the kids  are playing games and hanging out on the internet.  So I don't know how much killing, teaching those games  are doing because people are killing  and being less and less violent.  So yes, it is a generational thing.  They don't understand it, and they just don't like it.

Transcript:  I actually should correct myself  because I don't want to misstate.  I don't know if Bernie Sanders  was one of the people critical of video games.  In fact, he said in the past that video games  have been a scapegoat for gun violence,  and that's inappropriate.  So he's also called for the unionization  of video games developers.  So I don't know.  Oh, that's a big problem.

Start time: 7580.86
End time: 7606.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We also have to take the cynical political view  which is that Bernie Sanders is going after the youth,  like his supporters, younger people.  He's never going to say anything against video games.  And to a certain extent, Biden is going after,  he's trying to already run the election  against Trump in the main, you know,  he's basically going for the center.  So he's going for the older voters  who are going to also be disgusted  by violent video games and so on.  So I think that most of this is just political politics.  I'm going to say, I'm middle-aged though.

Now I think it's much more considerate  to the Fox to shoot it on sight.  But no, the whole thing about,  oh, it's teaching people to kill.  It just drives me.

Until, obviously, before cremation,  but you know, I mean, they are designed to last  as long as the patient does.

And in fact, there's always been a problem with SWOTing,  which is people calling falsely, saying,  you know, I'm being held hostage,  or there's gunmen in my house,  and then SWOT teams come out.  It's very dangerous because these teams,  people do get killed from time to time  by the police, by SWOT teams.  Apparently, people are calling SWOT teams  to tech executives' house.  Now, this is, the tech backlash has begun.  Adam Masseri, who's a senior Facebook executive,  was SWOTed in November.

He SWOTed the wrong person.  The police turned up at his door and shot him dead.  They're now facing 20 years in prison.  I hope they rot there to be quite frank,  but you know, it's a, it would only be possible.

Alan Turing,  his OBE medal, his PhD certificate,  and other of his personal items, 250 of them,  went missing decades ago.  Turing, of course, a great computer pioneer.  Because he was gay, he was forced,  ultimately committed suicide.  He was harassed by the British police in the 50s.  Later, of course, an apology was issued to Alan Turing  thanks to our friend John Graham Cumming at Cloudflare.  He got that petition started,  and the UK government did apologize.  Finally, in 2013, I believe, yeah.  But I didn't know his documents were missing.  Apparently they were found.

Transcript:  That's even nuttier.  No, they didn't know what had been stolen.  She sent some back, but this woman is obviously  several flying buttresses.  She claimed to be his daughter.  She claimed to be his daughter.  She changed her last name to Turing.  She changed her middle name to, I think, Malthusen,  which I think was his middle name.  Clearly several flying buttresses short of a cathedral.  She tried to sue for copyright over pictures of photos  that she'd stolen herself.  And then she gave one of these things to her sister,  who took it to the police saying it was stolen,  and they found them two years ago,  hidden in a briefcase behind her toilet.  And it's only just now come to the fact  that the US government is saying  that they were imported illegally,  and therefore they should go back to the school,  which should hopefully take a slightly more care of them  this time.  These are important documents.

Transcript:  The school's a little culpable, for instance.  They didn't know what she had taken,  so she sent some stuff back, and they said,  oh well, I guess we got everything back.  Yeah, exactly.  Case closed.  She kept his OBE, and sent them somebody else's gong.

Start time: 8346.54
End time: 8350.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  She sent somebody else's gong, and said this is the OBE,  but she kept the original,  which came with a message from King George VI,  apologizing for not being able to give the award in person.  Wow, I mean, this is historic stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, she was also,  she tried the same thing in the Manchester archives,  where an awful lot of his stuff is kept.  She was a super fan.  And thankfully, they kept her,  I think super fan as being overly polite.  This woman was scarily obsessed with cheering,  and she wrote letters to Pink News  when the film came out about him,  just like, this is terrible,  why wasn't I consulted as a consultant, that sort of thing.  It's just, as I say,  this is a strong case for better mental health.

Transcript:  We have a good friend, Throwboy, who makes amazing stuff.  I have his full-sized Macintosh pillow.  Actually, John, would you fetch that out of my office?  He's now making little pocket pillows,  put it up on Kickstarter.  Three days ago, he's already doubled his pledges.  He's got 10,000 raised and more to come.  Wouldn't you like a little pocket pillow  of the classic, you can't call it a Macintosh, probably.  There's also the Bondi Blue You Know Who,  named after the beautiful beach in Sydney.  That's rather cute, isn't that cute?  Here, throw me the, throw me,  this is not the pocket pillow.  This is the full-sized pillow, but it is, isn't that cute?  Isn't that cute? And that takes you back.  Yeah.  I keep that in my office so I can sleep on it  whenever I get tired.  So I just want to give Throwboy a little plug.  Good job, Throwboy.  And there it is.  And let's see, there's a couple other things  I want to do before we wrap it up.  Oh, actually, two sad stories, and I'll mention.  Clayton Christensen has passed away.  He was the guy who wrote The Innovator's Dilemma.  He was only 67, but a very influential thinker.  His books were quoted and used by many in Silicon Valley,  including Steve Jobs, Reed Hastings of Netflix,  Andy Grove of Intel, Jeff Bezos at Amazon.  The Innovator's Dilemma is an absolute classic business book  and describes a dilemma that every modern tech company  faces, the difficulty of innovating  when you've got a successful product.  It's tough to do.  And then also a little bit closer and nearer  and dearer to our heart, Leila Janna,  who was an amazing entrepreneur,  working hard to make AI more equitable,  passed away at the age of 37 of complications.  Do you know what happened?  Yeah, cancer, epithelioid carcinoma or sarcoma.  She had fallen ill a couple of years ago.  We interviewed her on triangulation, there you go,  about 2017, I think, and she was just such an impressive,  such a smart and talented person.  So very sorry for her friends and family.  Leila Janna passed away way too young.  And of course, Terry Jones,  Monty Python's Terry Jones passed away at the age of 77.  Graham Chapman passed away about 20 years ago in 85.  Actually, so gosh, that's almost 40 years ago.

Start time: 8567.82
End time: 8582.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And also I would watch out for the,  hopefully they'll release footage of the funeral  because if you watch Graham Chapman's funeral,  I've seen it with John Cleese's.  John Cleese's eulogy to him is just marvelous.  You cannot watch it without tears in their eyes  and their tears of laughter.  It's just genius.

Start time: 8583.06
End time: 8585.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm sure he will do the same for Terry Jones.

Start time: 8585.46
End time: 8587.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Terry was a very naughty boy.

Start time: 8589.17
End time: 8592.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, passed away at the age of 77.  He had suffered from dementia.

Start time: 8592.76
End time: 8595.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He got prefrontal dementia,  so it was kind of a blessing in a way.  Yeah.

Start time: 8597.70
End time: 8605.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's about it.  Is there anything else you want to cover, Patrick?  Did I miss any of the big stories in your world?

Start time: 8607.36
End time: 8614.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it's a huge story,  but there is a question about Vine coming back.

Start time: 8614.22
End time: 8676.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you gonna, I downloaded it right away, Bite.  Vine's coming back.  Well, the guy who, okay, Vine, what a sad story that is.  The guy who started Vine,  actually, they had a couple of founders, one of the guys,  Vine was sold to Twitter,  which killed it almost instantly  because Vine creators went to Twitter and said,  we want to be compensated because we're making your product,  we're making a success, and Twitter said, absolutely not.  So they all pulled out.  And Twitter ended up killing Vine  very, very quickly in 2017.  Dom Hoffman, who's one of the co-founders,  has been saying, I'm gonna bring Vine back  after months in closed beta.  It is back now on Android and iOS.  It's called Bite, B-Y-T-E.  Unlike, it's a little late,  because TikTok is pretty much taking the Vine mantle,  but Bite is limited to six second videos like Vine was.  And, you know, I downloaded it.

Start time: 8676.26
End time: 8690.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really is exactly Vine,  and I don't know that it's going to,  because Vine did have, for some reason,  I wasn't a huge fan, but it did have a community.  It was very creative.  Like 60 million people or something, I think.

Start time: 8690.76
End time: 8697.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and Vine created some big, big stars  who have gone on to stardom on YouTube  and other places I'm playing.

Start time: 8697.22
End time: 8699.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Twitter killed it because server space is expensive.

Start time: 8699.58
End time: 8718.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they killed it because all the creators left.  They killed it because they wouldn't  give the creators any money.  By the way, Dom has learned a little bit from that.  And TikTok, which does share revenue  and has lots of ways for creators to profit,  will apparently do the same thing.  So a partner program is coming soon.

Start time: 8719.38
End time: 8729.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think that one of the complaints  of TikTok users is that it's hard to monetize,  which is why so many of them go to take their TikTok videos  and they put them on YouTube for monetization.

Start time: 8729.36
End time: 8756.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always going to be a problem.  Yeah.  And you live on these platforms and you die on these platforms  and you hope that these platforms will compensate you.  YouTube isn't much better.  I look at so many people pour their life,  their blood into YouTube and make no money at all.  Yeah.  But they revere the 20 people like the eight-year-old  you talk about who are making millions of dollars a year.  But it's hard to get to that position.  Well, usually it's not through YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, unfortunately, I was a week later on this,  but the invention of the laser printer died.  I don't know if you covered this in last week's show.  No, we did not.  But that was a sad one.  The obituaries are never fun.  But yeah.

Start time: 8789.44
End time: 8793.49

Start time: 8794.66
End time: 8807.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're getting on.  I know.  We've had the co-founder of ARPANET die in the last six  months.  And if I could get the time and the money,  I would just spend a year going around all these first movers  into the field and do it all over history.

Start time: 8807.58
End time: 8836.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, that's been the point of my career back at Tech TV  and here with Triangulation was to talk  to as many of those people and get them on tape,  get video of them so that a record would be kept.  Because in the early days, they weren't lionized,  they weren't revered, they weren't famous.  They just were amazing inventors who actually  changed the world.  And in years to come, people will look back  at people like Douglas Engelbart and say, wow, or Alan Kay.  And so it's important.  We who know who they are remember them.

Start time: 8836.98
End time: 8839.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 8841.08

Start time: 8854.40
End time: 8864.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have to be quite careful at the Reg because we have  sort of near to the knuckle headlines.  When I heard about that, I was just, do we do runs out  of toner or is that too strong?

End time: 8884.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we did it with one of the founders of the IBM PC  and it's like when Blue Screen all goes and disc her a reading  drive C.  But my favorite was in Gary Gygax, the inventor of  Dungeons and Dragons when he passed on.  And the headline was Gary Gygax's failed saving throw.  Anyone who's ever played will appreciate that.

Transcript:  Have you talked about Octi on any of your shows?  Octi is basically an AR app that pivoted to become  a social network.  So basically what works now is you, after you've established  a friend connection on the Octi app, you walk up to them,  you hold your phone and on the phone the content they have  posted is orbiting around their body.  Oh man, I love this.  So you can tap on something and get their music that  they're playing or their status update or whatever.  It's a little weird because you're standing right there.  That's kind of brilliant.  Yeah, but I mean I think for high school students,  stuff like that, it's a way to basically carry your social  networking around in physical space.
