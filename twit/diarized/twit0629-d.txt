She is at, interestingly enough, took Paul Thuratt's job at the SuperSight for Windows.

Transcript:  There was a gap. Okay. There wasn't. She didn't push him out.  Anyways, great to meet you, Lisa, and have you on here. EIC at SuperSight for Windows.  And she's also, of course, at The Incomparable with us. Also the technologizer. And you two know each other, Harry McCracken.  We met a couple months ago.  Yeah, you were here a couple months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a wide circle of people in common as it turns out.

Start time: 179.72
End time: 184.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Many former colleagues who were each other's former colleagues and friends and associates.  IDG Borg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Mark Millian from Bloomberg was scheduled to be here.  But Mark says, I can't come today. I'll be watching the wire.  He probably has a wire machine in his living room and he's waiting for the five bell alert.  Remember those? Did you ever work with a telephone?  No.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. That would mean a presidential like big thing like a five bell alert.  We are all waiting because today the Uber board meets to name a successor to Travis Kalanick.  And what's interesting is last week we talked about Jeff Immelt, CEO of GE, former CEO, who was widely expected to take the job.  He tweeted this morning at 847. Oh, I'm sorry. I took it off the screen. I'm not doing it.  There we go.  That's not a flattering picture. I'm going to just say that right now. That's on recode.  And I think Kara Swisher. Oh, no, it was somebody else.  Kara wrote it.  It was Kara. Yeah, Kara chose it for sure. We know Kara.

Start time: 243.30
End time: 247.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're no longer vying for that job, does that mean you would turn it down if offered?

Start time: 248.86
End time: 252.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what's interesting because now the front runner is somebody who has turned it down.

Start time: 253.14
End time: 256.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She said she would. She said Meg Whitman will not be the next Uber CEO.

Start time: 257.06
End time: 328.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it turns out if you read, for instance, the Wall Street Journal, she has met with the board.  She met with him yesterday and made a presentation to them.  And what Kara is assuming and I think others are is that she made some demands.  I'm sure the Uber board would like a woman CEO, given that a lot of the reasons Travis is gone is because of this rampant sexism and harassment.  It's the optics of it. It's been such a kind of combative company, partly because it had to be in order to succeed in towns where the local government and the taxi commission and the taxi drivers just didn't want Uber to exist.  So I think that that was kind of part of their startup nature, this kind of pugnacious, we're going to do it anyway.  But it did not help that a number of people started to talk about harassment, corporate culture that really was bad for women.  And of course, Susan J. Fowler wrote that blog post earlier this year that really blew the lid off and ended up taking down Travis Kalanick.  Whitman's after tweeting last month, I'm not going anywhere.  Whitman's demands apparently are that A, Travis B, nothing more than a founder. He's on the board right now.

Start time: 328.64
End time: 332.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he seems like he is angling to maybe come back someday or be a shadow CEO.

Start time: 333.00
End time: 364.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is worse than Game of Thrones. He's been kind of he's been writing letters to Uber employees saying, you know, maybe would you kind of like to start a grassroots movement to bring me back?  You said he was going to be Steve Jobs. It's well, if you have to remember when he was knocked out, there was a petition circulated over at least a thousand people sign it saying, no, we can't be over without our founder.  Founder has a lot of loyalty, I imagine, especially among the people he had interested to see the breakdown.

Start time: 364.04
End time: 375.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is not in a persecution way. I would be interested to see the breakdown who signed the petition, what level of employment they're at.  I'd also like to see the breakdown, demographically speaking, between men and women.

Start time: 376.02
End time: 377.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think there are any women left?

Start time: 378.04
End time: 396.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. Well, there's Bosma St. John now, who was a very, oh, Bosma is beautiful and wonderful and strong hire.  And if you take a look at what they're doing now, where they've got the driver friendly features and the tips, she's I get the sense that she's behind pushing a lot of these stories out to try to change the Uber narrative to one where we're better for drivers, drivers have more control.

Start time: 397.14
End time: 409.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hire a strong, powerful woman of color to be the front person to say, no, this is not the Uber that you think it is.  She came to our attention first when she was working at Apple and she was so good.

Start time: 410.02
End time: 431.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agency background because the experience that she had before she came to Apple was she did branding and campaigns for Pepsi, right?  Moved into music development and that contact brought her into Apple's music business.  But you're talking about somebody who has decades of professional experience figuring out how to construct a campaign and how to lay down very simple talking points that resonate with people.

Start time: 432.38
End time: 441.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love her Twitter bio. There's nothing more badass than being who you are.  I am a force of nature in fierce stilettos.  Chief brand officer at Uber.

Start time: 443.16
End time: 452.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she lost her husband to cancer a couple of years ago, so she's been doing all of this while also being a single mother.  Oh, my gosh.  And I follow her on both Twitter and Instagram.  I adore her.  She knocked me out at that Apple event.

Start time: 453.24
End time: 460.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was Apple was famous for not having any women on stage and then all of a sudden they've got Bozema St. John on there and it was like, wow, who's this?  Yeah, let's see more of her.

Start time: 461.92
End time: 496.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was a really strong brand ambassador and it was a big I wouldn't call it big loss for Apple because Apple's good at building a deep bench of talent.  But she brought something to Apple that I think they're going to have to work very hard to try and find again.  And she's been really proactive with the press with regards to Uber saying, yes, I'm going to come in.  This is a good company.  I believe in what it's doing.  We're going to take steps to address complaints.  And here's where we're going.  And I was looking at the tech crunch story talking about Uber adding more driver friendly features and hitting 50 million tips.  And some of the talking points in this story from tech crunch 50 million sounds like a lot.

Start time: 496.58
End time: 500.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, until you realize that they probably that was on a billion dollars in rides.  So what they say.

Start time: 501.00
End time: 525.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the talking points.  I have a feeling got drifted out from Uber and put into the story is like, oh, 50 million.  And just a few weeks is great because Lyft has had the tip feature for years and only hit 250 million tips this year.  So what they're implying is that Uber's users have been responsive to this in a way that Lyft's users are not.  And they're also implying that Uber's drivers are getting tips because, oh, they're so great.  And dying to tip them. This is so great for the drivers.

Start time: 525.24
End time: 534.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, which is really kind of misrepresenting it because Uber for years pretended that you didn't have to tip the tip implied.  I always thought this was somehow included.

Start time: 534.61
End time: 536.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a selling point for the service.

Start time: 536.16
End time: 543.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. No tipping. You don't need to tip.  And in fact, it was just you weren't tipping.  I felt like a jerk when I found out that, no, they're not getting anything.

Start time: 543.34
End time: 551.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm still not sure how much you should tip, by the way.  Well, like I use Lyft and they suggest a dollar as one option, which that's definitely not 20 percent of any ride.

Start time: 552.14
End time: 587.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uber now for a long time, Uber didn't put it in the app, which meant that you had to have cash to tip, which was again, not really a good way of supporting it.  They actually were ordered by a court to allow the drivers to ask for tips.  They were not allowing them ask for tips.  As soon as that court order happened, people start putting up little signs in their Uber, some drivers anyway, saying it's OK to tip me.  I felt terrible. I over tipped for the first few months just because I felt so bad I hadn't been tipping.  Now it's in the app. And you're right. They suggest three dollars, just like Lyft, three dollar amounts.  And I don't think it's very high compared to what I would normally tip a cab.

Start time: 587.46
End time: 592.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you take a New York cab, the options they give you are like 15 percent, 25 percent, 58 percent.

Start time: 595.72
End time: 598.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it goes up and down depending on the time of day.

Start time: 598.94
End time: 610.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always over tip cabbies because I feel like that's a hard job. They're underpaid.  They have to pay a lot of money, especially Uber drivers for gas. They have to pay for all the expenses of it.  I always give them a good tip.

Start time: 611.00
End time: 625.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Uber story here is interesting with the we're empowering you to drive and set your routes and things like that,  because one of the data points I've noticed in my last few Lyft rides is there's an almost adversarial relationship between the drivers and the app you have to use.

Start time: 626.00
End time: 627.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take this street. Don't go that way.

Start time: 628.08
End time: 659.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But every there was a case where I was coming home from an airport is very late at night.  My driver couldn't pull up a route on his app. And I said, well, it's because I'll tell you.  Well, you've started a pizzeria in Emeryville. So that explains a whole lot right there.  And he's like, no, no, it's the app. The app doesn't know what it's doing.  And I was walking him through the steps to get back to my house.  But the whole 35 minutes home, he was just ranting about how awful the app was and how it's unhelpful and how it sends in places he wouldn't want to go.  And it was not the first time I've had that experience.

Start time: 660.00
End time: 662.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it was his fault, though, or the app's fault? Sounds like it was his fault.

Start time: 663.16
End time: 672.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never discount an end user problem. But what I have noticed is there seems to be more adversarial relationships between the drivers and the tools they're being expected to use.

Start time: 673.50
End time: 681.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every time I take a Lyft or an Uber, I ask the driver, and drivers seem to like driving for Lyft better, don't they? Or is that just my experience?

Start time: 681.20
End time: 695.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They seem to. A heck of a lot of them drive for both.  Yeah, almost everybody.  And if you ask them, they seem to typically say that Lyft is easier to work with.  I don't know whether that's still true, given that Uber has been doing at least some more driver-friendly stuff lately.

Start time: 697.20
End time: 783.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of our producers, as an experiment in reporting, applied for a job at Uber to drive and was surprised that they never asked to inspect his car.  They never asked to even see his car. It was a pretty easy process becoming an Uber driver.  Not a lot of background checks and all of that stuff.  Lyft apparently is a little more assiduous about looking at the car, inspecting the car, and making sure the car is safe.  Anyway, we're going to probably... So Mark Millian stayed home to cover the session of perhaps Meg Whitman, the CEO at Uber.  We will keep an eye on that and let you know if a decision is made.  The board is meeting right now.  Apparently Whitman met with them yesterday and said, Travis can't be on the board. He can't be breathing down my neck.  He will have a role as a founder. I'll consult him.  She also... Where are the other conditions? You had that article up, Carsten, earlier.  I'm just going to see if I can find the other conditions.  She was pretty clear that she was willing... It sounded like she was clear that she was willing to do it if Uber would agree to go along with it.  Kara Swisher predicted before the tweet that Emelt withdrew himself. Here's the... Kara's been the cover.  She's replaced her Yahoo scoops with Uber scoops.

Start time: 783.00
End time: 785.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Yahoo at this point is...

Start time: 785.06
End time: 811.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what are you going to write about Yahoo?  She says that... Kara writes, let's just say Whitman's driving the car, deciding on the route, not paying for the gas.  She apparently wants a lot of control over... She wants a new board and wide latitude over who she hires.  But you would ask for that, especially if you're coming into a fairly challenging role.

Start time: 812.50
End time: 829.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the problem is institutional culture from the top on down, then yeah, you're going to say, I'm not walking into this house unless I have an ironclad guarantee to clean it as I see fit and then fill it up again as I see fit.  You're not going to come in and say, oh, everybody here, that's just fine. Sure, I'll just be your CEO.

Start time: 830.38
End time: 841.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So she also says Whitman was worried about other undiscovered problems.  And that's a reasonable thing to worry about because for a while there was a story every week about stuff.

Start time: 842.70
End time: 849.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently there is a third candidate, though, who Kara at least has not identified yet as the last time I checked.

Start time: 849.00
End time: 851.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A woman or a man? I think a man.

Start time: 852.71
End time: 853.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was a guy, I guess.

Start time: 854.86
End time: 863.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how... Mae Whitman is not necessarily considered a great CEO. She was CEO at eBay, right, for a while.

Start time: 863.50
End time: 870.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was CEO at eBay from the time it was tiny until it became a huge company.  Practically a founder.  Yeah, almost. Not quite.

Start time: 871.78
End time: 877.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then went to HP. Okay, I'm looking at you, Harry. How good a CEO is Mae Whitman?

Start time: 879.30
End time: 896.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, eBay is still a pretty impressive story overall, I think.  She built a good company.  She turned something tiny into something huge, which is one of the few Internet companies from 20 years ago that still matters.  Cough, cough, cough.  With HP, I mean...

Start time: 897.72
End time: 898.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She ran for president in 2008.

Start time: 901.22
End time: 905.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, she ran for governor. She was the Republican nominee for governor of California.

Start time: 906.36
End time: 908.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, yes. And she lost to Jerry Brown.

Start time: 909.00
End time: 914.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  During her HP tenure, wasn't she responsible for overseeing the split of the company into services and hardware?

Start time: 915.60
End time: 933.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She took over a very troubled company. Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, had really done some terrible things, including acquire a company that had really no value at all, and spending billions for it. That was a huge flop.  And so I think you could say she turned around HP. The split was a success, too, I would be willing to say.

Start time: 934.32
End time: 944.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the last few years of HP have been the least disastrous HP years in a while.  Okay, I call that a success.  Because they had so many problems and so many CEOs before that.

Start time: 944.36
End time: 961.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a good market position, too, to explicitly separate out services from hardware because she recognized at a pretty crucial point that hardware was going to be a commodity spend from now on, whereas services can be a continuous revenue flow if you do it right.  So it was smart to isolate out two different models and say, okay, let's see how to grow revenue in two different ways in two different companies.

Start time: 966.10
End time: 973.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wonder, I mean, really, if that wasn't the fallout of the HP Compact merger, which was considered one of the worst mergers in technology of all time.

Start time: 973.14
End time: 1001.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they doubled down on PCs in 2001.  That was not under her, by the way.  No. That was under Carly Fiorina, who's another HP person who was the senatorial nominee in the run for president.  So they doubled down on PCs, which even if it made sense at the time, it only made sense for a little while.  And the closer we got to the smartphone era, the less that was valuable.

Start time: 1002.10
End time: 1011.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The irony is that the HP's PC division is knocking it out of the park in the last two years.  The designs and the quality have been stellar, a big improvement.

Start time: 1011.54
End time: 1031.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're the most important company in a troubled industry, essentially, in an industry which is probably destined to shrink a little bit.  And years ago, I mean, HP, they did phones, they bought Palm, they made TVs, they did all kinds of consumer electronics, most of which fell by the wayside rather quickly.

Start time: 1031.26
End time: 1035.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they do a smart kitchen appliance way back in the audience? They tried a prototype of something like that?  Probably.

Start time: 1036.08
End time: 1043.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember the Audrey. Was that one of theirs?  Yes. Was it there?  Audrey was, I want to say, three times.  Was it three common?  Cisco? Yeah, it was three common that was required by Cisco.  There are all those things.

Start time: 1044.59
End time: 1046.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have a graveyard behind you of all the other things.

Start time: 1046.22
End time: 1052.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. You should see my office. You haven't seen my office. The graveyard is behind me. I have everything. I don't have an Audrey.  The companies of Boomscast.  If anybody wants to send me an Audrey.

Start time: 1053.44
End time: 1055.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure if the Audrey ever actually shipped or not.

Start time: 1057.38
End time: 1093.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, the Echo Home is the modern-day Audrey, and it does everything ten times better.  So you actually, if I look at her tenure, she started at eBay when it had 30 employees, a revenue of $4 million.  She took it to 15,000 employees and $8 billion in revenue. She was a huge success, I think it's safe to say, at eBay.  I think she took over a troubled HP and if it didn't, if not turned it around, at least made it viable.  So I think she's probably a very good candidate to do something. And she's my age. She's 60.  So it's not likely she would have a long tenure at Uber.

Start time: 1094.22
End time: 1098.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the argument is that she's both a growth artist and a turnaround artist.  Yeah, she's got the skills.

Start time: 1100.19
End time: 1102.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And she's a tough cookie, which I think they need right now.

Start time: 1103.08
End time: 1129.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She stepped down as chairman of the board of directors at HP in July, but she's still the CEO of HP Enterprise.  So she would have to leave HP to do this, although she says, I am fully committed to HP Enterprise,  I plan to remain the company's CEO. We have a lot of work to do. I'm not going anywhere.  It's a lot like the people who protest. I'm like Mark Zuckerberg. I'm not running for president. I like, you know, until they do.

Start time: 1129.88
End time: 1132.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how much of this messaging is to preserve stock prices or to keep investors happy?

Start time: 1133.50
End time: 1137.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Precisely. Well, the Uber transition is all about stock prices.

Start time: 1138.22
End time: 1138.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're valuation.

Start time: 1139.30
End time: 1214.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or not stock price, because they're not public, but.  Valuation.  Investors and valuation. I mean, there's a lot of money been sunk into Uber.  And frankly, I have to say, if I were thinking about taking over Uber,  I'd be more concerned not so much about sexual harassment and the bro culture, but about runway.  Because Uber right now subsidizes every ride to the tune of 59 percent.  Forty one percent is what you pay. The rest comes out of Uber.  In effect, they're spending billions of dollars to lose billions of dollars.  And I don't know, they have a lot of money. They've raised a lot of money, but I don't know how much runway they have.  It can't be more than a few years. At some point, they're either going to have to go back to investors and say,  you know that hundred billion dollars you gave us, can we have more?  Or they're going to run out of time. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.  It's self-driving cars. One of the ways they get this price.  They can't raise prices. People use Uber because it's cheaper, but they can eliminate one of the big costs, which is drivers.  And I know they're working very hard on self-driving cars.  In fact, I would guess that really the most of the investment money is not all about replacing taxi cabs.  It's all about replacing drivers.

And they are only now beginning to reckon with the scope of all of the safety features that are going to have to be regulated and what the acceptable parameters for safety for everyone are going to be.

Kara says, my bet, she will get what she wants.  So that's maybe what the board is deciding right now is do we give her all of that?  How important is it to maintain a solid board and to keep Travis happy compared to keeping the investors happy?  One of the reasons this is really important, and Travis had to step down, is big investors, big institutional investors like Fidelity were saying,  we're not sure we want to be in this company anymore.

Transcript:  This is tough.  All right, we're going to take a break.  This is going to be a breaking story we'll continue to cover.  And I actually have a tweet deck search filter on Uber CEO, and it's actually pretty funny.  It's interesting to watch.  I'm thrilled to have you both here.  And Mark Millian, Mark's doing what we're doing, which is watching this.  Twitter's the place where you would watch this, right?  So where else would you go nowadays to keep an eye on breaking news?  You watch it on Twitter, right?  So as much as I diss Twitter, I think it still has some significant value, at least for covering tech news stories.  Great to have Lisa Schmeiser here.  She's editor-in-chief of the SuperSight for Windows, windsupersight.com, Harry McCracken, the technologizer.  And what is your title now?  Technology editor.  Technology editor for Fast Company.  Nice.  Our show today brought to you by a technology I use and love and have been getting more thrilled with at all times.  It's IRO.  I first tried IRO, gosh, maybe two years ago when it was the first of the mesh Wi-Fi solutions and was very happy with it.  I tried them all.  And then IRO came out with their newest second generation IRO and the IRO beacons.  And I flipped my lid.  So IRO now, the second generation IRO, they've learned and they've gotten it's twice as fast.  It's tri-band.  The beacons plug into the wall so they're easy to install.  They also have a nice nightlight feature, which I really, really like.  It's very easy to set up the IRO.  You can do it in minutes.  You get your IRO, you plug it into your router.  Actually, it's going to replace your router if you can.  You can use it with a router, but I would plug it in to the cable modem or the DSL modem, make it be the router.  It does a better job.  Then you fire up the app on your iOS or Android device and it walks you through installing the two beacons,  which spread the Wi-Fi throughout the house, about 1,500 square feet per IRO device.  So this is big enough to do a 4,500 square foot house.  And if you want to add more, you can get out to the pool and everywhere.  And I have to say, IRO has transformed my experience of Wi-Fi.  If you have the experience of Wi-Fi bogging down, stalling, buffering, not working right,  devices having a hard time joining it, devices sometimes joining the neighbor's Wi-Fi,  you've got to take a look at eero.com.  The second generation IRO and IRO beacon are even better.  More speed, more range.  The third 5 gigahertz radio means you get not only more bandwidth, but more places to put content.  So if you're going to watch Game of Thrones streaming tonight,  you're going to really wish you had an IRO.  The new Thread radio built into the IRO can connect low-power devices, locks, doorbells, and other sensors.  Thread is the new standard for Internet of Things devices.  And it's very easy to isolate your Internet of Things devices.  Or if you've got guests, set up a guest Wi-Fi network to keep them off your main network.  So security is paramount.  And I should show you my IRO app.  Actually, I don't have it with me, but it's probably too small to show you on the iPhone.  But with the IRO, you can name every device in your house,  and assign them to a user.  So I've got my devices.  Michael has his devices.  Our kid.  And if it's time for Michael to go to bed, it's the easiest thing in the world.  I can do this on my Echo, by the way.  I can say, Echo, pause Michael's Wi-Fi, and he's offline.  He has to go to bed.  Or I can do it right from the family profiles on the IRO app.  I just press the pause button.  It doesn't affect me.  It only affects my wife.  It doesn't affect me.  It only affects Michael.  There's also fantastic, this is something new, IRO Plus,  and I pay a subscription fee for this.  It's well worth it, filters.  So I can say Michael's devices are blocked from adult content.  They have to use SafeSearch.  And ours not, maybe.  But all of our devices are protected against malware.  This is fantastic.  You can schedule pauses.  So I have a schedule that says after 10 p.m., between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.,  Michael can't use the Wi-Fi.  He's got to go to bed and go get some sleep.  Any house with teenagers in it will really appreciate that.  IRO, free overnight shipping in the U.S. or Canada.  Go to IRO.com.  And all you have to do is select overnight shipping at checkout  and use Twit as the offer code, and that will make it absolutely free.  You're going to want it.  You're going to want it.

Lisa Schmeiser, the Supersighter, the incomparabler.  You need a nickname.  I do.  Everybody has to have a nickname.  So I loved this, and it really isn't that big a story.  But you always hear on the autonomous vehicles, what do they call it?  The trolley scenario where...  Do you know what I'm talking about?  No, I do not.  Okay.  It's kind of...  I don't want to be...  Okay, cars driving down the road, and there's a bunch of these.  You have a choice.  Oh, do you kill the one person or the other person?  Do you kill one person?  Okay, so you're driving down the road.  You're going to have an accident.  You can either plow into a trolley car and kill everybody, 20 people,  or plow into that beautiful mother and their little baby girl  walking across the street.  What do you do?  What will you do?  Now, a human, I don't know.  But people say, I disagree with this, people say,  well, we've got to tell self-driving vehicles what to do, right?  In my opinion, what you tell the self-driving vehicle...

Anyway, Germany's decided...  The register headline is fantastic.  Kill animals and destroy property before hurting humans,  Germany tells future self-driving cars.  That's kind of what they said.  In Wednesday, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure  announced it's going to implement guidelines devised by a panel of experts.  Experts, folks, not amateurs.  Expert animal killers?  Experts.  Expert property insurers.  14 scientists and legal eggheads, according to the register.  And there are 20 rules.  I know, I love the register.  They're so snarky.  I want legal egghead as a job title.

Transcript:  So, okay, so again, in my opinion, if you're...  And if you, by the way, if anybody designs autonomous vehicle software,  please call me, come here, tell me I'm wrong.  It strikes me what you do is you don't make a rule about what to hit or what not to hit.  You say drive as well as you can, try not to hit anything.  Just try not to hit anything.  And if you do, it's an accident, just like a human.  No human is saying, I think I'll drive off the cliff rather than run into that trolley.  No human's doing that.  You're going to try to not hit anything.

I'm serious. I keep a stack of those in the car.  I used to get carsick as a kid.  It's awful.  And I have to drive me in the whole nine yards.

Transcript:  Yeah, until we found... But I was thinking about this and I thought,  well, this is the thing about driving cars and making rules about animals.  Animals don't behave predictably or logarithmically.  You have to be able to write software that can respond to each individual movement and try to predict how much longer they're going to be.  Well, I think software could do it better than a human, right?

Start time: 1844.06
End time: 1849.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 1874.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A self-driving car will do a better job.  And I think, frankly, in most cases, a self-driving car is going to do a better job than a human because humans have expectations.  Oh, that guy's not going to hit me or whatever.  Bambi's going to run.  Oh, look, it ran away and it came back.

If a situation on the road goes south and it looks as though an accident is going to happen,  the vehicle must save humans from death or injury.  And this is the key.

We brought in staff.  Because what we do with live streams, we sit there, we talk about the live stream.  The live stream, well, I can show you the live stream.  There wasn't much to it.  It was a stage in a park in New York City.  And the curtains opened.  And a giant Oreo-shaped robot appeared.  And that was it!  Nobody took the stage.  There was no Bozema St. John to say how wonderful Android Oreo was.  There it is.  That's the video.  I felt so bad for Jason.  That's it.  We brought you in.  It's an Oreo.

Transcript:  It was launched as a competitor to Hydrox.  Hydrox which pre-existed.  Which is a terrible name, but a delicious cookie.  Although I find Hydrox's, and maybe I'm wrong, are often imperfect.  Whereas Oreos tend to be perfect.  Do you ever find... like the Hydrox...  Do you eat a lot of both?  No, I'm just saying.  From my memories as a child, the Hydrox's sometimes were a little whopper-jawed.  You know, like to be on an uneven layer of filling.  But the Oreos always seem to have...  It may be because Oreo, Nabisco, and its food scientist Sam Porcello have five patents for the Oreos.  Porcello retired in 1993.  And... oh, this is good.  In the early 90s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.  Now we know the lard's safer.  Bring back the lard!

And I'm sure there are a lot of people running out to buy Oreos.  I don't like it when frankly Google uses a brand name.  I felt like we were kind of willy-nilly forced to advertise for KitKats.  Now we're forced to advertise for Oreo.  But really when you get to O, there aren't a lot of choices.  You could just call it Android O.  I thought they might do that.

And apparently we will at some point, at least on the Pixels, get the update to O.  You can if you're in a hurry do the public beta.  And if you do that, you'll get the official version of O.  Let me just check to see. I've been checking.  I mean literally every day since Monday.  So that was Monday. Wednesday. Was it Wednesday or Tuesday?  It was Tuesday. It was when? Wednesday.  Wednesday. You know what I'm going here.  Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 8.  No cookies. Just 8.  No cookies, no flames.  But a Bixby button, which really disappoints me.  But this is a phone that really hasn't had a great history in the last year because of the Note 7.  I think very important to Samsung's future.  And anything that either of you have anything to say about it?

Start time: 2676.36
End time: 2716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at a couple Samsung events over the last year and they've been really forthright about saying,  yes, our phones have been bursting into flames.  Yeah, to their credit. They didn't deny it.  They've been really upfront about it, which is probably the best strategy.  And what I have also noticed is that the Samsung Note phones really have an ardent following.  Yes, I am one of them. I've had every Note phones as it came out.  And so the chatter I've heard with this coming out has been, hooray, a new phone.  Hopefully this will burst into flames.  The price point is a little bit concerning because we're looking at a thousand dollar smartphone.  But that's where we're trending now, I guess.

Start time: 2716.00
End time: 2738.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I met with the president of Samsung Electronics North America.  He started by showing me a video of Note owners talking about how much they love their Notes.  Now they're looking forward to this one.  And he also said, he did not mention the name Apple, but he said that the two companies that dominate the smartphone market  are both going to have these high-end flagship phones coming out at about the same time.

Start time: 2739.58
End time: 2750.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they both also have extraordinarily devoted customer bases too.  So I get the sense that this is kind of an experiment to see exactly how much people are willing to pay  for a very powerful tiny computer that can also make phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the Note brand will survive its problems.  I agree.  There are all these people who didn't buy one last year.  And so they're stuck with a two-year-old Note and this one.  I got some hands on time with that.  Oh, did you?  For the most part, it's very nice.  It's very similar to the Galaxy S8.  I don't like the fingerprint.  That's the big downside.  It's on the back next to the camera.  That's a mistake, which I assume they will correct on the next ones.

Start time: 2785.04
End time: 2786.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised they didn't correct it this time.

Start time: 2787.00
End time: 2797.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But other than that, it's beautiful.  The edge-to-edge screen is nice.  Every time they come out with a new one, they improve the pen a little bit, the S Pen.

Start time: 2798.40
End time: 2803.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the biggest differentiator in the Note, besides screen size, and that's less of a differentiator these days,  it's 6.3 inches.  The S8 Plus is 6.2 inches.

Start time: 2805.00
End time: 2817.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the Galaxy line comes in large, even larger, even a little bit larger than that,  which is different than the old days when there was a very clear dividing line between the Galaxy S and the Note line.  The pen is a differentiator.

Start time: 2818.58
End time: 2833.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the third differentiator this year is the camera.  It's going to have the dual lens system.  It's going to be able to do what Apple does later after the picture in software mode, the portrait mode,  but it's going to be able to do it live with a slider, which I think is really cool.  You can adjust the blurriness.

Start time: 2834.00
End time: 2857.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has optical image stabilization on both ones.  In both lenses.  No one does that.  When I met with them, they had this cool box where they have a fake scene with a fake woman in front of a fake background,  and they have a Galaxy Note and an iPhone 7 Plus, and then they have a switch on the box where they can make the box vibrate.  So they made the box vibrate, and they took pictures with both phones.

Start time: 2873.62
End time: 2937.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I like it because a lot of times on these events, they show on the screen, but you saw it happen in real time,  and that's a little more encouraging.  I have to say the thing about the event that I liked the best was the box, but it was the giant box that the presenters were on.  We didn't realize this at first.  It looked like just a giant stage.  I couldn't think why the stage was so big until I realized it was screens.  And they were standing on screens backed by two giant screens, and the effect was quite dramatic.  Let me see if I can, I might have to skip to, this is DJ, here we go.  So that's the stage.  The phones look like they're coming out of the stage, and the people on the stage look like just little tiny, this was a really nice effect.  I expect we'll see more of these in other keynotes, but look at that.  Isn't that not remarkable?  He's walking on water now.  The following day, the vice chairman of Samsung Korea was sentenced to five years in jail.

Start time: 2937.00

Start time: 2950.32
End time: 2988.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is, so Samsung is a family run business.  His father, Lee Jae Young's father was, still is the chairman, but had a heart attack in the spring and was incapacitated.  So even though Lee Jae Young is the vice chairman, he's running Samsung.  They'll appeal no doubt, so we'll have some a little more time without going to jail, I guess, but five years in jail would be devastating.  And the reason it's a big story, I think I've been told in South Korea is this is unheard of.  Traditionally, these guys running big mass, I mean, Samsung is 17% of South Korea's GDP.  It's a huge part of their economy.  Traditionally, these companies have been immune from this kinds of prosecution.

Transcript:  Well, earlier in the summer, there were lots of people wondering whether their schedules were slipping,  and they might be talking more like October or even later for the $1,000 flagship phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell you one thing, Apple does not...  Labor Day is on a Monday, Apple is not going to have an event on Tuesday.  They've never done that, even though Tuesday is their normal day,  because they don't want employees to have to work on Labor Day weekend to get ready for an event.  So if it's the first week, it would be September, it would be a Wednesday or Thursday, 6th or 7th.  Failing that, it would be on the following Tuesday, the assumption is.  And we haven't seen signage or anything.  They haven't blacked out the Urbana Center, where they normally have it, or Flint Center.

Transcript:  We'll see. One of the reasons, Mark Gurman had that scoop on last week,  but one of the reasons people think that is that some people have seen in their stored movies 4K options,  and there's no Apple TV that plays 4K currently, so that's possibly it.  An updated TV app that might have live TV? Apple's really been wanting to do that, right?  Become a cable box, in effect.  I trust Mark Gurman, and he seems to be thinking all of the above.  So we shall see. It's that season.  And then, by the way, we'll still be waiting for the Essential Phone at that time.  I ordered it a week ago. I ordered it 10 days ago. They said, oh, it'll be a week.  Nothing, not even shipped, nothing.  And then yesterday I got the email saying, oh, do you want that camera that goes on, the 360 camera?  I said, sure, why not? Add insult to injury. Let me give you another 50 bucks.  At some point, that will come, and a lot of interest in that.  And then the rumor is, according to Richard Gow at Android Police,  that Google will wait until October 5th to announce, actually this comes from Evelikes,  October 5th to announce the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL.  Seems some strong indication the Pixel 2 will be made by HTC, the Pixel 2 XL will be made by LG.  Might look a lot like the LG LE30, which is coming out soon as well.  And here's an interesting story. Everything else is going to have a Snapdragon 835, including the Note 8.  Google may scoop that with an 836.  Ev says 836, and Evelikes is usually pretty good.

End time: 3327.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think this is actually one of my ongoing, and I'll fairly admit this is one of my ongoing challenges  with keeping on top of Android as a market.  What the hell is the difference?  It's difficult to find someplace that collects all of the information to explain the hardware  and the iteration of Android that is running on it to tell you,  do you want a phone that's faster, or do you want a phone that is more responsive?  Do you want a phone that does this? Do you want a phone that does that?  And so when you're like, oh, it's a different chip.  And, well, what does that mean? Does that mean that the phone is faster?  Does that mean that it processes better?

Start time: 3328.48
End time: 3412.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The stories I've seen say that the 836 is a minor upgrade and not a big jump to the 835.  As its name suggests.  The 845 is for next year, and that will be a bigger jump.  Qualcomm, which makes these chips, says that they're going, let's see, they're on a 10 nanometer FinFET,  which is pretty interesting for the 835.  I don't know if they can get any smaller than that.  So I'm not sure what, oh, yep, seven nanometers.  When you get to zero, let me know, right?  Seven nanometers.  What are we going to have, petameters? What's next after nanometers?  That's a billionth of a meter.  I could probably look it up on Wikipedia, but anyway, it's a thousand whatever that is.  All right, now I'm going to look it up. Now you got me.  Let's see, you got a millimeter.  You got a centimeter.  You got a, huh?  Let's see.  You got a meter.  Nano, milli, centi.  What is next?  So these are littler.  Decis, centi, milli, micro, nano, picometer.  So a thousand picometers would be one nanometer.

End time: 3471.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, you're pretty much hard pressed to get a non-Qualcomm chip because they own the CDMA patents,  which means if you want to support the CDMA on your phone, you're going to be using a Qualcomm radio.  Apple famously put Intel radios in half of its iPhones and they performed so poorly they slowed down the Qualcomm radio.  They had to slow it down. It's the LTE radio.  So I agree that it's probably meaningless and yet all anybody does is say, well, I have an A36.  And that's all that's the bragging rights.

Transcript:  Also with us, Mr. Harry McCracken, the technologizer for FastCompany.com.  Our show today brought to you by the backup experts, the data protection heroes at Carbonite.  By the way, I haven't said this yet, but our hearts and prayers and minds and thoughts are all going out to our friends in Texas.  Harvey, what a nasty storm and now huge flooding even in metro areas like Houston.  We hope you're all all right.  And not to commercialize it, but every time I see a disaster like that, I think I hope those businesses...  You know you can rebuild the business.  You can buy new computers, but the data on the computers, that's pretty hard to replace if you haven't been backing it up.  I think about when disaster strikes, when ransomware ravages the world.  I just read that Merck, the big shipping company, which got bit by I think the Petya ransomware virus, in their quarterly results said we lost $300 million because of Petya.  $300 million.  The pharmaceutical company Merck shut down, had to shut down.  They've closed their offices.  So data loss is a serious thing.  Now if you've got a good data protection strategy, you don't have to worry about ransomware.  And I would submit that if your business isn't using Carbonite, you better darn well check it out.  Carbonite.com for home or for office.  If you go to the office side and look in the resources section, there's a bunch of white papers, a lot of things about backup, but also ransomware mitigation.  Protecting your business from ransomware.  Read about that.  They even have a link to FightRansomware.com.  They're a supporter of that.  To help you understand and teach your employees what not to do.  But ultimately, no matter what, whether it's acts of God, ransomware, acts of hackers, or just human error, you got to protect your data and you got to do it right with Carbonite.  Go to Carbonite.com.  Pick the plan you want.  They've got high availability plans.  They've got hardware solutions that then back up to the Carbonite cloud like the Evault.  There's the Evault right there.  A bunch of different solutions.  And if you're a business that needs to get back online fast, you'll really appreciate their high availability solutions.  This is not your Pappy's backup solution.  This here is the best data protection experts at Carbonite.  Carbonite.com.  Start your free trial today.

Okay, let's see.  We talked about Apple.  We talked about Google.  I think we got all the phones.  Are there any other essential phone?  We got Note 8.  At this point, and this happens every year around this time, because I buy these things, which is crazy.  It's a budget buster.  I don't even want to think about another.  And they're $1,000 for these devices.  And yet, well, you know, so Jason said, I'll since you bought the essential, I'll buy the Note 8.  Well, I'm buying them all, but he'll be the one holding it.  And then I think I'm going to get the new iPhone and I definitely get the Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL.  I'm a Pixel fanatic.  That's the Android choice for me.  I don't want to go through the leaked images of the iPhone 8 and all of this.  The Note, the essential phone comes with six gigs of RAM, right?  The Note is four gigs of RAM.  Or is it six? Maybe it's six, too.  I don't know.  I think that's another one of those bragging rights things where it doesn't.  You probably wouldn't notice a difference on tablets.

Start time: 3815.00

Start time: 3820.79
End time: 3852.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not the brand new one.  I have to say the new 10.5 is noticeably faster.  And I think some of that is because of ARKit.  I think that they want to be ready for that to be an AR device with bigger cameras.  Look, you're both using iPads.  I have an iPad Air 2.  You're so cute.  Yeah. I love it.  And I'm using my giant.  This is the giant iPad.  Yeah.  The 30 inch iPad that Apple never made, but really auto.  This is the Surface Studio.  But it's kind of like when you look at it, it's kind of like it's a giant.  The Surface Studio is beautiful.  It's kind of like a big iPad.

Start time: 3867.04
End time: 3898.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no. I was thinking it's really smart because what they're doing is.  They're tables almost.  What they're doing is they're turning the computer into a social experience and a family experience.  So instead of having four people in front of their tablets at night, you can pull out one and have everyone plays a game and then goes back to their tablets.  They're like 27 inches? Is that the size?  Yeah.  Yeah. I think we had an idea.  Yeah. And I've seen them use this recipe stations and kitchens and things like that.  But the idea was you just had this big iPad-esque experience you could take from room to room.  And it would change contextually depending on what you wanted to do.  I thought it was a great product.

Transcript:  Father Robert had one. I don't think it had a stand or it had a weird tilt stand.  Yeah.  That's the only thing to me that makes this. Well, I like the high resolution. I love the screen.  But really the fact that you can tilt it to 15 degrees and make it like a drafting table, that to me is the most interesting thing about the Surface Studio.

Start time: 4025.64
End time: 4079.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what really... And I hadn't really thought about this.  This was a study of teenagers. Apple doesn't say anything about who buys iPhones or any demographic information.  But in this study, it said that the majority of US based teens, 70-75%, three quarters, have iPhones. 76%.  And 81% say their next phone will be iPhones. This is from Piper Jaffray.  And what's interesting is that means iMessage, forget WhatsApp, forget Facebook Messenger, forget Google completely.  iMessage is dominant among the under 20 set. Fascinating.  I mean that shows that Apple, and Apple is putting more and more into its messaging platform, including I think payments are coming.

Start time: 4081.11
End time: 4096.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was one of the announcements they made in their last decade.  Well, at this point, if the teenagers have iPhones, the question that doesn't get answered, but I'm curious about,  is what percentage of those teenagers bought their iPhones themselves and what percentage got them from the bank of mom and dad?

Start time: 4096.26
End time: 4107.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure they're almost all from the bank of mom and dad. And in many cases hand me downs.  That's where our teen gets his. When I'm done with my iPhone 7 Plus, he'll replace his 6S with that.

Start time: 4108.50
End time: 4126.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I know there have been studies that showed that one of the reasons that tablet sales have plateaued is because device makers were not counting on phones.  Hand me downs.  No, they weren't. They were seriously thinking that people would always just buy, I guess, batches.  And there's been a hand me down effect. Have there been similar studies that have shown that being the case for phones?

Start time: 4127.00
End time: 4134.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know. That's a good question. Although Apple seems to have no trouble selling iPhones in mass quantities, much higher quantities than iPads.

Start time: 4135.00
End time: 4145.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it turned out the iPad was less of a device where everybody in the family has their own one, more like a PC, more of a shared resource.  And that shared resource you don't want to upgrade every single year?

Start time: 4146.68
End time: 4157.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really interesting question, Lacey. But that raises a good question. Do people buy a new iPhone every year or every other year? Is that kind of like automatic?

Start time: 4158.64
End time: 4188.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in the old days you had your two-year contract, which gave you an incentive to upgrade after two years.  And you don't have that now, but there are all these plans from Apple and from the carriers that allow you to pay for your phone on installments.  And then when the next one comes out a year later, to trade in your old one for a new one and continue making installments, which mathematically is probably not the world's greatest idea, although I do it myself.  But at least it's a plausible thing to do.

Transcript:  Well, the Pew Research Center keeps track of digital habits of Americans.  They have good study of American Internet.  I just looked up the most recent numbers and they say that 92% of 18-29-year-olds own a smartphone.  So you're looking at...  It's pretty well saturated.  Yeah, you're looking at true endosaturation. So the Piper Jackery figure, I'm no longer going to get quite a side eye, but I would really like to know...  Well, 76% of that 92% is iPhones.

Start time: 4215.04
End time: 4218.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take that all in. There are years, there are these experts who were constantly predicting that Apple was losing its luster among young people and Samsung is the new cool brand.  It's quite the opposite.  I hope nobody is still claiming that.  No. Samsung was the one to claim that.

Start time: 4236.00
End time: 4260.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of the things that points out to is Google has made tremendous inroads in the U.S. education market where the Google apps are pretty much a default for many, many school systems because you can do collaborative work, teachers can issue assignments, edit quickly, they don't have to manage files that way.  So are we looking at a generation of users who are taking it for granted they're going to have to negotiate multiple platforms and multiple vendors just to get stuff done?

Transcript:  Well, the Chromebook, it turned out where the Chrome pack has really had its impact is in school systems and it is sort of the new Windows PC and it really has hurt Apple in terms of how they're doing there, which is why Apple came out with this new $329 iPad, which actually seems to be a hit and maybe will help them compete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google seems to have a complete offering for a school who's really suffering there is Microsoft, Windows, because that was the dominant school platform, not Apple, but Microsoft.

End time: 4332.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it made Bloomberg News a couple weeks ago when Nielsen Research announced that they switched from Microsoft Office for their for their workforce to the Google Suite.  They said, yeah, this is actually what we're using as a recruiting tool because younger adults have come up through the school system and through college using the Google tools expect to walk into a workforce and have feature parity with the software.  And they're not thrilled with office. They'd rather use the same Google Apps they've been using for nearly a decade.

Start time: 4332.06
End time: 4335.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4337.00
End time: 4362.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder, and this is purely speculative, but you think about the foothold that Apple had in education in the 80s and 90s.  And how much do you think that helped rocket the popularity of the of the iMac in the late in the late 90s?  Because you had people who were not that many years removed from the experience.  And how much do you think it helped with something like the original iPod where there was the expectation is I get how this works.  This this hits a button in my brain that's been installed as a child.  A lot.

Start time: 4365.32
End time: 4414.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think that's why Apple's clear strategy is abandoning Mac OS and moving everybody towards iOS because you've got a generation that in just intimately understands how iOS works.  They're mobile first.  They're mobile first.  And they're going to use iPads and iPhones, maybe not even iPads.  Maybe just I mean, as we get more powerful in these phones, you may not even need.  What do you think of the solutions that Samsung and they mentioned this again in their in their Note 8 announcement.  Samsung and Microsoft also has something similar.  These these solutions like Samsung's decks or Microsoft's continuum that allow you to use your phone as a desktop computer, kind of almost a Chromebook where you dock your Samsung Galaxy Note in a little decks thing.  And it's connected.  It's connected to keyboard mouse and a big screen.  And now you're working.  Is that is that a you see that scenario?  Have you ever seen anybody do that?

Start time: 4415.00
End time: 4419.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, let's put it that way.  I haven't seen it in the wild yet, but I don't discount it.

Start time: 4419.04
End time: 4421.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done it. I have a text, but I did it once.

Start time: 4421.46
End time: 4442.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also wonder how much longer the keyboard is going to be your primary interface for computers, because again, you're looking at generations of people who have grown up with drop and drag and touch screen and typing with just two fingers because that's a transitional technology.  So who is this?  So we're not going to see somebody who figures out a better way to text is a transitional technology, the keyboard, the mouse and the monitor.

Start time: 4442.38
End time: 4448.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just to make people feel comfortable.  Millennials will say, well, I don't need that man.  I got my keyboard was a transitional technology from the typewriter.

Start time: 4449.02
End time: 4465.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So who's to say that we're not voice will eliminate the need for a keyboard input.  Only if the software is really good.  And it's getting good because I was thinking about this.  One of the stories that we have on the list is about Google and Wal-Mart teaming up for grocery delivery.

Start time: 4465.00
End time: 4468.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get to that.  Actually, that's a great thing.  So why does that help?  What does that have to do with voice?

Start time: 4469.82
End time: 4482.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say, oh, we want to we want to they want to do it because they want to gain a foothold in voice in voice assistance and invoice activated grocery deliveries where you can just say, hey, make sure my regular order is available for pick up at Wal-Mart.  And do you think this is a big story?

Start time: 4484.06
End time: 4490.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I thought I mean, it's obvious that Google and Wal-Mart are pairing up only in the face of the threat of Amazon.  I think it's an interesting strategy.

Start time: 4491.02
End time: 4493.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  But bear in mind that I don't like using the voice activated devices because I find it's too much work to train them right now.

Start time: 4503.00
End time: 4523.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use my Echo almost every day to buy something.  Yeah.  Because it's tied to Amazon.  Yeah.  Amazon knows everything I've ever bought.  So it's very easy for me to say, in effect, you know, that thing I bought last week, buy another one of those.  So if I say, you know, I could buy batteries, it says, well, the last time you bought this, you want more of those.  And it knows.  And that is easy.  There's no training.  That's easy.

Start time: 4524.30
End time: 4584.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the reason I think that it's actually a really smart strategy is Whole Foods is fairly geographically limited.  When they expanded the franchises, the people who cited Whole Foods always look for really specific zip codes with really specific demographics because they wanted to make sure they could guarantee so many sales per square foot.  And there are only so many zip codes you can do that in.  So Amazon doesn't is not going to have the same comparative geographic reach as Wal-Mart does because Wal-Mart has a much different geographic strategy.  So if you are if you are Google and Wal-Mart, you don't go after Amazon Prime customers.  You go after the people who are not geographically served by the Whole Foods Amazon team up.  And you go after people who still have to buy fresh produce and eggs but may live in rural Illinois or may live in southwestern Virginia or someplace where the nearest Whole Foods is not half an hour away.  So they have a real opportunity here to serve a market that has not seen a lot of attention and love.

Start time: 4584.36
End time: 4586.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  And it gives Google a scale that is never going to meet with something like Google Shopping Express.  Exactly.  It still seems like an experiment.  But Shopping Express has a lot of vendors.

Start time: 4596.15
End time: 4598.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought they were just going to add one more vendor to Shopping Express.

Start time: 4599.18
End time: 4654.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Shopping Express has CVS and they have Costco right now.  And again Costco is another one of those retail chains that has a very limited footprint.  They don't have they have more outlets and they're not tied exclusively to high income neighborhoods.  But because Costco's business model rewards more conservative growth in terms of putting down new stores and training a workforce.  They don't have the same geographic penetration as Wal-Mart does.  Wal-Mart's traditionally weak markets have been in urban areas.  But Amazon Prime and Whole Foods do very well there.  So by focusing on parts of the country that are underserved by an Amazon Whole Foods team up.  What Google gets out of this is a tremendous amount of retail data that they don't have access to otherwise.  And they get a reach that Amazon would have to work very hard to get into with Whole Foods.  Because right now what Amazon can offer is oh you can now buy like the 365 brand pasta if you're a prime member.  Hooray! You know because you've been dying for this dry pasta.

Start time: 4656.00
End time: 4662.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I think this is a scrappy...Wal-Mart and Google are a lot like McGregor.  They're not really boxers. They're coming from a different discipline.  And they're just hoping to box up against the big guy in this market.  But I think Mayweather, I think Amazon owns this.  Amazon in ten rounds. That's my prediction.

I don't think I've ever actually heard someone say the name.  But there's a Midwestern chain, Meyer or Miger, and there's Kroger and there's Safeway.  They've all launched delivery things too.  What I've heard from people who have used services like that is they get irritated at not being able to easily replicate things and pick them up when they want them to.  If Walmart can manage to nail convenience, they'll really have something there.

Start time: 4833.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

He killed him and he said, I'm going to screw you. I'm starting Jet, which didn't really take off, but at least, well, I'm sure he made his money back with the Walmart acquisition.  Now he's running e-commerce for Walmart. So you've got these Amazon...I don't know.  I am not a bet-against-Bezos kind of guy. I feel like he's the one to beat at this point.

And I've already made a little bit of that jump with Blue Apron, right?  So I'm almost there.  I get three meals a week from Blue Apron.  And of course, Amazon has their version of packaged meals.  Not as good as Blue Apron, but I have a feeling if Amazon doesn't acquire Blue Apron, they will duplicate it, which is why, by the way, the market agrees.

And everybody...it's clear when Google and Walmart partner, not natural friends, natural allies, when they partner, it means they're worried about Amazon.  And I think they should be. I do.  Amazon did announce, I don't understand it, that on Monday when the acquisition goes through, they're going to drop the prices at Whole Foods on kale, bananas, avocados, and salmon.  Woohoo!

Transcript:  Yeah. Why not? It's the new luxury. Luxury experiences, not luxury things.  Well, I'm going to do a Blue Apron ad now.  Actually, Blue Apron, I should have mentioned there, is a sponsor. Blue Apron is an interest. It's kind of like the gateway drug for this, right?  Because I was always skeptical about getting food, particularly fresh produce, delivered. I thought, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to...they're not going to pick out the melons, the avocados, the stuff I would pick out.  It won't be the same. And so I always went to the store to get fresh stuff, fresh produce. And then I tried Blue Apron.  And I think I realized, no, actually, it's completely possible to deliver amazing quality veggies, meats, fish, never frozen, fresh.  It's a refrigerated box. It's got dry ice in it. And it is incredible.  It's so good that they have a guarantee. Blue Apron is the idea is you get it. It's like everything you need to make an amazing meal.  We get our Blue Apron three times a week. Actually, we get three meals a week, three meals for two a week. I give one to our...we give one to our in-laws, which is really nice.  We prep them a little bit so it's ready for them to go. They don't have to chop anything.  The nice thing about Blue Apron is everything you need. I mean, if you need a tablespoon of soy sauce, you get a little bottle. See, a little bottle with a tablespoon of soy sauce.  If you need three fairy eggplants, you get three, not two, not four. So there's no waste.  It actually makes it easier to make the recipe because you know if it's here, I must have to use it in some way.  And it turns you into an amazing cook. These are meals you can make that smell delicious.  It's great. It's so nice to make them in the house because the aromas fill the house. I made the ramen bowl you see on the right there.  I made that the other day and people go, when's dinner? Oh, that smells good. What are you cooking?  It is fabulous. You feel good about it. They sit down to an amazing healthy meal with fresh ingredients.  They think you're a great cook and you say, well, yeah, I am. I'm a great cook thanks to Blue Apron.  Blue Apron is trying to build a sustainable food system and a community of home chefs with the highest standard for ingredients.  I think they're knocking it out of the park for all three. It's less than it's very affordable.  It's less than going to Whole Foods, less than going to any grocery store because they don't have the brick and mortar.  They don't have to worry about clerks and stocking and all those things. They don't have to rent a big space.  For less than $10 per person per meal, you're going to get seasonal recipes, perfectly proportioned ingredients.  You can cook the meals in 40 minutes or less. There's no weekly commitment, by the way.  You only get deliveries when you ask for them. You get to choose from the menu.  So there's lots of choices to suit your dietary requirements, your preferences.  Yes, they have vegetarian options.  And you don't ever have to worry about a box arriving when you're out of town because you only get it when you ask for it.  Listen to some of the things on the menu this week. Basil, pesto chicken with summer vegetable panzanella.  We're in the tail end of the summer stuff. We're going to start getting to the fall foods.  Oh, man, I hate doing these ads. They make me so hungry.  Sauteed shrimp and green beans with globe tomatoes, spinach and orzo pasta.  Here's a vegetarian one. Whole grain pasta and summer vegetables with heirloom tomato caprese salad.  Oh, miso butter salmon and lo mein noodles with cucumber and charmed tomatoes.  Meatball pizza with fresh mozzarella cheese and charmed tomatoes.  Now, they also have two plans, one for couples, one for families of four. Your family of four, right, Lisa?  Three.  Three? Okay, you actually, we feed three with a two person plan. I should mention this.  Sometimes we'll make a little rice extra or something like that.  But even Michael, who's a teenager and eats like an amazing, like a brontosaurus, we generally have enough food with a meal for two.  But they do have a meal plan for four. And they have more kind of, if you look at the family friendly, it's more family, you know, the family plan is more.  Oh, barramundi. And I don't even know what tzatziki sauce is, but it's, is it good? Summer vegetables? Oh.  See, doesn't that look good?  Your first three meals free with your first purchase, just go to blueapron.com slash Twitter.  Making me so, it's like torture. Free shipping to blueapron.com slash Twitter.  You will love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cooked meals with Blue Apron.  And I look at Blue Apron and I think this, Amazon should just buy them because it's really, Blue Apron customers and I know so many people, many of our staff uses Blue Apron.  You'd use Blue Apron, right, Carson? Yeah.  He's got two, two boys and feeds a family of four.  That's when you realize, no, I don't have to go to the store to shop.  This is perfect. This is better than I would have picked.  Perfectly ripe and fresh and delicious.  Blueapron.com slash three meals free with your first purchase.

Margaret Sullivan.  She was wonderful.  And she's not the Washington Post, I believe.  She went to the Post.  Yeah.  She was an ombudsman for the reader.  So she would call the New York Times to task.  When they did a story that wasn't well researched, I remember the New York Times wrote a story  about the sweatshop workers, child workers in China for Apple.  She would call them on the carpet.  And then, I don't know how Liz did, but she was apparently a little abrasive.

Transcript:  That's not what you need.  No.  You don't want a PR person.  So Facebook has hired her, which I mean I'm not sure exactly what she's going to do here.  She's blogging I guess, or I'm not sure.  What Facebook says is, well we have Campbell Brown who was the CNN journalist they hired  as their head of news partnerships.  Campbell is going to be more public facing.  We're going to make Spade kind of somebody who's inside but calls us to task.  Is that the right job for Liz Spade?  I don't know.

Start time: 5942.38
End time: 5960.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think she has done some good work in the past because she was at the Columbia Journalism  Review, which was certainly a force for good.  When she was at the Times it was a little unclear whether she could get her head around  social media in a world in which stuff is not tightly controlled.  It's funny that Facebook would then hire her.  It does seem like an odd hire, but who knows.  Maybe she made a case for herself.

Start time: 5960.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's what's a little concerning is since Facebook has the well publicized fake  news issue they're still trying to deal with, and they also have as I wouldn't say mandate  for growth, but a huge component of their operation comes down to people sharing news  articles and commenting on it or commenting on publisher streams.  Unless you can understand how people have chosen to dialogue with one another.  Oh God, I just used dialogue as a verb.  I'm so sorry.  How people chose to conduct a dialogue with one another.  If I were Liz Spade I would get my ruler out and hit your knuckles.  If you can't really look at what is in an online space and accept this is how people  choose to talk about the news and you're like, no, this is how you should run face with it  instead, I'm not sure you're setting yourself up for success.

Okay, well I'll be watching that and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which Jim Carrey  tries to keep his face from making funny images.  They'll all be broadcast from the Focus, these are all Focus films, Focus Features,  Focus Features Facebook page.  First time a studio has ever broadcast actual movies on Facebook live.

Start time: 6075.02
End time: 6089.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Facebook says go ahead, it's your page, you can do it and since you own the  rights to the movie it's not piracy.  Focus, you know, they say this is part of their 15th anniversary celebration.  It's certainly PR, it's not a movie that probably they're making money on.

Start time: 6101.00
End time: 6135.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm also suspecting that for Focus Features because one of the things that's going on  right now in movies as well is you have production companies that have been getting into spats  with theater chains over the terms of releasing movies in theaters versus streaming or video  on demand.  So it's also in the interest of the studio to be able to say hey we got this kind of  interest with streaming.  It does not hurt us to walk away from box office distribution and this data could be  used as bargaining chips later especially during award seasons when awards are often  predicated on airing in a cinema.

Start time: 6135.18
End time: 6160.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be interesting, because during award season I get DVDs with lots of anti-piracy  messages and stuff on there for your consideration.  Wouldn't it be interesting if instead they streamed them on Facebook for your consideration  and said alright celebrities.  The problem is piracy is a big problem because these are all in many cases movies in the  theater still.  So I'm supposed to shred the DVDs after I get them.

But now it's a password protected site where it's streamed and I no longer have the DVDs  at all.  I just have a password protected site.

Transcript:  Incidentally, one reason I think, another reason why Facebook is doing this is because  they are trying to figure out how to integrate professional content into Facebook which I  think they're doing partially because YouTube has placed a large emphasis on integrating  more professional content into YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's licked this yet though.  Apple wants to do it.  They've announced they're going to spend a billion dollars on new content.  YouTube spent hundreds of millions and maybe will spend more coming down the road.  But the companies like HBO and Netflix just are so dominant.  They make so much better stuff.  Netflix says we're going to spend seven billion this year on original content.  And I imagine HBO spends something like that.  Okay, since you specialize in covering television among other things, why is it so, look at  what Apple's made so far.  They've trashed Carpool Karaoke and made this awful Planet of the Apps show.  They haven't shown any ability.  They hired two executives from Sony.  Maybe that's their bid to get some expertise in here.  A billion isn't a whole lot of money compared to what Netflix is spending.  How does Apple or Facebook or YouTube convince people?  YouTube already has people watching but they watch short growing crotch shot videos.  Well, they watch instructional videos too.

Transcript:  And what I found really fascinating actually, and we can get back to the scripted shows  or remote, but I've found Buzzfeed's Tasty.  Very good.  And they've also got a new DIY Crafty series they do where they can show you how to make  crafts and they accelerate through that too.  I'm trying to remember what it's called.  Nifty, that's what it's called.  And I think it's really interesting that Buzzfeed has effectively pioneered and nailed  this visual format for super quick, super instructional videos.  I have reservations about how useful they are, say, if you don't have broadband or if  your internet connection goes down in your mid-recipe.  But I honestly don't understand, I should say I don't think it's necessarily smart on  Apple's part to push out original content.  I don't see why you don't just work on making partnerships with companies that do that already.  But that's mostly because maybe this is the inverse of the Whole Foods Walmart thing we  just had where, like you pointed out, Netflix is so dominant in the space.  HBO's done a great job.  A lot of other channels do streaming content.  Why would you not just lock down a really nice deal with them?  And then that makes it more compelling for people to use your product.

Start time: 6401.00
End time: 6416.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't lump them all together.  YouTube for a while was doing kind of random celebrities and giving them lots of money.  And that flopped.  Remember Shaquille O'Neal had a channel.  They eventually swung back to people who actually do have a critical mass of fans on YouTube,  which makes a lot more sense.

Start time: 6416.00
End time: 6427.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, we should point out the whole purpose, at least for YouTube and probably for  Facebook, not so much for Apple is advertising revenue.  For Apple, it's a little more complex because they want to generate revenue.

Start time: 6428.00
End time: 6431.72

Transcript:  Although YouTube also wants you to pay for YouTube content.  They want you to subscribe to YouTube.

Start time: 6432.44
End time: 6438.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But really, I think YouTube is trying to upgrade the quality of their content because advertisers  don't want to be on groin shot videos.

Start time: 6439.02
End time: 6464.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if you're on Netflix, though, one of the advantages you have is since you have a deep well of  content and people will get on for nostalgic reasons.  For example, if they're like, oh, the entire run of this British sitcom I like happens to be on  Netflix and it's only $9 a month and I get access to Orange is the New Black and Moana and all these  other movies, why not?  And so they don't just come for one show.  They come for one or two shows.  And then they go through the back catalog.  And when they emerge 48 hours later, their loved ones are shocked they're still alive.

Start time: 6465.74
End time: 6478.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mentioned, it's interesting, you mentioned the Buzzfeed Tasty videos because they're very  well done and they're very viral.  They're produced by Zay Frank.  Who do you know?  You guys remember Zay Frank.  He's an old hand at this stuff.

And he went on to Buzzfeed and created some great video content for Buzzfeed.  So that underscores what I maybe think is the case that it's really if you're going to make this kind  of content, you need there's some people who know how to do it.

Start time: 6501.00
End time: 6511.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to distinct.  You need that.  You need to have the visual vocabulary and you need to have this.  The skills.  You need to be able to identify what works in a video and what doesn't.  And that's a whole different set of skills.

Transcript:  No.  Well, that was actually a big problem with food blogging.  And this is something that I suspect only irritates me.  But I used to read a couple different food blogs and I had to stop because every recipe was  preceded by a 2500 word essay.  The first time they had it and how it feels in their mouth and how exciting it is to make it.  And then like a sidebar into the history of kale and then back again and just and I was like,  I just want the recipe for the cookies.

Here is a typical tasty video.  And this is the kind of thing my son sees all the time.  They're kind of sped up.  They have the recipe in it.  You can't it's pretty compelling because it's happening so fast.  This was actually and this is a format.  Everybody's copying the format, but I'm sure Ze Frank was the one who thought it up.  Brilliant.  And you don't and it has the other advantage of cooking shows.  It's such a consistent visual format, though, where people know what to expect.

And the reason I ask is I've seen stats for individual sites and there are some sites that have a lot of workday, a lot of workday.  That's old school, right?  I hope it's not my employees.  But what I'm saying is that short videos may do better simply because it is easier to watch a three minute video.  When you're taking a work break than it is to have a movie streaming and a Facebook tab in the background.

We don't remember in the early days of the Internet, you would follow links and you would go and you I don't know, you would start and you would go down a link hole and you'd be just kind of hours.  We don't do that anymore.  We go to Facebook and we go through the feed and we watch videos sequentially or we go to Twitter.  We go through the feed and we watch videos sequentially.  And then you're done.  I've done anyway.  When I get to the one that I saw already, if I remember it.  So I well, we've just demonstrated that something different going on that maybe the expertise to do this isn't going to come from Hollywood or from Sony and that Apple really needs to get out of the business because they have no clue what they're doing.

Transcript:  It's an anachronism.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  I know when it comes to getting a home loan, I remember it's like you ask a neighbor,  you ask a friend, you ask your realtor.  You don't really do a lot of thinking about it.  Because you assume, well, it's all the same process.  And it is, if you don't mind being back in the 19th century, it's roughly the same process.  Somebody...  I'm in the last home loan. It's only three or four years ago.  There was a guy with a clipboard.  It was about three inches high with little fool's cap thin rice paper practically.  And he licked his fingers as he went through the rates, looking for a rate for us.  The guy might as well have had sleeve garters and a green visor on.  I mean, it really was antiquated.  And it was...  We were getting a loan from the big bank.  It was actually the biggest lender in the country.  And they wanted more paperwork, and we had to fax it to them.  For months, it was just...  It was a terrible experience.  Fast forward, we're in 2017 now, and we've got Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans,  the number two lender in the country, but definitely the best lender in the country.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  If you look at the website, you'll see all those JD Power customer satisfaction awards year after year.  Number one in mortgage origination.  That's what we're doing here.  And now, I think better than ever because it's entirely online with Rocket Mortgage.  You could do it on your phone, and it's so fast you could do it at an open house.  And before you leave, you could show the realtor, we're approved.  We could buy this house if we wanted to.  Rocket Mortgage makes it completely transparent, too.  In fact, you don't have to go through piles of paperwork or go up in the attic to get your pay stubs, your bank statements.  They have partnerships with all the financial institutions, so they've got your information.  You don't have to do anything.  Based on your income, assets, and credits, they will crunch the numbers, and within minutes,  they will give you the loan options for which you qualify.  You pick the one that's right for you, the term, the rate.  It's fully transparent.  You'll understand everything that's happening.  It happens fast, and you'll know you're getting the right mortgage for you.  So instead of just kind of going along for the ride next time,  this is probably the biggest purchase you make in your life.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  That's rocketmortgage.com slash twit.  And the number two, equal housing lender license in all 50 states,  and MLSconsumeraccess.org, number 3030.  Rocket Mortgage.  Apply simply, understand fully, and mortgage confidently.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  I know you're not buying a house right now.  Bookmark it, okay? Bookmark it in your phone.  That way you'll know when the time comes you'll be ready to go.  Speaking of ready to go, there's no point in continuing this show much longer,  because Game of Thrones lasts, this is the last episode of the season, right?  Am I right? Am I wrong?  Believe you were right.  And then they're going to have another season next year,  which they haven't even started filming, and then it's over for good.  73 hours.  Oh, wow.  Benny Ove, one of the creators, said, I'm making a 73-hour movie.

Transcript:  Yeah, it feels like that too, by the way.  Anyway, I don't want to keep you from your Game of Thrones,  so let's just see, first of all, do we have a CEO?  Nope.  Nope.  Nothing to say here. Nothing going on.  Okay. See, Mark, you could have come to the show.  Let's see what Kara has to say.  I'm not saying anything.  Good news, we had mentioned that the U.S. Department of Justice  had asked DreamHost for every single IP address  from everybody who visited an anti-Trump website.  This was a website that was created, disruptsj20.org,  to protest at the inauguration day, January 20th, get it, J-20.  1.9 million visitors, and the DOJ wanted everybody.  DOJ has backed down.  Oh, we didn't really want that.  No, we didn't really want that.  DreamHost, congratulations. Thank you.  DreamHost decided not to comply with the July 12th warrant.  They said it was overly broad,  and I think they would have gone to court to defend that,  but the prosecutors amended their request,  saying that while the government wants information on subscribers,  it's not interested in data logs containing information about visitors.  Hey, give us the information,  but we'll put aside anything that doesn't involve rioters.  You know, that's problematic.  That is very problematic.  U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington says the website was used to recruit  and organize hundreds of people who rioted.  200 people were charged, 19 people have pled guilty,  but honestly, visiting the website, that's not a crime,  and it's really chilling that they wanted all that information.  They've backed down a little bit.  State Supreme Court, good news.  Now, this is only a state Supreme Court,  but in Massachusetts says digital cameras can't be searched without a warrant.  It's kind of a strange case.  A robbery suspect apprehended, they searched his backpack,  they found a digital phone,  looked at the phone and discovered a photo of the suspect next to a gun  later determined to have been stolen.  He got convicted for stolen property and carrying a firearm without a license.  He said the defendant challenged it,  saying, you know, most of this information you got from going through my camera phone.

Start time: 7527.06
End time: 7663.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you have a warrant? No.  The state of Massachusetts said, well,  the Riley decision, which was a decision blocking this kind of thing for cell phones,  doesn't apply because digital cameras,  I guess it wasn't a cell phone, I guess it was a digital camera,  lacking the ability to function as computers are not analogous to cell phones  for the Fourth Amendment purposes.  Well, the court said, no.  So digital cameras and cell phones, at least in the state of Massachusetts,  protected against unlawful search and seizure.  Weird story. You've probably been following the arrest of Marcus Hutchins.  He's a white hat hacker.  The Department of Justice is accusing of writing malware on very thin evidence.  There was a defense fund created.  And, you know, I got to say the Internet sucks.  According to the lawyer who managed the fund,  at least $150,000 of the money collected for the defense fund  came from fraudulent sources, illegal credit cards.  And since he can't figure out which is legit and which isn't,  he's refunding everything and Marcus no longer has a defense fund.  We've been covering this story on security now.  If you want to know more information about this.  We don't know what Marcus did or didn't do, but it sure looks a little fishy, the OJ,  as has happened before, kind of overstepping their bounds going after a guy.  Steve feels, appears, didn't do anything wrong.  DJI is going to have to ground your spark.  I almost bought a spark. I'm glad I didn't now.  You have to get a firmware update.  Apparently sparks were falling from the sky.  And if you have a spark and you don't update the firmware by September 1st,  or it won't fall from the sky, it won't even go into the sky.  It'll just stop working entirely. I didn't know they could do that.  Install the firmware by September 1st or your drone will not take off.  Anything else? There's so many stories and we didn't get to all of them,  but I don't want to keep you much longer.  Actually, Leo, I have a question for you.

I think the number two shark bite capital after the U.S.  They have shark spotters, but shark spotters only do about 20 to 30 percent accuracy.  They have trained cameras to recognize sharks.  They're putting them on drones. They'll be used with a human assist.  But they're 90 percent accurate with the machine learning compared to the humans of 20 to 30 percent.  In a move that would really thrill Dr. Evil, shark detecting drones, no lasers, are going to patrol Australian beaches.  Bravo.  That keeps the sharks out of trouble too.  Oh look, it's a shark.  There's a shark.  It also can tell the difference between a shark and a dolphin, a shark and a man-eating shark and a knot, and a woman-eating shark.  What? No, there's no difference.  Not all sharks.  Not all sharks. Only some sharks.  And that's, I think, going to wrap this up.  Previously.tv, I look forward to reading your stuff there.  Are you a Game of Thrones fan?
