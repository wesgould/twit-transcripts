Transcript:  This is Twitch This Week in Tech, Episode 45 for March 12th, 2006.  Hello, Leo. That is Doug Kay, who is joining us via ISDN from his house somewhere in Northern California.  Hello, Doug. From Amsterdam, John C. Dvorak, who is trying to get home. Are you lost, John?  No, I'm leaving tomorrow.  He was at C-Bit in Hanover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess I had a funny thing happen to me today. It was kind of amusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me introduce the rest and we'll talk about that. What time is it though?  Real quickly, what time is it in Amsterdam?  It's a little after 1 a.m.  Sorry, we're keeping you up. Alright, we'll move fast here.  From via Skype from San Francisco, it's Robert Heron. And good afternoon to you, Robert.  Hello.  And of course, also from San Francisco via Skype and DLTV, it is Patrick Norton. Hello, Patrick.  How's it going?  How's it going?  It's going great. Hey, Cranky Geeks, episode one, did that come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually it's up on, if you go up to www.dl.tv, scroll about a third of the way down, you will see the links to download the very first show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, oh, that's the pilot, but is another show coming out sooner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it depends on when John ever gets back from Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you can't really do it while you're in Germany. So what happened to you that's so funny, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm roaming around Amsterdam taking photos in my normal fashion when I hit these little towns.  And I got approached by a guy and a girl, a woman with a camera, and it's a guy doing what he calls, I guess it was ambush journalism for a computer magazine.  Wow. Did he know who you were?  No, he didn't follow?  No, he didn't know who it was, but he'll find out when he goes to the website, dvorak.org slash blog.  Anyway, he just was asked, they asked people on the street about the, about how long they've been using email and what the value of it is, which I thought was amusing.  How long they've been using it.  You know, well, you know, they don't use a lot, email is pretty new to some people.  Not in Amsterdam, surely.  Apparently it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't get recognized by any, you didn't get any recognized by any twit fans in Amsterdam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, I did in CBIT a couple, but in Amsterdam, no, I'm not, I used to have a column, I think that ran in a licensed version of PC Magazine around here, but that, they don't have that anymore.  So I'm kind of just a normal person here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably just as well nobody was throwing brickbats at you.  We missed you at the Apple store though. They were looking for you with brickbats there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's a shame, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to be kind of the trade show report because John's got an update on CBIT.  E-Tech just happened, that's O'Reilly's Emerging Tech Conference and Doug Kay was down there and he's going to give us the latest from E-Tech.  And joining us a little bit later, Will Harris, who is with a British enthusiast site called bit-tech.net, a great little site.  And he was at the Intel Developers Forum, so we'll get the latest on the IDF as well.  So a lot of news in the works.  You know, I think in fact we could focus on that because there's not a whole lot of news in the rest of the world, except maybe this Google acquisition of Rightly, which is the online word processor.  Anybody surprised by that?  Yeah, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was a little surprised because I had visited with the company and they had this roadmap.  They were actually going to do a calendaring program or some other things, I guess, which kind of fits in nicely with what Google's up to.  I knew that this is the kind of thing that looks like an M&A company, mergers and acquisitions design to be bought eventually, but I think this was a little earlier than they were anticipating.  It was quick.  What did they pay for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't see a number anywhere. Did anybody see a number?  No.  Rightly is, I think, a pretty slick product, although interestingly it's not written in PHP or Java or anything you'd expect. It's written in .NET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was under the impression it was written in C-sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. C-sharp and .NET.  Right, okay, .NET.  Yeah, yeah. So, Scobel over at Microsoft is a little happy about it.  When I talked to them, they were going to recode it in Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder now because I don't think Google does much .NET stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody does much. Well, I don't know. .NET is a ... I don't even want to get started. Sorry.  It's a little beastie.  Let's just say there's a lot of extremely well proven and hammered upon code in everything .NET in my life.  Right, right. That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that the talk of e-tech, Doug, when you were there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it was part of, I would say, one of two themes. It's sort of the Web 2.0 theme, if you think about it in those terms.  And, of course ...  Get attention, get bought.  Well, the e-tech was about 50% or maybe even more, you know, new company announcements and particularly companies that were involved in the, what Tim O'Reilly refers to as the Web 2.0 stuff.  But, you know, it sort of resurfaces that old debate about Google. Is Google going to be a viable alternative to Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it sure looks like they're putting an office suite together, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And, you know, we all thought, I think, that if anything, Google was writing that in-house.  Right.  And now they turn around and buy probably the core component, which is the word processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Michael Arrington, who broke this story, also broke the first pictures I've ever seen of Google Calendar.  And I have to say, looking at it, it looks like the typical sparse, ugly Google project. Unimpressive, you know, and nothing compared to, say, something like Yahoo Calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but, you know, you might say that about Gmail, but it works.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know?  True. And if you're already using Gmail, any integration with Gmail would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I had another idea for one of the things about Web 2.0. Maybe what it means is Web 2.0, Microsoft 0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, John, you just wrote a column saying Web 2.0 was just Web 1.0 rewarmed and equally dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same, you know, what you have to do is just, I think there's been some lists put on some websites and some blogs where it shows you, you know, the old name and the new name.  It's the same thing. They just renamed all these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think Free Office, rightly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there was a discussion about that at eTech, too. I don't know who said it. I wish I could remember.  But somebody said that Web 2.0 really is the same thing as Web 1.  But what happened in the meantime is that the investment community came in and popped a bubble or created a bubble and popped it.  So this is essentially the geeks taking the Web back from the investment community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there was nothing wrong with Web 2.0, except that there wasn't a business model for a lot of these.  And now that banner advertising is successful and you can make some money.  I don't I mean, yeah, you might see some overheating.  I think Google snapping up rightly so quickly is probably some evidence of that.  But is Web 1.0, was it so very flawed? I mean, who cares that it was a, you know, investment bust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, except that somebody needed to put a new spin on it so people would pay attention to it.  The techies are doing the same stuff we did all along. We never stopped. Right.  So it's a continuum. I think John's right in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know who else never stopped is Amazon and eBay.  And John pointed this out that some of those companies just kept on going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You know, if you stayed if you stayed in business, you by at this point, you'd be doing pretty well for yourself.  Most of the companies that you know, a lot of these guys, you always have to remember these investors pulled the plug on some of these guys.  And then a lot of companies had, you know, a lot of companies did an IPO.  And then all that money, the real money that was made on the IPO was made by the middlemen.  I mean, the company, if they sold the stock for 10 bucks and it flew to 100, the company didn't get that 90 dollars.  Everybody in the middle did. Now, the thing that's interesting about Google is that they did an auction IPO,  which means all the money that that was raised by the IPO and where that stock was going to head all went to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, nobody said the guys running Google were stupid.  You know, and they're also in the rare position of actually having, you know, the entire Wall Street salivating so desperately,  they were willing to do anything it would take to get any kind of money off the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the way I looked at it is that if everybody had done back then what Google did today and actually absorbed those profits,  you know, from the stock going up into the company instead of, you know, getting it, you know, the winners being the middlemen,  I think half of these companies that went out of business would probably still be in business.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it a mistake to kind of confuse the investment community and what it's doing with actual technology and innovation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, well, not when they're the ones paying the bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying that by sucking up all the capital, it kept these good companies from surviving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm not saying I agree with Patrick that not all these companies were good.  I mean, some of these ideas were idiotic, but there's a number of the things that could have done at least as well as,  you know, some of the MySpace kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think if you look at all the recent acquisitions and compare them to what we saw five or six years ago,  all the acquisitions today are the companies are being led by their founders and those founders are developers.  And if you look back at 2000, 1999, I think at that point, people were acquiring companies that were much more inflated.  And the management were, he quote, professional managers.  They had already replaced the developers.  So these are earlier stage acquisitions, which are essentially almost pure technology.  So it's a different world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And developers are willing to have their companies stay small so that they can reasonably maintain control.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they realized they're looking for the Google acquisition as opposed to a venture round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a couple million dollars in pocket is a lot better than a theoretical $50 million that turns into a $30 million tax debt,  you know, because you can't pay off your mock earnings off of the sale.  I mean, if you look at some of it, it just seems like so much of what a lot of people learned was it's, you know,  the IPOs just kicked a lot of people's asses.  Venture capital kicked a lot of people's asses.  You know, when you were watching, it was one thing to have like, you know, we're the emerging site that's going to be tracking.  I mean, how many sites were there that were dedicated to basically to have lawyers and other urban professionals,  you know, be able to track their time, you know, in two minute chunks for billing, right?  Okay, there's room for a couple of those companies.  But I remember watching like the fifth one open up and receive $11 million in VC funding.  And you were just watching, you know, okay ideas to begin with that there would be like, you know,  four more VCs would be like, oh, my God, you know, that's where all the money is going to be.  And then they would invest on it.  And it was just a mess to watch.  And then they'd never ship products or they'd be spending money.  I remember watching somebody who had all of this insanely expensive office space downtown, you know,  then turn around and buy a retail building to convert it into their main office building in a, you know,  in a retail section of San Francisco.  And it's just like, what are you insane?  You're peeing away money on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, these guys were almost encouraged to do that kind of crack pot stuff by the again by the investors.  Anyway, I think we're a little off topic here.  We should probably get back to what else was it was there anything new with the show besides the sudden discovery that Web 2.0 is Web 1.0?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there was a lot of new stuff.  What else happened at ETEC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think one of the themes sort of continuing from last year was micro formats.  That's one that's sort of been on the back burner.  That's, you know, structured content in the form of calendar data or contact data, you know, simple things.  But when you put them together, they're fairly powerful.  One of the things that was hyped a bit.  I didn't I didn't fall for it.  I don't think but this was Ray Ozzie showing his his basically smart web based copy paste thing, which I think has been shown other places.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, it's a clipboard that's web board for the web for the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So the idea is that you just like you find something on Microsoft's desktop environment, you copy it from one application and paste it to another.  Why can't you do that on the web?  Why can't you find an address or an RSS feed or some other structured object and paste it from one environment to the other?  There was a lot of hype around it.  I either missed the point or or didn't fall for it.  But there there is the part of it that you had a blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's true.  If you were a big blogger, it would be handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could cut and paste.  But I mean, but it's not text.  It's structured structured data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And and you know, when you got listening to the presentations by the calendar guys and the other micro format guys, there are many presentations about those kinds of tools.  It makes some sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they talking about using kind of an XML?  Yeah.  Under code so that everything can.  I mean, that is one of the big issues right now for users is the formats are all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The theory is, you know, Ray is out there saying, well, Microsoft is going to get behind this and it's going to be completely open.  Now, if Ray is saying that, I believe it.  If Ray as part of Microsoft is saying that, I'm not sure I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was using Firefox to demonstrate this, I noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was I was in I was in the other room listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's kind of interesting.  Maybe it doesn't work in Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was one of the big things.  And I guess the only other big topic, which again is a something we've seen before at meetings like E-Tech is the whole Ajax thing, which comes back to the word processing and so forth.  So there are a lot of people developing developing Ajax based applications.  And now people are also sort of going to Ajax 2.0, which I just made up.  But it's essentially recognizing that the performance of Ajax can be problematic.  So a couple of proposals, one called Comet, for example, as a way to mitigate some of the performance problems of an Ajax architect.  It's a faster Ajax or?  Yeah, just smarter.  It just recognizes that you can't send half a dozen XML packets for every keystroke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, getting back to what Ray Ozzie was doing, I like the idea if you could get somebody if you get people to agree.  He demonstrated apparently copying an event from eventful and pasting it into Microsoft's live calendar.  But you've got to get eventful to agree and a Microsoft degree and everybody else to agree.  How realistic is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it is because the microformat guys seem to be looking for anybody who will adopt their standards.  They've created these standards and no one's showing up to the party.  And so if Microsoft turns around and says, we'll endorse them and we'll put them into our products, there's plenty of motivation then for everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not talking V-Cal or V-Cards. Is it something new and different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It includes V-Cal and V-Cards. It includes all that stuff. But it's more.  And then there are people looking at what is the question is, what is the semantic component?  If you paste an RSS feed into a web page, what does that mean?  Does that mean you just get a little orange button?  Or do you get the content of the feed?  Or what does it mean? So there's more work to do.  I think we should get Dave Weiner to work on this. That would really help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks.  It solved the whole problem.  Anything exciting at C?  Well, I can tell you one thing that CBIT revealed, which was Microsoft's origami.  Did you go see that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I got the demo and I played with it and I got the lecture from Bill Mitchell, the head guy who did the...  He was in Hanover to promote it. There's a bunch of TV reports that were done on it.  Let me summarize. It's a small notepad.  But no keyboard.  No, actually, there's no keyboard.  I've got some stuff. I've got, I think tomorrow or Tuesday for sure, PCMag.com will have a slideshow that I'll be putting up tomorrow.  Some of the pictures I took at the show.  And I'll have a lot of pictures, well, at least two or three pictures of the...  Well, at least one pic...no, a couple.  Of the origami device and some of these ideas that I've got.  It's a nice little thing. It's no big deal. It's expensive.  It could have a keyboard, I guess.  Yeah, no, you can have a keyboard, too. In fact, they have a little pack you can buy that you hook it into.  It's like a big kind of a wallet, you know, and you stick the thing on one side and you stick the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the market? Is it for somebody who wants to sit in their living room and access...I notice it's kind of a...  There's a market?  Oh, there doesn't need to be a market. I notice that the resolution is kind of DVD resolution,  so it would, I guess, be appropriate for playing back DVDs remotely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it only has two and a half hour battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked them if they have a Game Boy for adults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was somebody on television from Microsoft, maybe it's the same guy, who said the target market was soccer moms,  who have five or ten minutes while they're waiting for their kids.  I'm thinking that's not much of a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so. I asked them specifically about this and they wouldn't tell me.  They didn't know.  I asked them specifically about their market research and what they...you know, they said, you know, we can't say.  Bill Gates wanted it.  That could be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill Gates would actually do the market research and make sure there was actually a market for it.  I mean, the other thing is no U.S. portable vendor is touching this.  I know this is all Korean.  It's a couple other vendors you've never even heard of.  Samsung's the main one.  The first one comes out with three hours of battery life.  The physical specs are, you know, the thumb keyboard is definitely going to be in there for most people.  Keyboards are optional.  It's basically a modified version of the tablet OS from Microsoft.  It's like Media Center meets tablet PC with even less battery life than a PDA and a larger form factor.  So are the verticals going to want it?  Maybe, but hospitals and, you know, insurance adjusters seem happy with full sized tablet PCs.  Are people going to want it at home?  Well, do you want to spend $600 or $800 for one of these things for a seven inch or smaller screen?  Is this bigger than the Nokia 770?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little bit bigger, isn't it?  No, it's a lot bigger.  A lot bigger.  Yeah.  All right.  It's like half a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good size paperback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's bigger than that.  It's about two thirds the size of a regular notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Patrick, you were all excited about the Sony eBook.  I mean, couldn't this be just, you know, it's kind of like an eBook?  Yeah, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not like an eBook at all.  Come on, Patrick.  Hold on.  Hold on. Stop. Pause. Both of you.  Right? There's three things about the eBook.  A whole bunch of storage, which is easy, right?  The screen, which doesn't refresh, so it doesn't suck up battery life.  That's a good point.  It doesn't kill your eyes, right?  And three, some way of getting content onto it.  Now, we'll find out whether or not Sony's screwed that up or not in a few weeks when the Sony reader shows up.  We're going to get one in for testing.  But what it has is thousands of pages of battery life.  You know what I mean?  There's a lot of storage on there, and the battery life is going to be phenomenal.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't watch movies on it or listen to music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, this is something that the entire industry has been going around in circles on  since, you know, before I was writing about this stuff is do we need single devices that are designed to do one thing really, really well?  Or do we do another device that mostly does one thing and then half-asses four other things?  You know what I mean?  Does your GPS, you know, does your automotive navigational system also need to be an MP3 player?  You know what I mean?  Does your MP3 player also need to display movies?  Does your, you know what I mean?  It's like, you know.  I'll tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think that this little, this small tablet from Microsoft and Makeup,  if they had a cradle for it, make a great, great GPS device for the car if it was powered.  Seriously.  It's the right size and a good looking screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's probably the biggest problem with it is that it doesn't do any one thing particularly well.  It doesn't have a battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, that's why it's called Origami.  Nobody mentioned this.  I think I, in fact, I didn't write it in the column.  I just did one for Market Watch about it.  But I asked them specifically, why was it called Origami?  He says, well, it's like, you know, because I thought it was going to be something that folded up.  Right.  And so he says, well, it's like a piece of paper, you know, that you can fold it up different ways and it does different things.  So our device does all these different things.  So exactly what you described is why it was named Origami in the first place.  Terrific.  Anyway, let me change the topic real quick and just say the only the real news of this show seemed to me to be besides RFID, which was all over the place.  I mean, it's like everybody's building this RFID gear.  It's kind of frightening, actually.  Are these new phones that you're going to be seeing?  I think there's going to be your phone du jour, which is a looks like a regular phone.  But the screen kind of gimbals and goes sideways.  So it looks kind of like a T.  Yeah, Nokia is doing.  Isn't that the 90?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Nokia 90 was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody had one of them.  And they were all like, you know, this big screen.  So you can watch movies, I guess, sideways or you can play games and have the I don't know.  I thought that I thought it was.  That's origami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now that's origami device.  It folds up in different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that actually probably is more origami than the Microsoft.  Samsung showed a 10 megapixel phone at Seabed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what you would do with a 10 megapixel phone.  Very detailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if that's using the foveon sensor because I didn't see that phone.  That's that's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it is, by the way, just like the phone.  You know, it's another one of those folding.  Oh, no, actually, this one's not.  The Grundig was the one that's kind of folding.  That was a six megapixel.  I'm going to have decent optics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, 10 megapixels of bad light is, you know, very detailed, bad light.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just kind of kooky.  I think that's a number so that they can for bragging rights more than anything else.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, retail salespeople love stuff like that.  Sure.  You know, the new Samsung phones got 10 megapixels.  And that's really the thing.  If you want the good photos of the kids, you do want the good photos of the kids.  Don't you, Leo?  John, did you see any SED TVs there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I'm seeing now that they're saying SEDs will be coming in about a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there were these little bitty TVs that run on, you know, hand held PCs or whatever all over the place.  Yeah.  Like lots of them.  Did you see that, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the announcement from Toshiba and Canon.  They say they call this a major industry milestone, a once in 50 years historical turning point for the TV industry comparable to the initial introduction of CRT.  This is that new SED.  It has the potential.  It's a surface conduction electron emitter display.  Last time we talked about this, you said it was more like a CRT than an LCD.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you something about that technology.  That used to be called, if you ask anybody about that, that used to be called an FED, a field effect display or whatever, or field emitter.  Right.  And these are called FEDs.  Two companies, probably the biggest bust in the history of Silicon Valley was a company called Candlescent, I believe.  And they billions of dollars essentially squandered, well, not that much, but close to it maybe.  But whatever the case is, this technology has never cut the mustard.  It's not going to happen that now it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're mixing up technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure.  No, it's the same technologies, exactly the same technologies.  It's just another like Web 2.0.  It's just renamed and kind of tweaked a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's really Canon and Toshiba, two people you normally don't associate with display technologies per se.  I mean, the cameras and broadcast equipment, sure.  But this is their baby as far as introducing not only a flat display technology, which initially they'll be 55 inches.  At least that's what they reported back in CES.  But it also offers performance on a level above and beyond any other flat panel you can buy today, which, you know, yes, when they first released, they will be expensive.  No, I'll tell you something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean it won't work.  We've seen them, haven't we?  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys saw a lab version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they had a dozen of them at least.  They had a dozen.  What were they?  Thirty six inch 720p displays for demonstration purposes, showing everything from full motion video to rather challenging scenes.  Yes, it's all set up on their back end and hand massaged and whatnot.  But as a demonstration product and after looking at enough bad TVs this past year in the consumer side of things, yeah, they have a potential technology that could easily end up wiping the floor with plasmas and the LCD market as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So would you delay?  I mean, they say they won't start manufacturing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we put some money on this dead end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not going to start manufacturing for another year.  They won't start shipping for another year and a half.  So this could be.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the latest projected numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Toshiba and Canon are saying now.  They're starting production in July 2007 and they want to get out by Q4 just in time for the 2008 Olympics, I think is what they're shooting for.  Perfect timing.  Which does maybe give some credence to what John's saying.  I mean, if they had production models in January, but they're still not going to start making them till July 2007, there may be some issues they still have to resolve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but then the guy in the New York Times today said that broadcast television is dead anyway.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we still will watch TVs, won't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, there was a lot of little TVs at the thing, but they didn't have any of those said that I saw.  All right.  I mean, there could have been.  You have to remember that CBIT is a the number of the they actually calculate the number of miles of aisles there are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  So how is it that you refuse to go to CES, which is a show arguably say 10 times smaller.  You end up at CBIT, which is the granddaddy of all consumer electronic shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why.  And it's a pretty simple reason is that the CES is over covered by American journalists and CBIT's not.  I mean, whatever I cover there is pretty much nobody else is covering it.  I mean, there's nobody that they have very few writers there from from the USA.  So nobody gets any information.  Basically, I'm just reinventing the wheel down at CES.  So what's the point?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been interesting.  Watch like Engadget and a couple other places have been doing some pretty good.  Do they send some people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Engadget is doing they're doing the best job covering these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're coming on strong.  That's an interesting choice for them is maybe they become the trade show.  Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, as far as said, one last comment was that it is a new technology and you could have said something very similar about the whole cost.  The liquid crystal.  We did.  I think we did.  You could say that, you know, why bring in another technology that has, you know, it's going to have to compete against the LCD reproduction and the DLP  reproduction.  They're so firmly entrenched right now.  Yet now anybody who's in the in a market seriously for a new TV using reprojection is L cost offers the best of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a year ago we were saying L cost was dead that they could they couldn't get the chips out.  The companies had given up.  I'm going back to that point of view, by the way.  Well, Sony seems to be doing pretty well with its L cost displays.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not saying that you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's impossible to make these things.  But I was hanging out with one of the guys from one of the electronic buyers guide or electronic products, Hearst publication.  And he's like kind of setting me straight on some of these things.  And L cost is still a little bit on the cusp.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting projectors or for full size screens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything.  Just on the cusp period.  There's some issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only a projection technology.  That's all it is.  Well, that's why I said is exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's basically a projection.  The problem with the projection technology is essentially is the Samsung invention.  I guess everybody's going to start doing this.  The elimination of the color wheel with with with LEDs.  Yeah, they're going to use.  And once you eliminate the color wheel, I mean, there's no moving parts and things change.  The cost structure changes dramatically.  And also you've gotten rid of the replaceable bulb and you replace it with with LEDs.  Next time, you know, that's thing.  I mean, it's going to be it's going to be hard to compete with that kind of thing for projectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was going on with RFIDs?  There's a lot of RFID there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just seems to me that they're going to just RFID everything.  All of Europe wants to put RFIDs on everything so they can track shipping shipments of trucks and everything else.  It's mostly for tracking.  But you can just see it just headed to, you know, having people track to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you get the sense that they're less concerned in Europe about privacy than we are here in the States?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're just going to be coming up in the conversation with RFIDs.  I can tell you that's the first thing that comes up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You talk about what item that you buy in any major retailer doesn't have an RFID tag on it in this country.  You walk into anything that has that protection system as you walk out of a.  But they take it off, right?  No, they do.  Or they fry the chip internally before they hand it to you.  I mean, because you look at like a DVD packaging.  The chip itself is built into the packaging and then they just simply sack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what that white strip is? That little white strip that's in there?  Yeah, a little gobble, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an RFID tag.  A puffy plastic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not an actual RFID tag.  Sure it is.  Are you sure?  Yeah, it contains info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, anything you put a serial number to and scan it or say, yes, I belong here or not here.  It's a crude version.  Same things you put in your Hamel or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's inevitable.  I think GPS everywhere, RFID everywhere, and then nobody will ever get lost again.  No, no, no body, no thing will ever get lost again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's that's a wishful thing.  And then now I'm not even wishing for it.  I'm dreading it. Are you kidding?  Well, yeah, no, but I mean, it's you're still going to be able to get lost.  There's going to be coverage problems.  You know, there's going to be this half year.  There's still be huge swaths of the, you know, the American West that doesn't have cell phone coverage.  I mean, Procter & Gamble, it's like nuts.  They're claiming, you know, if they RFID tag everything, they're claiming that they can get some insane like save it like a billion dollars a year by producing, you know, lost product lost in shipping and shrinkage.  But then the then you turn around and you look and you start to realize that, you know, RFID tags don't work really well.  If you would say have, you know, six containers full of dishwashing soap because the RF gets absorbed by the liquid inside the containers.  You know, there's still a lot of stuff to be worked out to make this work.  I have faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there are more of them out there than we think.  I bought a shirt a couple of weeks ago, you know, and they took off the big white plastic tag and I got it home and a little tiny tag was inside the shirt.  So I'm not sure that we're not all carrying on more tags than we think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying here.  Yeah.  Where there's no privacy.  So what do you have to do? Just microwave everything you buy, I guess.  Well, I've been looking.  I mean, you know, a number more and more phones, you know, phones have had GPS capability or location capability for a long time.  But more and more phones are supporting things like TeleNav where you basically your phone is a GPS device and you just dial it in and it's pretty cool.  And when it works, it's great.  Yeah, it's a great idea.  So we, of course, the Intel Developers Forum was going on in Silicon Valley this week and Intel actually scooped Microsoft by showing the origami a little bit early.  But they also showed some new chips and of all things, a water cooling system for overclockers.  We sent Will, well, we didn't send him.  He was there.  But we talked to Will Harris from BitTech, which is a great UK enthusiast site.  And he gave us his lowdown on the Intel Developers Forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff there this time.  The big news was Intel released what it calls its new core microarchitecture, which is going to debut in its new processors, which are called Conroe.  And Conroe is going to be the chip basically that ends up in the new Apple Max.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Conroe is the successor to Core Duo?  Well, it's sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of the successor to the old Pentium 4.  And so when Apple says, well, we're going to hold off on replacing the Power Max until the end of the year, they're waiting for this chip basically.  Is it Yona part two or where does it fit in the roadmap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an evolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you take the original Pentium M, which was such a massive success for Intel because it turns out, hey.  Israeli designers who are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Israeli guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turns out, you know, we can make a really high powered processor that really doesn't consume any heat.  And they said, well, let's move that onto the desktop.  And so this is what you've seen now with Core Duo and Core Solo, which is in all the new Mac stuff.  And that was codenamed Yona, right?  And those were, gosh, yes, Yona and I think Benias.  Benias was Pentium M. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Yona was a successor to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have too many codenames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. And now so Conroe is the successor to Yona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Conroe is the successor to that.  And there's three products.  There is a Conroe, which is desktop, Meron, which is laptop and Woodcrest, which is server, which you don't really care about.  But they're all based on this new core micro architecture, which is instead of doing instead of having everything go faster and scaling clock speeds all the time, we'll make it more efficient and we'll make it wider.  So the core micro architecture has like four execution engines in each core instead of three compared to the last generation.  So immediately you just add on a bunch of capacity there.  It's got all kinds of new logic engines for rearranging and combining processor instructions and better ways of accessing memory.  And it's got a more intelligent way of sharing cash between the dual cores.  And basically it's just designed to be really efficient, really fast, really sleek.  It's going to deliver a hell of a lot more performance for a hell of a lot less power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it all dual core?  Will they have a solo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all dual core from now on, I think.  They don't care about solo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not at all.  How about quad core?  Is that what you even talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely not.  So they actually demoed for the first time quad core in a gaming chip.  Oh my God.  There's a gaming chip called, I think it's called Kent's Field, which is due to arrive in January 2007.  And that is four physical cores.  It's going to be fast as heck.  They showed it playing, do you know the Guild Wars MMO?  So they showed it running Guild Wars.  And you know, it looked pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet it looked pretty good.  Now, are they hyperthreading these at all or is that gone?  That's dead.  I think they're dropping hyperthreading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hyperthreading was a great way to get people introduced to the idea of parallelism.  But it's really not that efficient now when you've got so much actual hardware to do that instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now on bittech.net, I know you've benchmarked Conroe already.  I don't know how you did it so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we had, I mean, we were kind of lucky.  We had Intel decided, you know, hey, we actually quite like you guys.  We'll let you come and have a go on this system.  That's fantastic.  And so the guys at Anantek actually got to spend a fair amount of time just benchmarking it.  Intel had a Conroe system and an AMD FX60 system.  If you know the AMD product line, the FX60 is like the hardcore gamer product.  And they were showing, hey, this is a lot faster than the AMD system.  And Anantek published that.  But then there was lots of controversy about like, well, hey, you're publishing results for an AMD system that's being configured by Intel.  Right. So who knows what they've done to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. That's a little suspicious. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when we went in, we had the chance and we said, hey, actually, forget about the AMD system in the corner.  We just want you to run one of our benchmarks on the Conroe system so we can compare it to all the systems that we've done in the labs back home.  And you use fear for your demo.  Yeah. So fear was something they had installed.  It was fairly easy to run.  And it's something that we've seen in our labs is gives a really good indication of CPU scaling.  If you crank back the resolution and you crank back all the details, basically you become you take the graphics out of the equation.  You become really CPU limited as to how fast can the CPU just keep churning this stuff out. Perfect.  Absolutely. So we ran that on there and we compared it to our results from the labs back home.  And it was just stonking. Oh, it's amazing.  It was it was really, really like an order of magnitude faster even than our really well configured AMD system at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your Pentium XC 955, which is your reference, was 213 frames per second, which, by the way, is pretty fast.  That's really hundred forty six for Conroe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And even better, you know, you take the top end system, you can buy an FX 60 machine that was two hundred and fifty three.  You're adding on like a whole nother hundred frames a second. It's more than 30 percent faster.  Yeah. So it looks really, really, really good. That's that's truly amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so Conroe is the thing to look at. I know they also showed, though, prototypes of origami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have another product. Yeah. So they kind of pre announced that for Microsoft.  Yeah. Microsoft must be a little annoyed. Well, I mean, they made a big thing about, you know, we're going to answer that on Thursday at Seabed in Germany.  But of course, you know, we're all standing around on Monday going, hey, we're looking at this right now.  Here it is. Yeah. And so they had a bunch of different concept machines.  They had a couple of actual retail machines that they were showing.  And it was I know I'm not sure I can get very excited about it.  It's it's it's kind of like just a tablet PC, but a bit smaller, but not really small enough.  Right. Like you can put it in your pocket. No, I agree.  Maybe you can put it in a handbag.  Since I don't carry one, I don't know about you guys. Yeah.  Yeah. It's not got a cell phone in it. Right.  And so it's not like you can replace your cell phone.  So so it's kind of just like, well, I'll take it on the plane and watch some movies.  But what else am I actually going to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft just won't let go of this tablet PC idea.  And in fact, this is not much different than their tablet that they announced.  I can't remember if it was called the HPC.  The idea was you'd you'd kind of be sitting in your living room controlling your TV with it, which it's just never caught on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it doesn't really work.  And it's certainly not you know, when when the origami speculation came out, it was, you know, Microsoft is readying an iPod killer.  And this is certainly not by any stretch of the imagination, an iPod killer.  It's an entirely different usage model.  I don't think it's a usage model that's as popular.  I mean, you got to spend out what, like a thousand bucks on one of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking to Will Harris. He's the editor at bit dash tech dot net, a British tech enthusiast website, a great website.  He's been at the Intel Developers Forum for the last few days.  I noted that Don McDonald took a little swipe at Apple at his keynote.  Tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. Well, I mean, Don is a fellow Brit and he's got a kind of wry sense of humor.  He doesn't like to be outdone on anything, I don't think.  I mean, he invented the marketing concept for Sentrino.  So he's a pretty clever guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he was saying, you know, basically he alluded to the fact, you know, jobs in his keynote a while back when he announced front row were saying, hey, we've got this new Apple remote.  And it's only got six buttons.  It kind of looks like an iPod shuffle.  Look at how stupidly complicated our competitors remote controls are.  And they showed the Windows Media remote, right, which has like 50 buttons on it or something.  Crazy. Yeah.  I mean, kind of skipping over the fact that Windows Media Center does about, you know, five times the thing that front row does.  You only need six buttons on front row.  Absolutely. We'll gloss over that.  But Don said, you know, hey, we thought of the challenge was, can we make a remote control with no buttons?  Can we best Steve Jobs?  And so he showed some basically voice control of Windows Media Center.  So basically the premise was you say, hey, computer, what time is Family Guy on TV?  And the computer goes, let me think about that.  And it searches the guide for Family Guy and brings you up.  And then you can say, hey, record this episode of Family Guy and it will automatically record it for you.  So does it work?  Well, the problem was it took him about five goes to actually get it to work.  Standing on the stage going, computer, what time is Family Guy on?  I don't really know what you're talking about.  That's my problem with all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly what always happens.  If computer light on, on, and you end up shouting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, absolutely. And the trouble is, you know, you've got multiple systems in your house and you say computer, record Family Guy.  And you've got five systems in the same room, all start recording Family Guy, you know.  So that wasn't particularly a compelling demonstration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything else you saw there that you found of interest to the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they had, you're aware of the sort of the kind of liquid cooling enthusiast hobby of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw this on your site.  They got an extreme addition of five gigahertz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So the idea is that, you know, you see for years, for years we've had water cooling systems in PCs.  Where you have a reservoir and a pump and you throw that around with some tubing.  That's pretty cool, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're quieter, they're cooler. You can overclock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But Intel has decided, well, hey, we're going to try and take this to the next level.  We want to we want to make something that does the same thing, but which we can ship in a whole bunch of systems.  You can't really ship a water cooling system because, you know, a tube bursts, you got water going everywhere.  It's a it's a real pain.  So they said, well, we're going to we're going to make a water block that sits on the CPU.  We're going to integrate a centrifugal pump into the water block.  So that all is like one solid unit.  And then we're just going to have that go through some metal pipes to a heat exchanger, like a traditional radiator.  And what they did was, you know, Intel's R&D is pretty has a pretty nice budget, has a lot of expertise.  And they were just able to take this concept of water cooling far beyond what the kind of niche industry that it always has been has been able to do.  And so they had, yeah, a Pentium Extreme Edition, which ships at three point eight gigahertz, and they had that up over five gigahertz.  Wow.  Still operating well, well within temperature ranges that are acceptable.  Wow. And it was just sort of like, wow, you can suddenly it's going to be fifty dollars because they made sure that when they created it, they used easily available components, you know, stuff that if you're a CPU maker, you can just go and get out of China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works on an ATX motherboard or a BTX. Yeah.  And it works on either of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just, you know, you plonk it on, you set up a heat exchanger, make sure the pipes are OK.  And it looks like a really elegant solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it a little strange to see Intel promoting overclocking?  I mean, it seems like that's the last thing they'd want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that is exactly what I said to the guys.  And actually, you know, it's quite a good story.  There is inside Intel, you know, Intel, as you say, is a very kind of anti-overclocking, very by the book.  There is a little team of enthusiasts that works in the Intel R&D department.  And they had this like a secret society and they have a meeting every week.  You know, on a Friday, they go and find like a spare room somewhere in Intel.  It's like invitation only.  You can't turn up unless you've been like verified as one of these enthusiastic kind of people.  And they just sit there and brainstorm ways to make Intel products more friendly to enthusiasts.  You know, these guys are enthusiasts themselves.  What a great job.  And so they set up these secret clubs and now they've done stuff like so they got this product green lighted and they got it, you know,  you're going to see this being rolled out for the rest of the year as a really good and out of the box performance cooling system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would buy it in a minute, especially coming from Intel.  You know it's going to work, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's been, you know, verified.  It's going to work for at least three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And are they saying to use it? Are they saying to overclock with it or are they just saying use this?  Absolutely.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're putting more overclocking features onto their main boards.  One of the things they also showed was that they've started putting heat sinks on the voltage regulators on the motherboard.  And of course, the only reason you'd ever put heat sinks on a voltage regulator on a motherboard is to crank up the voltage regulators a lot.  And so they're really getting Intel to move away from this.  Hey, we're not going to we're not going to do anything in this area to hey, actually, maybe we could make some money in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, this works so well.  I think hell is actually freezing over right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  And I think, you know, they really are starting to get it a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will, I want to thank you so much.  This has been great to get to your perspective on the Intel Developer Forum, which is wrapping up.  We're just wrapped up. We're recording this on Thursday the 9th.  For more information, bit.net.  You're going to put more articles up.  There's some great stuff on there.  And I have to say this is going to be a bookmarking.  It's going to be a regular visit.  Well, thank you very much.  Thanks very much for having me.  I really appreciate it.  Will Harris, editor of bit.net with the IDF update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Leo, before you go to that, I'm going to take off.  OK, so I'll see you guys next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm actually we're back already.  Well, never mind.  I'll let you back.  But I will let you go because it is like getting it's almost two o'clock in the morning.  So yeah, I got to get to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to get to early plane tomorrow.  I'm only staying up because of our fantastic fans who listen to the show.  Thank you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to be back next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be back. I'm going to be back tomorrow.  I mean, essentially.  So I'll see you guys.  Thank you, John.  Thanks.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good night. Good night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, speaking of Intel and Microsoft, what's the what's the story about EFI?  I wasn't familiar with the EFI until you pointed it out to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Let me bring that up.  And then I would like to get kind of especially Robert and Patrick, your take on Intel's announcements at IDF, because there's some interesting stuff coming out of there.  One of the kind of surprising announcements from Microsoft this week was that they are not going to support the new EFI BIOS, something they co jointly developed with Intel in Vista.  They're going to stick with the 20 year old BIOS, which is kind of a surprise.  It's just one more thing that's being pulled out of Vista.  If you ask me, EFI stands for the Extensible Firmware Interface.  And irony of ironies, Apple's already using it in their Intel Macs.  And I think one of the reasons people paid attention to this, although I don't think it's the most important part of the story, is that it means that Vista won't boot on any of these Mac intels because they need EFI support.  But more than that, I mean, I think it's it's it's Microsoft saying, God, we can't even we can't even support our own technology EFI in our brand new operating system.  What's going on with Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think they're doing it for 64 bit PCs, not 32 bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say they're going to it won't appear until Vista Server Edition in it requires 64 bit.  But Mac, Mac's doing it with 32 bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could that be the reason or the means that they will keep the OS from migrating so easily then to the Apple platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to, though, I don't understand why they want to prevent that.  It's more money for more money for them if they sell more if it runs on more hardware, why would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or will this also give the Windows side with all of its with its user base as big as it is?  Will that just give more people the option then to try out the OS on their existing hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe that's it.  Maybe it's an upgrade issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, some of the reports I'm reading on this is it will Vista will support EFI on 64 bit processors.  Windows XP will support it through what basically amounts to a compatibility module.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Andrew Ritz, who's the Microsoft development manager.  He was talking IDF.  He said there will never be any support for booting Windows via EFI on systems with 32 bit processors will only be on 64 bit.  And EFI will not be seen in any version of Windows until the release of Longhorn server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but aren't they supposed to deliver server at the same time?  Yeah, but nobody's but are you buying server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to buy you just can buy Vista, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he just said it's not going to appear anywhere until that maybe that means they just need to finish the code and then they can maybe they'll put in everything then because they've also said in the they've also said that.  Yeah, I mean 64 bit processors and they've also said in other places that there will fundamentally be a bootstrapping device to get EFI to get older operating system for EFI.  I'll be interested if they draw the line on that because, you know, they've been doing some funny things that's, you know, reek of forced operating system upgrades lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It said that it's Windows XP that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they said Friday Windows XP will boot under EFI when a compatibility support module is present.  When it is.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, when they ship that.  It said the decision to quote reprioritize EFI development to the server version of Windows was based on lack of available desktop PCs with EFI.  So it's a it's a court.  It's a chicken and egg thing where they nobody supports it so they don't have to support it in the software.  And then again, quoting Ritz.  No combination of factors changed our plans.  The big one, in my opinion, was platform availability with this huge move to 64 bit based platforms.  And for us to support it, we needed to see a large heterogeneous sample of 64 bit implementation.  So basically they're saying there's not enough 32 bit hardware out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So does it mean that for us Mac hardware fans that the Windows issue is completely dead or is this something that's hackable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's dead for now.  Yeah, I mean, once they release the module, I suppose you could do it.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I would I'm always pleasantly surprised, shocked and amazed by what hackers come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you saw the Linux running on a nano and they've got MAME running on Linux running Pacman on a nano.  So, in fact, somebody built a little arcade case that was nano size.  You insert the name to the arcade.  That's cool.  I didn't see if it had a little tiny little track ball.  But obviously, you're right.  There are people with a lot more time on their hands than common sense.  So what about this?  You know, the first thing that shocked me was that I mean, there were some very interesting stuff out of IDF.  But I think when Will said that Intel was showing a water cooled system and encouraging overclocking, I mean, that's a shocker.  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intel has also admitted that AMDs are running faster and Intel's two years they've they've gone from, you know,  clock speed on processor is the most important marketing tool we have in the retail market space to doing like the BMW style numbering system.  They've gone, you know, and now they're saying it's all about reducing power consumption, right?  All about making corporate buyers happy and also, hey, reducing your home electricity bill.  So they're, you know, they're fine.  I think they're finally reacting to AMD success and saying what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how many people how I mean, is it going to cost them anything that people are overclocking Intel processors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think, you know, I don't know how much they were excited about overclocking so much as they were, you know, the Intel advanced liquid cooling technology.  They were. They certainly were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they but I remember for the Pentium four launch, though, they did a similar thing where they at least they showed what cooler they were using.  But I believe they had a completely sealed box.  They just sat there and ramped up the the front side bus speed until the thing finally froze.  But it hit like four and a half gigahertz back in the day when it actually meant something true.  True. It's nice to actually see them come up with a decent cooler that can actually support.  Hey, maybe their previous Prescott parts as well, which were incredibly notorious for being argued the hottest CPUs you could put into a computer in their own Intel's own coolers.  Sometimes weren't enough under certain case designs and certain airflow designs to keep up with the heat that thing was capable of putting off.  So it's nice to see them focusing on as much as as much as the low power per per computing part.  You know, the fact that they can make them more efficient and change the the architecture to, you know, do more with fewer pipelines and also the smaller build processes.  But just on top of that, put a good cooler on top that you can see.  You know what? Here, even if you want to overclock down the road, you'll have the headroom and the coolers available for you to do that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as Will said, new chip architecture, Conroe, Merrim and Woodcrest for respectively desktop, laptop and server.  What do you think of these Conroe chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm watching people who cover chips for a living that are literally like.  I mean, we had Lloyd Case was on talking about Conroe on Thursday's episode of DLTV.  And he's just stoked because they're looking at phenomenal performance improvements and phenomenal reductions in power consumptions and a pretty heavy re architecture that, you know, if it, you know,  we'll wait until we actually have the chips in our hands to test them, but it looks like they're going to be unbelievably fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will's site had a, did have some bench. They were able to do some benchmarking at IDF.  And yes, absolutely stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see, I want to see, you know, I want to see, I want to see shipping parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I agree. I agree. It always looks good when they're doing the demo, but still pretty, pretty impressive.  And as Will said, this is clearly the chip that Apple was waiting for, for its high end machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the desktop.  Yeah. Yeah.  And it's amazing. I mean, they've, they've dropped the, they dropped into a 14 stage pipeline instead of a 30 stage pipeline, you know, which slows down the clock frequency, but makes it a lot more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it funny because for a long time, the push was how big can we make this pipeline? And then they hit Prescott and it was, oh my God, it's not working anymore.  We've, we've gone too far. So they're pulling way back on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty cool. I mean, you know, each, each side of the core has 64 KB L1 cache.  And there's like four megabytes of shared L2 cache. And then the sharing on the four megabytes L2 cache is dynamic.  It's going to be, I mean, it's going to be really interesting. It's going to be interesting to watch this. Does the Condra does for desktop performance and Merrim does for mobile performance.  You know, and they're saying like the, you know, this, a lot of this doesn't actually require one of the things they've done is they've set it up to the SSC instructions.  We'll take the entire like the SSC engine at 128 bits so they can now a single clock cycle execute all, you know, an entire all the SSC instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Awesome. Yeah. And you really see benefit there in transcoding and coding and 3D gaming.  You really see a big, big improvement anytime you're working with a massive data.  That's where you're really going to get some benefit of that. So that's going to be, I mean, it's going to be interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's supposed to ship by, you know, the end of this spring. So if you're thinking about buying a notebook, man, or a desktop, it might be worth waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Merrim notebook would be pretty awesome. I mean, I think that that might be the notebook I'm waiting for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So Q2, Q3 of 2006. That's when it's coming out. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any other stories you guys, we pretty much have used up our allotted time. Is there anything else you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One thing I liked that I saw at the E-Tech was a company, EVDB, the events and venues database. Yeah, I like them.  Yeah, they've got some great stuff. Brian Deer, who was formerly with MP3.com, is heading that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to be the IMDB of concerts and shows and events. They already are actually. They're doing a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, they don't have the scale perhaps yet, but they came up with a really interesting concept there, which they call eventful demand.  And it's just interesting because you go to the site and you decide what event you'd like to see.  And you create that event, then people participate and vote or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think you're going to see that as an interesting sort of a way for fans to kind of get back to the promoters and say, hey, we, you know, we need a Beatles reunion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just it's an interesting twist on one of the theme of the show this year was the attention economy.  And as Doc Searls has said, maybe what it ought to be is the intention economy.  And so this is turning around and putting it in the hands more of the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I have to say some of the demands are kind of interesting. I'm looking right now. This is brand new.  They've just launched it. But demand number one, they want to see the impeachment of George W. Bush at the Washington Metro Arena.  So obviously some people are being a little silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought this was kind of like Polestar only with interaction.  What's Polestar?  And what's the deal with the fans and stuff?  Well, Polestar is basically tracks pretty much if not pretty much all the major acts that tour in North America list their list their tours on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the top vote getters right now is our buddy, Will Wheaton.  They want him to do an event at the San Diego Metro area in the San Diego metro area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think it's sort of a it's a you know, it's meetup.  It's flash mobs. It's all this sort of coming together in another form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's only a matter of time before people start putting twit on the road.  And I just want to stop you right there because unless you're going to pay for it, we can't go on anywhere.  It's tough enough to get everybody together by Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many people would pay five dollars a piece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if we get it, you know, if we see a thousand people on there saying, you know, come to Tucson, I guess we would have to come to Tucson.  You know, don't you think if they all came, that's the problem.  You get the hall, you get all dressed up and you go and then five people show up and we're in trouble.  Maybe we should take the money first.  You pay us and then we'll show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then we'll show up.  And I do want to put in a plug.  The Podcast Academy is holding a new event at Boston University at the end of April.  Go to podcastacademy.org and you can get more podcasting in two days than you'd ever want to see.  How much does it cost to take the Academy?  It is if you do it before March 15th, it's only two hundred and fifty dollars.  That's great.  Which includes some meals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those of you who don't know what the Podcast Academy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Podcast Academy is part of the Conversations Network.  That's the nonprofit network that brings you IT conversations.  And the Podcast Academy is doing four events around the country this year and hopefully one in Australia in January to train people in the basics of podcasting.  That's great.  And part of what we do is to record those events and we'll be putting those online as free online courses in podcasting technology and tools.  As always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I should point out, it's really good, wholesome, nuts and bolts information and not just like go out and buy a $700 microphone.  We've got some great people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, at this one, we've got Tony Khan from WGBH will be talking.  We've got Michael Gohagen from Grape Radio and who produces the Disney podcast.  We've got people who are really in the top tier of podcasting and public radio talking about everything from the technology to the business side to podcasting and education.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds wonderful.  Podcastacademy.org.  I was going to say, OK, podcastacademy.org.  Of course, IT Conversations is at ITConversations.com.  And that's a great place to find about 3000 podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I forgot to tell you that membership in the Conversations Network is now free.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We discovered that none of our social tools were being used if we made them available to paid members only.  So it's a nonprofit, but guest membership is now free to everyone.  That's great. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us.  Appreciate it, Doug.  It's always great to talk to you.  A lot of fun.  Thanks for your update on e-tech.  Yeah.  Have a great day.  Thank you.  I want to thank also, of course, you, Patrick Norton and Robert Heron for stopping by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you know who we had on the show on Thursday?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who?  We actually had Jeff Heemos.  Excuse me, Jeff Bates, aka Heemos from Slashdot.  Oh, how cool.  Which is really funny.  Oh, you're getting some great people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did he talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talked to him a bunch about sort of the history of Slashdot and how it came together and also  about some of the stuff that's coming in the future, which includes some pretty serious  mods to the interface involving Ajax.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, our friend Kevin has rolled out Ajax commenting now in the dig, and it looks really  slick.  I'm sure Heemos and Commander Taco are looking at that going, hmm, we're going to do a little  Ajax ourselves.  A little Ajax in there.  to see that show and all of the shows.  And of course, John C. Dvorak's new Cranky Geeks, which is a lot of fun.  I look forward to another one of those.  And Robert Heron, of course, joins you every day on DLTV, too.  Am I right?  You are.  Right I am.  Thursdays.  On Thursdays.  No, you do Tuesday and Thursdays.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Two a week.  But every day you can watch one if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you can watch them over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to watch live.  You can watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Much like my relationship to Twitter.  Over and over.  A day without Twitter is like a day without sunshine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Patrick.  Our thanks to AOL Radio for providing us with the bandwidth and broadcasting the show on  their podcast channel.  AOL.com slash podcasting.  If you want to know more, subscribe.  It's a great online radio service.  You know, we're going to have our first advertisement on Twitter in a couple of months, I think.  Just one.  We're going to...  I'll tell you when the time comes.  But it's just one.  I just thought it'd be kind of interesting.  Will it be beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The middle?  Will you read it out?  No, it's going to be pre-recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be at the beginning.  It'll be short.  It's...  I can't tell you what it is yet.  But the only reason we're doing it is just to see what happens.  Hooters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm very excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Robert, by the way, we will be looking for an endorsement from you.  Indeed.  Alright, guys.  Have a great afternoon.  You know, the Sopranos are on tonight.  I'm going to check out early because I've got to get my Z in the oven to start baking.  Have a great day.  Another twit is in the can.  Alright.  I should have paid attention.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Too much work.  The problem is, there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have a hell of a time.  What blue screen's like?  Forget it.  I'm killing you.  Hehehehe.
