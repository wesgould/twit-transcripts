Dvorak at Dvorak.org slash blog.  Hello John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello. You know I'm also a twitterer now.  Why are you a twitterer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When he started twittering. Oh I know. It's the real Dvorak by the way. So it's twitter.com slash  the real Dvorak. You've already got 5000 followers in a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry are there are there fake Dvoraks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah there's a John C. Dvorak that's a fake and there's another Dvorak that's a fake. So I'm the real  Dvorak and yeah I figure I'm moving up the ladder. It's not like I need to have a million people  following the thing but it's kind of good to get into the point where you have enough people that  you can actually solicit them for you know information. It can be really useful. I mean it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's a you know when you get up to in the thousands you're starting it's a broadcast medium all of a  sudden you can reach a lot of people very quickly. I ask I ask questions all the time on there but  you get it you're doing interesting content you're putting you're giving them value for their buck  unlike others who just you know use it as a chat room. Yeah well you know I use it kind of as a chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  room in a kind of a meta sense because people ask me questions and so I chat with them kind of back  and forth through the replies or whatever but generally speaking when I just post I don't post  just my mundane daily life which is you know like everybody else. I ate cheese. I'm standing. Yeah.  I ate a cheese sandwich. Yeah. I just want to see something really cool that I think they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know about. I'll sit let them know. Well this is not going to be this week in Twitter but everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's another thing I promise all these people wouldn't talk about it. I know thank you for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  starting it off on a high note. By the way speaking of a high note well I'll talk about that in a  second. Also here another Twitter at Veronica she's a Veronica Belmont or should I say Veronica  Belmont the new host of Tekzilla. Yay. You threw me. I didn't think you would do that. I thought  you know when I heard you left Mahalo everybody said oh she's going to Tekzilla. I said why would  she do that. She wouldn't leave Mahalo go to Tekzilla because that's kind of a lateral move.  Was it really about being in LA and stuff like that or. Yeah there was a lot to it. I mean I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wanted to do more in tech and I wanted to be in San Francisco regularly which was starting to become  a problem. But it's not just Tekzilla. I mean Tekzilla is a day a week or so a little more  counting all the work that we put into it but there will be another project that I'm announcing  hopefully soon. That's more my full time job. Give us a hint. Mainstream media I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't give any hints. See this is my supposition was she's not going to leave Mahalo to go to  Tekzilla. That's lateral. She's going to take a mainstream job. She's going to CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No it's not CNN. It's not really a mainstream thing. You'll see it. Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Veronica are you watching the video because if you are turn it off because I think it's kind of  a hit in your. I'm not actually. Okay is there anything else going on there. Well let me introduce  the rest while we figure it out. Paul Therod is also here from our Windows Weekly show.  The author of the SuperSight for Windows wins supersight.com. Hey Paul. Hey how you doing? Have  we ever had you on Twitter before? Yeah it's a long time ago. Okay well it's about time we got  you back. Year and a half. Let's get back. I keep I ignore your invitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually I don't see them until after it's too late. That's why. Well you don't work on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  weekends. Now let me introduce our special guest because he has been on Twitter once before. We  did a Twitter from the Apple store a long time ago. Roger McGuinn the co-founder of the birds  and an absolute utter tech geek from his home in Florida. Hey Roger. Hi. Hey Lirio. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter 21 and it was it was really a thrill. It was great and you had the same problem back  then with your multiple inputs with Adobe Audition as I recall. Yeah it's inevitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact this is as the third anniversary of Twitter it is only fitting that we should have  all sorts of technical issues because that's basically been the story of Twitter from day one.  So is it recording all the tracks now? Yeah we're doing fine. I always have a back. I've learned one  thing from these many years. Always have a backup. But it's not it's not a multi-channel backup right?  But you know the truth is. Technology will never fail us. Yeah most of the time all we end up doing  is mixing it down anyway. It's you know it's almost like why bother recording it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Multi-track. That's just too fancy for me. It would be a lot of work to take all those

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  inputs and and moderate them. Yeah we used you know I used to try to do that. That's crazy. You  use the same program. In fact I think you're using the new Audition right? I'm a beta tester

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for I was. It's I think it's out now the Audition 3.0. Right. And it's got some good bells and  whistles and they pretty much copied Pro Tools down the line you know with the moving faders and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all the good stuff. Oh really? So do you have it hooked up to a mixer with flying faders? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I don't. It does it on the on the screen. I'm not really into to having a control surface. I  think that's just for the old timers who need that. Right. And you're not an old timer. Not when it  comes to. No I'm kind of a new engineer. I used to watch the old guys but I was never. One time I got  kicked out of the Columbia Records studio for moving a pot you know doing a board fade and the  union guys just walked out on me and I said that's it you know not allowed to touch the equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know it's still that way in some places when I do Regis and Kelly I'm not supposed to unpack my  own boxes. The grips come over and say oh that's a local 53's job and and you're not allowed to do  so much stuff you know it's really weird. Well unions are good for some people. Well hey I'm not  I'm pro labor but yeah sometimes unions do themselves in by being a little a little too  much feather bedding and a little kind of crazy. Yeah yeah. Roger has in fact we'll put this link  on our show notes he has designed his own solar ice machine and they did a story on him in the local  tv. It's really it's really great. You use a solar panel to make ice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right I've got four solar panels four deep cycle batteries and a couple of inverters and an ice  machine that runs on this and the idea is that we get these hurricanes here in Florida knocks the  power out and it's usually in the hot weather so you want to stay cool and we thought well we can  run electric fans and an ice maker it'd be cool. I only mentioned this to give you geek cred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Which he has because he also runs you run every you run your computers and stuff on solar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am I'm running all the laptops and cell phones and all the little stuff you know all the things  that you plug in with a wall where it's cool runs off the solar stuff. So speaking of touching pots

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the studio this is 420. You know you all know what that means.  Veronica I know you know what that means. What's that supposed to mean?  You're a young person you're hip you're with it you're cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. Did you know. If you think I'm that cool that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know that the 420 which is a day that stoners use in fact there are usually I remember  in Toronto last year the year before they get together like in some public space and publicly  flaunt the laws although in Toronto it's like ooh what are they going to the Mounties are going  to slap you. It's not exactly illegal in Toronto but they get together and they all smoke pot in  public because 420 day that's but this came I didn't know this. Dane told me our senior  producer here Dane Golden said this started at San Rafael High just down the road in 1971 the  kids would all leave class at 420 p.m. to to toke up at the Louis Pasteur statue and that's where

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the name 420 comes from. Really I always heard it was like the police code or something. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I went to snopes.com and it's not. All right. Although weirdly enough in 2004 Arnold  Schwarzenegger passed Senate Bill 2004 in California making uh regulating the illegal pot  sales in California the you know medicinal marijuana stuff that was SB 420 but that was  that was many years later. Anyway all right enough of that let's start talking tech because  there's a lot of stories in the news today. I hear you Veronica but I also hear little weep  beeps coming out of you. Really I'm not doing anything. Maybe it's me could be me.  Federal officials charge a California woman stealing IDs from the dead. So here's a nice little  here's a nice little twist. The Department of Commerce under the Freedom of Information Act  puts out a database of dead people. It's called the monthly death index and the idea of it has  it has the birth dates and social security numbers of people who have died. Wow. The theory is it  goes to banks and lending institutions so they can you know cross them off the records but this woman  Tracy June Kirkland is charged with going to rootsweb.com which is a genealogy site  accessing this database and then calling the credit card company saying oh yes you still have  my account open. I've like I've moved and and we'll give them a new address. Sometimes she'll even  add her own name to the credit card as a authorized user. She scammed hundreds of credit cards this  way including Nordstrom's Macy's and GE Money Bank. That's amazing. I love how it's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  supposed to prevent people from committing fraud. Yeah. Instead it's basically open up the door for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  her to get a lot of money out of it. It's on the rootsweb but it is public information and it's  only because these lenders don't do anything. They just ignore it. But they caught her right?  Yeah she's going to well she might go to jail if she's convicted. Accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably. She should have moved to the Cayman Islands or something. Is that where you you stash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your money? He wishes. I didn't hear a denial there. It's a good place to put it I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they don't they the banks don't do anything about it because the banks are a bunch of  sleazeball weasels and they just as soon make their life easier by overcharging everybody else  at a rate of 18 plus percent on the card which is the only reason you're paying those exorbitant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fees by the way. Yeah it's it's easier just to overcharge and not worry about the losses.  I got my credit card canceled. They called me up and said you just buy something in Australia  and then buy something in the US and I said yeah actually as a matter of fact I was just in  Australia now I'm back and they still canceled the card. Yeah. Sorry we already canceled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What card was this Leo? It's a visa. Oh because you know I I only use them I don't want to start  plugging things but I only use American Express because we don't want to get into debt to these  other companies and American Express makes you pay every month. Yeah you're right. But they they do  they have in fact I'll bring this I think I've talked about this before but they have a you know  a very good computer program and they know I travel a lot and I've always been shocked at like showing  up out of the blue after getting a tank full of gas in Munich you know and then I did have some  place else and they never bother me except once in a while I mean they do but it's always you know  in a very awkward situation or some something weird and I never had the card pulled but I was  at a lecture one time where the CEO or one of the top guys at American Express was there and I think  I've blogged this and I've talked about it before and it's actually a good thing to test.  He said they've got so many models that they can tell spot a stolen credit card rather quickly and  he says the one that you will always get a card pulled or you know you'll have your card stopped  on the spot is the following scenario that anyone out there can try and you'll see it works. Oh great.  You get you get two tanks full of gas in a row and then go buy some Nike shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you fill up your SUV, fill up your caddy and then go buy some Nike shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But actually another thing is they found that a lot of kids who are like kids you know little  scammers who have these cards the first thing they do is they fill up their gas tank and their buddies  and maybe another one because they got the card and then they go buy a bunch they start buying shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said that the gas thing is how they can test it because was it was this just seems like  I just had this conversation they could test it because then they can get away if you know the  merchant comes out and says hey wait a minute they just drive off. It makes sense though and of course  two tanks of gas would be right away would be a little suspicious. I mean who buys two tanks of gas

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in a row? Yeah. That makes sense. I do sometimes because I have a big van and a lot of places they  have a $50 cut off that won't fill in you know it fills it about halfway out so you know it'll  look like I bought two purchases of gas in a row. My suggestion Roger stick with Adidas.  I want to get an electric van that would be better. Yeah or an electric van either one. I just want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to pause for a second before we get back to the hilarity with our guests and welcome a brand new  sponsor this show.

Gotomeeting.com slash twit give  them a try I think you'll like it. So what is it what do you think of this guy in fact he's down  I think he's your way he's in Florida his name is Rudy Pedraza and he started a company called  PsyStar and they've adverse right pardon me yeah they they say they're gonna they're gonna sell  beige box clones yeah with a Macintosh OS 10 Leopard installed on it. Well it's just an Intel box

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's easy to say you're gonna sell such a thing but has anyone actually bought such a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's exactly what they said in Forbes they said okay let's see it who's got one of these  there there were some suspicious circumstances the guy's initial address was a residential address  then it was a warehouse district it changed very rapidly also the credit card on the site PsyStar  site they stopped taking credit cards saying that but he says the reason we moved is we had to move  to a big warehouse we've got six a 40,000 square foot warehouse we have 16 employees we're adding  four more because of all the demand he also said we ran so many cards through the credit card  service that they power pay that they locked our account maybe he bought some Nikes I don't know  and then yeah and then he went to PayPal where they also overloaded the account so he says it's  just because it's so popular he says we think we could do it Apple hasn't said anything yet  although it's pretty clearly a violation of the EULA they're buying you know full retail copies  of OS X and using you know hackintosh widely known hackintosh techniques to get it working on a beige

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  box it's open open source stuff so you know it's not really illegal to use it except for the EULA

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah I mean what's the worst Apple can do say oh you violated our EULA?  Yeah that's hard to enforce. I would like to see one what do you think John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you know this is going to be a test case let's face it I mean did somebody actually  somebody I think wrote on the blog or some place that whether or not this place is legitimate these  computers are going to be sold or whatever it's an interesting scenario for a test case for somebody  else to do you know can you can you can you do what's described you know take get this  operating system and commercialize it on the normal platform you'd probably have to turn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  off updates because Apple would change you know change I mean I think there's a they're thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of as a test for a legal test because why hasn't anyone tried this before that's what I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it in the first place in the first place what is skype's business model i mean how do they make  is there advertising i don't see any advertising on it you know what they they're doing no you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talking about skype interaction over i'm sorry ebay interaction over skype aren't you like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well ebay bought skype right for what for billions like four billion right but the idea being that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what people are going to talk to each other on the on the phone about their products or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well that's the problem so they i'm sorry they spent 3.1 billion dollars  they wrote down the value to 1.4 billion after concluding it's not going to match its earlier  hopes and the new ceo at ebay is saying if we don't find a way to to make you know john donahue  says if we can't figure out a way to make this work with our business and nobody else could figure  what it could be we we will probably sell it so what shouldn't they have come to this determination  before they spent before they spent 3.1 billion now here's the interesting thing skype had a 61  increase percent increase in its first quarter revenue this year 309 million users worldwide  isn't it the web 2.0 credo that you don't have to worry about a business model just get numbers  and the business model will follow i think you've told me that john yeah absolutely that's the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way the business is done in silicon valley that those people are worth about 20 bucks ahead so  why can't ebay figure out what to do with it i don't know ask them they're obviously uh you know  i'll tell you something ebay's never impressed me with with being able to develop any sort of  model other than the original one that they first came up with because even at one point  what during the era in the late 90s when everybody was taking this easy you know this huge capitalization  that they had accumulated because of the stock market and everything else in the in the post  bubble burst they they bought butterfield and butterfield and looked to me as they were going  to go into the the real auction business and have both the online thing locked up and then take over  the world because they had enough capitalization to do it so they bought butterfield and butterfield  i thought they were going to buy christie's and they could have bought the whole group and then  they just no no no it's too much work and so they bailed out on everything and they went right back  to their original model pes dispensers it's all about the pes dispensers i don't think they have  any real collect those that's how it started you know yeah it's all and that and then those crappy  little dolls those little uh those what are those things called those squeeze things from tie those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no i agree i mean i can see i can see why they would think that skype would be a good purchase  for them i can you know i can kind of get it how you know people could call each other nobody else  can but i don't think people are really interested in doing that how would it integrate with ebay's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  business though what are you saying you call the seller and say hey dude that pes dispenser way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  overpriced and chat talk ask for things maybe ask for details exactly but you could do that whether  ebay owned skype or not they had the money it's too much human interaction though people don't  actually want to talk to each other about that kind of thing i don't even want to talk to you  i barely want to talk to you guys right now yeah and and by the way the ebay typically ebay users

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  aren't necessarily uh you know the types that are going to be into all these gizmos and gadgets and  screwiness i mean they may not be able to figure out how to use skype now if the whole thing was  in asia they're probably all mac users yeah for europe  hey i'm trying the best i can i'm looking for my rim shot sorry the podcast is huge in asia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everything it's not faster you know it's it's underpowered it just takes a long time to do  anything but and it's got some weird uh kind of you know the operating things i mean if you want  to play a video you have to go to this other thing that starts up uh you know like a little star and  it goes up into another thing and it is weird isn't it yeah it's the whole interface the networking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stuff is kind of cool though you can see all the available networks the mesh yeah yeah oh and also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it won't it won't play youtube videos at all oh well it won't play flash video from youtube and  let's see what else so it's kind of like the iphone yeah well right and when you're in gmail  there's no cursor in the reply box so you have to kind of guess that where you know and sometimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it works and sometimes it doesn't well it wasn't really designed to do email and play youtube  videos it's designed for schools it's k-6 schools and i i mean maybe we have trouble with the  interface because we're used to macs and windows maybe a kid that never has used a computer i mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  how can someone get used to a computer using this thing and then move to a mac or a windows  machine that's true it's so different i don't even understand so you think intel's classmate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  undermined it's like why does he get the the monopoly on this idea it doesn't make any sense  to me that he should be complaining it's supposed to be like throwing laptops out to the to the poor  people in africa and every place else why would somebody say well you're gonna do it too with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're stepping on my toes in nick's defense he's never done that but you could just tell that the  steam's coming out of his ears but he's he's been very careful because i think he knows it would be  unseemly he's been very careful not to say it out loud i just you can point to any low-cost laptop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and there are a bunch coming out now and in the future and i think almost any one of them would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's not the hardware is okay it's just the interface is so screwy i i don't like the interface  you know i don't know who designed this or how but it's just so well it's red hat it's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some version of red hat but there's a but there's a big python interface on it called sugar  sugar i think it's sugar and then there's a squeak is on it too which is a small talk implementation  i mean i think in some ways this would be i i would love to do as an experiment give it to a
