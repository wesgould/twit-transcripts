Transcript:  Joining us from Midlothian. No,  where? Cheltenham in the UK.  Cheltenham. Cheltenham. Very nice  to have all of you here. Also  joining us just for a little bit  at the beginning, Steve Gibson,  our security guy. Steve has been  following closely, kind of  waiting for the other shoe to  drop on this encryption thing.  Of course, as we all know, the  Department of Justice dropped  their suit against Apple saying  never mind, we got it. We figured  it out, no problem. They've also  admitted that they only can do it  with older iPhones, that they  cannot decrypt newer iPhones. And  Steve, just to kind of get people  up to date, you were at one point  working on your own crypto  program, weren't you? Right. I

Start time: 256.85

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had laid out all of the  architecture for a VPN called  CryptoLink, which was going to  make it super simple, basically  solve a lot of the annoyances and  problems that people have, for  example, configuring and setting  up OpenVPN and then also using it  in the real world by simultaneously  sending packets out to attempt to  open multiple ports to find a way  out of a local network over to the  VPN server and a bunch of stuff.  But thanks to the Security Now  podcast every week, and our  continual looking at what was  going on, a few years ago, I was  sort of reading the tea leaves  and I decided to suspend that  whole project because it became  clear to me that the whole  question of whether we were going  to ultimately be allowed to have  truly unbreakable encrypted  communication, and I think that  the issue of the communications  was still not a settled issue.

Start time: 319.00
End time: 382.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And of course, shortly after you  decided not to do CryptoLocker,  Ledar Levison of LavaBit abruptly  went out of business, we found out  later, because the FBI had  insisted that he hand over the  keys to all of his customers'  encrypted email in an attempt to  find Edward Snowden at the time.  And so we've seen this happen  and on the show on Wednesday, on  Security Now on Tuesday, or  Tuesday, I should say, Steve and I  were talking about Senate action.  It's been widely considered at  some point that the Congress would  weigh in on this, an attempt in  some way to give law enforcement  access to encrypted data.  Well, we've been waiting for  Richard Burr, who's chairman of the  Senate Intelligence Committee,  he's a Republican from North  Carolina, to release the text of  a bill that they're calling  Feinstein-Burr, and we got, what is  apparently a draft of that on  Thursday? Have you looked at  Feinstein-Burr?

Start time: 383.59
End time: 473.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have, and we should also  remember that this is what Tim  Cook wanted, too. His objection  was that this is too important an  issue to just have some judge  write a court order out of the  blue and attempt to compel Apple  to create code in order to get  the FBI a wedge into a phone that  they had. Tim wanted, said, look,  this needs to be resolved one way  or the other. We don't want to  break the law, but we also don't  want to just capitulate to  something that we feel is wrong.  So ultimately, I think it's clear  to all of us that, it's not clear  how far up it's going to go, that  legislation of some kind to  resolve what are the laws of  law, and I think that's a  good question. I think it's  important to resolve what are the  legal obligations of someone  providing encryption, you know,  where that, what the limits are.  There is a bill in the  California State Assembly moving  along, and then, of course, up at  the national level, we've got, as  you said, this Feinstein-Burr  bill, and it is as bad as  sweeping as it could possibly be.  It doesn't, and it's actually,  it's what I've been talking about  on the Security Now podcast for  weeks, sort of expecting  something that unfortunately  looks like this. It doesn't  outlaw encryption, but it provides  a law to compel decryption.

Start time: 475.52
End time: 485.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the name of the bill, and by  the way, we should mention this  is a draft text released for  comments, so we're commenting.  I don't think Richard Burr wants  our comments.  The president would have to sign

Start time: 485.46
End time: 487.69

Transcript:  it into law, so we have a long way  to go.

Start time: 488.38
End time: 544.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he's kind of indicated that  he's somewhat on the side of, I  think everybody in law  enforcement and many in government  are concerned about this going  dark problem, this problem of  criminals being able to use  strong encryption to essentially  go dark, to go, you know, off the  net but still communicate.  The name of this bill might tell  you something.  It's the Compliance with Court  Orders Act of 2016.  It's not very long, which is  good.  It's a long read.  It's nine pages.  Again, this is not in committee.  This is just a draft that Burr is  circulating so people will  comment on it.  But boy, oh boy, here's a comment  from Kevin Bankston.  He's the director of New America  Foundation's Open Technology  Institute.  He says, I got to say in my  nearly 20 years of work in tech  policy, this is easily the most  ludicrous, dangerous, and  technically illiterate proposal  I've ever seen.  So what is the proposal, Steve?

Start time: 545.28
End time: 618.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so it essentially says  that anyone who encrypts  communications, and they define  that very broadly to be both in  flight and encrypted storage,  must provide a means to provide  intelligible, is the word they  use throughout, an intelligible,  i.e. decrypted version of  whatever it is that the court  orders.  And they use the term covered  entity and then define it to  mean, and I'm reading from the  bill, the term covered entity,  that is to say who this applies  to, means a device manufacturer,  a software manufacturer, an  electronic communication service,  a remote computing service, a  provider of wire or electronic  communication service, and  a provider of a remote  computing service, or get this,  any person who provides a  product or method to facilitate  a communication or the  processing of storage of data.  So it's essentially everything  and everyone.  Yeah, the professor of law at

Start time: 619.92
End time: 639.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  George Washington Law School,  Orrin Kerr, said that this would  apply to Apple's App Store and  Google's Play Store and the  Windows app.  So anybody who's providing  software would be required upon  court order to give up all of  the information unencrypted.  Or somebody posting something on  GitHub.

Start time: 639.80
End time: 654.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's that broad.  GitHub would be, yeah, you're  right.  It's not just commercial  entities.  It's any person who provides a  product or method to facilitate  a communication or the  processing or storage of data.  Now, by the way, Matthew Green,

Start time: 654.86
End time: 685.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  our favorite crypto-scientist,  Matthew Green, our favorite  crypto guy from Johns Hopkins,  says the White House declined to  endorse Feinstein, Burr.  But he said they took a complex  issue and arrived at the most  naive possible solution.  What would, this would mean  essentially that anybody doing  business in the United States  would have to have a backdoor.  It doesn't say backdoor.  In fact, Burr said this is just a  performance proposal.  This is, it doesn't say you have  to, how you have to do it.  It just says that you have to  have a way to do it.  Exactly.

Start time: 686.98
End time: 749.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what we expected.  And I caution everyone to be  careful about terminology,  because terminology matters.  And so no one mentions backdoor,  and a backdoor brings with it a  negative, a negative connotation.  So all it says is that, for  example, Apple would have to  have, would have to build in to  their technology a means to  allow if they receive an order  from a government.  Now that's the other, the other  really scary thing here is this  says a government, and then, but  they're not talking about, you  know, non-U.S. governments.  They're talking about all  government entities within the  U.S., states and counties, and  so it's not just, it's not just  law enforcement at the federal  level or some, some, some  Supreme Court order.  It's some government official  down the street can apparently  compel this sort of decryption.  The EFF says, despite being in a

Start time: 750.32
End time: 836.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  golden age of surveillance, I  mean, that's the other side of  this is that right now, it's  only going to get better thanks  to the Internet of Things.  They can surveil us in all sorts  of new and unusual ways.  Despite being in an age of, a  golden age of surveillance, the  senators are pushing Congress to  destroy fundamental aspects of  computer security.  This doesn't just open a door for  law enforcement to keep up on  criminals.  It opens a door for criminals to  invade us, and they go on to say  forcing companies to undermine  their products will stifle the  very innovation that built the  American tech industry, and I  don't, you know, I can't imagine  that this would become law or  even end up, but it's so  important that we not sit back  and say, oh, that couldn't  happen.  Go to the EFF.  They have an action page that  will give you the name, address  of your Congress critter if  you're in the United States, and  you can write to them.  I strongly suggest you either  phone them or write to them  using snail mail so they can  verify you're a constituent and  register your feelings about  this.  I'm not going to tell you how to  feel, although I think you can  tell how Steve and I feel about  it, but register your feelings  about this, because this is  something that's going to come  to a head pretty quickly, I  think.

Start time: 837.20
End time: 866.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says here, the term  government as defined in this  document, meaning that the  government can compel, means the  government of the United States  and the government of the  District of Columbia or any  commonwealth territory or  possession of the United States  of an Indian tribe or of any  state or political state, and  political subdivision thereof.  So the city council of Petaluma  could ask for this.  Yes, exactly, meaning the mayor  down the street.

Yeah, I bet it's going crazy.  But remember, this is a good  time for you to weigh in,  because this draft proposal is  designed to get conversation,  and now's the time for you to  let your Congress critter  know how you feel.  We'll talk to them more on  Tuesday.  Thank you, Steve.  Steve Gibson, the host of  Security Now, every Tuesday,  1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern,  20.30 UTC.  Greg Farrow, the UK had the  Snoopers Charter, right?

Start time: 905.53
End time: 933.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Similar?  Yeah, it's very similar in the  sense that the Snoopers Charter  in the UK is based, we don't have  a bill of rights here.  So as a citizen or as a part of  society here, you don't get the  rights that you get in the U.S.  through your bill of rights or  in your Constitution.  So we don't actually have some  of the privileges that you have.  And the Snoopers Charter was  basically just reinforcing the  existing law that you have no  rights and the government has  the right to take whatever it  likes.  Great.

Start time: 933.96
End time: 939.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And is that the law?  It's the draft communications  data bill.  It was proposed.  The Snoopers Charter has had a

Start time: 941.27
End time: 987.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  substantial amount of  resistance in the community.  People have been pushing back  very, very hard and it's been  very, very hard and to the point  where the government's had to  shelve it for now, there are  other political things that have  taken it off the agenda, but I  expect it to come back in a year  or two.  The British government, I mean, I  think one of the things that I  don't think people are talking  about in this debate is the  reason why the government wants  to be able to decrypt and it  comes down to money.  The ability to use, to have a  back door or to have unencrypted  data is the cheapest possible  way of implementing government.  And as our governments keep  making commitments to people to  spend less and less on tax, to  take less and less tax and spend  less on having small government,  they need cheaper and cheaper  forms of law enforcement.  This is a response to budget

Start time: 994.33
End time: 1038.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  always get to the truth at the  end of the day.  So the cheapest way that they  can collect data, of course, is  to get access to unencrypted data  sources.  The FBI of course has a lot of  data.  The FBI of course needs to do  more with less and so the  cheapest way that it could do  it is to have these cases.  Now, of course, they will always  win if the encryption gets really  really tough.  They can go back to the  government and ask for more  money.  So I just see it as cheap money.  One other thing about this, Bill,  if I may, is it also perhaps the  most egregious part about this is  the part where it says people  must not obfuscate or encrypt the  metadata.  So that is people must not only  render up the data, but they  must render up all the metadata  around it.  Well, I think that's what the

Start time: 1038.62
End time: 1070.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  EFF meant, that we're in a  golden age of surveillance  because that metadata not only is  widely available, it can be, at  least in the United States, you  can get it without a warrant.  So it's, you know, you just, in  fact, every carrier in the United  States has a portal for law  enforcement that they can log  into and for a small fee, a few  dollars, get location  information, you know, information  about who you call.  They can't get the content, but  they can get everything else, all  the so-called metadata.  And in many cases, that's  sufficient.

Start time: 1070.66
End time: 1153.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the secret here is that  during the Second World War when  Bletchley Park cracked the  Enigma code, I'm sure everybody's  heard about the Enigma code and so  forth, but while Alan Turing was  the guy who cracked the Enigma  code, what a lot of people don't  know is there's a guy called  Gordon Welchman who actually had  spent five years ahead of that  collecting metadata.  That is, they had actually been  analyzing the Morse code that  people had been using, and they  were able to identify which  operator was talking.  So each of the operators had a  signature.  By their hand.  Wow.  By their hand on the Morse code.  Exactly.  And this Gordon Welchman was  actually able to build a massive  library of metadata around who  and when so that when they  finally cracked the code with  the Enigma machine, they were  able to say, oh, that operator  is sending that data, then so  reference what they knew about  the operator and where they were  to say, yes, this is valid.  Viable cracked data.  So the metadata is at least as  or perhaps more important than  actually the unencrypted data.  In this bill, when you read it  says it is illegal to obfuscate  the metadata.  That is illegal to hide IP  addresses.  Right.  Illegal to hide you as the user  that things like that.  That worries me much more even  than the fact that there's no  limits on what the court can  ask for.  Imagine a court going to Amazon  and saying, give me all of your  data.  Right.  Not just one person.  I want.  Everything.  Anybody in the whole data center.  I want to see the whole data  and I want to see it all.

Start time: 1166.11
End time: 1223.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I haven't really had enough  time to look through the exact  documentation, but from the  what I've read on the web more  than how I have thought about  it, this is still early days.  There's a lot more debate which  needs to go on.  And I think we need to be very  careful when in terms of making  decisions around encryption and  decryption from a business  standpoint as well as security  standpoint.  I think everything is happening  in the dark.  And I think that is a bigger  challenge right now for the  whole community, especially in  the investor community is that  no one really knows what is  happening in the market.  And I think that is the  reason why we're having this  conversation and why the  decisions are being made.  So I think we still need a  little more healthy debate  around this whole topic.

Start time: 1224.82
End time: 1242.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you will see more and more  conversation around it.  Yeah, my concern, if you're  Apple computer and a law like  this were to pass, you would  have no choice except if you  either would give in, which I  think they would have to, or  give in.  And by the way, where would you

Start time: 1243.34
End time: 1289.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  go?  Indeed.  And I think the biggest  challenge we have right now is  that most people look at  technology as a geographic,  you know, like companies are  geographic entities or services  as geolocal entities.  And that's not really the case  because we are, we live in a  world which is kind of  borderless.  So Apple is not just a U.S.  company.  It is not just a Chinese  company.  It's all over the world.  And so each decision has a  bigger implication.  I think that part of the  decision-making process isn't  really there.  Nobody actually, you know,  thinks about the larger global  implications just yet.  I just...  Yeah.

Start time: 1293.14
End time: 1343.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the problem is that  many people, encryption is a  really scary word, and I don't  think a lot of people  understand, probably most of  the people that listen to the  show understand why it's so  important.  But I think that for many  people, technology is really  scary.  And even the people that are  writing these bills, after you  read them, you can say it's  almost like kids writing a  wish list to Santa.  They don't know how they're  doing it.  They're just hoping for it.  And it's like if you've ever  seen any horror film, they're  like, you know what, I'm just  going to open the door to this  box even though I don't know  what's going to happen.  And we're opening Pandora's box  a little bit so the good guys  can get in.  And I think that we need to  have these discussions to help  people understand what is  encryption, why is it so  important, because the  government has been using very  insightful emotional arguments  saying we have to catch the bad  guys, but this actually also  lets the bad guys catch us.

I think this is a message to  US companies.  But you know, to your point,  saying stop fighting us so hard  because we could squeeze a lot

Start time: 1396.96
End time: 1459.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  harder.  And a company like Apple,  Apple is not going to let us  do that.  They're not going to let us  do that.  They're going to let us do that.  And I think that's the point.  I think the point is you know,  the point is, you know,  a company like Apple,  I mean, look at look at Steve's  rational economic decision.  Well, I'm not going to do a  crypto product because I don't  want to be put in that position.  A company like Apple that's  already in that position is  probably going to be more likely  to cooperate in the hopes that  something more draconian doesn't  become law.  So I my suspicion is that this  isn't something that Feinstein  Burr or anybody else thinks would  become law.  But as you say, it's a stick.  And they're suggesting that,  you know, maybe you guys want to  be a little bit more helpful.  The problem is there's no halfway  with encryption.  You either it either works and is  impenetrable or it doesn't work.  And it's impenetrable not only to  law enforcement, but as you say  to criminals.  I think really this.  Go ahead.

Transcript:  I mean, I read this and it's a  horror story, especially for  American cloud companies.  So people in tech who are  followers of AWS or Rackspace or  Google Compute or even Facebook,  this is very bad news because if  this does get up, you're going  to see a reaction from the  European governments where  they're going to legislate much  harder than they're already  doing to say people in Europe  cannot do business with those  companies.  You'll have to take your data  out.  It's already a seesaw type of a  thing there now, and if they  push much harder, I think you're  going to find a serious reaction  and billions of dollars of  revenue will be lost, and I'm  not sure that they're caring  about that.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I think really what has to  happen at this point is that we  as users now need to educate  ourselves about crypto.  I know you're right, Georgia,  that a normal person, see what  Apple's doing and the things  that law enforcement doesn't  like is they're trying to make  it easy and universal.  That's, I think, in the long  run probably not going to happen  because of stuff like this, but  it's very clear that if you know  what you're doing, you can  achieve privacy and strong  encryption, and I think it would  behoove all of us at this point  not only to educate ourselves  about it, about PGP, GNU,  Privacy Guard, WhatsApp, Signal,  Open Whisper systems, strong  encryption that is not  penetrable to law enforcement.  It cannot be made penetrable to  law enforcement and then tell  friends and family, you can use  WhatsApp now and be relatively  secure, although metadata,  incidentally, metadata does leak  from WhatsApp.  You can be secure with WhatsApp  but as far as I can tell, and  Steve I'm sure is going to weigh  in on this a little bit more,  he's reading the white paper,  but it looks to, WhatsApp uses  your phone number to identify  you, which makes sense.  That's how your friends know you  and can add you to their WhatsApp  but it's then attached to your  identity on WhatsApp and so  there's some metadata leaking.  Also, who you're talking to is  leaked.  So while the content is invisible,  WhatsApp is not a perfect  solution either.

I think that was part of the  problem people were talking about  and the problem people had with  David Cameron's stance on  encryption, Greg, correct me if  I'm wrong, is that, oh no, we in  the government will have strong  encryption.  It's just you that can't.

Transcript:  This state level, there's a big  difference between state level  actors and personal actors.  Right.  That is when you're a state  level infrastructure and you're  like GCHQ or the NSA in the U.S.  or the DSD in Australia, the  ability to collect data at such  vast quantities because you've  got so much money and the  legal empowerment to tap  mainstream activities, that is  the key.  Now, when you're acting at that  scale, having a back door or the  ability to unlock everything  gives you unlimited capability to  extract data.  And I've heard various stories.  Like I work in enterprise  security.  My day job is about enterprise  networking.  And I can heard various stories  about governments just capturing  all the packets and then sinking  them into bunkers so that they  can play them back decades after  they've been caught.  And that's where it is.  And these types of bills are all  intended to keep the government  in control over that data and  over unlocking it so that they  can extract it later on.  I think there's the real weakness  here, of course, is and I don't  want to turn this into a  political show, but if the  government starts to act  irregularly, like we've seen  many abuses from the smaller  police departments in the U.S.,  the English legal system is a  little bit more unified than it  is in the U.S.  and has different sorts of  controls.  But I think the big point is  that this bill says any court  member.  So you could imagine a county  court in some small town of  rural America.  Something like maybe Maricopa

Transcript:  I think that's the right way to  do it.  I think the founder of WhatsApp,  Jan Kuhn, is from a former Soviet  Republic, so he understands what  draconian governments can do with  information and data.  And I think it's a very big  problem for the country.  I think the founder of WhatsApp  is a very good friend of his.  He's a very good friend of his  and he's very good at  information and data.  And I think it's a very brave  step for him to take and I'm  actually pretty excited that he  did.  I think the one aspect of all  these encryption tools which are  available right now, I think if  you currently use any kind of  encryption or any kind of  technology like that, it's  a bigger issue for yourself if  you're using encryption  technology.  So this brute force approach to  encryption and privacy and data  collection is running roughshod  on the rights of average people.  I think that's a bigger  challenge.  I think in this debate about  security and terrorism and  everything, the thing we are  constantly forgetting is the  basic rights of people.  We're going to take a break.

Our show today brought to you  by Carbonite Online Backup.  A big part of your security plan  is having a good backup.  You know, we talk a lot,  especially on the radio show  about ransomware.  It is gone.  I mean, two more hospitals were  hit by ransomware last week.  It seems to me nobody who has an  IT department should ever be hit  by ransomware, and yet they are.  And you know what the solution  is?  A good backup with versioning.  If you want to know more about  it, Carbonite has a great  white paper on how you can use...  Go to carbonite.com and the  resources section and look under  white papers.  Very good article about  recovering from ransomware and  preparing from ransomware.  Ransomware Preparedness and  Recovery Guide.  And the key is a good backup with  versioning.  And that's what Carbonite is.  Carbonite is a solution for home,  for office.  It gives an online backup.  So your data is stored in the  Carbonite cloud where it is safe.  This is a great time to sign up.  If you've been hearing me talk  about it, and I know you have  because I talk about it a lot,  right now if you use the offer  code TWIT, you'll get two bonus  months with your...  You know, first of all, try it  for free.  You get two free bonus months if  you decide to buy.  And right now, up to 30% off.  So this is a really good time.  The nice thing about Carbonite is  you pay by the year.  It's as little as $5, actually  $4.99 a month for everything on  an individual computer.  Windows or Mac, home or office.  And it's the most...  And by the way, that's for an  unlimited amount of data.  It's the most affordable backup  out there.  So you've got to check it out.  More than a million and a half  customers now in business and at  home.  And they have restored, and I  love this stat, 50 billion files.  That's 50 billion files that  would have been lost without  Carbonite.  Carbonite.com, no credit card  required for the free trial, but  do use our offer code TWIT.  That way you'll get two free  bonus months when you buy.  And take advantage of this 30%  off.  This is not going to last.  Carbonite.com.  And if you go to, again,  resources white papers, you can  read about the ransomware  preparedness and recovery guide  and a lot of you in small  business.  Have any of your clients been  hit by that, Greg, ransomware?

Start time: 2267.40
End time: 2298.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crazy.  That doesn't surprise me at all.  Medical institutions generally  have a very confusing array of  IT and often it's not possible  to have the systems fully under  control.  The doctors are going one way.  Patients are going another way.  The hospital administration is  going another way and often the  backups aren't there.  And those sort of cloud tools  are a possibility, by the way.  I mean, those carbonite, that  type of backup can certainly work,  especially for small doctor  surgeries.  It's a simple solution.  I would highly recommend it.

Start time: 2298.51
End time: 2323.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, you don't want to pay  these ransoms because that just  encourages them.  It's kind of not the ideal  solution.  And by the way, the $17,000 that  that hospital in Southern  California paid is nothing  compared to the government  fines they're going to get for  HIPAA violations.  You know, the loss of that data  violates the federal HIPAA laws.

And so plan a media strategy and  then have a budget proposed  already once you get slammed  with that security event.

Transcript:  I'm really curious what you all  think about Revolve.  This is, it seems like a  black mark against Google.  If Revolve made a home automation  hub, R-E-V-O-L-V, no E on the end,  it looked like a little jar of  hummus.  And in fact, that's what one  poster on media, Marlo Gilbert  called it.  He wrote an article saying, the  time that Tony Fidel sold me a  container of hummus.  Actually, Tony Fidel did not  sell it to him.  Revolve was a business.  They sold a few of these.  They were not inexpensive.  There were several hundred bucks.  Nest bought them.  Of course, Nest is an alphabet  company.  And Nest has announced that come  May 15th, they're just going to  turn it off.  Even though you own the  hardware, it will be non  functioning.  They're essentially going to  brick the hardware on May 15th  by turning off the servers.  The thing that I find very  offensive is this hardware was  billed, it said, guaranteed for  life.  Now, of course, you see that all  the time.  And one of the weasel words is  whose life?  And maybe the life was the life  of this working life of this  product.  So legally, they'd probably get  away with this.  But it just seems to me such a  mistake for Google, which  already has a bad rap for  discontinuing stuff like Google  Reader, Google Wave, the people  use.  Here's a case where Google  Reader is a place where people  have been using this Revolve Hub  they spent 300 bucks for it, may  have spent many more hundreds of  dollars, even thousands of  dollars for devices that connect  to it.  And now it's going to be bricked.  Is this bad for Google?

And that's one thing everybody  needs to know and remember when  they buy a product from a  startup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

You've got to support the  product because you actually  love the product, not because,  you know, for life.  Life in technology products  doesn't exist, man.  I mean, that just is not real.  I kind of find that, you know,  Google may be at fault here,  but also we don't have all the  facts on this.  But does it matter that when  you pay 300 bucks, they claim  you have a lifetime

But they were bought out by  Google.  Google's doing really well.  There's no reason that they  couldn't decide to continue  supporting their product  because Google, as like as its  name, it carries value and a  lot of bad press is bad for all

Transcript:  of the stocks for Google.  That's what I think.  I mean, I'm going to think  twice about adopting a Google  service because they seem to  have a habit of pulling the  plug on things.  Doesn't that hurt them?  So by the way, what as because  of the clamor, here's the EFF  article, Nest Reminds  Customers Ownership Ain't What  It Used To Be, because of this  hubbub, Revolve is asking  people to contact them on  Twitter so we can work out  something.  And apparently they're offering  a refund of the $300 price,  which is great, except unless  you paid for a lot of other  stuff to work with it.  They're asking that you email  help at revolve.com so we can  help you out during this  transition and provide you with  a refund.  Is that enough?  I feel like that's not enough.  I guess here's my moral.  You tell me where I'm wrong,  Om.  The moral of this lesson is A,  buy open source stuff that  supports open standards so that  you're not reliant on one  company to continue to run the  server.  Very kind of important.  And two, don't trust Google  because they pull the plug on  stuff right and left.  And thank God they haven't  pulled the plug on Gmail or  Google Voice yet, but that could  happen any day now.  Okay, Om, I'm sorry.  Are you done?

But I also feel that in this  case, you know, we don't have  all the facts.  I think getting outraged on  revolve is one thing.  Yes, you know, Google Reader  that was bad.  And I think the Nick software is  another one where you know  they're going to pull the plug  on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're giving it away.  That's nice.  But I paid 300 bucks for it.  So, A, I don't get the freebie  and B, you're right, they're  obviously not going to develop  it anymore.  That's it.  It's the end of life for that.  And that's another company they  bought.  Now, they have SnapStream, which  is their mobile version of the  Nick software.  And I'm sure Google will keep  that up until they get bored  with it.  Somebody told me that the  problem is structural.  I'm trying to remember who I was  talking to about this.  Maybe it was Brad Sams from  Petri.  He said, here's what I deduced  by talking to Google engineers  is the way Google works.  Tell me if I'm wrong, Om.  The way Google works is  engineers pick the things they  want to work on.  It's almost like, you know, you  got to create a sexy project so  you can get the best engineers  at Google.  And what happens is they work on  this stuff because it's exciting  and new.  It gets released and then they  move on.  And it's impossible to get an  engineer at Google to stick  around and maintain things  because that's not sexy.

And I think that's why you're  beginning to see the company  become a little bit more  careful and stringent about how  they want to do things.  There is more accountability.  I think a lot of it is due to  the new CFO.  And she is actually making sure  that there is more structure in  this company.  Like, yes, I've heard multiple  times that people go off and do  their own thing a lot.  And as a result of that, there  is sometimes chaos, creative  chaos is more like it.

I think the company is at that  critical juncture where it needs  to have a transition from, you  know, this free for all, like,  you know, structure to a more  organized, more optimized way of  running a business.  But I think, you know, it's very  hard to find the gap between  creativity and bureaucracy.  And I think, I mean, if there is  any one company which can find  it, it might be Google.

Transcript:  I think we're going to see a lot  more of these, Leo, where IOT is  just an emerging technology.  It's roughly around about the  1920s where cars were.  And there's no standards, none of  them interoperate.  There's no agreement between the  vendors who make IOT technology,  Phillips light bulbs.  Right.  You know, for example, the Hue  light bulbs live in a completely  different ecosystem to Apple TVs.  The two should work together.  But instead, they're completely  isolated.  They don't.  And aggressively, these people are  building their own platforms to  try and lock the competitors out  from those sorts of things.  To me, this is just the first of  100 of these going wrong.  Startups getting early to market.  You know, their technology will  either founder as they run out of  cash and their road drops off and  they just run off cliff or they'll  get acquired by big companies and  the big companies either hide them  for the people or the technology  they're buying isn't compatible  with the platform they've got.  You're going to see hundreds of  these and you're going to see a  rejection from the market that  people are going to say this IOT  is rubbish.  And then that's the dip.  You know, the depression in the  middle and before we go up into  the slope of acceptance where IOT  standards start to emerge.  Standards are key.  And Google is working on

It's in the standards that are  being developed.  And, you know, there's so much  going on here that we have to  fix in IOT.

But it means to me that people  who are intrigued by the  Internet of Things and the  promise of these IOT devices  would they be better off  waiting?  And if they wait, then who  funds, you know, who funds the  growth?  I certainly, many of us have  learned not to put money into  Kickstarter projects.  I apparently haven't learned  that.

Without spending dozens of hours  writing code and shims between  different platforms, even  fiddling with IFTT so that this  thermostat talks to this  controller that does this, you  know, my life's too short for  that sort of stupidity.

Transcript:  This is a new feature that  arrived in iOS 9.3.  It's the first time in my  opinion, Apple has fallen for  the late night television blue  blockers pitch and they've  decided to put blue blockers in  their smartphone.  What's the story?

Start time: 3250.15
End time: 3299.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we do have a circadian rhythm  and that is really important to  us feeling tired or not.  And the first the couple of  hours before sleep when usually  the sun would go down and  that's the way that our bodies  have evolved.  We would produce a lot of  melatonin.  Right.  And melatonin is the natural  transmitter that says we're  tired now we can go to sleep.  Right.  Now, just recently actually in  1998, we, we had a new  technology that we ended up  finding out on African tree  frogs, Claude frogs, that there  was another type of receptor  that we had which were called  melopsin and those are photo  light receptors that react very  strongly to blue wavelength  light.  And they're in our eyeballs?  Where are they?  They're only in our eyes.  Okay.  Like that's it.  So yes.

Start time: 3300.28
End time: 3303.00

Start time: 3303.24
End time: 3322.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  It's the third receptor.  Wow.  And it's very strongly to blue  wavelength light.  So short wavelength light.  And it will actually inhibit for  hours the production of  melatonin.  And we need melatonin to fall  asleep.  So they, they've done, and this  is not me.  This is actually science.  They've done.  Okay.

Start time: 3323.34
End time: 3328.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been, they've been,  there's, there's hundreds of  thousands of studies that have  gone through sleep and why we  sleep and how to sleep better.  And so the best way would be  just not to use your tech.  It's not just that.  Well, that's okay.

Start time: 3341.30
End time: 3348.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's my point.  If the tech is orange, you're  still awake looking at Instagram  at three in the morning.  You're still awake.

End time: 3405.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yes, you're probably getting  if it's something that's really  intriguing and exciting, that's  probably going to make you be  more awake.  You're, or if it makes you think  or worry, if you're reading the  discussion draft from, you know,  the Feinstein bill, you're going  to be more upset than you would  do something else.  Yeah.  But, but at least with it being  larger wavelength of light,  you're still producing more  melatonin than you would if you  were watching your reading your  phone as it would before with  all of this light going straight  to inhibit the production of  melatonin.  And so the studies have shown  that it works.  Now we haven't done studies yet  on night shift in and of itself,  but the studies have shown that  using a dimmer light and using a  light on a larger wavelength  of spectrum does help more  melatonin, less melatonin be  inhibited so that you can fall  asleep faster.  And those studies have shown

That's true, that's true, but  probably most of that is because  you have cycling thoughts that  go through your head or your  brain, and you're not solving  at the middle of the night.  I can't stop thinking.  Right, we're going to solve the  problems of the world at night,  which is the worst time to do it,  and we don't have any  distractions to keep us from  thinking these thoughts, and so  they plague us, which is another  issue, but you might as well use  night shift.

That's a case study of two now,  Leo.  Whether it's worked because my  screen's yellow and I can't see  it anymore, and tells me I  actually should go to bed, or  whether it's because there's blue  light not hitting my cones, or  maybe both.  But I think there's two things.  I do want to point out there's a  wonderful, wonderful podcast  called In Our Time, which is  hosted on the BBC with Melvin  Bragg on Sir Ken Sinclair's  Circadian Rhythms, and they dive  into this for 30 minutes, talking  deeply around circadian rhythms  and blue lights and these extra  cones.  And it's a truly fascinating  article to listen to.  If you do want to dive deeper  into it, I could highly recommend  that to you.  Didn't they do studies of people

Start time: 3617.92
End time: 3628.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and they put them in caves where  there was no indication of day  or night?  Yeah.  And weird things happened, like  they shifted into polyphasic  sleep.  Yes.

Start time: 3629.11
End time: 3648.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do.  They do.  And we change our sleep habits  as well.  Without the cues of having a  light source, we will sleep  sometimes for 18 hours, then  we'll be up for four.  And so there is a huge shift  without light.  We do need that to kind of keep  our body's clock in sync.

Start time: 3650.66
End time: 3670.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it may be that polyphasic  sleep, the idea that you sleep  in two shifts, one from when the  sun goes down to about four hours  in, say 11 or midnight, and then  you're up for four hours and you  sleep for another four hours, is  something prior to electric  lighting was the natural mode of  sleep?

There's a lot of people that do  sleep that way and it works out  really well for them.  And so, you know, unfortunately  there's no real way to go back in  time so that we can see what was  the best way we sleep.  And it might have been very  culturally influenced.  So if there was things that you  had to do in the middle of the  night, you know, a lot of dangers  that were happening or something  you'd have to do that that would  be really important.

Transcript:  That's kind of my natural work.  Yeah, well you're probably, you  do so much, you're giving such  an output during the day doing  these shows and putting it all  online.  You need to also decompress.  That's also why I'm a drunk.  But what happens...  It works, that works.  Though that then will wake you  up after three hours.  So it's only a depressant for  a certain amount of time.  I know, it doesn't work.  Then it will actually wake you  up.  But what happens that will help  for your blood pressure is that  when you're sleeping through the  night, our healing happens  mostly when we're rested.  So either low stress or when  we're sleeping.  So most of our cellular repair  happens at night.  Most of the working also on...  So our brain uses up refuse, so  like brain poop.  We do most of the cleansing of  that also at night.  So we get rid of beta, like  amyloid plaques.  And so that will lower your  blood pressure.  And that's why...  And that happens more during the  later part of your sleep.  So if you're shorting yourself  two hours of sleep, you're  shorting yourself from two of  the most important restorative  hours of your sleep as well.

Transcript:  I'll get...  I just want to take the story  to the right a little bit,  but I've been having problems  with sleeping and I've got a  sleep disorder of certain type.  And I've been attending a sleep  clinic at my local hospital.  Wow.  And the thing that stunned me  about it is just how tech-savvy  these people are.  Say, for example,  when I was doing the diagnosis,  I went to the hospital and they  gave me this kit which had a  thing on my finger,  I had to put a face mask on,  and then these bands,  and they could actually calculate  my heart rate, my oxygen levels,  and how much my breathing.  And so I took the kit home,  plugged them all in,  and then took them back to  the next day.  They plugged it into the computer,  took the data out,  did a diagnosis instantly,  and said,  we think that you need this.  And now they gave me a machine  which blows air in my face.  It's a horrendous thing.  It takes weeks to get used to.  Wait, it's like a fan?

And the guy said to me,  he said,  if you don't use it,  I'll know.  And he can actually reprogram  the machine from the hospital  so he can see that the machine's  not working.

And I was just thinking,  that is a real amazing advance  in technology.  That doesn't happen in the US  because CPAP and sleep disorders  are only treated for 90 days  under corporate health care plans.

You know, and then,  of course, it's related  to circadian rhythm.  So once you've got  a circadian rhythm disorder,  and for me now,  I go to bed at the same time  every night, more or less,  regardless of whether  I'm tired or not,  and I'm a lot healthier  than I used to be,  partly because of flux  and the blue light thing  on my screen,  which tells me to get the hell up  and leave the dirty thing alone.

And if you're looking  at the clock and calculating  how much longer you have sleep  or saying, oh, God,  I'm awake again at this time,  I'm just making your waves hit  stronger than beta waves  and so you'll wake up,  wake up.

And sites like BuzzFeed and I would say even Vice,  much less interested in driving traffic  to their homepage.  They don't care.  BuzzFeed doesn't even have a homepage anymore, right?  Well, they do.  But they don't expect you to go to it.

Transcript:  They don't.  But like I think their whole model has been  a very atomized way of, you know, spreading their content.  So they're doing a good job.  I think, you know,  both Vox and BuzzFeed have done a good job  and so has Mike.  And I'll tell you,  the biggest challenge for all these companies  is going to be on Facebook  is that they will all be competing  for the same space on the newsfeed as everybody else.  And I think it becomes very challenging.  And what I mean by everybody else,  it means your baby posts, your advertising,  your, you know, your music posts from Spotify  and all those things which go into your feed  is everything is going to have an equal amount of ranking  and that's going to cause, you know,  all these services to have a moment of reckoning.  I think the news organizations  who are heavily dependent on Facebook  will have a moment of reckoning in my opinion.

Transcript:  Facebook itself struggling a little bit  according to an exclusive in the information,  Amira Frati writing,  that they're suffering from a decline in original sharing.  That in fact, it isn't the baby pictures anymore.  That fewer people are posting on Facebook.  More personal content is now going to Snapchat,  Instagram, Twitter and other places.  In some ways perhaps the news services  pushing out the personal content.  And I have to say, I see that on my Facebook page, absolutely.  What I used to be a place I'd go to catch up on family  and friends is really now a newsfeed.  I love that image there.  Which of Mark Zuckerberg?

Transcript:  Facebook 2005, a beach with people playing volleyball.  Now it looks like Times Square.  I don't know if that's quite fair.  It says about 57% of Facebook users  who use the app every week post at least once in a given week.  This is confidential data that the information got a hold of.  But only 39% of weekly active users post original content.  A lot of it is reposts, reshares.  And 6% of weekly active people post it  to a specific group of friends as opposed to the newsfeed.  So people aren't using those friends lists.

So in the first world, so Europe and America,  recently I gave a talk at a school about social media  and being safe online and things like that.  It was a wide forum.  There's about 500 kids in the room  and I said to them, how many people here use Facebook?  And they all put their hands up.  I said, how many of you have posted on it in the last week  and no one put their hands up?  They don't put anything on Facebook because brandmas watching, right?

Transcript:  My teenage daughters are using...  I spoke to my... I have two teenage daughters,  one's 15, one's 18,  and their consumption of Snapchat boggles my mind.  They will make like 250 posts a day on Snapchat.  They'll literally just take a photo of themselves endlessly  every 10 minutes or continuously post or react or like.  And I... But they don't put that on Facebook  because Facebook lasts forever as Snapchat goes away.  It's a conversation.  And I think Facebook's missing out on the fact  that all of media is a conversation.  It's two-way. It's not broadcast.  And what Facebook's trying to be is a platform that pushes it out.  I know also, like our podcast,  we work directly with big companies  with billion-dollar marketing budgets.  And their problem is that their marketing has to compete  in the Facebook newsfeed  with news articles, baby photos, and so forth.  And they cannot find a way to make Facebook work for them  with that money.  Facebook's problem is coming at it from multiple points of view.  Now, keep in mind that Facebook's got plenty of growth,  Indonesia, India, China, you know, wherever you want to be.  There's plenty of growth going on in those countries  as new adopters come on.  But I do sometimes wonder if Facebook's reaching a mature phase  in some markets where the high dollar value is  as people start to fight to get into that feed.  And this is where media's coming a cropper  because it's competing as much with marketing efforts  as news efforts as mashable, producing, you know,  low-quality video rubbish that drive click-throughs  as anything else.  And then eventually you end up with free newspaper  being distributed on the underground on us every day.

Transcript:  You know, I think there is one counterpoint to that,  that in 2014, average time spent on Facebook per month  was 40 minutes, and in 2015 it was 46 minutes.  So even with an increased number of users  and decreased number of original,  decreased quantity of original content,  we've had more usage in Facebook  regardless of how we all feel about it.  It feels...  Go ahead.  I also feel that, you know, as a service,  I think if there is anyone who can figure out  how to find the ideal blend,  it would be them because of all the data they have.  And from what I... I'm pretty confident of that.

Transcript:  It seems like Facebook is looking to get more content  from media than ever before.  They started the live video streaming this week  through the iPhone.  Anybody can stream live,  and they've announced that they're going to allow advertising.  They're encouraging, you know, with Facebook articles  that people post to Facebook,  I thought it was very interesting, Home,  that Medium announced that a lot of news sites  like The All are going to move to Medium,  and then Medium has tools to automatically do instant  articles on Facebook and AMP,  Google's sped up browser built in.  So if you're a news publisher,  you don't need a content management system.  You just have everybody post on your Medium page,  and it will automatically go to Instagram  and it will automatically go to instant articles,  it will automatically be AMPed.  I think that's really an interesting play.  It feels like there's a move,  really such a move from mainstream or traditional media  onto these platforms that of course it's pushing out,  you know, teenagers who are just going to use Snapchat anyway.  But they're not... I think your point is well taken.  They're not abandoning Facebook,  they're just not contributing to it, they're reading it.

Start time: 5238.38
End time: 5275.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My reaction to that would be is that Facebook has,  like usage of the Facebook feed has dropped,  but that's been offset by usage in Instagram,  tools like Instagram or Messenger is a separate app.  I'd love to get hold of the data and drill in and say,  have people replaced feed time, you know, the newsfeed,  with time spent in Instagram or in Messenger  using it as a telephone call system,  or whether there's some sort of actual...  I would think, given the discussions I've had,  is that feed time has dropped dramatically,  but people are spending more time engaging with Facebook  than they would with Facebook as an audio tool or as a picture tool.

Transcript:  Right.  I think that they have to be really careful.  When you see the people that use the internet the most,  which are teens, they use the greatest time on the internet  and social media, and they're the ones that are not adopting  to Facebook being active, participating members,  more like that's the way that they check in,  their grandparents check in to make sure that they're okay,  or they send family messages.  I think that that's something that Facebook is trying to still be trendy  with the next generation of users,  and so I think that they have a little bit of a, you know,  a competition versus Snapchat is cool, trendy, fun, effortless.  They don't have to worry.  They can post almost anything without worrying about rep retribution,  whereas they look at Facebook as,  this is your parents watching you the entire time,  and so we have to be careful using it,  so they don't have that same amount of fun and or freedom,  plus Facebook's privacy policies have given people a little bit of pause  and I think that these are the issues that are slowly coming back  to kind of haunt them.

Transcript:  what they say at F8.  I mean, one of the things that supposedly they'll be introducing at F8  is a chat bot platform that they're going to,  it just feels like Facebook is in many ways going more towards  corporate publishers, corporate content.  This chat bot platform isn't for end users.  Well, it is in a way.  It's for end users to communicate with big companies,  so they're going to, they have developers that they're going to communicate with  and they have developers that they're going to connect the big companies with  who will create bots for these big companies.  So when you need customer support or you want to buy something,  you can go into Messenger and say,  hey, LL Bean, I need a couple of pairs of moccasins  and a bot will respond to you.

Transcript:  Oh, for a human.  Some human will appear and say, what do you want?  I'm busy.  According to CNBC, Michelle Castillo writing on the CNBC page,  the NFL went to Twitter and not Facebook because,  and this is from sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity,  the NFL failed.  Facebook undervalued content rights and had a poor monetization model.  So the NFL, I mean, Facebook Live was built for something like the NFL,  but Thursday Night Football is going to be, oddly enough, on Twitter.  Twitter is going to stream 10 games next season  and where it would have probably more naturally gone to Facebook.  I don't know how Twitter is going to stream the NFL.  That makes no sense at all.

A source with, according to CNBC,  a source with knowledge of Facebook's thinking said the social network  was the one to back out of the NFL offer, not the other way around.  The main point of contention was over the value of non-exclusive.  And that's the point.  And then there's the question of whether or not  the NFL will be able to watch live streamed games,  which are also widely available on TV.  So it doesn't mean Thursday Night Football will only be on Twitter.  Amazon also backed out of the deal,  leaving Twitter as one of the last players standing.  So there's some dispute.

Also, it was brought by PETA on behalf of Nerudo, who is a crested Sulawesi macaque against the nature photographer David Slater.  See, Slater published the picture in a book saying that Nerudo took the picture of himself, which is obvious if you look at his cheapest expression.  Of course it's obvious.  I'm a macaque.  Lower Court... So lawyers claim the monkey owns the copyright and that the photographer, Slater and the publishing company have infringed on it.  The lower court dismissed the suit saying animals don't have the standing to sue under the Copyright Act.  Apparently, based on the Ninth Circuit case that is named Cetacean versus Bush,  a self-appointed attorney for all the world's whales, porpoises and dolphins sued the Navy for using a sonar system harmful to marine mammals.  That was thrown out.  So now the appeals court is going to hear the appeal by the macaque who says, no, I own this.  And I don't know what he's going to do with the royalties.

Start time: 6054.74

Transcript:  So the article came about when I read the news that Nick's software was going free.  And the first thought that went through my mind was, oh, well, they don't want to publicly announce they're killing it.  Right.  But this is what it is pointing to. They're going to kill this.  And they means Google. But when I thought about it, it made perfect sense that they're doing this because we take so many photos now as average human beings that we don't have enough time to edit these pictures the way we used to edit them.  First, we used to develop the pictures inside dark rooms.  Then we went to the desktop software like Photoshop and Lightroom and Nick's software.  And now we just keep taking photos.  And the idea of photography has left the realm of human scale.  And it's gotten to a scale where the only way to make sense of our libraries, edit all these pictures, find the best ones, find the most magical moments, we need to end up using artificial intelligence and machines.  And from that standpoint, we don't really look at everything. We will just have all the photos edited and surfaced for us automagically by hardware.  That's what Google's doing, isn't it? That's kind of the idea.  I would not be surprised that all the things which are great about Nick's software end up in Google Photos.  And I think this is a logical progression. And that's what I argue in my piece that we should not get upset about the shift, but it is a logical progression for photography.  We are no longer making photos from an aesthetic artistic standpoint.  And now we are making photos as essentially part of our everyday language and everyday memory.

Transcript:  I think that you're right about it being something that you can look back on and remember it.  But I think that we also end up, you know, we spend so much time, you know, wanting to plaster our moments around social networks that we're not really in these moments ourselves.  We're not really enjoying the concert and how it feels because we're so busy trying to take that perfect picture that's going to make our friends jealous or that we're going to be able to show to Grandma that I always worry about us being in the immediacy of being Zen and in the moment.  Everyone's trying to get ahead, getting a better shot.  And so you want to, you know, sometimes I'm like, you know, put the phone down and just like be there.

Transcript:  I think that's one aspect of it.  I think sometimes you see something in a store, you take a picture of that, you see something on the wall written in a magazine, you just take a picture of that.  So this is, you know, I think the behavior around photography is changing.  I don't think it's about making photographs.  It's about, you know, capturing visual data from a sensor.

Transcript:  How do you feel about this life logging thing?  Gordon Bell very famously was doing it.  In fact, wrote a book on it.  There's a company, I bought this one, another great Kickstarter investment called Narrative, that you wear this clip on camera and every 30 seconds it just takes pictures and uploads them to a server.  So you basically have pictures.  The reason I stopped wearing it is the pictures were always like of somebody's navel because it's on, you know, it's on your, it's not good pictures, but your whole life is recorded in pictures.  Mike Elgin who also wears one of these dopey narrative clips wrote an article or an opinion piece in the computer world this week.  Life logging is dead for now.  He was talking to Gordon Bell who kind of invented this, even wrote a book on it.  He said it was, Gordon called it his My Life Bits Project.  Gordon was one of the chief scientists at Digital Equipment.  He was at Microsoft when he created this.  He said, I don't do it anymore.  It's not something that's bringing a lot of value to my life.  He says we're overloaded with data and the public is suffering from data fatigue.  We don't need any more pictures of our life.  We don't want them.  And by the way, if we needed them, we've got the camera phone to take them.

She founded the Computer History Museum in San Jose and suffered towards the end from Alzheimer's.  Couldn't remember anything.  And one of the things that I think really interested Gordon was this idea of, well, if you, you won't be able to remember it, but your camera will.  And you can go back through your life, whether it's just yesterday and see what you did or 10 years ago or 100 years ago.  You know, 50 years ago and see, see your life that way.  And he thought that that would be kind of interesting.

Transcript:  Yes. I mean, I spent a couple of years traveling through Africa and the Middle East.  And I had took a, in the days of film, a 35 millimeter camera and took photos occasionally when that's most of the time I didn't get it out because the camera was actually quite valuable.  And people would want to steal it when you're traveling through third world countries.  Getting a camera out is pretty difficult, but I've got enough photos.  They're all weird. They're all badly framed.  They're not exposed.  At some point I dropped the camera and the left hand side went out of focus, but I have the photos there to give me memories.  And today what I do with photos, which I think is to Ohm's point, he makes a good point about what we're doing is the relationship with photography is changing from rigid photos to something that's just a stream.  But I record a photo in my day one.  I have a daily logger app on my iPhone.  And, you know, recently I was in Las Vegas to do a podcast recording session and I just got the phone out, took some photos of the hotel room, photos of the hotel, of the recording sessions, of the people I was with.  And they automatically get caught into a diary app and they're there.  And every now and then as I'm scrolling through the diary app, I see them again.  Instead of writing an article, you know, like a 300 words on what happened today and what I'm thinking, I just took a photo.  And any time I need to see it, I can go back to that, that day, click on it.  And there's my geo tag.  There's the photo and I can remember what I was doing that day and the memories are still there for me.  And that's all I'm, that's the only thing I take photos of.  I'm not a photographer.  I don't expect to be.  I'm a worst photographer ever.  And I'll never own a camera again.  It'll just be my smartphone.

Transcript:  I think that you're probably right.  We're getting worse for becoming a little bit more need for immediacy, fame and narcissism.  But I think that as Amin and Greg were mentioning, it isn't, if you're going to use it just a catalog and to use that as, you know,  your way of writing your story to be able to remember, to be able to log something, then I think that that's nice.  I think that social media has pushed that, that everyone has to have.  And it makes other people feel like they're lacking.  I have a lot of people come into my session saying, you know what, I'm looking at everyone else's life on Facebook,  which leads to a lot of depression because you put onto Facebook on social media these great moments.  And so everyone thinks that everyone else is doing so much and then they reflect upon themselves and say,  you know what, I'm doing so little and look at this person.  They're climbing this mountain.  This person's shark diving.  You know, someone else is Greg's running with the bulls.  And here I am at home on the couch watching Game of Thrones and how I wish that I could be doing these things as well.  And so we need to kind of also put things into perspective that, you know, most people's lives are not like this.

Transcript:  So who's going to buy Yahoo?  Yahoo has decided to let the clock  take a little bit longer.  They are for sale.  There's a deal book out.  People have seen it.  It's circulating around.  They've decided to take bids through April 18th.  Now.  And lots of rumors about who might buy them.  I think the inside track goes to Verizon,  which, of course, bought AOL recently.  SoftBank, perhaps, the big Japanese investment arm.  Some have said Google's interested,  according to Kara Swisher, who probably knows all.  She says, the truth is the mergers and acquisition unit  at Google crunched the numbers as they should,  but an offer is highly unlikely.  She says AT&T Lukewarm.  And now this just in, it would be pretty funny,  the Daily Mail in the UK.  What?  Greg, tell us about the Daily Mail.

Start time: 7033.38
End time: 7042.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Daily Mail is a phenomenally huge media platform.  They do a lot of, it's called a tabloid.  It's very big on putting together beat up headlines.

Start time: 7043.36
End time: 7046.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been told that if I see a story in the Daily Mail,  I should not repeat it.

Start time: 7047.79
End time: 7143.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's generally a good idea,  and also question the validity of the truth.  Exactly.  If you think BuzzFeed invented the catchy headline,  these guys were doing it years and years ago  in the days of real media, and have done for like 30 years.  They get an astonishing amount of traffic.  I can't remember the numbers off the top of my head,  but it's absolutely one of the top five web properties  in the world.  And for them to get onto Yahoo means  they want that content platform to thrive more.  The same reason that Verizon's in the ring,  although my understanding about Verizon is that  they're exploiting the network as a way of generating  higher revenues around the ad tech.  That is, by buying AOL and HuffPo a few years ago,  Verizon was able to get much better ad tech play  because they can see people traversing the Verizon network  and as well as what's happening on the actual site itself.  Huge value to that, isn't there?  There's a $24 billion market in carriers selling data  to the ad tech brokers about the traffic that's crossing.  So your personal data is identified on the internet,  on those MPLS backbones, on those fat pipes,  and they sell that data for billions and billions  of dollars worth of revenue every single year.  So if Verizon can use that to know how much money  these ad tech companies are making,  then it makes sense for Verizon to throw its hat in the ring  for Yahoo as well because now it gets to see the content  and the network and they can exploit that data science  to give you the ads that you really want to see  and drive much more revenue out of the network  not just as selling bandwidth.

Start time: 7144.27
End time: 7190.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Clearly, the Daily Mail is already doing that  because I just went to the Daily Mail.  It's a UK publication,  but they clearly know that I'm coming in from the US  because every story in here is US focused.  I doubt anybody in the UK knows Megyn Kelly from Fox News,  but of course she's been written quite a bit about  because of her feud with Donald Trump.  And here are some paparazzi pictures of Megyn Kelly.  That's on the top.  The New Orleans Saint football player  who was killed in a road rage incident yesterday,  the female Texas teacher who was arrested after being caught  repeatedly hitting a male student around the head  then mocking him when he complains.  That's all US stories.  Now I bet you that's not what you see  if you go to the Daily Mail's website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sports ball, yeah.  What do you think Yahoo's worth  and who should buy Yahoo or is this just a fire sale  and it's just the end of the line?

Start time: 7211.70
End time: 7298.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's a fire sale.  I think Verizon is probably the most likely buyer here  because of all the reasons Greg's just mentioned  and I think they will probably make a very reasonable bid  for this company.  I think that data brokerage business is huge.  I think people are still struggling to figure out  how to tie web data with mobile users  and I think this is another way of Verizon  to be able to bridge that gap of mobile and web information.  So if I was a betting man, I would bet pretty hard on Verizon.  My number two pick would be Time Warner.  I think Time Warner also has a reasonable shot  at making a play for Yahoo,  though I don't think they have that kind of...  the money power as Verizon has.  So I would pay close attention to those two.  I think that the number of people who use Yahoo on a daily basis,  the traffic, has some value for companies like Verizon and Time Warner.  But if it was...  It is not a growing business.  It's a growing business for people  who actually have something to tie it to  and I think Verizon is the best bet.

We say that we track the ads  so that we can show you the best quality ad,  but what we actually want to be able to do  is target you in multiple ways, not just one way.

You know, are people talking about their products in public?  Are people, you know, is the audience engaging  with your brand in some way?  And I think that's a really good question.  Are people talking about your audience engaging  with your brand in some way?  I mean, are people mentioning Coca-Cola on Twitter?  Are people talking about your router, your revolve,  or your IoT strategy?  That sort of sentiment analysis is huge  in terms of being able to say,  I ran a marketing strategy I've just spent.  There was a...  Have you seen the...  There was a video this week from the guy  who runs the Game of War,  one of the top five games on the iTunes store,  and he's now spending over 500 million a year  in spend on promoting that game  in the iTunes and the Android app stores.  It's now one of the second or third largest.  It's making over $2 billion a year in revenue.  And he built his own media and ad tech team  because he fundamentally believes  that the media companies are all lying, stealing,  thieving buggers, and he wants them to stop.  He doesn't trust them to deliver ads,  and he has to justify every single spend.  So he has his own ways of tracking all of that sentiment.  And he just basically said that  I get all the data about when it's delivered,  I know when people react to that  and buy my game and make money for me,  and I will no longer trust media.  All he wants is a way to know  if his marketing is actually generating a return.

Unfortunately, games can give you  the same amount of addiction as cocaine can,  and it gives you this one, immediacy,  two, it gives you a rush of dopamine,  which makes you feel good and powerful,  and we like that feeling,  and it's a great avoidance technique.  So instead of doing your taxes,  you're going to play a video game instead  and feel a little bit better about it.  And so the games can market off of that  and keep us coming back for more  by giving you just a little bit of dopamine,  and it ends up being the same thing  like the guy around the corner saying...

Transcript:  It's a Skinner box, as Beatmaster said.  Skinner, B.F. Skinner,  the father of operant conditioning,  showed that rats would press a button forever  to the point of death  if you just gave them a little reward  every once in a while.  Average of...  Whoa, look at this.  There's a headline from April Fool's Day,  but this one's true.  A game of war is paying players  spend an average...  Average of $550 each in 2015.  Is it that good a game?  No, but it's not about that.  In fact, I would be willing to bet  that most people who play games like this,  I know I'm one of them,  didn't really enjoy it,  felt bad about it.  I realized when I was getting up in the morning  to harvest my crops in We Rule,  every morning that there was something  wrong and I deleted that game.  Good for you.  So game of war is number one.  I'm going to download that and try it.  You probably shouldn't.  Don't do it.  Kate Upton, they ought to pay her more money  because, by the way, she's not in that game.  She looks fabulous in the advertisement.  Yeah, where's that buxom young lady in the game?  Nowhere.  So, oh, why didn't Yahoo just do this themselves?  Why are they...  I mean, isn't this a strategy  that could have kept them alive?  Mine that data.  Sell it to game of war people.

Or maybe they just don't want to be in the business anymore  and just say, you take it.  They could probably get a better exit.  Actually, come to think of it,  this is really being forced by activist investors on the board.  The board itself have all thrown in the towel  and they're saying, let's just get what we can for it.  Right?

Transcript:  It seems like it.  I think the...  You know, one of the articles I wrote about  Yahoo was pointing out that like,  you know, all social services  and all web services have an expiration date.  I think you grow older with your audience.  I think you see that happening with Facebook right now.  That's interesting.  Like, just like television services  and the music services, everything just,  you know, the audience grows older  and when you get older,  you become less attractive to advertisers  and the new behaviors of the people  of the internet are elsewhere.  So the attention shifts,  the attention shift means you become less relevant.  So it's not like Yahoo is dying.  It's just becoming less and less relevant by the day.  And as a result of that, its value keeps going down.  And I think that's where they're at.  Like, their relevance to the modern web is very little  except for they're selling this data around their own users,  which is like the crummiest position to be in.

If you don't try to be trendy,  there are content categories that have some interest  that can continue to generate new audience.  Our audience is not aging,  as far as we can tell in our research.  But that's because our audience is not about geography.  It's not about demographics.  It's about people who are interested in a particular thing,  technology and using technology.  And as long as people are interested in that,  I hope, I mean, I don't want to do this forever.  I don't expect to sell the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually don't think that's good for us,  to be honest with you.  I think that that's brought in competition.  We dominated for so long,  and I think now there's a lot of choices  in the podcast space,  and I think that that's brought in competition.

Transcript:  It's true.  Well, everyone and their dog has a podcast.  It's diluted.  Yeah, it's diluted.  Yeah, it makes it harder to find sponsorship  and advertising in an audience.

Start time: 7913.32
End time: 7947.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our audiences are not going down.  Our audiences are going up,  but the ad dollar is diluted.  Yeah.  So that means there's...  And what's unfortunate,  and maybe this will be fixed,  ad spend has not gone up  with the increase in interest in podcasts.  You would think that,  you know, Procter and Gamble  and big companies would start  going to podcast advertising  as their mainstream media advertising  starts to become less efficient  and less effective,  but they're not.  I don't think there's been  an overall increase in the pool.  There's just been a larger number  of people splitting the pool,  but maybe that'll change.

Transcript:  I think this advertising grows  at the rate of the GDP.  It doesn't grow any faster.  Oh, interesting.  So if you look at it,  it's just a little very tiny variance  in the GDP growth  and advertising dollar growth.  So, you know,  I think a lot of what you're seeing  is more competition  for the same amount of dollars.  And I think people  who have the most amount of attention  are getting the most amount of dollars,  that being people like Facebook  and Google are sucking up  most of their digital dollars.  YouTube is taking  a lot of the digital dollars,  and some of the television dollars  are going to places like YouTube,  podcasts.  Right.  And so, you know,  this is just a,  you know, the slicing  and dicing of the pie is changing.  And I'm, you know,  I don't think, you know,  folks like you have anything  to worry about  because you serve a very strong niche  with a very strong point of view.  Right.  And you have,  you actually remember who you are.  I think, you know,  we talked about Mashable  a little while ago  as sometimes when you go,  you know, too far away from your core,  you lose your core audience  and you actually start to dilute  why people come to you.  I think the reason to come to Leo  hasn't changed in last,  you know, close to 16, 17 years,  in a sense.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  I watched you on screensavers.  You were very current then,  and I watch you now  and you're very current.  And I think that,  I think that is what will keep you in business  by being, you know,  regenerating yourself by the day.

A couple of big things happening.  First of all, HTC is going to be having,  hopefully what is expected to be its flagship announcement  for its new lineup of phones is the HTC 10.  We don't know.  We're going to find out on Tuesday.  Might have a 5.15 inch display,  a Snapdragon 820 processor.  Is it going to save HTC?  That's always the big question here.  We're going to find out on Tuesday.  Also, starting Tuesday and going through Wednesday, April 13th,  is Facebook's F8 Developer Conference.  Lots of things that Facebook's going to show off there,  including chat bots and Messenger and so much more.  Leo and myself are actually going to be on hand  on Tuesday, April 12th from 10 to 11 a.m. Pacific time.  We're going to be on the Pacific here at twit.tv slash live  to kind of talk about the kind of the keynote from the event  and all of the implications there.  And then of course, later in the day on Tech News Today,  we're going to talk all about it.  So you'll want to check that out.  Don't forget, Megan Moroney and I do Tech News today  every Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. Pacific  at twit.tv slash live.

Jason, as he mentioned, will join me and Gina Trapani  Tuesday morning around 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time,  1700 UTC for our live coverage of the first of two keynotes  at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference.  If it turns out that we think there's more on Wednesday,  there's a second keynote, we'll cover that live as well.  You never can tell.  Sometimes the second keynote is just very developer-y.  But I'm really interested in what Facebook has to say  about this bot and messaging platform.  I really feel like they have the inside track  because so many people use Messenger.  Almost a billion active users now, which is mind-boggling.  Hey, we were talking about Sleep a little bit earlier.  Our sponsor for this portion of the show, Casper,  the best mattress ever!  An online retailer of premium mattresses  for a fraction of the cost.  Why? Because they make their mattresses  beautifully, obsessively engineered mattresses in the U.S.  and then instead of putting them in a showroom  and having to mark them up for that middleman,  they sell them direct to you.  And I think when they probably pitched this,  I would like to see their deck  because I bet it was kind of like,  look, no, we know people want to lie on mattresses in a showroom.  No, we know that.  And we know that shipping a mattress, that's crazy talk.  You're going to ship a king size, but we figured this out.  And they have.  So first of all, lying on a mattress in a showroom  is no way to choose a mattress.  I know that. I've bought many a bad mattress  because you can't really get into it, you know,  on a showroom floor.  Everybody's looking at you.  There's bright lights.  But with the McCasper, you have a hundred nights.  You have a hundred nights to lie on that mattress  so that, you know, if you don't like it,  anytime in the first hundred days you call them,  they'll come and get it.  They'll take it away and refund you every penny.  It also, as you can see, it comes in a very compact box.  That's a queen size mattress, fit in an easy box.  That's really great.  That's why I got one for my son at college  because it was very easy to get upstairs in the dorm room.  And by the way, he really appreciated having a nice,  fresh mattress in the dorm room.  And because they're inexpensive, it was a great thing.  It was worth it for four years.  We also, I sleep every night on my Casper pillow.  Last night I said, where's my Casper pillow?  Lisa said, I put it, it was, we were watching TV.  I have it on this couch.  I got up, out of bed, walked to the living room  to get my Casper pillow.  Because I have to have it.  It is the best.  Dual layer, responsive, but comfortable, but cool.  And by the way, that's another thing.  I love the coolness.  I think, and I think, Georgia, you confirmed this,  that one of the problems people have with sleeping  is they get too hot.  You need to stay cool.  And these mattresses breathe beautifully.  And they're so comfortable.

Post your site on wordpress.com.  That is a great thing.  You don't have to do anything. It's just there.  It's on.  I think you might have to check a box.  They're using Let's Encrypt,  which is a really cool project  that anybody who's running their own website  should look into that will get you an SSL certificate free.  It's an amazing service.  Isn't it great? Let's Encrypt.  I'm trying to do it on my Mac.  Maybe I can get you to Greg to consult.  It comes with these scripts, which is great.  It's really an automated process.  If you're using Apache, boom, bada-ding, bada-boom,  it's very easy.  If you're using NGINX, a little bit harder.  Apparently on a Mac, it's very sketch.  For most people who are running Apache on a LAMP stack,  this is a very easy way to get a free cert and be HTTPS.

Start time: 8793.98
End time: 8833.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The people who are involved in Let's Encrypt  jumped onto Apache very early  because it's the most widely used server.  NGINX is a little bit behind it,  but there's quite a few articles out there now  on how to use your favorite tool to reprovision.  The key there, of course, is that your Let's Encrypt  only issues a certificate for 90 days.  It does that, of course, so that certificate validation  or certificate revocation is not required.  You have to refresh the certificate every 90 days.  That requires you to automate it  and that requires you to have a script  that automatically runs Apache.  Apache does that and now there are tools available  for more and more of the web servers  as Let's Encrypt becomes so obviously dominant in the market.

But all of those things are happening.  Yes, Let's Encrypt, fantastic project.  And more importantly,  Let's Encrypt is supported by a number of commercial companies  and we should thank them for contributing money  to push that project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that 90 day thing I talked about  is going to drive a lot of those.  You're going to see an awful lot of certificates issued.  They're going to have staggering numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing 100,000 certificates a week.  OVH, WordPress.com, Gandy, Dreamhost, and DigitalOcean  also support HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.  So that's fantastic.  Did you see, and what do you think of the Brave browser?  Speaking of Mozilla,  Brendan Eich, who is one of the founders of Mozilla,  has created a new browser called Brave.  It's nice, but it does something that,  well, the newspaper publishers aren't real happy about.  It comes with not only with a built-in ad blocker,  but it replaces the third party ads with ads  from its own inventory,  ads from advertisers who don't use tracking  and honor the do not track setting.  Then Brave takes a little bit, takes a taste,  and then shares the rest of the revenue  with publishers and users.  They say on better terms than the publishers are getting  from their own ad networks.  That's not good enough for the newspaper publishers  of America, 17 members, called Brave blatantly illegal.  Blatantly illegal.  I'll explain why that's not true.  And a plan to steal content and threaten a lawsuit.  Eich responded, I think, with something  that will be worth mentioning,  which is browsers, and I'm reading directly from his post,  do not just play back recorded pixels  from the publisher's sites.  They're the end user agent,  the software you run on your computer  that mediates and combines all those little bits of content,  including ads and news stories,  and displays them on your screen.  Content is published as documents, HTML markup,  with the intent not of specifying  how the content is presented.  The browsers are free and do, in fact,  rearrange, ignore, mash up, and otherwise make use of content  from any source to deliver that page to you on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that Brave's browsers perform republication  as the newspapers suggest,  well, then so does Safari's reader mode,  or any browser with an ad blocker,  or, I don't know, do you use links on your command line?  That does it too.  So do screen readers for blind users.  That's what a browser does.  A browser is software you run that at your request  goes out and fetches content from sites  and displays it however you, gosh darn, want it.  Disagree? Agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not at all.  I think you have yet another proof  that media companies are technology illiterate.  They have not been able to keep up with technology  and are actually unable to understand  the reality of the world today.  I think you look at why Facebook and Google control their destiny  is because they were not paying attention  to the bigger trends at play.  I think that is where media has fallen.  And I think this is just another example of it.  It's like, did you read the story on Forbes where...  Perfect example.  Yeah, they're spreading malware.

Start time: 9088.82
End time: 9130.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me just... This is a great one.  So, when you go to Forbes.com with an ad blocker on,  it says, oh, this is how we make money.  Please turn off your ad blocker.  I don't know, Forbes, a lot of sites are now doing this  or you can't read the site.  Does Forbes let you in or does it just beg you to turn it off?  No, it doesn't let you in.  It won't let you in.  So you go, oh, well, I guess I have to turn off my ad blocker.  And then what happens?  The Forbes Ad Tech software allows automated purchase  of banner ads and, oh, lo and behold,  malware has been injected into your computer  from an automated ad, a flash ad on the Forbes site.  The irony.

Start time: 9131.54
End time: 9212.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the editor of Forbes.com  wrote a long piece defending Forbes  after I went after them on Twitter  and my comment was something like,  friends don't let friends read stuff from Forbes.  And I used to work for Forbes.com.  Forbes was good content.  Whatever, like whatever.  I'm not going to talk about the merits of the content.  I think the fact that they were spreading malware was on them.  That's something, you know, and he wrote a long...  I can almost 2,000 word piece defending  why I was wrong and Forbes was right.  Well, lo and behold, they're doing this again.  And, you know, like kind of it's the same thing, you know,  economists did, which was like accidentally served up malware.  And, you know, it's like if you're going to take advertising,  if you're going to make advertising  your key source of income, at least, you know,  be careful to pay attention to the fact  that it could damage your end customers,  also your end customers, not just advertisers  but also the readers.  So, you know, I think media had it coming for them,  in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the part that really upsets me about the Forbes thing  is that as soon as the malware appeared,  they go, oh, it's not our responsibility,  it's our third-party ad tech suppliers.  But it's your brand that's actually at play here.  And I was, Ohm is exactly right.  Not only are media companies, tech companies,  every company is a tech company in 2016.  And the companies that are failing are the ones  who don't understand that IT and the technology that drives it  is your key competitive advantage  or it's your survival mechanism as it gets,  as the industry changes, as technology changes everything.  And media companies are just one example of that.  I mean, look at their rush to get onto the platform of Medium.  Medium is able to even talk about becoming a publishing platform  for the old media companies  because they don't want to be technology companies.  They don't want to understand the internet.  They don't want to understand ad tech.  They don't want to hire developers and write platforms.  And yet you look at the media companies who are successful  and they're the ones who have invested heavily in IT teams,  in technology people, hiring the right resources  and in spending on, you know, technology and so forth.  They're the ones that are winning and the ones that have failed  are the companies like Forbes who say,  oh, we're not a technology company.  We're just about content.  And, you know, even earlier today we talked about Yahoo!  is selling itself to Verizon.  Well, what's Verizon? A technology company.

Transcript:  So I want to end the show with a hat tip to robots  and automated technology.  A couple of great upbeat stories.  Here are trucks which have crossed, what is it?  All of Europe, I think, autonomously or not exactly.  They have one truck with a driver in front who has Wi-Fi  and he led a convoy of trucks across Europe  with no drivers in the back, just him.  No, they all had drivers.  They had drivers.  Oh, that's no fun.  But they couldn't touch the wheel.

Start time: 9356.17
End time: 9390.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The drivers had to be there for safety.  Yeah.  But it was basically when they're on the highway,  the trucks are able to use the white lines on the road  to steer themselves and to reach the optimal condition.  So because they see how in the video they're drafting each other  and saving up to 20% of emissions and fuel.  And that's all done by computer.  The drive is actually just sitting there resting.  It can only run on a motorway and only if the motorway  is in good condition with perfect white lines to operate.  And please don't get in between the trucks

Transcript:  The other good news story comes, of course, from SpaceX,  which did it for the first time.  They were able to.  They launched, of course, the Dragon to bring 7,000 pounds  of cargo to the space station.  And what SpaceX has been trying to do  is get these boosters back after they're used up.  And they were able to land the booster upright on a barge.  Same music, oddly enough, as the trucks.  No, maybe that tab's still open.  And there it is.  The robots are winning, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey, it was so much fun.  I took an extra 40 minutes of your time.  I thank you for being so generous.  Om Malik from om.co.
