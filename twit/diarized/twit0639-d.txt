Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I had problems with  Mac OS X who I used to call it  Mac OS X all the time. I got yelled at by  all the Apple didgeridoo or blogger  so yeah, iPhone  10 is a little bit hard for me. It's hard for

Start time: 260.08
End time: 275.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  everybody. It's kind of a weird thing.  So  by the way, I loved  the way you reviewed the iPhone 10  in the New York Times. The iPhone 10 is  cool, wrote Brian, but that doesn't  mean you're ready for it.

Start time: 277.13
End time: 317.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind  of a resting headline,  right? You read that and then you have to click  through and you'll  see what I mean when you get through the first  few paragraphs of the review.  It's not that the iPhone 10 is bad.  It's not. It's the best iPhone ever  made. But my point being that  I think that a lot of people who aren't  really used to having abrupt changes  in technology probably  aren't going to want the iPhone 10, right? The  home button's gone. The way that you turn on the phone  is gone. Everything is totally  different. But I think there are  plenty of people who are technology enthusiasts who  embrace change and are just  cool with it. I think it's fine  for them to spend $1,000 to get the iPhone 10. I think  it's great. I'm actually

Start time: 318.02
End time: 321.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  curious. You wrote your review November 1st.  When did you get your iPhone 10?

Start time: 322.99
End time: 349.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got it  on  Monday and we had  until Tuesday for the embargo to lift.  But I chose to take one extra  day just to spend  some more time with it instead of  doing it. I felt like if I was doing it  within the first 24 hours, I would barely  even get to use it. I had to spend more time writing  and polishing and it just wouldn't work out. It would be like  writing an infomercial in some ways. No offense  to anybody who did pull it off and did a fine job  doing it in 24 hours. Everybody else did it

Start time: 350.10
End time: 396.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in 24 hours because of course you're going to  get clicks.  I'm curious what Ed bought because you've covered this for  a long time. Apple really  did something I think unprecedented  this time around.  They gave four iPhones. They've done that  before. In fact, with the original iPhone  they gave out four to David Pogue  of the New York Times at the time  at Beg of USA Today,  Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street  Journal, and Stephen Levy who was  then at Newsweek. This time around  four went out but three of them  actually all of them really went to  Web properties. Stephen Levy was  the only one of the four who got one.  And weirdly, those  four got them a week ahead of time.  But weirdly, Stephen's embargo  ended Monday and everybody else ended  Tuesday. Ed,  is that unusual?

Start time: 398.32
End time: 425.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's highly unusual.  I mean, I can't  remember anything  ever like that. I know  with other devices  you've had  some people get longer term units,  other people get shorter term  review units. But  to have things arrive with one day's  notice for the majority,  especially the established media  outlets, I mean, that's just basically unheard  of for me. And then there

Start time: 426.02
End time: 451.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  were some very well known people who  were a little upset, like  the Wall Street Journal.  And  John Gruber of Daring Fireball, who  has always been an insider  for his coverage of Apple,  didn't get advance units.  And then, now Brian, it  is unusual to have a phone.  I'm actually proud of you that you delayed  another 24 hours. There must have been pressure  to publish right away, right?

Start time: 452.46
End time: 514.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. I mean, I did want to spend  an entire week with it.  Ideally, you know, typically when you get these  phones, you spend a week. But my  editor pointed out that if we waited a week,  we would have missed Friday. That's when people are  deciding whether or not they want to get in line and buy  this thing. So we had to  put it out before the iPhone even came  out. But yeah, it gave  me some extra time. I didn't  really catch too much  of it. I think it was more than other people. I did  catch a bug with the Amazon app that froze  the phone. That wasn't Apple's fault.  It was just the thing I was pointing out was that  I didn't know how to turn the phone on and off  because the controls were very different  with the new iPhone.  There's definitely a learning curve.  Yeah, that's the thing. There's definitely a learning  curve. I think  people who are very good at technology  or just very sophisticated with it are going to pick  it up pretty fast. They're going to like  Face ID versus Touch ID.  They're going to be used to the home button pretty quickly.  But there are a bunch of weird things, right?  Like the battery indicator is gone in the  corner. Did you notice that?  Yeah, you have to slide it down

Start time: 524.00
End time: 531.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  long. If you hold them too long,  SOS goes off and it starts going  whoop, whoop, whoop. That scared  the hell out of me the first time.

Start time: 532.87
End time: 544.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so my point was that  I feel like it's the first iPhone  where people are probably going to have to read an instruction  manual. Whereas I feel like for the past  decade I've never read an instruction manual for  an iPhone in my life. But now I have  to. I think Apple

Start time: 546.24
End time: 637.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was fairly bold with this. I hate  to admit it. It's  very nice.  But there is some question about why  they, for instance, they gave Mindy Kaling  a phone  so she could write about it in  glamour. She gave a  12 year old developer, Alex  Nolophone, so he could show it on Ellen Degeneres.  They  gave Ina Friede a phone  to review on Axios, but they also gave Axios  his political journalist, Mike  Allen, a phone. And he had his nephew  who  was apparently an emoji expert and a freshman  in college review it. This pissed  John Gruber off by the way. No hand.  It was  interesting. There is some speculate.  Look, it's Apple's right to  do this.  There ain't no law.  But some people  speculate that Apple might not have wanted  the people like Brian  and long time tech reviewers  to have too long with this  phone. There was some concern that maybe  they were hiding something. I think it wasn't that they were  hiding something so much. Although  if there are battery issues or screen burn issues  we may still not know for a few days.  But I think maybe what they wanted  and this is I think  reasonable speculation is they  wanted the reviewers who only had a day  to focus on what's new. The new  screen, the new face ID,  the an emoji  and have their reviews be all about  that because that's all you could cover.  And you really didn't have time to  do anything more in depth.  Is that manipulative, Ed?

Start time: 639.70
End time: 719.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well,  I mean the very notion  of handing out review units to  a selected  number of outlets is  by its definition manipulative.  And it's Apple's right.  It is absolutely their right  to behave in their own  best commercial interest.  So, you know, their job  is not to serve the needs  of the journalistic community.  Their job is to sell phones.  I mean I think to a certain extent  the audience  for this phone is  self-selecting.  This is, I mean, because of the price  number one and  because of the feature set  and the amount of work that you had to do  in terms of staying  up late and not making a mistake  in typing or clicking to get your order  in, it was self-selecting  to the kind of technology enthusiasts  who were not going to be dissuaded  by a  lukewarm review anyway.  So I think they said, you know, what we really want  to do is get this out there  to people who  can show it off, the web  based properties, rather than  the sort of older mainstream  media, that it's much more important  to actually have people demonstrating  the features than simply talking  about the specs and  how something works.

Start time: 720.42
End time: 752.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it was a really smart  move for Apple because they're  giving it out to people that are probably going to be  a little bit more enthusiastic or  a lot of us reviewers are getting  a little bit jaded. Maybe it will be very  spec oriented in what the phone  can do and what it can't do instead of  how much fun it was to use it  and how I enjoyed it and this is something that was  really innovative and interesting.  And it also broadens the audience  to areas where usually they may  not even think about a phone. So I think it was smart  that they gave it to new different people  and it also changes the water a little bit.

Start time: 752.63
End time: 758.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's smart, but I feel like it does a  disservice to end users who are  not going to have as much information as they might like.

Start time: 758.42
End time: 789.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't have to have the review  in 24 hours. That was people's choice  to put them out and there will be more and more reviews  that are going to come out. A lot of people  that would have a phone, you know, that would  have it for a lot longer to be able to review,  they'll still have reviews that are out  and the phone is expensive enough that I think that  people are going to think about it unless  you are a huge tech enthusiast.  And I think Brian said it well, you're going to go through tech  shock. If you're not used to changing  technology and it makes you frustrated when you have to  learn a new interface, this might not be the phone  that you're going to want to take a look at until you're  really comfortable with it.

Start time: 790.00
End time: 845.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think people, don't misunderstand me folks.  I have no sympathy or concern  about whether journalists got it or didn't.  I never take review units. I buy the  units and I get it if I'm lucky.  And it was my wife who was lucky.  I got it on the day of the  release. Mine won't come for another  week or two.  But, because I don't like  to review pre-production units.  I don't like to be in the, kind of  have a relationship at all with the  companies.  And I don't have a long lead.  I don't have a lead at all. I can, as soon as  I get it, I can talk about it and continue to talk  about it. But I just, I think Apple,  I worry that Apple is  doing all this to,  they don't need to, God knows, but  to  control the message more  than,  consumer deserves, I think,  a longer review, to be honest,  before she orders it.

Start time: 846.20
End time: 853.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  That's fair. There is this pretty smart  blog post. Somebody wrote this pretty  blog post. I forgot who it was about  how the Apple Watch Series 3  review cycle was  just so horrendously bad for the Apple  Watch because there was one bug that was  caught pretty quickly and fixed pretty quickly.  And that took over the entire news  cycle for like an entire week where, you know,  the LTE didn't work on the Apple Watch.  And this blogger pointed  out that Apple probably felt burned by this.  And I think with the iPhone X, it's just, there's  too much at stake, right? This is the most important  a decade, and you know, to Ed's point,  it's in their commercial interests to  control the narrative.  But if there were a showstopper on the level of the LTE

But anybody who's buying it in the first  day or week or even month,  better be expecting  that there are going to be some issues.  Even the best case scenario,  there's going to be a half a dozen annoyances  that are going to be fixed by  at least one or  two, you know, point  updates to iOS in that time.  That's just the way it works.  The real testing doesn't happen until  it gets in the hands of real users  on real networks out in the

Start time: 950.14
End time: 1038.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  real world. Well, the good news  for Apple is we  have a number of data points.  Of course, Apple's own quarterly results  came out the day before the iPhone  10 shipped.  And they say they had amazing  sales of iPhones.  The iPhone sold  46.6 million  units  in the fourth quarter.  Much of those, probably  iPhone 8s.  So iPhone 8 was a success.  And then, of course, Slice,  which is  an interesting story. I don't know.  I'd love to hear whether you guys trusted  it or not. I use Slice. Slice is  an app that monitors your  Gmail  to see of its  customers. And there are, I guess, millions of  users monitor Gmail to see  if your delivery  is coming and when it's coming. So they have  advanced information,  admittedly a sample, but  I think a fairly large sample size. And they say  according to  their customers, their users,  it's the largest product launch in  the company's history.  This is the graph. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  kind of one of the smallest  product launches in the company history.  But the iPhone 10 even bested  the iPhone 6, which was huge because it was the first  big iPhone.  This is pretty significant.  Brian, are those useful numbers  you think? I feel like Slice is  useful.

Start time: 1040.40
End time: 1079.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have been an Apple reporter in several  years, so I really don't remember. But  are they scanning receipts or something in Gmail?  Is that how it works? Yeah, that's how it works.  I think Apple has disputed  those metrics before, like just from  what I remember. They don't love them and  I'm not sure if it's because they're too accurate or  if they're totally wildly off.  I do think that early orders  are definitely a good metric for  early adopter interests  and just an indicator  of whether or not  a product is very interesting  to technology enthusiasts.  I don't know if it really tells us much about the long term  over the course of a year.  But it definitely is interesting to see the iPhone 10  and so much excitement over it.

For the price, for the attention  it was getting, I just wanted to hate this phone.  I wanted to find something wrong with it and I can't find

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 1149.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know either but I'll play a little bit  for you in case you somehow  have missed the excitement of  Animoji Karaoke. It's actually  kind of a hard thing to do because what you  have to do is record  using the screen recorder because you're limited  to  10 seconds.  No, this is an ad. Let's see if I can find it.

Start time: 1150.57
End time: 1159.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that Rene has an actual  how-to on the iMore site. He does.  Of how to do this yourself. If you so  wish to torture  the rest of the world with an Animoji.

Start time: 1160.48
End time: 1213.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe Rene's found a better way to do it but  what I was told is that you have  to use the screen recorder  and then edit it out, crop out  the UI stuff  and then you can  according to Buzzfeed, Harry McCracken  invented it.  And then you can mix it into  here's Harry's first  or one of his first.  So he's got a rabbit  and a chicken  singing  singing blue suede  hooked on a feeling.  Now I just want to remind AskFBMI  that this is in use  in service of news and commentary.  Not  being used for any aesthetic value.  Although I think it's pretty funny.  So how does Rene's technique, does it  does he have to use a screen recorder

Start time: 1214.14
End time: 1218.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

It's kind of a limited  Actually, there's some concern  about believe it or not  I found I managed to find  all the negatives.  There's some concern about  this because Apple, of course  Apple says the face  ID information is stored in the secure  enclave is not available  to anybody else. We don't see it.  Only the phone sees it and it does a very  good job of recognizing you. I'm actually pretty  impressed with face ID. I wasn't  you know, it's as good as  it could be. I think in the circumstances  but there's some concern because there is an API  for third party developers to use  the cameras in the notch.  I imagine Snapchat  be one of the first, right?  Wouldn't that be a great way to use  get those Snapchat  characters use the notch  and do a better job of it. And so  and there's nothing to stop them from  ex-filtrating that information  from the phone to the Snapchat servers  all the information delivered by the  the notch.

You have to approve it.  ACLU says  a lot of things about  FaceID. They don't like it.  But something to be aware of.  Senior Policy Analyst at the ACLU  says  a bad guy could  what? Get your face.  Big deal.  All right. I'm trying to find negatives.  I really am. It's not easy.

Transcript:  Apple said it would get better.  Because occasionally it doesn't recognize  me.  I did it first with glasses, but I  didn't have glasses. I entered the  code. So then you have to use your  pin. But from then on, it  recognized me with glasses. So I have  a feeling it's updating all the time.  And Apple said it would be. And I think there is  evidence it's doing it. Same thing. The studio  lighting confused it at first, not anymore.  It gets better.  It's pretty impressive.  It's to the point where...

Transcript:  A brother did the  exact same thing. So they had similar faces  and two brothers unlocked  the phone by having the phone  relearn the new face, which was  actually the brother's face, which was similar enough  for the phone to be mixed up. So there's probably  some updates that will make it a little  bit more attuned  to that. But it is constantly trying  to relearn. Like if I probably  do the passcode with a grumpy face, it would probably  notice grumpy Georgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it doesn't recognize you. It asks for the passcode. You enter  it. I suspect it's then  saying, oh, well, that was you, I guess.  We'll add grumpy to your repertoire.  We did try it with  identical twins. Megan Moroney, one of my co-hosts,  tried her iPhone 10.  She had one of her sons, Huck,  unlock it with his face.  And then gave it to Milo. Milo was able  to unlock it. This is what Apple said could happen  with identical twins. And they were right.  So that's a drawback.  You can only have one face in there,  unlike the fingerprint. I used to  let my wife have her fingerprint on there so she  could get to my phone when she needed to.  Now it's, I can, you know,  I have to give her the passcode.  I fix it,  ran to Australia as  they want to do to get  an iPhone 10  so they could destroy it.  We had  Kelsey from iFixit on the new  screensavers yesterday. A couple  of supr, interest, not surprises, but  interesting things. A, they gave it a  repairability score of six, which is not bad.  Better almost  than I thought. They found the batteries  in two modules. It's an L-shaped battery  with two different modules.  And as a result, the logic board has an  odd shape and is jam-packed.  They figured out it has three gigs of RAM.  Apple never talks about that, but  that seems more than adequate. Of course  it has the A11 Bionic, as we expected.  It actually has quite a few custom  processors on it,  which is kind of interesting.  It's got a lot of smarts in here.  There's the, you know,  they give the chip numbers, but there's  definitely a motion coprocessor  in there and some  other things. It's a, for such a  tiny logic board, there's a lot of stuff in there.  All right. I don't know what else to say.  That's the iPhone X.  Anything else anybody wants to add?  Do you want one now, Edbot?  This screen is gorgeous. It is the best screen.  It actually, I have it right next to a  Note 8, which until now  was the best screen I could find.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8.  And I think the colors are actually more accurate  on the iPhone.  Yeah, the Note 8 colors look bluer,

Start time: 1566.00
End time: 1625.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samsung kind of, even if you turn on cinema,  which is the most accurate, I think,  of the choices.  I'll give you an example. If I compare  these, here there's the Othi  icon on the Note 8 on the left,  and compare it to the red of the Othi icon  on the iPhone. Now maybe those icons  have different colors, but I would guess that  Othi's doing the same thing on both  phones. And the red is  actually feels more true. It's a little bit  maybe magenta or pink  on the Note 8.  And it feels more true on the iPhone.  And this is with the cinema mode  on the Note 8. They have an adaptive mode  that really pops it, that makes it look wow.  And I think that probably  Samsung is going to start having to think about  OLEDs and say, well, maybe we should make  these more naturalistic and not quite so bright.  People who, Apple was very quick  to point out,  now it's an OLED, you guys,  you iPhone people aren't used to it. When you tilt it,  it's going to get a little blue,  and then it's going to get a little  blue. And then, yeah,  anybody's using OLEDs.

End time: 1667.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't have to do with whether  it's polarized or non-polarized. I actually had  a pair of Ray-Bans that were polarized and worked  with Face ID, but  I had a different pair of sunglasses that  were non-polarized and didn't work with  Face ID. And I asked Apple about it.  They said it has to do with  if the lenses filter out a certain  part of the IR  spectrum, just  that specific wavelength. If  those sunglasses block that part of your eyes  from being seen, then it doesn't  work with some sunglasses.

Start time: 1668.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it, a lot  of devices, when you flip them 90 degrees,  polarized  sunglasses will basically turn  them opaque.  So I'm curious whether that's  shouldn't be an issue on a modern display.  But I saw  somebody had talked about that.

Transcript:  Yeah. You know, to answer your question,  Leo, one of the things  actually that I like about this  phone is the absence of the home  button. That's always been a pet peeve  of mine about the iPhone. It seems  old  it seems old fashioned,  constantly having to press that button and  double press to go  back to the home screen and all  of that. And it's just a waste  of  real estate that can be used for a display.  So I'm, you know, I'm  probably the opposite of many  long time iPhone users  in that I'm glad to see  the home button gone.  And I think that most  people within about a week or so  will, you know, will adapt  to whatever UI changes  come because you spend,  you know, if you're spending a thousand  dollars on a phone, you're spending eight or ten  hours a day with it.

Transcript:  I didn't sleep at all last night, let's put it that way.  I was playing with my precious  all night. Brian, what's been  your experience? Did you get used to the UI pretty quickly?

Start time: 1766.46
End time: 1797.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm still fumbling around a little  bit when it comes to using  reachability, you know, that shortcut to make the  top of the screen come down to the bottom.  Sometimes I swipe in the wrong  place, but overall it took me a few  days to get used to it. I think  I don't miss the home button that  much, but there's some things that  I could still do faster, like app switching was  faster when I had the home button.  I agree with Ed, I think it's about  time to get rid of it and just  embrace the future, if you will, because I  think it's faster overall to not have  a home button. Yeah.

Start time: 1798.20
End time: 1830.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say that I agree with you, Ed.  The home button does feel kind of antiquated.  Even Samsung doesn't have a home button anymore.  This is the, you know, the home button  you sweep up from the bottom, so  that's easy. The recense  is a little challenging for me, Brian,  as well, where you have to  swipe up halfway and wait.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you can't  get rid of an app by sweeping  it off anymore. You have to press  hold till you, you know,  just like deleting an  icon, and then you can sweep  away. But yeah,

Start time: 1838.83
End time: 1907.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for you. So they're discouraging people.  We'll leave it in, but  you really shouldn't do that.  Exactly. I find, I use recense  a lot. And you know, of course,  the 3D Touch iPhones,  when iOS 11 first came out,  they eliminated the best way to get  recense, which is to press  and hold on the left side until you get  the haptic feedback and then slide over.  And I use that all the time to paste  passwords in, for instance, from LastPass.  That no longer, ironically, it works  again on the iPhone 7 and 8.  They patched iOS 11 to make  that work again, but it doesn't work at all  on iPhone X. And I realize  a number of the things we're seeing, UI things we're seeing  with iOS 11, the changes  have to do with the fact that the iPhone X was  coming, including that recense  change, which was a little weird  in the beta. They fixed it when iOS 11  came out. I'll be honest,  I don't see the notch anymore. It doesn't bother me.  The UI, I'm completely used  to. I know it's not  faster because it's the same  chip. It feels a little faster.  I have to say,  this is a modern phone.  I thought that I would miss the home button

Start time: 1908.38
End time: 1925.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a lot more than I did.  It's easy to use.  It's kind of intuitive. I also find  that switching between things, it's a little  bit weird. I often don't  know how to close something at first.  I have to rethink, oh yeah, yeah, I just have to  swipe again. But I think that I'm  going to feel really comfortable with that as well.

Transcript:  The buttons have all changed. Now the power  off button invokes Siri.  You can turn off the screen  and if you hold it, it invokes Siri. If you want  to turn off the phone, which I guess Apple also thinks  you probably shouldn't do,  you have to press  two buttons on either side and  hold it, as we mentioned.  The other thing, of course,  is don't drop it because Apple has  already said the screen repair  is, what is it, $260, $259?  And this is  without the extended  warranty without the AppleCare Plus.  And every other repair, including  cracking the back, would be $500  plus.  So don't break it. Get a very tough  I did immediately. I got a tougher  case than my original case  with a cover.  Because I'm terrified I'm going to break  this thing. Very expensive  to repair.

Transcript:  Yeah, you're essentially leasing a phone  kind of like leasing a car. You never own the  phone because you have to give it back before you get  the new one. And so you  get on this endless treadmill of getting new phones  every year. I don't really like it because it seems  like rampant consumerism in my opinion.  But I'm sure there are plenty of people who enjoy

Transcript:  doing that. That's why I don't like any of this.  And I hate even  I hate that we spent half an hour talking  about it. But it  is after all the premier  product from the richest company  in the world. And  they're making a lot of money on it. A lot of people  are going to buy it. If they sold 46  million iPhone 7s  and 8s last quarter, they're going to sell  that many I'm sure with the iPhone 10.  Do you think the  price is I mean it's ridiculous.  But do you think that Apple people care?  No.

Start time: 2046.40
End time: 2081.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They won't. If you think no  if you think about how how long you  spend on your phone  in comparison to what you do with any  other technology. This is probably the technology  that it makes the most sense to spend  the most amount of money on anyways.  Because it matters to you. So I think that most people  that already buy Apple products usually  are doing well enough or you know  spend their resources so that they can afford this.  And I don't think that they're going to mind.  I think that in some ways it being so expensive  makes people feel elite and  better than others when they buy it.  Which is horrible statement of  people in general.  But it's probably very true.

So it's added  a couple hundred  dollars perhaps.  And I think more  important than the absolute price  is the psychological  barrier of going  into four figures for  a phone.

You know a lot of the engineering that  goes into the  what's inside the phone you know  when you tear it down there you know  that stuff's not cheap. And you  know Apple likes to keep its margins.  I don't think that they  I doubt that they've increased their margins  for this device.  But it's just a more expensive  product and they've  bumped it up.

You have to file within a specific time typically  90 days after the incident. There may be  caps from 500 to 10,000 dollars  and there could also be an annual  reimbursement cap. So I guess

That's where if you type too fast  the calculator thinks  1 plus 2 plus 3 is  23. Yeah, it's still there.  That's an animation  bug. Yeah, it's  not, you know, if you're very slow,  oh, still doing it, wait a minute,  1 plus, you have to  wait until the animation stops on the plus  and then  you get the right answer.

A lot of this stuff  hasn't come yet. Air bonsai.  It wasn't cheap.  200 some bucks.  You kind of get the impression even if you look at the  video that there is a bonsai involved.  But what you get instead is  a rock that floats.  Then you put the  bonsai in it. But of course the bonsai unbalances  the rock.  So you then chip off pieces  of the rock to make the  bonsai balance.

You should include that in your study somehow  Georgia. There's something in  there for you. Let's take a break.  We're done. No more iPhone 10  talk. Those of you who  have been plugging your ears for the last  half hour, it's over.  You don't have to think anymore. I'm going to talk about a lovely company  located in beautiful  Canada that does a  wonderful thing. They did a wonderful thing for me  way back when.  When I was a freelancer I flew to Canada.  I did a call for help. Remember up there?  At Rogers in Toronto for  one week a month.  And of course then I would have to invoice them.  Oh that was fun.  The worst part of my life was  end of the month when I have to fire up Microsoft Word  and Excel. And I have to figure out  what I spent, get all my receipts.  And the big  problem was I had to convert to Canadian dollars.  It was just a...  Then Amber said, no, no, no, Leo, there's something new.  It was just starting up.  I'll tell you, this was 2004. It was Web  2.0 at the time. Fresh books.  Here we are  like 13 years later, over 10 million  people use fresh books. And it  is the easiest way  to send invoices. But more than that  because it turns out if you  do invoicing with fresh books,  if you track your expenses with  the fresh books app,  if you track your time and projects, and  when you get paid and all of that stuff happens  automatically, turns out that's accounting.  Without doing accounting,  you're going to get all the information  you need to know, for instance,  what you spend, what your expenses are,  your profit. A lot of freelancers, I was one  of them, had no idea until tax time.  Did I make money this year?  Well you'll know every moment. Just go to your fresh books dashboard  at freshbooks.com.  You're going to send professional looking invoices  that take seconds.  And because they have every invoice  has a pay me  button, you get paid on average  11 days faster.  That is fantastic.  I mean that is just  amazing.  In fact, clients like it. Turns out clients  don't like paying invoices  any more than you like making them.  You can even set it up to  have recurring invoices. If your clients  agree recurring payments, you can reward  prompt clients and encourage  customer loyalty by automatically  adding discounts to your recurring templates.  You'll know what you did, you'll know  when you did it. You can bill for time  by client but also by project.  You can have different rates for different  projects and services.  The FreshBooks app, which is  awesome on iOS and Android, you just  press play on the app to track your time or do  it on the website.  It will sort the time entries chronologically  in the invoice. Just put them right in there  so it's completely documented.  You can even add future unbilled time  entries to recurring templates.  Even though you haven't done them yet,  you know it's going to happen. You just put that in the template  and it's automatic.  I love it. Receipt attachments.  You take a picture in the iOS app.  They go right into the invoice.  And your employees can log into  the FreshBooks mobile app for iOS and  it's easy for them to take care of business too.  Great. See those nice people?  Those are the great support staff.  FreshBooks has a fabulous support staff in Toronto.  And because they're Canadian, you know they're nice.  They really are. They're very sweet.  I love FreshBooks.  No wonder they were included in the Forbes Small Giants  list of 2017. You could try it free.  FreshBooks.com slash  twit. If you see on the form  how did you hear about us? Please do me a favor and  put this week in tech in there so they know.  FreshBooks.com  slash twit. And a tip of the hat. Thank you,  FreshBooks, for saving my life  back when I was  still freelancing. And now I can afford  an iPhone X.  Sweet works.  So now Brian,  are you going to fix your eye  problem?

Sold a significant  portion of, must be nice,  to just say, you know,  I'm going to sell some stock  for a billion dollars.  He's typically  sold stock periodically over  the last six years, 900,000  to 1 million. He owns 80  million shares.  In May, he sold  almost a billion, but now, thanks  to the fantastic  results, Amazon stock is up  year to date, 48 percent,  shares up 18 percent since September  alone, making not only  Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world, but  kind of a nice little  payday.  He wants  to put about a billion dollars a year into his  space project, Blue Origin.  And I imagine the Washington  Post is draining some of his income  as well.  I have  to tell you, I have to read you this, even though it's not  strictly speaking accurate.  This is fake news.  Jeff Bezos, you know Amazon's looking  for a new headquarters?  Jeff Bezos' heart breaks a little  reading Albany's Amazon  headquarters pitch. You ever been to Albany, Brian X,  Chen?  I have it. Tell me about it. Cringing  as he scanned the section touting the city  as the economic and cultural core  of New York State's capital region,  Amazon CEO  Jeff Bezos reportedly felt his heart  break a little while perusing  Albany's pitch to host the company's new national  headquarters sources confirmed Tuesday.  Oh geez, he said.  You could tell they put a lot of work into this sad  presentation. They even  provided a concept sketch of our headquarters  across the river from their little Amtrak  station.  The package included a custom-made Sunni-Albany  Great Danes football jersey with Amazon  written on the nameplate  and laid out the many ways a new five billion  dollar campus would benefit from being  situated nearby. Such landmarks as  the New York State Museum  and the Egg, a  performance center the  proposal referred to as iconic.  Bezos  said, it talks about how the Port of Albany has one  of the biggest grain elevators in the country or something  and they keep calling themselves the next Tech Valley.  God, I don't think I have the stomach to read this section  about how much we'll love their Tulip  Festival. At press time, Amazon  reportedly received an addendum to Albany's proposal  noting they're optimistic that United Airlines  may begin offering flights between their city  and Detroit within the next year.  It's the onion. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

Bill Gates famously, remember  Ed said, I'm not going to do it  until I can spend enough time to do it right,  which I thought was great. Zuckerberg  has famously thrown money at Newark  that didn't do anything and so forth.  And of course, now Gates is, you know,  doing philanthropy full bore.  But  the chair in computer science and  engineering at the University of Washington, the Bill and  Melinda Gates chair, and  Lozaska says, Jeff is probably not quite  ready to step down yet. And this  is a guy who, like Bill, is fixated on changing  the world in important ways. It's a full-time job  giving money. You have to imagine he'll  be every bit as philanthropic as Gates.  But, not  yet. I think that's fair.  I think that's fair.  I'm sorry. I'm not coming  up with anything good for you guys to chew on.  I apologize.  Have you seen the calculator on  iOS? Never mind.

Transcript:  A lot of people  love Kindle's  the grayscale  Kindle's for the  immersive experience.  It's like reading a book. And it's very  very, very easy on the eyes  in the way that a  transmissive screen isn't.  What I found, if I can  pivot from that just a little  bit, what I found interesting this  week was some  data on tablet  sales that  showed that Amazon is  now up to, I think this is IDC's  data, that Amazon  is now well up over a 10%  share of  tablet sales.  So they've been steadily, very  very steadily growing.  They were in the 2 and 3%  range two years ago.  Now they're up in the  10 to 15% range.  In a static  category, that's even more  impressive because  this is not a rising tide that's going to lift all  boats.  There's a real temptation  to look at the new device  that's going to sell 50  million units per quarter and  to poo poo some device that's  only going to sell only  one or two or five  million per quarter. That's really true, isn't it?  Those make a tremendous impact  on the lives  of people.  I think Amazon has  been very focused  and has done a great job  of engineering these things and they're succeeding  in the marketplace while nobody's  paying any attention.

Transcript:  Should point out though that after years  of falling iPad sales, Apple  reported an increase in both Mac,  iPad sales as  well as of course obviously the iPhone.  So the iPad is coming  back, maybe that new iPad Pro, the 10.5  inch. Go ahead Brian, I interrupted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The remarkable thing about Amazon's  strategy is that their Kindle Fire costs  as little as something like $50.  That's kind of  insane considering it's a touch screen  that can play audio and stream  Spotify and do pretty much  everything we want to do on a tablet. Granted,  it looks crappier compared to an iPad. But for  $50, you're going to buy this for your kids and let  them destroy it for Christmas, right?

Start time: 3834.20
End time: 3866.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if there were any doubt that the  Kindle tablets are  really loss leaders for Amazon, they offer  a $99 kids edition  that's coated  in rubber, but that they promise  for two years if it gets broken, if  the kid breaks it, they just give you a new  one. That's pretty amazing.  For two years. Well, I mean,  obviously either it costs $10 to  make or  it's a loss leader. They don't care  because you're going to buy so many copies  of Phineas and Ferb and  games and so forth that they make more money.

Start time: 3866.00
End time: 3873.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. They have said on the  record that it's a loss leader and that they don't  make money off the hardware. They make it off selling you  books and games and all that stuff.

Transcript:  They make a stick in, they make a stick in,  they make a box. They have a box.  And they're both available in 4K  models now. And I think it's the same  thing. I think  they're under the radar compared  to a Roku or Apple TV  or even the game consoles that  do similar things. But  for the people who are  Amazon's absolutely most valuable  customers, the people who spend  big bucks in their ecosystem,  it's a  welcome to our living room.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I think  there actually is kind of a  stratification of the gadget  market. You have the  people willing to spend a thousand dollars  on a smartphone and have to have the latest  and greatest. And then the majority  of people, the vast majority of people  who aren't looking for the  shiniest new thing, they're  very price sensitive. And for them, a Fire  tablet and the Fire  TV are priced right.  Fire TV is $40.  The stick in the box is like  $60. And does everything  that they want. And they're happy with that. And that for  them, that is the latest, greatest technology.  Yes?  Absolutely. I agree.  It's easy for us  geeks and enthusiasts  to forget that we're  a tiny minority.

Transcript:  Well, the thing that Apple has done  has been extremely successful  about is to  concentrate on the segments  of the market that  have the highest  profit. Right.  And, you know, those are the highest  price tags. They're people who are not price  sensitive. They can maintain their  margins and they'll leave the rest  of the market to,  you know, a variety of Asian manufacturers  and to  some PC manufacturers and to  companies like Amazon,  which are not going to make money on  the hardware, but can  often find a way, as Amazon  has done, to build  a very creditable  revenue stream from the  ecosystem around the devices.

Transcript:  You know, I think it's kind of funny because I  think in a lot of ways, that's why people  that do not use Apple  products, they really can, there's a lot of hatred  towards Apple and Apple products because  of, you know, how they're kind of priced  high. And I think that  always talking about how it's the greatest and  magical, I think that there's a lot of backlash  because of the same marketing that  it works very well and it's very  successful at. But I think that same success  has created a lot of people very  angry about us covering Apple, talking  too much about Apple. It kind of takes more of the piece  of the pie.

And then we were blindfolded. Megan Moroney  and I were blindfolded and we tasted them.  But I called  foul because first of all Megan doesn't  eat meat.  Did she eat the hamburgers?  They made veggie burgers. But I don't think that's  a fair test.  And then I don't know.

It didn't taste like there was  any cheese on it. So I,  but Megan won because  I got them. And actually  I think, what do you tell me?  You have three choices.  You shouldn't get all three wrong,  right? I mean statistically you should get one and a half  right. Right? I got  zero. I got them all wrong.  Megan got one right.  So she won.

Transcript:  Well our chat rooms I don't know what they're talking about.  The hearings are. Well  you can fill me in.  It's like I couldn't even bring myself  to read the transcripts let alone watch it.  And then the New York  Times. Your journal  asked, Brian asked  nine experts how to fix Facebook.  And  these were very smart people and I think  mostly they said I don't know. There's no  I don't know.  It's a lost cause. You can't fix Facebook.  Somebody called me today.  This is an interesting thing. He's 51  years old. He said I'm embarrassed to admit it.  I never did Facebook. So I  joined it last week. My son's overseas  and I wanted to see how he was doing. And so I joined  Facebook. He said Facebook  he did not put  interestingly not put a profile  picture.  Or if he did it was a random  profile picture. Facebook shut  his countdown briefly and said  we won't reopen your account until you  send us a photograph of yourself.  And then so he did  he said it has to be a clear full  face picture of you. So he did.  And then they said okay we'll get back  to you. And then like a day later they unlocked  his account.  The thing I don't  the thing that I'm reading between the lines  tell me if I'm wrong here. It sounds  like Facebook would know if  it was him or not from the photo.  But he was never a member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. No.  They just wanted  They wanted to know what he looked like?  No. They wanted to prove that there was not  a computer algorithm  that's just spitting these things out.  That somebody was actually going to get this  message and respond to it and do a minimal  amount of work. But look  the thing that came out 200  million fake accounts  on Facebook  that is the as  Jason Kint pointed out  that would make it the seventh  largest country in the world  and would mean if  you got all of the fake accounts  on Facebook together they would  outnumber all of the real accounts  in the United States.  So you know  there really is  a problem here.  This is ironic because

Start time: 4422.20
End time: 4435.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook always gave the  impression that we have a  real names policy. You know you  can't use a fake name. You kind of have to be  real. But apparently  they didn't care. I guess they care  now. Yes. No. That

Start time: 4436.14
End time: 4493.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  policy was always BS.  What they wanted was accounts  that looked  real.  And what the real name  policy tended to do  was punish people who  had legitimate reasons  to preserve their anonymity  or work under a pseudonym.  People who were  you know  being harassed by an ex  for example. Or  people who or transgender  people who  who had changed  identities and  you know and changed  genders, changed names and such.  So that the whole real name policy  became a great way  to harass anyone who  was different. But it did as  my late cat  could tell you. It is very  easy for someone to  create a fake account and  have it still available on Facebook.

That's what's happened to the oil  companies in the past. You know you bring  the CEOs in and  then all the congressmen go down  the line and they take turns  punching each CEO in the face.

However they are trained  and  their job  is to obfuscate  the truth and to present  as narrow a picture as possible.  What really should have been there  and it should have been interviews with the staff  of the congressional committees  was the staff  who were actually working  on these features.

And I think that if there was more accountability  then they would be much more careful  that they were doing things on the  up and up and they can't say well I had  no clue that this happened.  Like you know well I think it was Al Franklin  that asked you know well how could you not  you know you deal with so many data points and how could you not tell  you know account  and they're paying in like rubles like  that doesn't maybe mean that  there's something up between this.  And so I think that it would be a great idea to  have people be accountable for the companies that they run  so they can't hide behind  and be able to say well you know  what actually I didn't know.

Transcript:  Oh, God, there's a much, much, much larger  story, which is about the nature of reality  and the nature  of truth.  The fake news story.  Well, yeah, but fake news  in a much broader sense  than you think. Think about it in terms  of commercial speech with all  the really crappy ads  that are in there, and people just  the way that Facebook  has designed  its algorithms  is it rewards  engagement, and  engagement  the engagement  scores tend to reward people  who are most willing to manipulate  the facts of a situation.  So it doesn't so the  political messages are  the impact of those is horrible.  But every time I go on Facebook  and I keep a lot of the filters off just  so I can see how bad it is,  the amount of stuff that's  there that is just  crap is  is truly mind-boggling.  And it filters to the top because  it's inflammatory and  therefore inspires engagement.  So that's the algorithm.

So I don't know about you, but  if we walk  into, you know,  an Amtrak station somewhere  and there's, you know,  a crazy guy standing  there screaming at the top of his lungs  that the world is ending at 1059  AM. You walk the other way in  real life. Right. But that's the guy  who's going to get the most engagement.  You know,  and that's actually  I mean, that's almost  literally the way that  it's working right now. The people who  can craft their message.  There's no incentive  to have  a fact-based  message  on Facebook. In fact,  a fact-based message on Facebook is  going to be drowned out by  the sensational ones  that make misleading claims.

And I think they do have  a higher responsibility than other  companies when it comes to  making sure that people access  accurate information and  are hearing it from legitimate accounts.  I'd like to see them  personally do a better  job at verifying that accounts are real.  I think it sounds like they're taking some steps,  but it sounds like they're still falling short.

Transcript:  It's not that there's news  out there that people disagree with.  It's that they're gaming the system in order to  make things trending that are not  something that is a swaying of public opinion.  They're creating what  we think is public opinion.  And because of that, that creates a wave of  us wanting to be a part of it.  We are innately tribalists.  And we want to be a part of the  winning tribe. And so if we see  a lot of information that is swaying  one way, and that's why there's  so many fake accounts, it's because then  they can make things trending  that slowly our cognitive  dissonance will be broken down and we will  want to become part of  that opinion. And so  they're actually just manipulating the system  in order to see something. This is Orwellian  in every stage.

Transcript:  Thursday, the Pew  Center, which comes out  with these great surveys and  tells us a lot about how Americans use  the internet, came out  with a new survey that said about a quarter  of all US adults get news from two  or more social media sites.  One quarter, that's up from 15% in 2013,  18% in 2016.  But get this, this is the one.  Just under half,  45% of US adults,  45% of US adults  use Facebook for news.  Half of Facebook's  news users get news from that social media  site alone  with just one in five relying  on three or more sites for news.  So not only is Facebook dominant  and the source of  news for many people, it's for many  people the only source of news. That is  where they get their news.

Transcript:  Right, and Georgia was  right on, I want to add one thing  to that, which is that  in addition to  putting out a message that  people may or may not believe,  there's two additional effects that you get  from the onslaught of just  pure deceptive  messaging going out on a variety  of topics. Number one,  is it creates the  uncertainty in people's minds that say,  well, I keep hearing this. Yeah,  must be true. So there must be  some kernel of truth underneath it.  There's smoke, there's fire, yeah.  So that's part of it. And the second thing  is even if you can't  get that reaction from  people, the Russian  trolls in particular  and in certain political  arms are incentivized  to just  break people down to the point  where they throw up their hands and say, I'm not  going to be involved in this. This is just  everyone's ugly,  everyone's screaming, everyone's yelling, I don't  believe a thing. And so they just tune out  and they choose not to  participate in the civic process.  They choose not to  believe that there is one  side that's right and one side that's wrong  and there's value in  gathering facts and finding out what that is.  Instead, there are  the external  trolls coming from the outside  are just as happy  to turn  us, you know, if they can  convince 2% of the voters  to just not go to the polls,  they've won.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's an actual physical  effect that happens when you hear enough  negative content.  It's that you're the part of your brain, your  prefrontal cortex, the part that actually  analyzes consequences to action, starts  to shut down. And when that happens, you  want to just avoid it because it's  damaging to the system. It's actually  painful for us to hear too much  negativity. And so  like in the end, they would just  pit people against each other.  So there's already been analysis  of the different ads that were there and they  were really just trying to create fights  so that people would be angry  and not want to be a part of things. So  what Ed is saying is completely  right. And it's damaging to  discourse, to being able to discuss  things, to have differing opinions  because they're trying to polarize people. And we  are very, it's really easy  to create our own tribes of people.  And you can see it with fights between Android and  Apple and different sports teams.  We are made to do that. It was very  beneficial to us when we worked in tribal  groups because we would keep our tribe  protected. But now that we really have no tribe,  we still have that innate want to be  part of a tribe. And it's easy to  demonize the us and them.

Start time: 5546.04
End time: 5753.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I would  submit that what really has happened  here is, and there's a much  larger pattern, a much larger  game afoot,  which is that  one of the side effects of technology,  big data, computation,  is that companies  have gotten very good  at optimizing for engagement.  This is something  brand new. They've just gotten  incredibly good, almost  literally, not almost,  too good at optimizing  for engagement. That's one.  And by the way, it's  a capitalist society. If  optimizing for engagement returns  more dollars, they're going to do that.  They're going to do that.  Two, along  come actors, Russia's  just one of them, who see  this as an opportunity. They  understand what's going on, and  they say, hey, this is great. We can seed  confusion and dissent and  ultimately  complete apathy  by just taking advantage of  these things. And it's not just Facebook,  but Facebook's, let's use Facebook as an example,  by taking advantage of Facebook.  And it seems to me almost  an inevitability  when you get to the point  where you have a capitalist system and you have  technology that is  able to do this, that this is going to happen.  And I don't know what the  antidote is.  The interesting  article in the New York Times,  How to Fix Facebook, Farhad Manju  and Kevin Roos, who I  really admire, asked some smart  people,  and, you know,  what do we do about this?  And  there aren't a lot of solutions.  Kevin Kelly said, reduce anonymity,  provide real verification.  You know,  this is a challenge because  we all acknowledge that there's a reason for  anonymity.  There's a need for an ability to  be a whistleblower or, you know,  to talk freely without  verification of your identity. And at the same  time, that's become a very  damaging thing.  They asked a congressman from Silicon  Valley,  and he says, we need more  transparency. Facebook needs to tell us how the  algorithm works. They're never going to do that.  They should make their executives  readily available to the press in  Capitol Hill.  Bad actors want to take advantage  of technology platforms, but the key  is for Facebook to be upfront about the  challenges, open about its mistakes,  and willing to answer the tough questions. Eli  Pariser wrote The Filter Bubble.  I thought this was an interesting idea.  He said, Facebook should allow independent  researchers to study.  He says, right now Facebook's a black box.  He says,  there's of course a challenge to opening private data  to research, but  there are ways to do this, and it  would be helpful  to understand what's going on.  It would be a bold move for transparency  and one that would help us understand much better  what's going on. Facebook  employee, I can go on and on. I don't want to  get into the details. There's quite a few people.  Tim Wu, who wrote  the number of  really important books, coined the term  net neutrality as latest as the attention  merchants. He says, Facebook should become a  public benefit corporation.  That's kind of what you're suggesting, Ed, is that they should  stop being a for-profit entity  and be responsible  for the problem they have created?

Start time: 5756.06
End time: 5815.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wish  that we could reduce  the problem and the solution down to  a 15 second sound bite.  But unfortunately,  the original  sin happened  years ago when  Facebook turned from its  original model of being  a way to connect people  and the groups  originally colleges  and universities, and then it became  employers  and communities and such,  you know, local cities  and such. But they made a very  conscious decision to become a  news publisher. And that  has been tremendously  lucrative for them  monetarily.  But that's where  everything went off the  rails. And without being able  to rewind the tape and go back to that point  and start over again, I don't  think that there is an easy solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but if they put, and I, you know, I don't want to say  the word legislate, but I am.  But if they put legislations in place  where they had to be accountable for the  free speech.  You know what, though? There comes  a point where your free speech is actually  causing damage to other people, and that's where  free speech should end. And again, I'm from Canada,  so yes, we're kind of a democratic  socialistic nation, but  you shouldn't be able to push  hatred. And these are lies.  This isn't even free speech. These are bots  that are putting out media  in order to change public opinion.  I understand that. And you could sanction accounts.  But if you tell Facebook, you can't

Start time: 5892.00
End time: 5897.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do this, that's, that is  getting in the way of their rights to do that.  I have another idea to it, which again,

Start time: 5898.00
End time: 5943.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  may completely not work, and I think that this would  change one of the reasons why Facebook is so popular.  But if you had, like, you know,  before you're going to post something like a captcha  or something that happened so that you could prove  that you are not a bot, at least  it would slow down the percentage of bots  that were out there pumping out information  and then, you know, liking it  so that it becomes trending. There has to be  something that is a check in place  because people can talk  about what they want. But there shouldn't  be mass-produced waves  of differing opinions that are  there just to incite negativity  in another country so that then you can  kind of take over the pieces.  Because when we fight among ourselves,  we become weaker, and then  that works out great for rival nations.  And that could be anyone.  Facebook's not an American, it's

Start time: 5944.59

Transcript:  companies. Fair. But again, what I'm saying  is that it's not freedom of speech  because this is not someone's  personal opinion. We're talking about  a whole bunch of bots  that one organization  or many is controlling  to sway opinion. And so it should  be under a different  set of legislation. Isn't there

Start time: 5970.08
End time: 5987.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a great risk of unintended consequences  though if there were,  I don't have any faith that legislation  could be written that would control  this without having  serious impact on things like  the First Amendment. Or, I mean,  I don't have... Should a computer though

Start time: 5992.97
End time: 6090.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So there's an  interesting thing  legal issue going  on here.  Facebook wants to claim  that it is simply a neutral publisher  that if  people  or what appear to be people  on the service are  putting ideas out there, they can't  be held responsible for them because  they're simply providing a platform  for them to  for them to promulgate  those ideas. The problem  is that that exception  came about a long  time ago when there  was a significant cost  associated with promulgating  ideas. You had to own  a printing press. You had to have  people who would carry your newspapers out  there. So yes, you could put  fake news out there, but it  came at a fairly high cost. Facebook's  marginal cost for putting a new post  out is  essentially zero.  And their economic  incentive for putting hundreds of  thousands of posts out, you know, per  minute  is extremely  high. So at some point you have to  resolve this issue. Are they  a part of the process? Are they responsible  for the messages coming out there,  especially when they're algorithmically  determining which messages you and  I see? Or are they true  if they're truly going to be  a neutral publisher  the way newspapers used to be, then  you know, they need to just like  eliminate the algorithms completely.  I think it's an untenable  point of view.

Start time: 6093.03
End time: 6151.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to expand on  Ed's comment about how  they have an incentive to have as many  posts as possible. I also think  that tech companies have been too complacent about  allowing bots to exist.  You know, like I can even look at my Instagram,  which used to have 2,000 followers,  and I don't know that many people. You know, there are mostly  bots. Twitter, probably a lot of bots.  Facebook, lots of bots trying to add  me all the time. And I  think there's been very little done in  terms of getting rid of these bots because  it makes them look good. It makes it look like they have  more users that they can report to  their investors every quarter. So I definitely  think it's something that has not been addressed.  And  we were talking about potential solutions.  I think if you look at a social  network like Nextdoor, they do this  really interesting thing where they send you a postcard  with the code to make sure they're sending  a postcard to a real person with a mailing address  before you could use the service. You know, there's plenty  of things that can be done that aren't being  done yet by Facebook, Twitter, and different  social media companies that I wish would be  more pursued.

Start time: 6152.30
End time: 6175.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And didn't they also clamp down on other  like, well, I think that this  one was Ashley Madison. But anyways, they had a whole bunch  of bots posing as females  that weren't true. And they actually  had to say, listen, these are lies  and so people are joining it, which is  actually a lie. And because of that, they were fined  for it and then said that they  would get rid of it. And then there was like three females  on the entire site. But  that's a different story for a different time.

Start time: 6198.42

And so they went  they went back into  you know, with full access to Twitter's  internal data and said, holy  crap, you're right. Brought this  over to  management at Twitter and to  the the engineering  site at Twitter. And their response  was, and I quote, stay in  your lane.  That's the  and that ultimately is something that  I tweeted this week, which is all of  the things that  are going to fix social media  are  profoundly against  the economic self interests of  the companies of the companies that  are running those services. So it's in  their self interests to  take  small measures that appear  to be doing  something to apply  a blizzard of  band-aids to the problem  without actually affecting  the underlying broken  compound fractures.

He said efforts to root out  spam and manipulation on the platform were  slowed down by the company's  growth team, which focused on increasing users  and revenue. This is the quote,  anything we would do that would slow down signups,  delete accounts, or remove accounts  had to go through the growth team,  and they were more concerned with growth numbers  than fake and compromised accounts.

But the nature  of this kind of activity is they're  always going to make mistakes.  Yeah. And and when  they make a mistake,  I saw somebody who did an analysis  of the Gooseifer 2.0  personality on Twitter.  I was reading this article today.  This is the this is the  Twitter account that was  responsible for the first  dump of the  the DNC Podesta  emails from last  year and they were able to go back  using a variety of  of tools  to find and they discovered  that the Gooseifer 2.0  account was originally created in Russia  and that it and that  there was a period there where it was  looking surprisingly French  because guess what?  A French election was coming  up just a few months later.  And so they found that this, you know,  supposedly free  thinking, you  know, account that is a  working in the on the behalf of the  free citizens of the world was  they found pretty damning  evidence that this was  created in Russia  and was designed to influence  first an election in the United States  and then an election in France.

I worry that  those they feel too easy  in Pat and I don't feel like  I feel like there's an underlying problem  that's deeper than looking  for Russian IP addresses or  searching for mistakes  from Gooseifer.

Transcript:  I think that people also  don't know how easily we are  influenced. I think that that needs to become  media savvy has to be something that is  taught to our children in school  of how do you consume media  when someone's trying to influence you  by their talks. I think this would also help people not be  influenced by salesmen and, you know,  get a better amount on there when  they buy a car. Like, we need to be taught  these type of dealings  right from when we're really young. How  can you tell when you're trying to be persuaded  and when is someone trying to use a  fear tactic on you and what are these different  tactics that they use? I think that would  help. I think that would help a lot, but it has to  happen at a really young age.

We don't like to hear news that's going to be  from different, like, you know, oh, I don't want to hear  this news from here. So then that makes me  safe. But the problem is if it's polarized  news, I become more and more  leaning to whichever way I already leaned.  So we're already  made to do that.

Transcript:  And here's the even  worst thing is that  there was a lot of focus in the congressional  hearings on advertisements,  but that's the wrong place  to be looking. The ads  are not the, are not the problem.  Those were almost  a sideshow  for the whole thing.  A lot of that was, a lot of this was engagement  from accounts that appear  to be real  people, activists,  you know, legitimate  experts in an area.  The Blacktivist account,  which had 350,000  followers or so.  And the real, the  the way that the process gets  most toxic is when  one of those non-paid  messages gets out  there and then is amplified by  your friends. When your friends  are sharing things with you,  you tend to believe it more  than if it's an ad sitting in the side  bar that's labeled as an ad.  And that's the, that's the real thing.  All the, you know,  if they have 200 million fake accounts,  all they have to do is create  a handful of stars out there  that can have a couple hundred thousand  followers and start pushing a message  out that then gets,  you know, they tell two friends  and each one of those two friends tells  two friends and so on and so  on, the way the old commercial used to go.  You, you get a multiplier  factor on that  that is just  unbelievable  and frankly unbearable  when the message that you're starting out  with is, is toxic.

Many people are still going to be influenced  by media if it is not Facebook, it could be  something else. But we found  that people, if they're happy,  if they're doing good things for themselves,  if they're feeling, dealing with their anxiety,  these different things will  lessen our need to be susceptible.  We are most susceptible when we are scared,  when we are worried, when we are  angry. And so, you know,  just doing things for yourself, taking care of yourself  will make you less susceptible  to polarizing news.  And in the end, that's what we want. We want  everyone to kind of come together. We're  as a nation to be able to make good  change so that everyone lives better lives.  And that's by listening to each other, not by shutting  out one group or another.

Transcript:  It's so sad to me because really the hope  at the beginning, and I've mentioned this before  of all of this, of the  internet, of Facebook, of Twitter, of  Google, was that  it would ultimately democratize  speech. Everybody would get a chance to have a voice  that people  would be heard, that  you know, the oligarchs would no longer control  the media.  And it's just really backfired terribly.  It's not worked out like anybody.  Ed, you and I, we're at the beginning  of the internet. We remember  those days. And I was very hopeful.

That was, I think it was November 2nd,  It was the first worm in the apple.  And  that was sort of, you know,  you saw that happen, and all these people  who invented this,  the internet that had these  amazing capabilities to it,  and there was one guy saying there,  you know, all it takes is  somebody with some bad intent to go in  and completely hijack this, like  this.  And then  pretty soon, and then  about four or five years  later, you had  email,  you had spam taking  over what had been wonderful  email, and that was  over. And then you had advertisements  that were taken over by,  you know, by  malware.  And, you know, so I mean, I think  the lesson of the internet, for as long  as it has been available  to the public, has been whatever  you fall in love with is going to turn to  crap really quickly.

Transcript:  maybe here at Twitter, we should do  more about this. Maybe we could do something. That would be  great. Yeah. I have to think about  that. Ed Bott's also here, the Ed Bott  report on ZDNet.  Great to have all three of you.  Our show today brought to you by,  I wish I'd spent more time last night, but the  stupid fall back thing.  But I had a nice  mattress to lie on, my Casper.  Casper is an online  retailer of premium mattresses  for a fraction of the cost. They were the first  to really do this, to break the  hold, the grip of the mattress  middleman. These people,  these mattress stores, they mark  it up 100%, they hard  sell you. You can go  direct to the source. You go to Casper,  cut the cost of dealing with resellers,  and showrooms, and the savings  are passed right on to you. But now there's a problem,  and the Casper immediately pinpointed this.  People think they want to  lie on the mattress before they  buy the mattress. They think  they need to go to that showroom, but I think it's pretty clear.  You don't learn anything from lying on a mattress  for five minutes in broad daylight  with the salesperson looking at you, your shoes  on. You can't tell. How about  this? How about this?  Get the Casper mattress,  and then decide. You have a hundred nights  to sleep on your Casper, and then decide.  Casper mattresses combine multiple  supportive memory phones for a sleep  surface with just,  it's kind of a paradox, but they do it  just the right sync,  so your hard bits get, you know,  comfortably supported, but also  just the right bounce. So your back  wake in the morning, you feel great,  and I have to say, very important,  it's breathable design, sleeps cool,  and I know you know this, Georgia, sleeping  cool is very important to having  a good night's sleep. You don't want to sleep hot,  and Casper mattress is the best.  And it provides  long-lasting comfort and support. You can buy  it online, and there's absolutely no risk.  Now, I just got the new  Casper mattress, the Wave,  which features a natural geometry support  system, a new top layer.  It's a little more expensive, but I,  it's a, I have to say, I  like it even more.  Free shipping, free returns to the  US, Canada, and the UK. You get your choice.  The original Casper,  it's what I sent my kids to college with,  and you know what's great,  after four years they just left it there, because it was affordable.  And they said, the next kid's going to get  a nice mattress. Free delivery,  return, you have a hundred days to return it,  if you say, at any point in that first hundred days,  or I should say a hundred nights, you say,  I don't want it, they will come, they will get it,  they will refund every penny, you've got nothing to lose.  They come in a very compact box,  you open it up, they  suck up all the air, and they suddenly, they fluff out.  There is no smell, I don't know how they do this,  they do not smell, they just, they just  smell great, fresh.  I, you know, I've had mattresses,  you had to air them out for weeks before  you wanted to sleep on them, not the Casper.  Get a Casper mattress today, and  by the way, we're going to save you an additional $50  by going to casper.com slash twit.  All you have to do is use the promo code  twit, T-W-I-T, at checkout.  casper.com slash twit.  $50 towards your mattress purchase,  when you use the promo code twit.  Terms and conditions apply.  Get a great night's sleep on your Casper  mattress.  Really nice. And by the way,  I'm going to say it again, because maybe it didn't sink in.  Yes, the US, but they also ship to Canada  and the UK.  I know we have a lot of UK listeners who have heard us talk about this  who are saying, alright,  alright.  By the way,  Mitch McConnell  yesterday  said that  McConnell thinks tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Twitter  could help the United States retaliate  against Russian forces.  But he's  skeptical of efforts to regulate political ads.  This was on the Hugh Hewitt  show.  So when you get the  leader of the Senate,  or is he, he's  you know, he is the Republican leader of the Senate  saying, well, yeah,  but maybe not.  Asked about the absence of Mark Zuckerberg  at the testimony. He said that was not good.  He said the tech industry ought  to be more interested in cooperating  when you have a clear law enforcement  issue, more interested in cooperating with law enforcement  than they have been.  Now, I can't disagree with this. What we ought to do  with regard  to the Russians is retaliate,  seriously retaliate against the Russians.  This is great. Let's have a war  with Russia over Facebook.  And these tech terms could be helpful in giving  us a way to do that. I despair  frankly, that Congress  will ever understand what the issues are  and will ever make  a law that makes any sense. In fact, I worry  that anything that they do do will actually be  counterproductive. It's like encouraging  Facebook to wage war against Russia.  What?

Basically, basically what you're asking  is for what are supposed to be  global  technology companies, global  communication networks, to be  temporarily co-opted  by the  government of one country  which may or may not be  run by people who  have the interests  of the global community  at large. The idea  that the government, that the United States  government should be taking  over a social media  company and using it  to attack their enemies.  That's what the president's Twitter account is for.  Which by the way, as we mentioned,

He killed the account.  Of course, Twitter's government and elections  team immediately reinstated it.  But it raises the bigger issue.  Well,  just any  customer service guy could turn off  anybody's account. Can he tweet on your  behalf? Twitter said, no, no, no.  They can't tweet on the president's  behalf.

So there  was an effort  to get them back together again  but T-Mobile and Sprint will not  join together.  I think that's probably a good  thing. I think more carriers is  better than fewer

Historically  it's always been shown that with  telecommunications companies especially  or utilities companies, whenever there  have been mergers, historically  it's shown that there have been fewer jobs.  Prices have risen for  consumers, etc., etc. So all the historical  data just shows that this is the right thing  for the industry.

Transcript:  But in the United  States, don't we  effectively have a duopoly  with Verizon  and AT&T? I mean, collectively  when you combine their two  market shares,  I haven't looked lately so I'm  not going to guess what the number is  but the last time  I looked it was  the vast majority.  Sprint was a very small  number and T-Mobile  was a small  number. And when you combine a small number  and a very small number, you  usually wind up with a small  number. And so the fact of having  a bunch of  little naps in  the market,  I'm not sure  that that's really... The way that you  get competition is  by reducing  the share of the  two companies that make up  the duopoly so  that the  companies that are third and  fourth and fifth and sixth  out there have a legitimate shot  at winning over customers.

Start time: 7595.15

Transcript:  I don't think we can even change it at this  point because it comes down to wireless  spectrum, right? The licenses  for the spectrum. And now we're really  going into the weeds here, right? But like AT&T  and Verizon own the vast majority of  spectrum. I think about 80% of spectrum  in the United States.  Whereas if the two combine  then they would still have nothing to use to build  a greater network, a bigger network.  So there's really no point in  combining the two companies.

So an HP company  is up in the Santa Rosa  area. It was called Agilent.  They were  a spinoff. And then they became Keysight.  And Keysight somehow  got custody of these papers, which had been  stored in a fireproof  safe and so forth. And instead just  put them in a shed where they  burned up. They had been  assessed at a value in 2005  of two million dollars.  They had previously kept in special  flame retardant lined vaults.  But I guess  nobody cared. Keysight said,  just put them in that shed over there.  And of course  this is from an era when stuff wasn't kept  electronically. So these are the only copies  of those papers.  Kind of sad.

There is  Motherboard published  an article,  the Vice site, which is a very  good site, and I have to credit  the author of the article,  Christopher Malmo,  with doing some mathematics,  came up with a kind of not exactly  an accurate headline. One Bitcoin  transaction now  uses as much energy as your  house in a week.  But what he did was he  divided the total  amount of energy Bitcoin  miners estimate,  are estimated to use, about  24 terawatts of  terawatts of electricity a year  by the 300,000  Bitcoin transactions a day  and came up with 215  kilowatt hours used  for each Bitcoin transaction. But of  course the transactions don't use it, but  the miners do. Right.  And it is kind of remarkable  that Bitcoin mining, now  of course it's not economical if the power costs  anything or much.  So a lot of Bitcoin miners are next  to hydroelectric dams in China, for instance,  where power is either free or cheap.  Nevertheless, 24 terawatts  of hours of electricity a year  to basically do meaningless  math computations to generate more Bitcoin.

Transcript:  Well, maybe you weren't the only one. Razer had  an announcement at,  they did it, streamed it live on Twitch on November  1st. They announced a new phone.  Possibly the, I don't want to say  ugly, but the plainest phone ever.  But at good price. It's an 800,  835, Snapdragon 835 with a  5.7 inch  LCD display.  120 hertz refresh rate.  So this is kind of, Razer's a gaming company.  So it's kind of gaming focused.  8 gigs of RAM. I don't know of any phone with more RAM.  64 gigs of storage  plus the ability to support an SD card.  Front facing speakers with,  on the left and the right with Dolby Atmos.  Android Nougat THX certification.  And it's only $699.  Available in the US November 17th.  But it's, I noticed  a number of reviewers said,  damn that's ugly.  It's basically just a square,  it's a square box.  You know, there's nothing, there's nothing to it.  Pretty impressive.  Great for gaming. I guess they would,

So I think they just incorporated features of  the Robin phone. They had a, the Robin team is very  good. A lot of them came from Android.

Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting story because  most people reviewed pre-production units  and the camera crashed.  And I got my, I bought  an Essential phone as I do with all this stuff  and it crashed the first time I launched  the camera. The whole phone crashed.  But within a week they started pushing out  updates. I think they pushed three or four updates  and now it's fine.  It works great, but it's too late.  Yeah. Right?  Too late. Everybody says the camera crashes.  So that's the problem with pre-production  units. They fixed it.  Yeah. Well, it is, obviously.  And it's not a great camera, I'll admit.  It's not as good as the, have you played with  the Pixel 2 XL?

Start time: 8564.26
End time: 8576.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so it's an interesting thing that's  going on here.  You know, of course, Microsoft  released Windows 10 in July of 2015  and they said free  upgrades for everybody. Verizon and Google

Start time: 8576.00
End time: 8587.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Auto play, I hate you.  Okay. God.  Thank God the New York Times isn't doing that.  Oh, is that  my, is that CDNet?  That's CDNet, yeah.

Start time: 8589.23
End time: 8652.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope my management  is watching. But  the, yeah, so  one year after the original  launch, they said, okay,  the free upgrade offer is over.  But if you read  the disclaimers  on that, it said the  free upgrade offer through the Get  Windows 10 app is now  ended. But as it turns  out today, if you have a PC  that's running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1,  you can just go out and download the  Windows 10 code, install it, and boom,  you get your free upgrade. Does it authenticate?  Yes. Yes.  They never take out the free upgrades.  I've been writing about this. One of my most popular  posts has been for a year. You can still  get the upgrade. And  the part of the justification  for that was that anyone who  uses any kind of assistive  technology,  which could be as simple as the  screen magnifier in  Windows 10,  is entitled to a free upgrade.  There's no test. There's no  qualifier.  You know,

Start time: 8654.00
End time: 8659.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have to assert that you use  assistive technologies? You don't  even have to say it. You just do it.

Start time: 8660.81
End time: 8697.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just download it  and do it. But that offer  is officially, and that  fig leaf for  corporate buyers is  officially ending as of December  31st of this year.  So after that time, the  question becomes, will  Microsoft turn off the  code on the  activation servers that allows  older PCs to  upgrade for free?  Or will it just be just like before,  they'll still leave it running  in the background, but this time  there's no  justification for it.

Start time: 8699.13

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  I had no idea. I gotta read  the EdBot report more often. I had  no idea.  That's awesome.  Yeah. And  frankly, if you're using Windows, you're still using Windows  8, you should probably upgrade.  That was horrible. That was a nightmare.  10's great. I don't mind 10 at all. I like  10 a lot. I'm using it right now  with my Magic Surface  Studio.
