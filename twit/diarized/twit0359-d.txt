Transcript:  Good to be here, Lewis.  Good to be here, Leo. Sorry I couldn't be in Petaluma today, but it's a long commute and the Pride Parade is in San Francisco, which is very cool.  But it means more traffic.  You can't really get anywhere.

We call it an avatar. You're just there on a screen.  Can I get some free coffee from the other room like everybody else?  Yeah, no, you have to get your own. That's the difference. You've got to get your own coffee and my dog won't lick your toes.  I've got my own dog.  Okay, good. We've got the proxy.  So is it hyperbole of me to say the biggest week in the history of Microsoft from Microsoft's point of view? Larry, did you go down?

Start time: 310.50
End time: 338.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was in Washington, D.C., but it was a big week. I mean, between tablets and phone operating systems, I don't know, the biggest. Does it beat Windows 95 or Windows 3.0?  It's pretty close to Windows 95, I would say.  It's a pretty big deal. It's a big deal for them because they're betting the company on Metro. They're betting the company on their own hardware.  Rumor is that they may have their own phone. That's a huge departure for Microsoft. So maybe it is the biggest week.

Start time: 341.78
End time: 347.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not go, no. I mean, it was definitely the biggest week I can think of since the Xbox 360 launch.

Start time: 348.56
End time: 417.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I do remember when the main Xbox, the first Xbox launch, that was a pretty big deal.  That was a big one, but the 360 I think was much bigger.  360. But I have to say, this to me is huge because Microsoft's changing its business model.  Really good. John Gruber wrote a piece about it on Daring Fireball referring back to a guy named Diddy Yu and I don't from Asimco blog.  Yeah.  I don't know, but he wrote, I thought, a very intelligent piece in which he essentially said, do the numbers.  And what Microsoft realized was the writing on the wall. They'd made all their money selling expensive software on commodity hardware.  And really, I mean, we always, Dvorak would always joke, well, whose wallet would you rather have, Bill Gates or Steve Jobs?  It's better to be in a low overhead software business because it's all profit.  But all of a sudden that seems to have changed.  And Apple has proved that, in fact, there's more profit in doing inexpensive software on very expensive hardware.  And Diddy Yu's premise is Microsoft saw the curves intersecting and said, we've got to do something about this.  Does that make sense to you?

Start time: 417.96
End time: 479.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I mean, I don't think that they're looking at it as they're going to make money on the software.  I think that they're looking at it as one, you know, owning the whole banana, as we say.  And a lot of this actually kind of goes back before the iPhone.  As we really started to adopt mobile devices, something changed.  And that was we had integrated experiences.  And, you know, that would that means, at least my opinion, you know, a software stack and a hardware stack that are very closely tied together and that are not necessarily commoditized.  And if they don't work well together, the whole thing falls apart.  And so we started getting used to this. And then Apple raised the game with the iPhone.  And then all of a sudden it stopped being about operating system and hardware and, you know, pick your hardware, pick your operating system.  It became single great experiences that people came to expect.  Right. And I think that that's what Microsoft really realizes.  You have to at some point sooner or later to match the great experiences other companies are creating.  You have to own the whole banana.

Start time: 481.50
End time: 520.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Harris says that by doing a little division, Microsoft, if you include the office licenses and the windows licenses, makes about seventy eight dollars of operating profit per PC sold.  Remember, they don't make the PC. They just make the software.  He says Apple, if we do a little math, makes one hundred ninety five dollars per iPad sold.  And as iPads start to outsell PCs.  We're talking about surface.  Well, yeah.  Well, I mean, they're not making a surface because they were only doing the software.  And then, of course, Lenovo and Dell and HP are doing the hardware.  There's not much margin in hardware in the PC.

Start time: 520.52
End time: 560.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a major competitive disadvantage that they had for their hardware partners in the tablet space, because I think what I've read and I don't I don't have this confirmed yet because I'm not sure if the final OEM pricing is out.  But I think I'd read that they were going to charge seventy five dollars to eighty five dollars for Windows RT, which is their version of iOS.  So that would be the licensing cost to a tablet.  Right. So if I'm Asus and I want to create a windows based tablet, I'm going to have to pay seventy five dollars just for the OS, which if you look at the breakdown of what goes into one of these things, seventy five dollars is enormous.  That's more that's at par or maybe even slightly more than the incredible display on the on the right.

Start time: 560.98
End time: 563.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that isn't that a game killer for the third party ecosystem?

Start time: 564.04
End time: 576.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm saying. It's a huge competitive disadvantage to those guys because they can't compete on price with anyone else if they have to do seventy five dollars cost for the OS.  So for Microsoft, that makes a lot of sense.

Start time: 577.56
End time: 607.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus the fact I don't know how good the hardware is going to finally be when we see the actual final version of it.  But I would guess that Microsoft's going to do a really good job on the surface tablet relative to other companies that are going to create tablets using the same software.  In fact, I think Google did a superb job on its phones relative to HTC and some of the other players in terms of the branding.  And so I think that essentially they're going to kill the entire ecosystem, which I don't get it in that sense.

Start time: 608.50
End time: 626.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think they're going to kill.  I agree that they are going to kill the ecosystem on the tablet on Windows RT.  But I think that there's still I mean, look at Dell, Lenovo, HP.  They've still got to sell Windows machines. They're going to sell Windows 8, aren't they?  Or are they just going to be all Windows 7? What about you?  Robert, you deal with business. Business isn't moving to Windows 8.

Start time: 626.68
End time: 643.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not. But this is why you've had in this last week, the CEO of Acer came out and essentially he laughed.  He said they're not going to make this.  He said Microsoft was going to fail. And the reason he gave for them failing is they're creating two products.  They're creating their own product and they're creating the third party market for the Surface tablet.

Start time: 643.70
End time: 646.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know they only need one to win.

Start time: 646.50
End time: 654.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They only need one to win. And Acer actually bet the farm against tablets at CES this last year.  They essentially surrendered the tablet market.

Start time: 654.88
End time: 683.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be another reason for Microsoft to do tablets.  Exactly.  Even at Computex, we didn't see a lot of Windows RT tablets, right?  It looked like, okay, I'm going to make a prediction. I've got two predictions.  And I agree with you, by the way. It's not just financial. It's also because integrating hardware and software makes sense.  That's Apple's big advantage, right? They give a better user experience.  I think by doing what they've done, there's two things that are going to happen.  One, I don't think anybody's going to make a Windows RT tablet. I think it's all going to be Windows 8.

Start time: 683.64
End time: 687.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know about that. I think you'll still see people making it. The problem is they're going to be, well, go ahead and make a prediction.

Start time: 688.00
End time: 750.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there aren't going to be many apps, even though there is. In theory, you could push a button when you make a Windows 8 Metro app and it's a Windows RT app.  I just don't think we've seen so many tablets like the Playbook, like the Zoom, the Android tablets just die because there weren't enough apps for those tablets.  There's no ecosystem. So, $75. It's an unproven system. You can make it. It's just going to be difficult.  You can make an Android tablet if you really want to make a tablet, at least have a shot at it.  And Microsoft's kind of in the market. So how are you going to compete against Microsoft?  So I think this kills Windows RT, except for a Microsoft product.  And I think they'll kill it quickly enough because it's not going to be selling very well with just them making it.  I think it also means Windows 7 gets an end of life in 2025 because I don't think business wants to go to Windows 8.  I think Microsoft is going to essentially cede the Windows 7 market to Lenovo's, the Dell's.  They're going to make Windows 8 pro tablets and it's going to be a very different PC world.

Start time: 750.66
End time: 753.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is very doom and gloom for you. I mean, you think it's going to fail.

Start time: 754.96
End time: 765.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Windows RT will fail. I think Windows 7's got a long life ahead of it because business needs it and wants it.  I think Windows 8 is going to take a long time for it to get any trouble.

Start time: 765.54
End time: 776.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Windows RT doesn't work out, just so we're totally clear, that is Microsoft's entire tablet strategy right now.  Yeah, that's tablet.  But it's not just tablets.

Start time: 776.64
End time: 782.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the one that comes out next year that runs regular Windows 8 and that runs the office of full-blown apps?

Start time: 783.00
End time: 804.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it's kind of a pedantic.  It's an upside-down laptop.  It's not really a tablet. It's not a tablet like this is a tablet. It's basically a slate PC.  I mean, it's a full Windows PC. So I wouldn't really kind of put it on the same.  It's going to cost twice as much. It's going to do different things.  It's not an iPad competitor. It's something different.

Start time: 805.60
End time: 820.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I see this as driving something else.  One of the biggest trends that we're seeing in the enterprise right now is BYOD.  So you've got all these different vendors trying to figure out how to let the users of a network bring the device that they want to bring.  And that really what that means is smartphones and tablets.

Start time: 820.82
End time: 824.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That happened with the iPhone. It's what transformed enterprise phones.

Start time: 824.72
End time: 833.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. And it killed RIM in the process.  But also what you're seeing is that that's been eroding Microsoft's enterprise lead in that space.

Start time: 834.50
End time: 837.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they worried about the iPad becoming a dominant enterprise platform?

Start time: 837.54
End time: 868.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they are. And that's why you've got the Surface RT.  What they want to do is they want to offer an option for enterprise people to say,  If you want a tablet, we can give you one without having to bring your own device.  We can give you a tablet experience that stays within this network that we've already created that uses all the same resources that we've already bought.  So I mean, I see that as the real impetus.  And why Microsoft released what was clearly an underbaked product.  I mean, no one was able to play with it.

Start time: 868.50
End time: 872.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other question. What was the hurry here? It must have been Google I.O., right?  Yeah, definitely I.O.

Start time: 872.98
End time: 880.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why I.O.?  Well, I mean, we don't know for sure what's going to be announced, but we keep hearing about new tablet stuff and we assume they're going to show a new version of Android.

Start time: 880.66
End time: 884.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So not only is Microsoft terrified of Apple, they're terrified of Google.

Start time: 884.84
End time: 895.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, as well they should be. I mean, there isn't a legitimate player in the tablet space other than Apple right now.  But if there was one, it would be Google. They're at least closer than the other guys, which are essentially nonexistent.

Start time: 896.92
End time: 900.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess what I'm saying is I can't see Windows RT competing with the iPad.

Start time: 901.30
End time: 940.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I mean, look, if you if you zoom way out, you know, we're at year three of tablets, basically.  And it feels like it feels like Microsoft's tablet efforts since 2001, which I don't, because again, those were PCs and they were built as PCs.  So I you know, it's a different paradigm. They didn't really know what to do yet.  Nobody really knew what to do yet. They were they were they were dabbling.  We're in year three of tablets. I think, you know, let's like zoom ahead 10 years, 15 years when tablets are, you know, what most of us are doing.  Most of our basic computing on and have been for quite some time.  That could look totally different. I think it's hard to say, like, way, way down.

Start time: 940.50
End time: 944.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't bring a laptop. You decided to go tablet. Are you doing I brought a laptop. I didn't bring it.

Start time: 944.56
End time: 961.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You didn't bring it. Yeah. So you're on the iPad only.  You know, I mean, I actually really don't like being iPad only. It's not for me.  If I could only pick one device, it would be my laptop.  And I feel very weird about, you know, going on vacation with only an iPad.  It just it doesn't feel right. There's a lot of stuff I know it can't do.

Start time: 962.54
End time: 969.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's a stretch. You have to work extra hard.  You have to bring a keyboard, bring a laptop for crying out loud.

Start time: 969.70
End time: 989.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why we have ultra books and MacBook Air.  I mean, the MacBook Air, ironically, is not that much heavier than the iPad and comes with a full keyboard  and all the software you could possibly want.  And there's some ultra books out there that are going to fit that bill.  So I think that for those of us that are doing real work, the laptop is still the machine of choice.

Start time: 990.98
End time: 1031.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the question, Robert, does business.  Microsoft argument is, well, you're using Windows in business.  You're using Exchange. You want compatibility.  We're going to give you a Microsoft solution that's going to fit better into your enterprise and the iPad.  But isn't that what Blackberry said? You've got Blackberry Enterprise Server.  Isn't that what the Windows Phone 6 and 6, 5 was all about?  Well, it integrates better. It works with Office.  And that wasn't compelling when it when we got to the BYOD era, people brought iPhones.  So Microsoft, I think, is is is counting on the idea that we'll somehow integrate better into the enterprise.  Right. And that's absolutely key.

Start time: 1033.18
End time: 1053.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's something that they have proven they haven't been able to do.  Nobody has.  They had an incredible opportunity with the release of Windows Mobile to tightly integrate it with Exchange,  to make it a no brainer to be able to use in the enterprise.  And it's not there. It's actually easier to set up an Android phone on Exchange Server than it is to set up Windows Mobile.  And that's just that's ridiculous.  Your context don't sync with Windows Phone.

Start time: 1054.60
End time: 1111.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you talking about Windows Mobile or Windows Phone?  We're talking about Windows Phone.  Because Windows Mobile, that was the that was like the key feature of Windows Mobile back in the day up to 6, 5,  was that it had amazing it had amazing whatever exchange integration.  And that wasn't enough to save it.  Right. So I think Microsoft probably looked at that and said, OK, well, clearly, you know, having a great office,  office enabled product and enterprise enabled product is not what's going to save us.  So we have to work towards the consumer first and then back our way into that.  And I actually I mean, I think that's actually what they're doing.  Consumer product, not a business product.  They didn't really talk about the business story at this launch.  I mean, they really didn't.  It was very, very much a consumer focused launch.  And I think that's really important.  We're talking a lot about business, but I don't think that this is intended to be a business product.  I think if we're talking about BYOD, they want this to be a device that consumers feel comfortable with.  That's how BYOD.  That's how the Apple.  Right. Which is frankly, that's the strategy they should be taking.

Start time: 1111.92
End time: 1151.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I like your analysis of looking at looking at this as year three of tablets, because we could actually take it back.  Look, five years, five years ago, everything was netbook.  We were moving to the netbook and people realized, well, the netbook doesn't really have everything I want.  Tablets became really popular.  People are now using iPads alone and they realize it doesn't have everything I want.  And so you've got on the other side, they're bringing out ultra books and the surface seems to be just an ultra book with a touch screen.  So it looks as if Microsoft is betting on the betting the farm on a strategy that says people want devices that are going to be like a tablet,  but will increasingly allow you to do more of the things you can expect out of a notebook.  I think it might fill a very nice niche that way.

Start time: 1152.04
End time: 1193.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think at least in the higher and heavier version of the surface, Microsoft is also betting that people want to run their Windows software.  I mean, because there are certainly people who are out there who love their iPad,  but are frustrated because there's one or two PC or Mac programs that they simply can't run.  And I do think that there is a market for that.  But as pointed out, Microsoft has more than 10 years experience coming out with tablets that are basically just little PCs.  So the question is by having the hybrid with a metro interface and the desktop, by making it lighter, taking advantage of newer technology,  can they finally crack that business market for people who want the tablet that also is a PC?  They claim it's a great tablet and a great PC, but that really remains to be seen.

Start time: 1194.04
End time: 1224.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This rarely works. Every time I try to, you know, balance multiple disparate needs within the electronics world, it almost never works out.  I mean, Microsoft has made it work once.  I would say the Xbox 360 is a great example that they created a game console that was also an amazing living room entertainment device.  But, you know, that was something that took them years to slowly develop.  And they're kind of really just now really flushing out that side.  Like they they got the games down and then they moved to the entertainment stuff over the course of, you know, two, three years.

Start time: 1224.60
End time: 1241.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pointing to the one example where it's working, the multifunction device.  The printer scanner. And frankly, when those first came out, there was a lot of question about, pardon my camera,  there's a lot of questions about those too, because they weren't all that good.  But that's about the only thing I can think of that really does multiple things well.

It's a weird laptop. Why would anybody buy that weird laptop for about a thousand dollars  when you could go buy a MacBook Air? Right. I mean, or somebody explain that to me.  It just makes no sense. RT, I can see it's going to be really hard for them.  But I can actually see some people buying that and adopting it.  The pro just makes no sense. And we've already seen slate PCs do not sell.  They're highly verticalized. You see them in the medical industry.  And that's basically it. They don't move. Nobody cares about them.

Transcript:  Let's talk about what we don't know. There's a lot we don't know.  And there's a lot of missing things. I want to talk about the event.  We're talking about surface and a very big week for Microsoft.  We haven't even gotten to Windows Phone 8, which they also announced this week.  And we got the right guy for that with Ryan Block from Gadget GDGT dot com from on the enterprise side.  We've got Father Robert Ballas. It's great. It's perfect time.  And you see where Microsoft is in this weird hybrid world. Right.  And then Larry Magid and I also who have to explain to consumers that there are two kinds of windows, Windows R.T. and Windows 8 Pro.  And how do you explain the difference? Right.  So we've got an interesting panel here and it's going to be a lot of fun.  We've got a lot more to come. But first, I want to talk about our friends at Citrix who are making a great product, even greater.  If you've ever done support on IT or if your software support, you know about GoToAssist.  I'm sure GoToAssist is the pioneer in remote support for 10 plus years.  They've been a cloud based solution.  They are now number one easily for supporting clients and colleagues remotely.  Eight sessions at once unattended support the assay of all the software running in the background, including operating systems.  It's just so great. But now they took something great and they made it even better by adding a monitoring module.  So now GoToAssist is both remote support and monitoring.  And they really go hand in hand. If you're an IT, you know how important this is.  You start by putting the GoToAssist crawler on your client's network and it goes out.  It not only detects all the hardware, but all the network attached devices and all the software.  So you have a complete set of this is what's running at that place of business, your client's place of business.  You then set up a customized dashboard. You can use standard dashboards or make some of your own to display stats, track and trend key metrics like CPU load averages, memory and disk utilization.  You can set thresholds. So if a hard drive is about to run out of space, you'll get an alert via I am SMS or email.  So you know before there's a problem, if the toner cartridge is running low, you can fix it before the client goes, Hey, the toner cartridge.  That means you're proactive, not reactive. It gives you a chance to really give superb support.  And that's what this is all about is taking you and making you a support hero.  If you're interested in upping your game, maybe you want to get in managed services. This is fantastic.  Our IT guy, Russell, three person shop. He's a consulting IT guy for us, but we use him about 20 hours a week.  Three person shop, 855 individual companies he supports. How do you do it? With this. We set him up with this. He's loving it.  He set us up with it now and we can we can do all the remote support. I could log into the servers from home and see what's going on. It's just fantastic.  I want you to try it free for 30 days. Visit gotoassist.com. There's a try it free button. You click that. It's blue now.  They've changed the color. The blue try it free button. And there's a little expandable area that says promo code.  If you would use twit as the promo code 30 days free, you get the full range of you see you check whether you want remote support or monitoring or both.  And you know, try them both. I think you'll be really impressed. And if you already are using go to assist, you could take advantage of this to try the new monitoring module.  Go to assist.com. Use the offer code twit. I think you'll be very, very impressed.  And by the way, 30 days free, you'll never be charged during your free trial. Cancel it anytime online. 24 seven support for you so you can really understand how it works.  Windows or Mac or iPad. They have iPad support now. You support a Windows machine or a Mac from the iPad. I should I should clarify. That's pretty amazing.  Go to assist.com. The offer codes twit. We thank them. Citrix has been such a great support all along for the twit network.  So what about partners? It's it's kind of you know, this this event, there was a lot of speculation was all over the place.  One thing people really said is, wow, Microsoft can't get in the business of making PCs because what about the partners? Obviously they can. Yes, they can. And why?

Start time: 1607.56
End time: 1674.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do whatever they want. How can they get away with that? They can do whatever they want. Can you imagine the calls from Acer, Lenovo, Asus, HP?  I will tell you right now, if Microsoft felt like they could make more money building all their own PCs and not licensing their OS like what Apple does, if Microsoft felt like they could make a go of that, they would do it tomorrow.  Do you think they're considering it? I don't know if Windows really needs it. But, you know, at a certain level. So this reminds me of I interviewed Bill Gates a number of years ago.  And one of the things that was a little more cogent than that is definitely kind of coming back now is this tension between Microsoft as a software company, as a hardware company.  And I asked him, you know, why do you do hardware? Like what is the motivations for you? And he said, we are always going to do hardware if it makes sense for the software, right?  If there's a central component to the combination of hardware and software that necessitates us to be the people to create that. And so we saw that in Zoom, right?  And Zoom is obviously the wrong product, but they had to make it. Nobody else was going to make that product. And we're seeing that now here.

Start time: 1674.56
End time: 1681.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of an analogous situation. There was a dominant music player, the iPod. Microsoft was losing ground. They had to make something.

Start time: 1682.12
End time: 1725.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is they made the wrong product, right? They were fighting the last war instead of fighting the next war.  But, you know, it also reminds me of the quote from Alan Kaye that if you're very serious about software, you should make your own hardware.  And, you know, I don't know if Microsoft will ever start making their own PCs. It wouldn't actually surprise me too much if one day they did that because if you ever walked into a Microsoft store or know much about how Microsoft stores work, they have a Windows premium experience, which is basically...  They call it the signature.  Yeah, I'm sorry, signature. Thank you. Where that's basically PCs that don't have crapware on it.  And nobody made one except Vizio just made one. Nobody's made any.  Exactly. If you make a PC without putting crapware on it, they will like just shower you with affection and they'll put you all over the Microsoft store and they will sell the hell out of your product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that to me is like they actually do care about the pure Windows experience.  Oh yeah, they want this.  Yes. But I don't think that they're on the PC side yet.

Start time: 1738.66
End time: 1780.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, Apple's secret sauce all along with the Mac was that they owned the hardware and the software.  I remember having also an interview with Bill Gates a number of years ago when I talked to him about all the problems with PCs compared to Macs with drivers and all the third party issues.  All he said was, hey, Steve Jobs, or maybe at that point it wasn't Steve Jobs, owns the hardware, owns the software, has a strategic advantage.  So Microsoft has always been well aware of that.  They made a bet early on having this OEM strategy and I can't imagine they're going to abandon that with PCs.  It would put some companies out of business.  But I do think that going forward, they may be very smart to at least have some products like the tablets that they control all aspects of.

Start time: 1781.94
End time: 1805.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm right with you.  They haven't said that they're going to make their own PC.  Yeah, you could call the pro a PC.  That pro is a PC.  It's a PC, but you're not going to replace a desktop or a laptop.  There's still room for a tower.  Exactly.  So they could tell their partners, look, you can still make all the towers and laptops that you want, but you've proven that you can't make a tablet that competes.

Start time: 1806.23
End time: 1820.50

Transcript:  You have good contacts with OEMs.  Aren't they going to start pounding the door and saying to Microsoft, keep making, we want to be able to sell Windows 7 for at least two more years.  Aren't they going to say this is our niche?  We'll take Windows 7.  You go ahead with this RT strategy.

Start time: 1820.62
End time: 1846.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The OEMs will absolutely be saying that.  They're demanding it.  They're going to demand that, look.  You owe us something now, Microsoft.  Precisely.  We want to sell what the consumer wants and we're seeing more and more the consumer doesn't want 8.  On the other side, however, what Microsoft can do, if they can pull off making RT and Pro a success, which is a big if, but if they can, that would actually drive 8 into the market.  The laptop and desktop space.

I mean, you know, people worried about the partner situation and I can't believe that Microsoft is doing this.  And there's like a lot of dropped jaws right now.  I mean, it cracks me up because what are they going to do?  You know, Microsoft can do whatever it wants.  And like it's in a great position.  And I actually I think it's great that they are not compromising to partners when they have the opportunity to create a product that they perceive is a better user experience.  I mean, ultimately, that's at the end of the day.  That's what this is all about is about creating better products.  Right.

Transcript:  Does all this benefit Apple?  I mean, they did this to compete with Apple.  Could they actually be increasing Apple's market share by creating confusion in the marketplace?

Start time: 1903.98
End time: 1932.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how much confusion there really is just because people who are going to use Windows 7 or Windows 8 or always going to use Windows 7 or Windows 8.  Enterprise is still going to use Windows and that's their biggest customer right now.  So I only see this as a plus for Microsoft.  Even if even if the tablets fail horribly, they've proven one thing and that is that they can create a message.  They can create a vision, which has been absolutely lacking for the last couple of years.  I mean, it's been going to know they got their mojo back.  They got their mojo.

Start time: 1932.68
End time: 1955.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, with this, they got their mojo.  But for as great as surfaces is looking, at least the R.T. side, in my opinion, I mean, they totally blew the marketing side, which is the product's name is Microsoft Surface for Windows R.T.  What the hell is wrong with them?  They actually went to all the trouble to create this really beautiful tablet and then they name it that.  I mean, that is actually surface is an OK tablet name.

Start time: 1955.50

Start time: 1966.50
End time: 1971.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1971.50
End time: 2001.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, all they had to do is they call the iPad competitor the surface and they call, you know, if they have to do this, this, you know, stupid half baked tablet PC, slate PC thing, you know, just call that the Windows slate PC pro or whatever the hell you want to call.  It doesn't matter because that's, you know, specifically aimed at the pro market.  But just call the surface.  I mean, that symbol says the reason they call it the resurface.  If there's if there's confusion, I think it's because they clearly do not know how to position this and nobody knows that Windows R.T. is.  No, I'm not.

Start time: 2001.64
End time: 2007.12

Transcript:  So it's like, oh, wait, even on the software side, remember, I remember Steve Jobs making fun of Microsoft one year when he introduced a new Mac OS.  And he said, you know, it comes in and he talked about the pro version, the consumer version.  And of course, they were all the same price.  They were all the same product compared to Microsoft.  And sometimes I love four or five different versions of Windows, all theoretically aimed at different audiences, all with different prices.  And again, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.  And Apple has really thrived on just keeping it very, very simple, whether you're working in a corporation or at home.  You have the same Mac OS.

Why isn't there somebody developing the next great operating system?  You know, there'd be a huge opportunity here to go to the OEMs and say, hey, we've got something for you.

That's true.  I mean, I am amazed how few programs I use.  The only program I just recently got a new MacBook Air.  The only program I actually had to load in from a disk and it wasn't even a disk was Microsoft Office.  Everything else I downloaded.  And as far as I can recall, they were all free.  I don't remember paying for anything other than Office to fully equip my machine because 90 percent of what I do, I do in a browser anyway, which of course is Google strategy.

Transcript:  You know, that may be true.  But I think part of the issue is there's a consumer perception now that you have to have a great app ecosystem.  And I think people know which platforms have the best app ecosystems and which don't.  And whether or not you're like really into apps is almost doesn't matter.

Start time: 2142.74
End time: 2157.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you. And that is going to be the crux for Windows RT.  It's got to have apps.  It means that Windows eight developers have to push that button in studio and say make a metro app and they have to sell it in the Microsoft Store.  Will that happen?  I mean, it's more than that.

Start time: 2157.50
End time: 2163.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not yet.  The irony is that tablets require an app ecosystem more than laptops and desktops do today.  Absolutely.  There isn't a huge demand for desktop software, but there's an enormous demand for apps, which is kind of.  Because they're cheap.

Start time: 2198.60
End time: 2213.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's again this thing.  This cheap software are free on expensive hardware.  That's the Apple model and Apple owns it.  That's my question is, how can you succeed?  Yeah, you've got Windows developers, but you've got to convince these Windows developers to make tablet apps.

Start time: 2213.90
End time: 2243.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, right now, if you are a developer of any kind, you're going to be chasing the money.  And the opportunity for software has completely unlocked in the last couple of years.  And I think a lot of that's due to Apple strategy.  They kind of reinvented software, at least in the consumer market.  And so if you're a developer out there, it's a huge opportunity for you to go to Android, iOS especially.  And most of the big apps are launching iOS first now.  I don't really see what the motivation is to start on Windows.  Why take a chance?

Start time: 2243.60

Transcript:  There's something we're leaving out.  And that is, yes, tablets have really driven an app mentality.  But there's something that's beyond that, and that's Internet as a service.  And we're seeing that for more and more carriers actually providing the heavy lifting remotely.  And tablets are a perfect portal into that, into tapping into that.  Now, if you start looking at Internet as a service as the next generation of applications,  then no one really has a stronghold on that.  Maybe Amazon, but definitely not Apple.  Apple's done horribly with Internet as a service.  What do you mean when you say Internet as a service?

Start time: 2286.50

End time: 2319.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How is that different from software as a service?  Well, iCloud sucks.  iCloud sucks.  But in the enterprise, you actually start looking at hosting the services that you would normally require within the network remotely.  Getting it out of your colo, getting it out of your data closet.  And that, at least in the enterprise, we're moving more and more to that.  Some of the services that you never thought enterprises would be willing to part with,  they're now fine with sourcing to a center they have no idea where it is.

Transcript:  So we know it's going to be available around the launch of Windows 8, which we know is going to be available later this year.  They said that they're going to have it priced competitively with other products similar to it.  So we're expecting an iPad-esque $500 price point.  Can they do that? Do you think your sources tell you the supply chain can make such a thing?  Yeah, I mean, some of those parts might not be as great as what you have in the iPad.  But they're Microsoft. They can throw money at this problem.  They buy a lot.  Yeah.  I mean, if anyone can throw money at this problem, they can.  Because they're not in the razor thin margin business that all their hardware partners are.  So, I mean, this is part of the problem.  Did you read the piece that Chris Eagler wrote about Palm and kind of how they went from being Palm to being dead in like 30 months or so?  One of the interesting things that was brought up in that piece was they were basically picking up after Apple scraps in the components market.  So Apple would go out, they would find and identify like the best product and say, oh, we really love this Sony camera sensor.  And they go buy basically every single one that was produced.  And then every other company who wanted to use a sensor in their tablet, that sensor in their tablet was unable to.  So they have to go find some other crappier parts to use.  Well, you really could see that with the pre. It broke at the drop.

Transcript:  And there's a great article, Danny Sullivan, who was one of the people who was down there.  And I know when we had Paul Thurotte and Mary Jo Foley on Windows Weekly, they weren't there.  But they also complained that so many of these gadget blogs, I'm sure Gadget didn't do this, but the Verge.  I didn't go. I opted not to go.  They all said, our hands on first hands on.  And that really was a little bit of a stretch.  For instance, Danny said, I tried to I was able to hold one.  And then I pressed. I thought, what if I press and hold the desktop?  Will I be able to see what the resolution is?  And they grabbed it from him as he started to do that.  And he tried it again and they said, nice try.  And they grabbed it again.  You could type on the keyboard, but not if it was attached.  And yet we've seen Windows 8 running on tablets, the Samsung.  It runs OK. It runs. There's some crashes, but it's it's pretty good.  What's what? Why the secrecy?

Start time: 2517.19
End time: 2527.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That means it's not ready. It's just not done.  They can do three things. I see three things done at these product demos.  Apple does two things. They either let you play with the product.  And then when they do, they let you just go to town on it.

Start time: 2527.74
End time: 2538.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even when the iPad was announced three months before it was shipped, the first iPad, there was a hands on room.  Yeah, so I was there. I was the last time I was ever at an Apple event.  And you could touch it. You could use it. Yep.

Start time: 2539.86
End time: 2544.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they either do that or they put it in a case and right.  No one's allowed to touch with it.

Start time: 2545.50
End time: 2550.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But most of the time, Apple actually ships products the day they announce them.  Well, certainly a few days.

Start time: 2550.50
End time: 2577.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And especially when they do that, they let everybody play with it.  Your third option, your third option is this thing, which Palm has done and a number of companies have done, which is they bring out half baked software.  They want to come off as though it's ready to go.  And that, oh, well, you know, we're like, we're we're really excited about this thing.  And it's just not there.  And so instead of putting it in a case and making it seem like it's not ready to go, they give you the illusion that you can actually play with it.

Start time: 2577.62
End time: 2593.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The classic example is the Blackberry Playbook at CES 2011, where they had a video on the screen that looked like it was doing something.  They wouldn't let anybody hold it. But they say, look, see.  And it was it turned out it was a quick time movie running of the OS.

Start time: 2593.60
End time: 2615.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how far away from Palm did this on a number of occasions.  Palm did this at the touch pad launch where you could go up and you could play with it.  They wouldn't actually let you hold the device, but you could put your finger on it.  And you could just go through like a very simple flow of like open a calendar app, but not actually do anything with it.  So, I mean, you could have been basically opening a static image.

Start time: 2616.69
End time: 2623.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it a mistake to have this announcement then when they did if it's really that far?  I mean, aren't they expecting people like you to say, well, it's obviously not done.

Start time: 2623.54
End time: 2656.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's you know, it's hard to say. I think that it's good that people have it on their radar.  I don't think that they had to do it because whatever Google announces at I.O.  is, you know, there's going to be a product roadmap lag there where it's going to take many months for all of their hardware partners to start adopting the newest version of the tablet stuff that they're going to announce.  So, I mean, I don't know. Maybe they felt like they had their back against the wall.  Maybe they felt like like it had been, you know, three years and it was time to make the announcement.  Maybe they wanted to soften the blow to the partners.

Start time: 2657.01
End time: 2671.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knows?  And what's with announcing the press conference four days ahead of time and not telling people where it is until 10 o'clock that morning?  I mean, I have never seen anything like that before from any company where you literally don't know where you're going until you land at LAX.

Start time: 2671.72

Transcript:  Do you think there's a ham-handed attempt to create Apple-like excitement around this event?  Yeah.

Start time: 2677.78
End time: 2693.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they did much better than Microsoft normally does with these events.  Even with all the things that we're lacking, it's still much better than what I expect from Microsoft press release.  And yet they still trotted out Balmer.  And yes, I know. Well, I guess they have to.  It wasn't Balmer. Actually, Balmer looked good compared to Stephen Sinovsky.

Start time: 2694.52
End time: 2713.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you've watched the video, which I have, Sinovsky was nervous.  They crashed on him, which completely threw him.  He misspoke a couple of times.  Now, I don't know if that's, I don't know Sinovsky.  Maybe he's not good in front of crowds.  I think he's not. But Balmer at least had some presence.  Nothing crashed.

Start time: 2714.27
End time: 2739.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one word for what Balmer has.  You know, at some point in the next month or two, we're going to hear something will leak out.  We'll know what they were trying to preempt.  Or we're going to find out what it is that they were afraid of and why they pushed when this was obviously not ready to go.  But on the plus side, good things have happened for Microsoft.  They have created a buzz about this product.  Absolutely.  And as you mentioned, they got their mojo back on the campus in Redmond.  So these are all good things.

Start time: 2739.96
End time: 2766.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If there is one reason to do it, it's because you want people to write software for it when it launches.  That's the reason why Apple, despite its normal, incredibly secret way of doing business, they announce their OS's way early.  They announced iOS 6 and everything in iOS 6, and they put a beta in developers' hands months in advance before launch every single year.  It's because they want apps to run that thing when it launches to the public.  So if there's any reason to do it, it's that.  There's still that lag.

Start time: 2766.62
End time: 2775.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's still that lag for some reason.  This Retina display, developers have known this was coming.  And there's still a handful of Retina apps, and they're all from Apple.

Start time: 2775.88
End time: 2789.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and with the Surface for Windows RT, I got that right.  It's not like they introduced the specific details or APIs or anything to take advantage of that device.  No, but they got buzz.

Start time: 2789.81
End time: 2791.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's what they want to do.  They want to get developers to say, hmm.  They did.

Start time: 2792.52
End time: 2805.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if I'm a developer and I want to go out there and I want to build Metro apps for this product, I can't do it right now.  And that's a big difference between them and Apple.  If I'm a developer and I'm really stoked about what I just saw in iOS 6, I can that day register for an account, start building my iOS 6 app.

Start time: 2806.60
End time: 2816.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure.  I think you can start writing Metro apps for Windows 8 now.  But what I'm saying is you can't target that hardware.  Well, you don't know what the resolution is.

Start time: 2817.28
End time: 2822.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's no other Windows RT products out there, so I can't target the Surface if I want to build something for that.

Start time: 2823.09
End time: 2826.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you need at least screen resolution.  You need just some basic information.

Start time: 2826.58
End time: 2827.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was kind of a...

Start time: 2829.37
End time: 2863.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think we all are in agreement.  A couple of things.  First of all, every tech pundit wants Microsoft to succeed because it's just much more interesting to cover a market where it's vibrant and there's competitors and there's something interesting.  I think that everybody also is kind of rooting for Microsoft because it's been a kind of dull company for a long time.  I think I'm not alone.  I think a lot of people thought Steve Ballmer was running the company to the ground.  So to see Ballmer come out and introduce something new and exciting and potentially great, we don't know because we can't touch it, is I think basically good.  Yes, absolutely.

Start time: 2864.84
End time: 2867.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2867.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I commend them for their vision and taking a chance.  No question they're taking a huge chance, right?  They have the pockets.

Start time: 2874.50
End time: 2896.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, each.  They have the deep pockets.  I mean, that's why they did Xbox, if I remember correctly.  Because Bill Gates said to his executive team, look, we've got like, you know, almost infinite amount of money.  Let's make a big bet on something like there are very few companies who can throw five billion dollars at a problem.  So let's go make a big bet.  Aller said, OK, video game market.  Let's create a video game console.

Transcript:  And a CES keynote, Ballmer talked about betting the company.  He literally used the word betting the company.  He was talking about Metro.  And I'm not sure they're really betting the company on Metro.  But I think that they're hedging on Metro.  Yeah, they're hedging on Metro.  But he's taking huge bets right now.  And I think he really has to because Microsoft, as he said, it's lost its mojo.  I remember at all things digital, I think it was a year ago.  Eric Schmidt talked about the great PC companies and the great companies.  And let me see if I can get them all right.  He mentioned, of course, Google, Amazon, Apple.  I can't remember what the fourth one was.  Microsoft wasn't one of them.  Yeah, no.  And that is that was actually a fairly accurate portrayal of where they fit in the industry.  And they've got to do something bold.

I do want to talk about Windows Phone 8.  There's some consternation there.  Oh, yeah, that.  What a week for Microsoft and for us.  We've got a great panel.  Father Robert Ballester, Future Hope is right, of This Week in Enterprise Tech, which debuts  July 20.  July 20 or so.  Yeah.  A couple of three weeks.  Yeah.  Can't wait.  What's your first show on?

End time: 3038.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First show is all about deployment of wireless, the proper deployment of wireless, so how you  have to actually survey the site that you're going to be deploying your wireless in that  will determine how many APs you need, how they have to be tuned, where channels have  to be allocated.  It's something that a lot of people take for granted when you deploy wireless.  It's a black heart.  Yeah.  It's a black heart.  Yeah.  I'm totally going to watch that show.  Yeah.  There's actually going to be an engineer from Xeris who will be going around with a spectrum  analyzer.  We'll measure everything in the studio and determine exactly where the array should be  put and then tune the radios because sometimes you get better results when you bring down  the power as opposed to most manufacturers which just want to jack everything up.

Start time: 3038.62
End time: 3071.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be a great show because it's going to be very case study focused.  It's going to be how you solve problems.  One of our concerns with an Enterprise show is it would just be about Enterprise technology  and normal users wouldn't want to watch it, but you're going to make this accessible for  everybody and everybody will be learning.  We're all going to learn how to make your Wi-Fi sing.  Absolutely.  I can't wait.  It's going to be fun.  That's later this month or next month I should say on the Twitch network.

But when we come later in the show, I'd like to know why would kids be safer on Facebook  than not?  Because right now, technically, if you're under 13, you're not allowed to be on there.  And Facebook, I'll show an infographic to the Facebook released on what happens when  you complain about a post on Facebook.  Crazy, crazy.  But first, let's talk about stamps dot com.  Now, this is crazy like a fox.  If you don't want to go to the post office and wait in line to buy stamps, if you don't  want to go to the post office for any package over the 13 ounces, if you want to save money  and get your mailing done, if you want to bring the post office to you, then you want  stamps dot com.  It is such a great service.  I hope you've tried it by now, but if not, I've got a special offer for you.  Stamps dot com.

Transcript:  That Retina and the camera.  All right, we got to talk about Windows Phone.  And then I want to talk about the Retina.  Because I am in love with my new laptop.  And everybody's bashing it.  Oh, you bought the new one.  I did.  I'm a sucker.  I bought it before I heard all the things like it's not repairable.  But you know what?  I actually am physically in love with it.  Well, I went to the store.  Whoa.  I'm sorry, Kat.  Kat the knitter from Let's Knit Together just hit her face.  She's embarrassed.  And I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I went to the Apple Store the day after the announcement.  I looked at the Retina display.  And I loved it.  And then I decided to buy a 13-inch MacBook Air.  Because I travel a lot.  And I want something as light as possible.  And last year I carried around 11-inch.  So even the 13-inch is a half a pound heavier than I'm used to.  But it was a four and a half pounds.  And Leo, the extra thousand bucks for the Retina display was a little bit of a dent from my wallet.

Start time: 3817.50
End time: 3872.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I completely understand the price.  I mean, that's crazy.  The company paid for it.  And weight.  Yeah.  Weight is not a problem for me.  And you know, I'm a big MacBook Air fan.  I have my 13-inch Air.  I got a late model Air.  And I love it.  But this is so thin.  And what really happens is you kind of fall into the screen.  And then everything else looks like crap.  So don't ever buy it.  Ever.  Ever, ever until you're ready.  Because once you go Retina, you never go back.  I mean, I'm not kidding.  It's just stunning.  And I had to download all new wallpaper.  Change all my apps.  But boy, I'll tell you why it's different.  You know, you were talking about how the iPhone 4 great Retina display and the iPad Retina display.  But they're smaller.  When you get a Retina display at 15 inches, there's a lot of space.  At 15 inches, there's something that happens.  It really does change things.  And I cannot wait to see 4K TVs for that reason.

Start time: 3872.91
End time: 3884.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm trying to...  The price is a big thing about this.  And I'm trying to find what the original titanium PowerBook they did that.  Yeah, it was more than that.  $2199 is not horrible.  But I don't remember what that price was.  And by the way, $2199, you get 8 gigs of RAM, which is more than that.

Start time: 3886.50
End time: 3902.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't need 16 gigs of RAM.  And you get a 256-gig hard drive.  And people say, oh, how do you live with 256 gigs?  How many gigs did the original titanium have?  Come on.  I remember when...  Well, I'm an old-timer.  You have to add AppleCare, though.  I bought AppleCare because I can't fix anything.  Come on, Leo.

Transcript:  I remember when Toshiba laptops were $8,000.  And those were $1980-something dollars.  So we've just come...  You know, there's a new economy.  We're just more accustomed to more affordable computers.  And by most standards, even the MacBook Air is expensive.  But people are willing to pay for Apple products.  And at least some people are willing to pay that extra $1,000 for that very cool display.  I agree with you.  It looked great.  One of the reasons I didn't buy it, because I knew once I owned it, I would never return it.  I'd have to hold on to it forever.  And I'm just not ready to treat myself quite that well.  But again, the extra pound and a half over the air, for me, makes a difference.  Because I go to trade shows, and I carry this thing on my back sometimes for eight hours in a day.  Well, also no Ethernet port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a lot of businesses don't have Wi-Fi, right?  Right.  But the Thunderbolt adapter actually doesn't let you do some of the diagnostics that you would use with a standard Ethernet adapter.  It's not the same.  So you lose a little bit of the traffic if you're trying to tap the traffic on a network.  You can always go buy a regular 15-inch?

Start time: 3991.78
End time: 4023.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I didn't mind it, because I have the adapter on my air, and I rarely pull it out.  So that's exactly why I wasn't worried about it.  Optical drive, I've gone, that's dead.  Yeah, I haven't used that in a long time.  I had the 13-inch with 256-gig hard drive.  I still have 100 gigs free. It was fine.  I wasn't worried about that.  The real question in my mind, and this is one I don't want to hear the answer to,  what PC makers are going to make Retina, let's not use the word Retina,  super high-res, quad-res displays, right?  Isn't Samsung going to make a 9 or a 10 that's...  Sooner or later, yeah.  Sooner or later, and it'll be cheaper?

Start time: 4025.53
End time: 4045.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe.  Depends.  They could actually just build a much cheaper PC and then put a really nice high-res display in it.  That may not be what you want. This is quad-core.  Yeah, the thing with this laptop is Apple went, they totally blew it out, right?  They went, balsed the wall on it, and they just made the best possible laptop they could.  And yeah, it's going to be really expensive.

Start time: 4045.58

End time: 4057.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm seeing in the chat room like $2,500, $2,600. That sounds about right.  And that was for...  Just for inflation, it might be like $2,700, $2,800, $2,900.  That was a G4 at 400 megahertz. If you wanted 500 megahertz, $3,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a few inhibiting factors on the PC side because...  Windows isn't going to handle it well, right?  Well, no. Windows can actually handle very high resolution.  Can it do high DPI?  It can do very high DPI, but if you look at most systems today, they have either HDMI or DVI, or even dual DVI.  They do not handle anything higher than about 1900 by 1200 very well.  So if you start outputting much larger than that, you need to move everyone over to DisplayPort or Thunderbolt,  which you don't really have that much of on the PC side yet.

Start time: 4097.66
End time: 4111.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also some advantage Apple has because it controls the ecosystem a little bit better.  So Apple, for instance, the operating system is immediately high DPI.  The browser is. They upgraded most of their apps.  And I would say there's more unity in the app marketplace.

Start time: 4112.73
End time: 4124.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a huge competitive advantage, but it's going to be a long rollout for them.  Despite how quickly they may or may not be able to actually produce the panels on this.  And I think the panel production is why the wait is five weeks now.

Start time: 4129.00
End time: 4171.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not only that, but I think they're just ramping this up. It's a brand new technology.  Nobody else is doing it. They haven't hit scale for it yet.  But there are other technical issues they need to overcome as well.  I actually did a piece on gadget calculating what I expected.  Retina resolutions would be for basically the entire line of MacBook Pros, Airs, IMAX, the Thunderbolt display.  And even if you just pixel doubled the Thunderbolt display and the 27 inch IMAQ,  you're talking about more physical bits that need to cross over the wire than Thunderbolt can actually support.  So just to do a Retina version of the 27 inch Thunderbolt display, you basically have to have Thunderbolt 2.0.

Start time: 4175.66
End time: 4180.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm screwed because I was waiting for a 27 inch Retina. I guess that's not going to happen.

Start time: 4180.60
End time: 4193.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if you break it down, so it's like 5,000 pixels by 3,000 pixels, and then 24 bits, 60 Hz, it's way more than Thunderbolt can handle.  Unfortunately.

End time: 4217.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not the legacy, not the MacBook Pros.  Oh, they have hard drives?  They still have hard drives, yeah.  But it looks like we're going that way.  We really need a lot of capacity. Definitely going that way.  In five years, maybe a little, give or take, we'll all be on SSDs, thankfully.  Enterprise?

Start time: 4219.10
End time: 4242.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enterprise could go SSD. Pretty much the only ones who are really holding out for rotating media are those who are doing any sort of extensive video editing.  That's the only application that requires a ton of space actually on the system.  And what you're seeing from those products is they're either going a hybrid route or they're going with dual drives.  You've got your SSD partition and then you've got your rotating partition.

Start time: 4242.76
End time: 4253.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like that. I don't like the hybrids. They seem like their performance isn't great, but I love having a boot drive.  I love having a boot drive that's a small SSD drive and then a massive spinning drive.  That's a good compromise.

Start time: 4253.58
End time: 4286.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing with increasing storage though on SSD versus hard drives is it's actually a lot easier to double the storage on SSDs.  We know how physically to shrink dies and make memory smaller.  You actually have to come up with new scientific techniques to make hard drives double in space every couple of years.  Every time they come out with a new hack on the old medium, Seagate and IBM and these other guys come up with these crazy new ways to fit more bits on these spinning platters, that does not go on forever.  So you can actually just kind of keep reducing the memory size and doubling the capacity.

I keep my kind of deep data on the hard drive, my working data and my software on the SSD.  And I just ordered a terabyte, a Western Digital terabyte USB 3.0 drive for my MacBook Air.  It's going to be one of these ones. It's small, powered by the USB port.  I'm looking forward to that's coming tomorrow. Actually, it's an Eval unit that I'm testing,  but I have a feeling I'm going to probably wind up buying it.

Transcript:  I bought a USB 3.0 USB stick and Crucial makes a GT, which is the higher speed SSD.  And it's, it's fat. It's not, they say 220 megabytes. It's about a megabytes.  It's about 120 megabytes a second, but that's still four or five times faster than anything out there.  But then I tested the hard drive in the retina and it blew me away  because it's on the SATA, I guess a six gigabit SATA six.

Start time: 4358.68
End time: 4366.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's that in a controller.  Unbelievable.  When you have like a really good controller on an SSD, that actually unlocks a lot more speed than you get on just the memory itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Question for you, Ryan, though.  We've been seeing performance drop offs as more and more drives have to move to MLC SSDs.  That's the cheaper form of flash.  Yeah, there's two kinds of MLC.  But you've got a density problem dealing with SLC.  So when are we going to start seeing reasonably priced SLCs in the 500 gigabyte range?

Start time: 4388.56
End time: 4421.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I can't really speak to the kind of component level aspect of this as much in terms of like long term pricing.  But I did just read something that said, you know, basically all of the SSD memory on the market has plummeted in price over the last 12 to 18 months.  It's like half what it used to be. And it's going to just keep going.  We've seen that in the prices of SSDs.  Yeah, and then, you know, because of the floods in Thailand last year and all the production problems on hard drives, it's just it's a lot more clear now than it was even a year or two ago that this move is happening, you know, and it's just speeding up.

Start time: 4421.94
End time: 4439.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could buy a 500 gigabyte MLC SSD right now for 340 bucks, I think.  I won't say who the vendor is because I don't want to give them a plug.  But when I saw that, that sort of blew me away.  I mean, I remember.  How big?  500 gigs.  For $340?  There's nothing wrong with MLC.

Start time: 4440.50
End time: 4447.50

It'll be a few more years, I think, before the majority of products don't have it.  But we will all look back on our spinning hard drives and our computers and say, ha, ha, ha.  The same way we look back on massive room size, five megabyte hard drives.  We're going to say the same thing about spinning platters.  It just doesn't make any sense.

Alan Malvatano, who's my own personal SSD guru, he writes for PCPer.com and has a really good chart of what controllers and what's the state of the art in SSD says that they're using in the retina.  They're using the Samsung 830 controller, which I guess SSD drive.  Is that a San Force controller, a San Force chipset on that, Alan?  And it is.  It's a six gigabit SATA 6, which is pretty amazing speed.  I don't have the benchmark in front of me.  It's on the retina.  But boy, I was blown away.

Yeah, they're super good at it.  Yeah.  Okay, let's do phones.  We'll do phones in a bit because there's two things to talk about.  Of course, Windows Phone 8, not a lot to say about it, but we'll talk about it.  I think the biggest upset for a lot of people is that none of the Windows Phone 7s on the market today will get Windows Phone 8.  They'll get 7.8.  And the surprise was it's the Windows NT kernel on a phone.  And what does that mean?  We'll talk with our panel about that.  Also coming up, a big shock.  I believe it's true, but I wonder what Ryan's heard with the new iPhone connector.  Oh, boy.  Bad news in my opinion.  We'll find out.  But first, a word from FreshBooks.com, the easy online invoicing app.  I found FreshBooks, actually Amber MacArthur told me about it when I was one day back in 2004 complaining about invoicing.  See, I was working in Canada at the time and I had to do my own invoices and I had to do them in Canadian dollars as well as American dollars.  And come the end of the month, it was just a nightmare.  It was like having to do taxes every month.  I just hated it.  She said, oh, no, you got to try FreshBooks.  And I did.  And I fell in love.  Since then, three and a half million other people have started using FreshBooks to do their online invoicing.  It saves you time, gets you paid.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I say three and a half million?  Four and a half million.  The number's going up.  Gets you paid faster because clients can view the invoice online and pay you right on the spot with a credit card.  And believe me, my experience was clients want to pay you.  It's just as much of a pain in the butt to go through their accounts as it is for you to do the invoices.  So make it easy for them.  Do you bill for hours?  Very cool.  They've got an iPhone app that will let you take hours.  Also a web app.  And the hours go instantly.  The time sheets go instantly into the invoices.  You can also run all sorts of great reports.  If you're talking about taxes, your accountant will love you at tax time.  It's all already done.  Automated late payment reminders.  And yeah, they'll even print, stamp, and mail invoices for those old fashioned clients who like paper invoices.  You got to try it.  Here's the deal.  Go to freshbooks.com and you can try it free for 30 days and you get everything.  Unlimited clients, unlimited staff, all the features.  No limits for 30 days.  Freshbooks.com.  I think at some point they say, where did you hear about?  Just say Twitter.  That's all.  Just do me a favor.  Join the four and a half million.  That number just went up.  It was three and a half million.  Four and a half million people who have been using FreshBooks to do their invoices.  You'll see why it changed my life.  Let it change yours too.  Freshbooks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think?  I think they're working on some really, really interesting stuff with it.  I don't think there's anything that's going to kind of blow the doors off, but some really,  really great incremental improvements.  One of the things that I thought was actually really interesting and not one of the more  lauded announcements was they already have an answer to Apple's passbook.  Passbook?  I think that's what it's called, passbook.  You mean the wallet, the built-in wallet.  Yeah, it's basically a wallet, but to call it a wallet is maybe kind of reductive because  it also includes train tickets and deals and you can scan the pay stuff and coupons and  all that stuff.

Transcript:  So they're going to have that in Windows Phone 8.  Yep.  No, actually they're going to release that beforehand.  They have a couple of apps I think they're going to ship earlier than Windows Phone 8.

Start time: 4811.54
End time: 4836.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't think that they're going to release that beforehand because from how they described  it, it requires a secure SIM to work.  That's how their security model on that works, which I think is kind of not a very smart  way to go about that, but I think that they're doing that so they can actually offload some  carrier control on it.  But yeah, either way, it's still I think kind of an interesting play for them.  Their big thing though was the new user interface for the home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually we put the Lumia 900 on our must have list, which is kind of like our  top three recommended products of every kind of product.  And we debated for weeks about the Lumia and we actually gave it the number three spot  and it was actually big to do.  Microsoft made a real big deal about that.  And then we find out about the fact that Windows Phone 8 is not going to be compatible with  any of the current models.  We took it off.  We took it off our list.  We no longer recommend that you buy the Lumia.  Really?  Yeah.  We didn't reduce its score, but we actually, and that was also right around the same time  that the new Samsung came out.  So we promoted the Samsung and we took the Lumia 900 off.

Transcript:  So with the unified kernel, you're getting closer to the promise of write once, compile  many times.  Right.  So technically as long as you've got all the settings right for display size, you should  be able to cross compile across for Windows 8 Metro on the desktop, for the Windows Phone,  for the Xbox, and for the tablets.  Oh, even the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  I don't know about that.  And they actually, that's not entirely, I mean maybe that's what they're working towards,  but that's not where they're at with this shared port.  No, absolutely not there yet.  Because they definitely did talk about, okay we made it so much easier for developers to  port to Windows Phone or to port to Metro from Windows Phone because of this new shared  core kernel architecture.  But it's not there right now.  It's definitely not at the point where you just tick the boxes that you want to build  for.

Start time: 4968.52
End time: 4985.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  The real question I wonder from a consumer standpoint is how important is it that they're  going to be putting the Metro interface on everything they do?  Is that really going to become something that consumers are going to look for and expect  and feel good about having a relatively common user interface among all their Microsoft devices?

You're saying we believe so much in this very, you know, it's interesting because it's so  opposite Apple with the skeuomorphic stitching and leather applications.  There's not a rounded corner in the bunch.  There's not a shadow.  It's a box.  And it's going to be everywhere.  And I think that this is Microsoft saying the problem is that these things are really  about style and they're about fads and they're about fashion.  This isn't functionality we're talking about.  It's fashion.

Start time: 5019.52
End time: 5034.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And do we care?  Do we really care?  I mean, is it that important that our phone and our tablet and our laptop all have the  same Metro interface?  I, for one, can live with slightly different interfaces with different types of devices.  And, but for some reason, Microsoft seems to think it's a really big deal.

Start time: 5035.54

End time: 5078.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's for developers.  That's for developers.  It's that one click, that checkbox across the board.  Well, and Microsoft needs that because they need apps on the Windows phone and they need,  and more importantly on Windows RT, they really need apps.  They've got, they, but what it also means, I mean, but is Metro enough for business?  I mean, isn't it, isn't a Metro, Metro app means that it doesn't use the desktop or it  can use the desktop?  No, it doesn't use the desktop.  It doesn't use the desktop.  So it's just slighties.  I have to think that in three years, that interface is going to look as old as an Edsel.

Transcript:  I didn't even do it.  I forgot.  That's an interesting part of this S3 announcement that was US only.  The S3 is one of like a handful of phones that have, and the NFC is in the battery,  which is smart because Samsung is now saying you can't buy a third party battery.  You got to buy a Samsung.  Well, smart for them.  Yeah, smart for them.  Not for us.  Not for me.  I always buy a third party battery.  And for a very high price, I think it's five bucks per sticker.  It's 15 bucks for a pack of, three bucks a sticker, 15 bucks for a pack of five.  You can buy these very interesting, and they have circuitry on the back, little stickers,  and you put them on things.  So you put it on your dashboard in your car and you tap it, the phone goes bloop and it  turns on Bluetooth.  Or you could do a Foursquare check in.  Or there's a variety of things you can do with the software.  You have to be running the Samsung tech tile software.  And I get this.  I don't know if it's proprietary or if this is like, this is going to be generic NFC and  you could use it with a Windows phone.

Start time: 5208.00
End time: 5214.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so on Windows Phone 8, NFC is kind of built into the core OS.  So it's a little bit different, I think, from what you're seeing on the Samsung.

Transcript:  This is a bag hung off the side.  Right, exactly.

Start time: 5217.56
End time: 5224.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 5224.50
End time: 5227.17

Start time: 5227.89
End time: 5239.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to say.  I mean, not with Windows Phone 8 right now, right?  I mean, we know what their market share is.  Despite it being a pretty interesting product, it's not enough to drive NFC as a successful  technology in America.

Start time: 5239.50
End time: 5241.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's only a couple of phones that support it on Android.

Start time: 5241.72
End time: 5259.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, if Apple does it and it's not any kind of open standard, we don't have  any kind of cross-platform NFC standardization in terms of getting my iPhone to communicate  with your Windows Phone 8 phone.  Then I think there's a huge missed opportunity there.

Start time: 5259.88
End time: 5277.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you, if there were a NFC standard just for Foursquare, that every place you go have  a little thing that you tap it and it checks into Foursquare, that's good for Foursquare.  It would be very interesting.  It would promote NFC.  It needs to be cross-platform.  I presume that there's a standard.

Start time: 5278.72
End time: 5281.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, NFC is itself a standard.

Start time: 5281.50
End time: 5283.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that tech tile should work on anything that's an NFC.

Start time: 5284.52
End time: 5296.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Theoretically.  But if I want to do something like if I want to use my iPhone to connect to your Windows  Phone 8 phone and NFC is just the mechanism that syncs that up, that is not necessarily  standard.

Start time: 5297.60
End time: 5319.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see, now somebody in the chat room pointed out that Apple apparently does have a patent  for NFC for the iPhone.  That doesn't matter though.  I mean, they have a million patents.  They do that.  Yeah, you patent everything.  I could see Microsoft, I mean Apple, being petulant and saying, oh, that's fine.  Go ahead, have fun with your NFC kids.  We'll use something else.  I totally could see them do that.

Start time: 5321.06
End time: 5345.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, NFC will become popular when all the major financial institutions get behind it.  Because across the world, that has been the only real successful use case for NFC.  That's why Nokia built NFC into their phones way, way back.  Right.  Oh, really?  It's been there.  They've had it for, I mean, NFC is just a communication standard.  It's a way to get identifying information from a relatively inexpensive sensor.  It stands for Near Field Communication.

Start time: 5345.56

Start time: 5346.52
End time: 5374.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the problem is, I mean, we actually, a lot of US financial institutions have adopted  NFC in some form or another.  And you've got Google Wallet with Amex and I think Visa and stuff like that.  And they're all looking at it, but they're all doing it in different ways.  And MasterCard has their PayPass or whatever they call it.  And none of it's compatible with each other.  Everybody wants to kind of do it their own way.  And that's why it takes like an Apple to come in and be like, no, look, everybody's going  to do it this way.  And you may not like it, but at least we're going to be in one platform.

Start time: 5375.32
End time: 5393.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that people haven't really figured out the huge benefit for it yet.  I mean, I don't think it's that compelling a use case.  I mean, there are terminals and various merchants.  I can't remember the big national ones.  McDonald's has a PayPass.  I wonder what percentage of McDonald's customers are actually using it.  I'm sure it's very, very low.  Almost none.

Transcript:  Potentially. But I went to Japan a few years ago and I didn't quite fully understand it  until it's completely ubiquitous.  And once it's completely ubiquitous, once it's everywhere, then it actually becomes  completely essential.  Like you use the same mechanism to get on the train, buy lunch, get back on the train  later in the day from some other kind of train, open your door at home.  It does everything.  And until it does everything, until it's completely ubiquitous and standardized,  it's just ghettoized.

Start time: 5442.70

Start time: 5447.66
End time: 5482.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one of the considerations is you have to build the hooks for NFC into the OS.  In other words, it's not going to work if you have to start up your financial app in order to pay for something.  Absolutely.  And start up your ID app in order to open a door.  So all of that functionality has to be built into the OS where it's always running in the background.  Now, you could do that in Android by hacking it.  I mean, that's how I have it on my Galaxy S2. It's actually a hack.  Whether or not Apple wants to build it into iOS, I mean, they're not known for wanting to include a lot of overhead.  I don't think it's that big of a deal.

Start time: 5482.50

Start time: 5487.52
End time: 5497.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it uses almost no power.  But the reason we're talking about this is because, to your point about building it into the stack, that's what Microsoft did.  They built NFC into the stack. That's a key component of Windows Phone Aid for them.

Start time: 5498.92
End time: 5533.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's in the background. It's running all the time.  I think this is a really compelling technology.  And it's clear there's money to be made.  But I think that you kind of have to get Apple because Apple is such a big part of the universe that merchants and credit cards...  You know, everywhere but the US, smart cards are everywhere.  A chip in the card, right?  I mean, this is not a new idea.  This never penetrated in the US. I'm not sure why.  We didn't want it or something. I think people were probably nervous about the whole thing.

But they've already released a couple of the apps. There's going to be the new Nokia maps, not Bing maps, right?  So that's interesting.  It's like, I guess Microsoft says Nokia maps are better than our own product.  Makes you wonder. Do you think Microsoft will buy Nokia?

You don't need manufacturing capability because everybody makes this. It's all made in China anyway.  You need design. You need engineering.

The TellMe acquisition is now... I mean, the funny thing about that was they showed, they demoed a Siri-like system.  And I was like, okay, this is going to be interesting. I'm glad somebody else is kind of really getting into this.  And then when the voice came on, it sounded so much like Siri that I thought that they were just punking everybody.

So one of the things that frustrates me with my iPhone is that, for example, on the map side, Siri is linked to Google Maps,  which is their current mapping program. Obviously, it'll go to the Apple Maps.  But I happen to use Telenev Maps, which is really, in my opinion, a better mapping program.  Why can't Siri take me to that app? Why does it have to just work for Apple Apps?

Start time: 5726.18
End time: 5733.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the Telenev app doesn't respond to Siri.  Well, I think a lot of people are expecting that.  The Telenev app does have voice recognition, but Siri can't talk to it.

Transcript:  I think a lot of people are expecting that Siri will eventually start to be able to talk to other things.  And the Siri functionality in iOS 6 has been expanding in the new version, but it's not there yet.  I think that's what Microsoft thought that they could kind of put a stake in the ground on,  is having their voice application be able to talk to more stuff.

Transcript:  Is the Siri voice from Nuance or AT&T? They're saying in the chat room it's a Nuance voice,  and that, in fact, TellMe had it before Siri. So really, Apple stole it from TellMe.  Nice.  Hey, it's a nice voice.

Transcript:  No, they do this all the time. I think the thing that's different about Windows Phone 8 not being compatible  with basically any phones on the market right now is they said that.  They said straight out, it's not like you buy the latest, greatest, highest end phone right now.  We will guarantee you know, these one or two models will be upgradable.  Right.  There's zero upgrade path.  Right.  So that basically means like if you're following Windows Phone at all,  you're not going to want to buy anything Windows Phone related until the end of the year.  It kills the market from now.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good point. They Osborneed it.  It Osborneed it.

From the farthest away was Australia.  I think we had a little competition. I'm not giving you the Jane hat, though.  And the closest was well, it's either between Chad, me or Jam or B. We're not sure.  The people who work here don't have long to go.  OK, OK, you wanted to talk about 13 year olds on Facebook is Facebook actually they can't change that policy because isn't that the Child Online Protection Act?

Start time: 6398.50
End time: 6450.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, the COPPA law would have to be obeyed.  They would have to get verifiable parental consent. And that's absolutely what they're talking about.  It turns out that there are millions of kids already on Facebook.  And a study found that 68 percent of them had their parents helping them.  So if Facebook were to officially invite kids under 13, parents would have to be involved.  And how it would look, we don't know. They haven't made any announcements.  But I would envision that there would be parental controls.  It'd be some kind of parental dashboard. The parents would have access to what the kids are doing.  And they would they would actually cater to these children as opposed to the fact that now they're in there.  They're lying about their age. They may say they're 13. They may say they're 30.  But whatever they're doing, they're not getting any protections whatsoever.  So I think that kind of a sandbox version of Facebook would be a good thing for kids under under 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Larry has been very involved with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  He does the Safe Kids site, SafeKids.com.  So you're more than aware, more than usual aware of the dangers online for kids.  I think they're somewhat overblown. But of course, you're in public, basically.  And I think sometimes parents and kids think, well, he's in his bedroom.  How much trouble could he get into? And that's and that's the point is it is kind of public.  You're in as much risk, I guess, as you'd be at the mall.

Start time: 6476.50
End time: 6531.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, well, actually, you're in less risk.  You're not physically there.  It is overblown. The predator issue is way overblown.  But there are issues of reputation management, bullying kids who are just saying things that they shouldn't be saying.  That's a bigger issue, isn't it?  Yeah, much, much bigger issue.  And I think that Facebook needs to have tools to to help parents prevent those kinds of problems.  I'm not as worried about predators as I am about about kids just doing dumb things that they get them into some kind of trouble.  And let's face it, when you're talking about a 10 year old or a nine year old, there's performance anxiety.  They're there. How they behave on Facebook.  Lots of issues. So if they're going to be there and they're there anyway, I say be there with some kind of parental controls.  And I'm hoping Facebook does something.  And a lot of Internet safety advocates have been pushing them for a long time.  There's this myth that they're doing it just to make more money.  That may or may not be true.  But they've also been pressured to do it from some of us in the Internet safety community.

Start time: 6531.82
End time: 6544.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually don't think it should be limited just to kids under 13.  I mean, I can't imagine letting a 14 or 15 or even a 16 year old just go wild on Facebook with zero supervision.  Yeah, I think having those tools would be amazing.

Start time: 6545.56
End time: 6567.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the reason parents, and I'll speak as a parent, the reason parents let their kids use Facebook at a younger age, I did not.  But the reason some parents do, and I know I think I have family that did, is because this is nowadays how kids socialize.  It's how they interact.  You cut that off, you're cutting off a vital lifeline.  It's like telling a teenager from our generation, Larry, not to use the phone.

Start time: 6568.18
End time: 6602.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. And by the way, I am on a Facebook safety advisory board.  Oh good.  They will get advice.  And we have a booklet called Facebook for Parents or Parents Guide to Facebook, which is at FBparents.org.  That's FB as in Facebook, parents.org.  And that's the online free version of a 40 page booklet that explains to parents how they can parent in the 21st century.  So I urge people to take a look.  And I agree with you, whether your kids are four or 14 or for that matter, 40, there should be some kind of controls.  I'm not sure about 40, but maybe not parental control, self control.  I need some controls, trust me.

Start time: 6603.82

Transcript:  If you saw the blather I post on Facebook.  I see a couple of issues here though.

Start time: 6608.72
End time: 6634.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first issue is maturity of the child or maturity of the young adult.  And you made a very good point, which is there are some very mature 10 year olds and there are some very immature 30 year olds.  But I don't see that as big of a problem as the implementation, which is when you've got a 10 year old who is most likely more tech savvy than his parents,  how do you make sure that he uses this?  I mean, if he knows that his Facebook activity is going to be monitored, isn't he just going to make another account?

Start time: 6634.54
End time: 6644.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where the anxiety comes from from parents is that we don't feel like we under, I do, but I always knew more than my kids did.  But most parents go, oh, they run rings around me.  Right.

Start time: 6644.60
End time: 6668.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We hear that all the time.  And parents need to be parents.  Look, I supervise my kids in their soccer games and I know nothing about soccer, but I know something about sportsmanship and teamwork and just being there for my kids.  And I think the same thing is true for the online world.  You don't have to be a tech genius to be a good parent, even though you need to be aware of the technology, just like I'm kind of aware of soccer.  Yeah, I think Larry nailed it.

If you ever wondered what happens when you report something on Facebook, Facebook released an infographic that is hysterical.  This is this is the decision tree.  This is not made up.  This is from Facebook.  They have committees and teams and well, you can imagine there's a safety team.  There's a hate and harassment team.  There's an abusive content team.

I mean, think about the difficulty, the challenge of Facebook faces every single day.  There was a really interesting post on.  What is that? Is that it?  It's the same thing.  Yeah.

This is a legal settlement.  I think it happened in the UK, but I'm sure Facebook will have to do this globally.  You know how sometimes they use your name and sponsored stories, whether you would, you know, you don't get any money for it.  It's like an ad with your name.  Ryan Block loves depends.  And then and that's true.  I'm sorry. That was my that was my profile.  And then well, now you can opt out.

They tweeted using a Nike website and a Nike hashtag.  And they're really tough in Great Britain on this kind of stuff.  And the Advertising Standards Authority says no.

Transcript:  Finally, I've got to it.  The new iPhone, according to a lot of people, including TechCrunch, and we saw the mobile fund video, will no longer have a 30-pin port.  Ryan, tell me it ain't so.  A 19-pin port that will make every cable, every dock, even that $200 radio I bought incompatible.

Start time: 7030.86
End time: 7053.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, I'm sorry, but I'm going to come to the record.  I've been saying for years that they need to phase out that old-school iPod.  I guess it is old school.  I mean, it's old.  It's huge.  It was built in another era for another kind of product.  It's not meant for what it is.  It's like the biggest single thing about the iPhone besides the screen.  They have to build the whole phone around that port right now.

Start time: 7053.64
End time: 7054.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've thousands of dollars invested.

Start time: 7056.73
End time: 7060.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm sure they'll figure out an adapter solution.  Everything's got a little wire hanging off.

Start time: 7061.74
End time: 7071.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which would be fine for wires, but how about docks?  I have a Sonos dock.  I have that Renew Radio.  They all have 30-pin connectors.  What am I going to do?  It's going to be ugly for a couple of years.

Start time: 7071.54

Transcript:  Don't you love that every Android device uses this little guy?  I mean, they're all the same.  Yes, USB, baby.

Start time: 7076.52
End time: 7078.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that USB port doesn't do everything.

Start time: 7079.02
End time: 7084.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, presumably, a 19-pin port will do more than the micro USB port on every other phone.

Start time: 7084.50
End time: 7085.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's no standardization around that USB port.

Start time: 7087.06
End time: 7091.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it would if they had adopted MHL.  They could do all the docking.  MHL is newer, right?

Start time: 7092.47
End time: 7109.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been using micro USB in phones, and it was ratified.  Micro USB specifically was ratified as a standard in EU for all phone ports.  And it doesn't support data.  Or I'm sorry, it doesn't support audio, analog audio.  It only supports the raw data and charging.  So it's not as equipped as what we think of as being a proper docking.

Start time: 7109.50
End time: 7111.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying it could if it were an MHL?

Start time: 7111.60
End time: 7119.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could, but he's right.  It doesn't transport analog audio.  So you would need some sort of digital to analog audio within the device.  That's fine.

Start time: 7120.27
End time: 7122.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what the earphone port is for.

Start time: 7123.20
End time: 7126.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you care because that would make your dock not work.  Oh.  Yeah.

Start time: 7127.66
End time: 7129.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is already going to make the dock not work.

Start time: 7129.58
End time: 7134.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm screwed no matter what.  Well, it's going to happen sooner or later.  So would you rather it happen sooner or later?

Start time: 7135.72
End time: 7145.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but you know, I have to say it's risky because I may not buy a new iPhone  because I want to keep my old iPhone and keep all that compatibility, right?  Yeah.  Won't people stick with the 4S?

Start time: 7147.72
End time: 7156.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have this really expensive audio system that connects to an iPhone.  Maybe they'll make an adapter.  I don't know.  Do I throw it away?

Start time: 7157.49
End time: 7167.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'd really like to see as a like a trade-in program.  You know, bring in one cable, get another one back.  Bring in one dock.  I don't think they can do that for the docks, but you know, maybe.  You know, they did.

Start time: 7167.68
End time: 7181.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I can do another show and tell here.  They did for the new MacBook Air, the new Retina.  This is the ridiculousest thing ever invented.  Right.  But that's cool for $10 if you get to use your old MagSafe device.

Start time: 7181.54
End time: 7190.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, my favorite thing about that, Larry, is they didn't need to make the MagSafe too.  It fits on an Air.  What's the problem?

Start time: 7190.50
End time: 7202.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea why they did that.  It's not better. It's not more pins.  It's not different. It's just physically different.  And now they get 10 bucks out of me and none of these work.  That is the single reason not to buy a Retina.

Start time: 7202.50
End time: 7203.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty irritating.  Really.

Start time: 7204.64
End time: 7223.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I saw the story, I thought of this.  There was a Mini Cooper at USB.  It was a special edition, very well decked out.  And it had a perfectly formed dock for an iPhone 4S.  And so now you can't upgrade your car in order to make it work with a new phone.  That's fantastic.
