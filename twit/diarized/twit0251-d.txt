Always glad to have Mark on the show.  And you're in town today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice.  It's great to be here, especially in studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked if you were here for WWDC, but you haven't decided whether to go or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I ran into Gabe from Tech Meme and Alexia from SF Weekly earlier.  And our plan is to just sneak in.  Because I didn't plan in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Apple has so little security, shouldn't be any trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we'll do Mission Impossible style from the rafters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to have rubber masks?  Maybe.  I love that.  I love that when they peel off the masks.  And look, it's not.  It's Martin Landau.  We thought it was Mark Millian, but it's Martin Landau.  Also here with us, glad to have you back.  In fact the last time I saw you, Julio Ojeda Zapata, was in January at the iPad announcement.  You came back out to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the first time you and I shook hands.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very nice to meet you.  In real life, as they say.  First time on the show in real life, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm the other fart on the show.  So you don't have to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  You got a little gray hair there.  From the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the web blog, yourtechweblog.com.  Good to have you, Julio.  You are out here for WWDC.  You would admit that.  All right.  Good to know.  Also with us for the first time, very glad to get him on.  I've been dying to get him on for a long time from Engadget.  He's the editor-in-chief.  He's also the host of Engadget's great gadget podcast, Joshua Tobolski.  It's good to have you, Joshua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.  Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You like Josh or Joshua?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, whatever you prefer is fine with me.  They both work.  I respond to both.  Good to have you.  Ladies' choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're in a hotel.  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am in San Francisco.  I'm a few blocks from Moscone.  Do you want my exact location?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, I already have that on Foursquare.  It's okay.  So you're based in New York?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in Brooklyn.  Well, I live in Brooklyn.  I usually work from office at home.  We have AOL's offices in the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have the beautiful offices on the Lincoln Circle.  That's a really nice spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've moved now, though.  They're all downtown.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What about that beautiful building they built there with the thing and the hung and the  ding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they lost it in the divorce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're kidding.  So that's now Time Warner's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they use that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Columbus Circle, not Lincoln's.  Columbus Circle.  It's a beautiful building.  They just built that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I haven't been there since my initial interview about working at Engadget.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Downtown's better anyway.  It's hipper.  It's cooler.  Yeah.  It's much more with it.  So you're in town.  I take it for WWDC as well.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to be covering it live.  Live blogging.  As live as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you won't make the mistake I made, and I've never been invited back.  I just picked up my laptop at the iPad announcement and pointed it at Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard about this.  Yeah, he gave me the stink eye, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could tell he could see me.  He knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He probably has a button, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was surprised that there wasn't an injector seat, actually.  I was surprised I didn't go flying through the ceiling.  But I do notice that I haven't been invited to an Apple event since.  But of course, it's only been a few months.  Yeah.  Time heals all wounds.  There you go.  Oh, shut up.  I was trying to be on the optimistic side.  Are you going tomorrow?  Well, like I said, I haven't actually been invited to any Apple event in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That might not bode well for your...  I don't care.  Send him flowers.  Man.  You didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve and I, we've had this off and on love-hate relationship for many decades.  It's okay.  He knows I love him deeply in spirit.  Do you think, gentlemen, gentlemen of the press,  I've got some theories about what will happen at WWDC, but I'm curious what you think.  I guess we all agree a new iPhone will be announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you say maybe?  Never know.  You don't know, do you?  No, I'd be sarcastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If there's a new iPhone tomorrow, something has gone horribly wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's true that there's such expectation when Steve takes the stage.  If he just says, I'm going to talk about iPhone 4, the SDK, your developers,  let's talk about some of the features, the API,  some of the hooks we're building in for you developers,  and then leaves that he would be eaten alive by the press, right?  They'd be like, what are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do that.  It'd be very odd.  I mean, at this point, I think we expect it.  This is what happens at WWDC.  They're going to talk about a lot of other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the real question.  Julio, do you think that the iPhone will be available tomorrow?  They'll announce it.  Will it be available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I suspect they'll announce it and then release it in a week or two.  A week or two?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joshua, what's the line on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we've heard that sounds, that's very possible.  We've heard June 20th or 27th, some dates around there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have booked, apparently on the 27th, they've booked Moscone again.  Maybe because that's odd.  It might be it's simply that they weren't sure when WWDC would be  and they were covering their bets because they didn't announce WWDC  until kind of late.  Late.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I agree with Julio.  I think that it's going to be not the day of.  I just don't see them doing that.  Why not?  Well, I mean, I think they like to build a little hype.  They want people to wait in line.  And if you do it the day of, people just run into stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they had the hype built for them by tech blogs, by Modo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gee, people just run in the stores and buy it.  How horrible is that?  I mean, golly.  What's better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They run in the stores or they wait and then they have to get in line  and then the news covers these crazy lines for the new act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They better not wait too long because I think there's things like the Sprint Evo  that could very well eat some of their sales if they wait too long, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's already happening, right?  Yeah.  A lot of people are, I mean, I've gotten emails from people saying,  should I get this? I got to get this.  I can't help myself.  So the Evo, I mean.  I love the Evo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am loving it.  Can I tell you about the Evo?  Please, Julio.  Tell me about the Evo.  OK, I brought the Evo on this trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did a couple of wacky things.  I didn't bring a laptop.  I only brought iPads for productivity.  I noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to do the whole, wait a minute.  Now, folks, he's got two.  What's the deal with two iPads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm a deeply paranoid person and I'm taking a leap here.  And it's OK, iPad, I'm trusting you, but I'm bringing two.  I'm only trusting you a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two, just in case you lose one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, this whole 10 to 11 hour battery life.  You're using one for Twitter, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this whole 10 to 11 hour battery life.  I'm not seeing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm running out of juice.  You're not?  Yeah.  So I'm switching between iPads because they keep running out of juice.  I don't know if they're defective or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're running on 3G, that might be killing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that might be it.  And you're multitasking.  Somebody said that's the best way to multitask is by multiple iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what Woz does.  He had two iPhones.  I interviewed him and he said multitasking.  Well, I just have two iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how Steve would like to multitask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just buy more.  But the Evo, I brought the iPad for productivity.  I brought the Evo as my mission critical smartphone.  That might have been a mistake.  And the thing is driving me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why?  What don't you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if it's an Evo problem or an Android problem, but it's just the performance  is really flaky, getting all kinds of error messages.  I haven't had that.  A lot of force quits, a lot of pop ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you've got a problem.  I think you've got a bad one.  That might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's the soft one.  What are you running?  Maybe it's a particular app or collection of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one thing with Android that's really true is that you can hose your Android by  running a third party app that's not very good.  I've been very cautious about what apps I install and uninstall apps frequently just  to make sure that they're not, you know, if I see battery life issues or that kind of  thing.  Are you running just the stock stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just doing the stock stuff and it's driving me nuts.  But you know, the other thing, you know, we're talking Android versus Apple and I just want  to make a point.  I've used a lot of Android phones.  I like Android very much.  I'm a big fan of Android.  But every time I put down an Android phone and pick up an old, for instance, an old iPod  Touch that I have lying around and I start using it, there's a fluidity to the iPhone  OS that I have yet to see on any Android phone app.  There's somebody at Apple that knows something that nobody else knows because the fluidity,  the ease of use of the iPhone OS is amazing.  Every time I put down an Android phone that I've been using for many days, pick up that  iPod Touch, I still see that difference.  That little subtle thing about Apple hardware versus Android is something that Google has  not nailed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear people say that and Andy Anakos says that.  And I abandoned the iPhone in January for the Nexus One and have not looked back.  I have been very happy, especially now with Android 2.2 on this thing.  It's just great.  Joshua, you use a lot of phones.  Do you have an opinion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think some people, I mean, I totally know what Julio is saying.  I mean, I think some people are really sensitive that I am the fit and finish, the, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying I'm insensitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, maybe just to this one thing, I do find every time I get a new phone, the  first thing I do is I take, I get the icon screen up and I start to sort of go back and  forth my finger like this as quickly as possible because I want to see how it's tracking, right?  How it's what the finger tracking is like.  And if you do it, if you compare Android to an iPhone, I know this sounds completely insane,  but you do see there's something in the finger tracking in the smoothness of the experience.  Yeah, that looks fine.  But if I showed you side by side, you'd see how much lag it actually had compared to an iPhone.  The iPhone tracks to a tee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The iPhone is on a processor that's one third as fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't matter.  I know it doesn't matter.  That's it's about.  I mean, it's about the people always said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say people always said that in the early Macintosh days.  And it was true that the mouse in the Macintosh was direct drive.  And on Windows, it felt like it was like a little laggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It felt like it was floating above the actual glass, right?  Whereas Mac, it was in the OS.  That's the way the iPhone feels to me.  And I saw I agree.  But also, I don't know if it's a sense has gotten has made that experience a lot better.  What HTC has done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do like the sense UI.  I think while I missed 2.2, which I think is significantly faster, I do like the stuff that HTC builds in.  What about Moto Blur?  I haven't played with a Moto.  Dere, you don't like that, Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried the back flip.  It's just so superfluous and just totally unnecessary.  And sense, too, I think is an unnecessary layer that's added on top.  I mean, that's a slippery slope where you have sense built on top.  Google wants to roll out an update and you have to wait for HTC to rebuild there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can't get 2.2 on the Evo yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is going to fix that problem.  And unfortunately for HTC with I think because they just got, you know, Matias Duarte from the home.  That's right.  They snagged the guy.  The mastermind of the WebOS experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's a UI guy.  So you're saying he's going to fix the Apple slash Android issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a real possibility that they're looking at Android and they're saying we need to bring this together.  It's very, I mean, it's actually really inconsistent UI experience.  There are things that work one way here and it's worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, really, Android's biggest problem is that there are so many different handsets, different screen resolutions.  And the real bad problem, in my opinion, is and I speak as somebody who talks to real normal consumers,  is that you don't have the sense when you buy an Android phone that you're getting.  You may buy the Evo today as the best Android phone today, but you really have this scary feeling that next month there will be a better one.  And then the month after that, there will be a better one.  And that keeps people out of the market.  And Apple knows this.  They say one year and you know exactly when the new iPhone is coming out.  And you don't have that sense of, oh, God, tomorrow there's going to be a better phone out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure I agree with that.  Like, for instance, the Droid.  I see the Droid popping up in the most surprising places.  A lot of people buy Droid.  All my kids, school teachers who know a lot about technology, they're all packing Droid.  It's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they have to look at the reviews and say, well, wait a minute, the Incredible is better than the Droid.  Oh, wait a minute, the Evo is better than the Incredible.  And I think that in the long run hurts a company.  I don't think it doesn't hurt any one carrier or any one cell phone company.  It hurts Google as the common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a fragmentation problem.  That's definitely true.  But I think too, you know, on the point about the Droid, I think for a long time Verizon was, you know,  it was like a man in the desert who needed water.  There were no good smartphones on Verizon.  Really, your options were like get a Blackberry.  Right.  And the Droid was the first real, it was totally competitive with the iPhone.  Right.  It had apps, had support of a major company behind it, and it was a pretty attractive device.  So I think they've been selling a lot of Droids.  I think the question is, do people know the difference between the Droid and the Droid Incredible and the Droid Eris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For Droid 2, which is going to come out sometime soon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do with these hundreds of commercials Verizon's been pushing.  But the commercials are all the same product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aren't they all about the Droid?  Right.  But now they're saying buy the Droid Incredibles.  Whereas the original Droid is sort of passe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their Droid Incredible commercial is really good.  It emphasizes the speed of performance.  I like the commercial a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the Incredible is a better phone.  It is a better phone.  And I think that if all those teachers who bought the Droid, Droid, the Motorola Droid, are going to say,  oh, wait a minute, the Incredible.  And then you start to get this backlash where people say,  well, I'm not going to buy because a better phone is going to be here any minute now.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm talking a little bit out of my butt here.  But that's all right.  That's what we do on this show.  You're fitting right in there.  A long, long time ago, back in the Mac, two CIA days or whatever, if I recall correctly,  my memory is sometimes a little faulty.  Macintosh refreshes did not occur as frequently as computer refreshes occur now.  I'm speculating here.  But my hunch is this Android juggernaut with all these hands that's coming out all the time is going to put pressure on Apple.  And who knows?  Apple might start releasing phones every six months.  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Apple's, see, first of all, I don't think Apple pays much attention to what the other guys are doing.  I think Apple has this vision.  Jobs has this vision.  And he says, I'm going to do it my way.  Screw the other guys.  That's one.  Two, I think he realizes that putting out too many updates too fast is bad.  In fact, notice Google has already said we're going to back off.  We're not going to put out Android software updates.  We're going to do yearly from now on.  I think it's vice versa, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it's possibly not the frequency.  It's possibly how many improvements they make each cycle.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think that's what you have to think about here.  And what is this phone that we're going to see tomorrow?  Here's what we know about the phone.  We've seen it.  We know what it looks like, presumably.  But we don't actually know anything about it in terms of.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's hold that thought, Joshua.  That's great.  I want to talk about what is Apple going to announce tomorrow?  And in particular, what does iPhone 4 or whatever we call it, what does that look like?  And by the way, the unofficial Apple weblog has just disclaimed that picture saying, nope,  it wasn't real.  It was a phony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely not real.  Definitely not.  So we're going to take a break, come back.  We've got a great cast of characters here.  This is a perfect bunch to talk about these issues.  Lots to talk about this week.  Mark Millian from the Los Angeles Times, Julio Ojeda Zapata from the Pi Press, as they call  it, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, and from Engadget, the editor in chief, Joshua Topolsky.  Boy, you couldn't get a more elite crew in here to talk about phones and more.  Before we go on, though, I do want to tell you about our friends at Citrix.  They do such great stuff.  And of course, their GoToMeeting program builds on that foundation of high quality,  reliable, speedy remote access to give you a way to eliminate face-to-face meetings.  I mean, you've got to have face-to-face meetings in business.  You've got to press the flesh.  But frankly, it's time consuming.  Travel is expensive.  More and more, people are trying to meet via conference call.  And that's just not going to make it because people are spaced out.  They're zoned out.  It's not engaging.  Online meetings, that's the future.  And Citrix has this great GoToMeeting product that's the best in the business.  I have several accounts because, believe it or not, we'll actually have several GoToMeeting's  going on at once.  And if you've got an iPad, the GoToMeeting, the free GoToMeeting client on the iPad is  killer.  It's killer.  Use GoToMeeting for product reviews, for sales presentations, for training sessions,  for collaboration, all from your desk.  Go right now to gotomeeting.com slash twit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Sign up for that 30-day free trial so you can see how this works.  Within a minute, you'll have GoToMeeting installed.  Now the next time you're on a conference call, you say, wait a minute, I want to show you  something.  They say, what?  You say, go to gotomeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  You can email a link, of course, ahead of time too.  They're seeing your computer on their screen.  They're seeing the keynote or the PowerPoint presentation.  They're seeing the spreadsheets, the drawings.  You're working together.  You're collaborating.  You're sharing desktops.  It's powerful.  It's easy.  It's fast.  So if your clients or colleagues don't have to have it installed for them to get to a  meeting, they just go to gotomeeting.com.  You want to try this right now.  Gotomeeting.com slash twit.  30 days free.  I'm telling you, it'll change the way you do business.  Mark Millian, Joshua Topolsky, Julio Ojeda Zapata, we're talking about what is going  to be in the next iPhone.  I'll let you start, Joshua, because I cut you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, so like I was saying before you rudely cut me off.  I really interrupted you for an actual commercial.  Just to talk about a product.  So like I said, we've seen the iPhone, but we don't really know what's in it.  So we know what we've heard, the rumors we've heard.  But first off, it's got a front-facing camera.  OK, let's talk about the front-facing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all know that because of, by the way, Joshua, kudos to you for not giving that clown $5,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, hey, we're not choir boys.  We were very tempted.  I mean, we talked to these guys.  You know, we thought about buying that phone.  We definitely had conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why did you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the time.  Well, they were liars.  They were they were obviously pretty bad liars.  And by the time we got to any point where we were even considering it, it was out of our reach.  It was we didn't know if they were telling the truth about it at all.  I mean, by the time we got to that point where maybe we would buy it, maybe we wouldn't, it was like.  It just seemed like it maybe was a fake.  These guys didn't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you didn't go to the you didn't go to the AOL lawyers and they said, no, no, whatever.  I did. We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a conversation with them in the midst of all this and they said, you'd be crazy to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they say you'd be at risk of criminal prosecution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They I mean, almost verbatim said you would be insane to pay money for that phone.  And and this was after we had already had huge debates because we took a picture of it, though.  We had we had some pictures that we were given and we didn't know if they were real when we posted those pictures.  You didn't take them. They gave you pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, we didn't take them. We never saw it in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We never met these guys in person.  But when when we published this, part of the reason we published them was we said, we don't know what this thing is.  It could be fake. It could be a knockoff. It could be anything.  It didn't seem we were kind of like, you know what?  It's probably a knockoff. And when I woke up the next morning, people were saying, hey, this is a knockoff.  I thought, well, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there pressure? How much pressure is there on you as a gadget blog to publish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you mean to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if there's pictures, even if you think, well, these might be not we don't know what the provenance is of these.  Is there nevertheless pretty strong incentive to publish anyway?  Well, with whatever disclaimers you decide to put on there, if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing about it is credibility.  You can't keep publishing that Photoshop's or fakes and have people come back to you and say, well, I expect it has to be there has to be some shred of possibility.  So that's a very good point.  You know, and we go when we look at those pictures, we have the whole team will go over them with like a fine tooth comb saying, what is going on here?  Is this a Photoshop? Are there any artifacts?  You know, so we really look into we try not to publish garbage.  I mean, the goal is I don't want to waste people's time and get people, you know, thinking and worried and excited about something that's just a fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you want to you want to if it's real, you want to be first.  You want to have it. But you also know this is true because there are blogs and no names.  I'll say no names where a lot of rumors get published.  And after a while, there's rumor fatigue where you start to say, you know, I can't believe anything these guys say.  And because half the time it's not it doesn't happen.  Right. I mean, and that's the danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really don't want to be you also. I mean, for us, the idea is news, right?  We want this news to be useful to people.  So I don't want to become a site where you can't count on news, where you're just getting you're just getting rumors.  And we certainly have published stuff that didn't turn out to be real, you know, but it's always after we don't do it.  If we just get tips from it says, hey, I have some information.  We don't just go straight to publish. We have to follow up on it.  We have a you know, we we have a process for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in fact, the unofficial Apple Web blog may have been bit by this picture because now they you know, they published it at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I actually spoke to them about I mean, we got this.  We've been getting the same picture sent to us all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You all get the same stuff, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's it's fake. You can clear this is trouble with the render.  It looks does not look like what the actual phone looks like.  If you look at the side of it there, the back of it doesn't look right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's the fact that it's the ass.  There's a it's it's not square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually not square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also an incredibly boring advertisement.  It was never used faster.  They can't use colors in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These like loopy things that just Apple would never do that.  That doesn't look like Apple.  It's not the right typeface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to use myriad.  Well, it's it's a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, old or something.  And it just they're not doing it in colors either.  They're not going to do it in colors.  If they were going to do it in colors, we probably would have seen because we've seen white and we've seen black leaks from Vietnam and from China.  So I think if we were going to if they were going to be colors, we would have gotten something by now.  But maybe not.  But I don't think. Yeah, I think it's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so let's so I'm sorry, I got a little bit on the sidetrack because I just wanted to I just wanted to thank you, Joshua, for not falling into that.  I don't want to be like I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we were very tempted.  We were very tempted.  I don't I don't necessarily know if if you know, I think there are things that happened with the phone.  Had we gotten the phone?  I mean, it's possible.  It had the guys said we're down the street.  Come meet us when you say you're saying guy or guys, people who, you know, was it was it more than one guy?  We spoke to I mean, have you been subpoenaed on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you? No, no, it's hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, it's hard to say.  I when we had these conversations, it was it was not clear, to be honest, who had the phone.  That's one of the reasons we decided to not go.  And that's one of the reasons we decided to publish the photos.  Our thought was we don't know what's going on.  We don't know if these guys, you know, this guy or these guys are being straight with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was it was hinky from the start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And then so and we thought the easiest way to deal with this is just, you know, forget just put this picture up.  And if it's real, we'll find out.  And if it's fake, people will say that thing is fake.  And but, yeah, I mean, what I want to say was I think there are things that happen in that in this story that were I can't fault Giz for doing, you know, they went for it.  And if you're going to pay for a scoop, this is huge.  Somebody says I have the new iPhone.  It's a scoop. And it's a huge scoop.  And if you get it and you do a hands on of it, I mean, that's it's crazy.  I'm sure that they didn't think this thing was stolen, which is I think how Apple considers it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Pretty clear after the D conference that Steve feels like it was stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if somebody had said we stole this phone, I don't think Giz would have would have bought it.  Right. You know, but I think there are things that they could have done differently after getting that hands on up that I might have done differently.  But, you know, this scoop and we were very torn.  That's what I'm saying. You know, we were very torn about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I appreciate your candor because you could have said, yeah, we never would have done that.  Those guys. So I appreciate your candor, Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it was just the thing is, it's just when you're presented with something that's so alien, this is a completely alien thing to us.  We don't normally get people coming to us saying, will you pay us for this scoop and this level of scoop, this magnitude?  So we were very torn. And I think that a lot of people would be torn.  Now I have to say policy will not be we're not unclear on it at all.  The policy is we're not even going to think about it.  Nothing is worth it. It is worth the hell that it is.  I'm sure it's going to be Jason Chen is just dying at this point.  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy. It's really pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you haven't been contacted by police about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, they confiscated my computer and no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you missed that one. I got a scoop for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't been contacted yet, but, you know, I mean, you never know.  I mean, we're our name is certainly there. You know, Job said it.  So, yeah, when they when I heard about Jason them right in his house,  these computers are horrible, really scared.  I mean, I thought I thought if they could do this to him, they could do it to me.  You know, I think there's a real issue. I think the way they went about that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, you're all three journalists who are protected by shield laws.  Did it feel to you like maybe the violation of shield laws was going on?  Did you did this strike you as a little bit of a bad precedent that the police  kind of raided this guy's house, took all his computers, ignored shield laws?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not not being a lawyer nor playing one on TV. I'm not really sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It bothered me. I thought, you know, there are exceptions if they if they break the law.  There's exceptions, you know, your journalist just because you're a journalist  isn't protected against prosecution.  But there are reasons for the shield laws.  And I just hate the idea that I mean, look, it's at worst a stolen phone.  They took everything they they took his business cards.  They raided his house. And it seems to me that was that's overreaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark, do you think you also have to be careful to not specifically place the  blame on Apple there because no, we know this is Apple saying going to a task force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't know that. They admit that they call the cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. They called this task force called React.  And they said some of our private corporate property has been stolen.  And this is all the information we have.  We don't know if they said now go kick down some doors and take his business cards  and his iPad. I doubt and I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it does. I feel like people want to paint Apple as somehow masterminding  this raid. But that's not how it works.  I mean, in the real world, Apple doesn't call the police and say, go raid this guy's house.  Of course, they of course, you know, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They report a crime and then they react has to decide what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the question about the shield laws is is is what you know, the thing is  I can't kill somebody and say, well, I was in the middle of investigating a story  and this guy got in my way. So I had to take him out.  But, you know, I'm pretty I'm protected under the shield law. Right.  I mean, you can't commit a crime, of course, and be protected by.  I think the problem here was the way they went about me.  Did they need to break in his door? Could they have come to the door and said,  we need to talk to you about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The shield law is to protect sources.  We don't know whether other sources are on that.  They the point of the shield law is that they have to that this can be the circumscribed  this search to protect other sources.  I'm not saying you're protecting Jason Chen, but you're protecting sources.  And they took everything willy nilly and gave nobody an opportunity to say,  OK, you can take this, but not this.  And so I just it concerned me.  I mean, this is old news. I guess we could drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I when this whole thing was going down, I think every journalist  sort of pause and ask themselves, how would this have played out?  How would you? Our organization.  And I can see I can see the conversations with Tom Flanning, our editor, our attorney.  And I know I'm certain I haven't discussed this with them,  but I'm certain that they would have said, stay the frack away from that thing.  Don't go anywhere near that.  And I think the first place as a result, again, not a lawyer here,  but I think gives modus on really shaky flimsy ground in every in every way conceivable.  So it's problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it is, you know, obviously that's what we were told.  And that's what we were told. And and but.  It's it's it's the question is how far will they go against?  How far will the police go against Gizmodo? I mean, who's the who's the criminal?  If they're being looked at, are they the criminal here?  I mean, is the are the people who sold the phone? I mean, I read some of those documents.  I mean, these guys don't come off looking good.  They're like hiding evidence or destroying evidence. And I think the fear I'm guessing, right?  The idea that they get behind on getting Jason's computers was we're scared he's going to destroy evidence.  Right. And we want to prevent that from happening. Right.  So they didn't take the computers to and I mean, I don't think that he would have done that.  But they didn't take the computers to look at everything on them.  And that's what they're saying. Right. We're not going to look at these.  We just need to make sure at least I would imagine we just need to make sure that still it's still I mean, I agree with Julio.  It's shaky ground because Apple considers this thing stolen.  They reported it stolen. There's trade secrets that have been I mean, the thing was taken apart.  It was broken while it was taken apart.  So I mean, if it's stolen property and there are trade secrets and not just the device itself, but the things inside of it, it's not a good.  I mean, it's bad. It's not a good place to be. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, however, it did give us you.  You do believe that there is the next iPhone, yes. Oh, yeah.  So it gave us a pretty good look at what the next iPhone we know front facing camera.  Do you want a front facing camera? Julio, you said you wouldn't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I don't know if you're going to call with it.  OK, my parents live in rural New Hampshire.  They just got broadband and I'm doing backflips for joy because my ability to communicate with them digitally has been seriously, seriously compromised.  So our family connectivity has just taken a quantum leap and we're doing the whole video chat using Skype like crazy.  No, no, we're using we're using I chat.  And so at this point, you know, I'm I'm really looking forward to handing my son an iPhone and have him chat with grandma.  Yeah. And he's going to be all over that. I'm really excited about this.  I want that front facing camera. I'm going to use it like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, Mark, you agree? I just can't think of a time when I'm out and about and needed on my phone.  I mean, I have it on my computer and I never use it. I only use it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I wonder if you'll be able to use it with anything but I chat.  You know, is it going to be an Apple only experience? What is what is Apple going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like if they don't from the start, they will eventually open up the front facing camera to Skype.  Just like they did the back facing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that they're going to have to at some point let people have access to it.  I don't know. I think the thing about about I you know, doing an I chat with video.  I mean, Mark, you're saying and I agree, you know, where where are you going to be that you need to do this thing?  But think about the possibility of being able to call your your wife or your brother or whatever when something crazy is going on and show them  and show them or show them that you're standing somewhere or talk to them while you're you know, you're in Paris and you're on the Apple tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a typical Apple thing where it's there's no there's not a strong use case for it.  They're kind of saying we think you're going to want to do this.  And so we're going to put it in here and you will do it because we put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it probably people probably will. I mean, you'll probably find ways to do.  I mean, here's the thing. It's not a new feature.  People know Nokia's had it for ages. I mean, we were just we had some some people in Taipei at Computex.  And we have a post where they were being driven around by a cabbie who was talking, having a video conversation with somebody while while while driving.  There you go. It was just like a normal thing.  It's just you know, he's talking to his wife or somebody.  And you know, I think it may become much more commonplace once Apple and this always happens.  Apple says it's something you say, well, what do I need it for?  And then suddenly like I move. You never thought you'd be editing your own movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've said that again. I said nobody ever wants to edit movies.  Nobody. I'm standing. I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm standing in the grocery store. I'm really tired of conversations with my wife.  I'm standing in the grocery store and I'm having her spend five minutes describing what it is that I need to buy for her.  I can just point the phone at it. I'm looking forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What other hardware? I mean, it doesn't seem like it's and this has been the case.  Three GS was merely evolutionary.  It seems like the next generation will be merely evolutionary.  Anything revolution? I mean, it's front facing is the closest thing to revolutionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this would be a big change, really.  I mean, it's going to be a higher resolution screen.  We're hearing double the resolution.  Gigahertz processor. Really? Double resolution?  I think it'll be the A4 processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the processor in the iPad, which really is a snappy little devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And imagine it with more RAM, which supposedly this is going to have.  So it'll have double the RAM of the iPad.  It's going to have a higher resolution screen.  Almost the resolution of the iPad, from what I understand.  Really? Wow.  People are saying 960 by what's the number?  It's double. It's double the current.  720 probably.  480. No, I'm confused.  No, 480 is 960.  It's 320 by 480, so it's 960 by 640.  960 by 640. My math is awful apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's amazing. That's quite a high resolution screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it'll double.  And I've heard some rumors.  It's not stuff that we published, but they're going to have all kinds of new ways to scale up apps.  And I think the thing about that, I mean, I think this is going to be a big, big change.  I think this is going to make the Evo and other phones not look quite as amazing as they do today.  I think tomorrow, unfortunately, and I think the Evo is a great phone.  The Incredible is a great phone.  There are a lot of very strong competitors that have bested the 3GS in terms of tech.  But tomorrow, they may have to go back to the drawing board, which I think is what Apple does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could I ask you a question though?  The one feature in Android that's killer for me is whenever I am in an unfamiliar place, I fire up the driving directions.  Have Engadget heard anything about Apple implementing turn by turn?  That would be awesome.  I mean, there's a rich marketplace for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could just couldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, doesn't Google want to spread its turn by turn navigation everywhere it can?  It seemed to me like they would say, hey, can we tap into this?  It's already there. It's using your maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve, at the D conference, Steve said, we don't mind using Google stuff on our phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't think they do. Google does some stuff really, really well.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's painting Google as non-competitors where another quote from that was, they decided to come in and compete with us.  We didn't compete with them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't go after their search.  I went after our phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was the last WWDC that I was at last year.  They had said turn by turn directions would be coming from Google.  And we never saw it.  I think that may have more to do with the business move in that they make the most money from TomTom apps and the nine ton of money from ninety dollar apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's thirty bucks in their pocket.  And there's some of the top grossing apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They may argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They may also argue because, you know, in fact, you know, it may not happen, but because they when they talked about multitasking, they talked about turn by turn.  They said, what do you really need it for?  Well, turn by turn directions.  That's something you need to keep running, even if you're doing other things.  But, you know, I think Apple would say, well, we're giving you a choice.  You know, you can get TomTom.  You can get Telenav.  You can get all these different services instead of just being locked into one thing.  Now, to be honest with you, I kind of I see the value in that.  I love Google's navigation, but it has taken me some crazy routes before.  Like, I question whether or not it's the best navigation I could possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just Google, everybody.  You said, Julia, it brought you through downtown San Francisco.  Yeah, the Google navigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just kind of went blind and trusted it to get me to the cottage.  But I've had that happen.  It let me stray about four times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had that happen on every GPS I've ever used where you just sometimes you just get crappy direction.  Like, what were you thinking?  It's a computer.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it kept contradicting itself.  First, it said go here and then five minutes later, it said go in the other direction.  It's doing the best it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  John Gruber has a nice post from April about this higher res screen.  According to his calculations, it's 162 pixels an inch.  That's a higher resolution than a Mac display.  That's an incredible resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Gruber has some secret sources.  I mean, he gets some good stuff.  Every once in a while, he nails something.  I mean, so he may be right on.  I mean, you know, I've heard the resolution is really high.  I haven't heard a number, but from very reliable sources, I've heard that it's really high.  And this number makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  LCD screen, though, not AMOLED, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they'll go to AMOLED.  I think that they recognize the biggest problem with AMOLED, which is you can't see it in the daytime.  Daylight's best.  It's really, really problematic.  I mean, I love the Nexus One, but every time I have to try to make a call during the day outside, it's like...  It's hard to use.  Just guessing.  Just guessing what I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the iPad has that problem, too, although I imagine they'll use these IPS displays, I would think, in a high res iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's likely.  I think they have a technology they like and they're going to keep using.  They're definitely going to have to up the battery life here, though.  You're talking about a lot of new stuff going on, right?  You've got this front-facing camera.  You've got a higher resolution display.  5 megapixel camera, I think, is the rumor for the one on the back.  And then faster processor, more RAM.  So my guess is they're going to do something pretty...  I mean, the battery's pretty big in this thing from what we've seen in the Giz teardown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to correct myself.  The existing iPhone is 162 pixels per inch.  A 960 by 480 display at 3.5 inches would be 330 pixels per inch.  Is that even possible?  That's laser printing.  That's a laser printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be great for reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maps will look good.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you think they're probably going to put iBooks onto the iPhone at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said they were doing that with OS 4.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  They announced it.  So that'll happen.  That'll be great.  I'm sure they'll tout it and say, look how clean the text looks on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  I've got a conspiracy theory I want to run by you guys so that you can mock me, laugh  at me, and make fun of me.  And I know you're going to do that.  But I really think there's going to be a really important one more thing tomorrow.  And I'll talk about that in just a second.  But before I do that, I do want to mention our friends at Carbonite.  We're going to take a little break here.  Mark Millian is with us from the LA Times, from the Pioneer Press, Julio Ojeda Zapata,  and from Engadget, the editor in chief of Engadget, Joshua Tepulski.  We're glad to have all three of you on.  Carbonite, I've mentioned before many times.  I hope you know about Carbonite.  Carbonite is the leader in online backup for PCs or Mac.  And one of the things I like about Carbonite is it's automatic.  You know, if you have to remember to back up, let's face it, if I have to remember to back up,  it ain't going to happen.  Carbonite does it for you automatically.  In fact, if you go right now to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT,  you could try this without even a credit card for 15 days,  which will give you enough time to really get a sense of how this works.  As soon as you install the software, it starts backing up using your high speed internet connection  right to the cloud, to the Carbonite servers.  You can use AES 256-bit encryption if you want.  Password's yours. You don't have to tell anybody, so it's very private.  It backs up all your personal files, financial records, photos, music.  So they're safe and sound.  You can tell it what folders to back up.  I think on the free trial, you can't back up video because that's so big,  but everything but the video on the free trial.  And then when you buy, you can back up everything.  Unlimited backup from your internal hard drive for less than five bucks a month.  But to me, it's not the price is secondary.  It's affordable. Yes, it's a great deal.  You don't have to pay more when you upload more.  But the real deal is how easy it is to use, how well written the software is.  It never slows your computer down. It knows what you're doing.  It doesn't use your internet access until you're not using it.  So it stays out of the way, but it just happens so that you are backed up.  And you can access those files from any computer you can get online with,  including your iPhone. There's great iPhone software.  I mentioned this before. I mentioned it one more time.  My daughter's going to college in the fall, and I am putting Carbonite on her laptop  because I'll tell you what, you know that laptop might get stolen.  The hard drive might die.  More likely than all of that, she might just accidentally erase  the paper that's due tomorrow.  And I know when I get that call, Dad, what do I do?  The paper, I erased it. I can say, good news.  I got Carbonite on there. You just go and get it.  Carbonite.com. It's backup done right.  You got to back it up to get it back with Carbonite.  So big announcement from AT&T last week.  Actually, a couple of announcements.  First from AT&T, they said we're going to double effectively  our early termination fees on our phones to what is it, $375 on smartphones.  Then, late last week, they say, oh, and by the way,  you know that unlimited pricing plan for data that you're getting the iPad,  the $30 for all you can eat, that's gone.  Starting, and here's an interesting date, June 7th.  They say you can order an iPad between now and June 7th,  and even if you don't get it by June 7th, we'll guarantee that $30 unlimited.  But from now on, $15, 200 megabytes, $25, 2 gigabytes, $10 a gigabyte  in advance of that, after that.  Tiered pricing.  So do you think it's interesting, I put this to you,  that AT&T announces all of this on June 7th?  What is happening? What is happening on June 7th?  What could be going on? What could be?  Oh, wait a minute. Maybe that one more. This is my thought.  Now, I know you guys are going to think I'm nuts.  One more thing. Oh, and the iPad and iPhone on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a better one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about on Verizon and Sprint?  And Sprint.  And T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And T-Mobile.  Every network in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes!  Tell me you didn't just get chills.  I did!  I said that.  I got chills!  Yeah, I know, right? If it happens, that would be it.  It's over. It's all over. We're going to squeeze his end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all over for AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to shut down the site because there won't be any more gadgets to report on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that, you know what? That's brilliant, Joshua. Why not?  Why stop at Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, T-Mobile is a very short step. All you have to do is change the bands.  Same radium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're building CDMA and you've got GSM, go all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you do CDMA, you're going to lose data and voice at the same time.  And I think that if they do it, which would be the smartest thing that they've ever done,  and Steve Jobs is not a dummy, if they were to do it, they would say,  you lose data and voice at the same time. That's how the CDMA networks work.  But we think the pros outweigh the cons there. And it's a great experience regardless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we believe in choice. We're the open solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just imagine a world where everybody who's on Verizon, everybody who's on Sprint,  and everybody who's on T-Mobile can also buy the iPhone in America.  So you don't think I'm crazy?  I mean, you're crazy and it's probably not going to happen.  But I think the timing is really unusual. The seventh term, making these changes on the seventh,  the termination fee thing is a little unusual.  And I think that it could very well happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the termination fee is only following suit with Verizon. Verizon's already doing that.  Let's face that. I think they're just trying to stay in line there.  And the data, I think AT&T is saying, holy crap, everybody's going to do video conferencing.  We better put some limits on this or our towers are going to get hammered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think it's in response to the front facing camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's in response to the front facing camera, them opening up VoIP on the App Store.  I think they're just getting ready for a flood of people going to data rather than voice.  Will there be tethering finally?  Yeah, I believe AT&T said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 3GS can do tethering. The AT&T said last year we'll have it by the fall.  Some places, not here.  Yeah, they could do it in Canada. They could do it in Europe. They just can't do it on AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard rumors that it's going to be an extra $20 per month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be a good deal. I can tether right now on my Froyo 2.2 Nexus One for free,  because T-Mobile hasn't figured that out yet.  Froyo?  Froyo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say it's frozen yogurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Froyo. Did I say Froyo?  A lot of people say Froyo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Froyo.  It's like a made up word.  I meant the Froyo.  I mean, look, I agree with Mark. It is in line with a lot of other stuff.  I don't think that your conspiracy theory is crazy, but I kind of love a good conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's make it really good. Let's juice it up is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the option in theory, but this rumor has been going on for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has, but we've gotten to have some evidence.  But you gave me an alternate excuse that really is pretty logical.  What Mark said is really...  Damn your eyes, Mark Millian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't ruin the fun of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You ruined the fun. I like, Joshua, I like your idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, all four, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it in Apple's interest though?  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not so sure about that.  Why not?  AT&T is giving them a ton of money per new subscriber.  Of course they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think the other carriers would do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. Once you open it up to everybody, what is the incentive?  There's no exclusivity there. Why is Verizon going to say, we'll give you four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're Verizon, you say, I've got the best 3G network, and it's more reliable, and blah, blah, whatever they say.  And you know that there are people, lots of people who have Verizon or want to get Verizon because they know it's so reliable.  There's a huge incentive to give them this phone to say, you don't have to go.  If you want the iPhone, we have it. You can get it. It's happening on Verizon.  I mean, to me, the incentives are just, they pile up.  Same for all of these carriers.  I mean, I think it's, if you stand behind your product as it is, it could only get better with having the iPhone, right?  That's the, that would be their stance, I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My suspicion is that AT&T is just offering Apple an insane amount of money for new subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got to be. They've got to be. But don't you think Apple's a little mad if AT&T says, oh, that $30 thing that you announced in January is now not?  Don't you think that would, that would piss me off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a weird, it's a weird change for the iPad since nothing is changing about the iPad.  I mean, the iPad is still going to be the iPad tomorrow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no more additional capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless, here's one for you.  There's a front-facing iPad camera?  They broke conspiracy theory out. They announced a new iPad that's joining its brother, the new iPhone, and it's got a front-facing camera.  I don't see that.  As you're, if you're an iPad owner, you can join in on calls with your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You disagree, Mark? Yeah, I don't see that either.  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so soon.  It's conspiracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two months after the iPad comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's too soon.  Oh yeah, because Apple would never suddenly release a new product just after they released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two months? I don't, I don't think that's ever happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's too soon.  That's pretty soon.  Yeah.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn it. But they could, well, okay, conspiracy theory number two.  Maybe they don't do the iPhone on these other carriers.  Maybe they do a Verizon iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe.  Boy Genius seems to think so.  Boy Genius thinks that's what's coming?  Yeah, they say that Verizon is testing a 3G iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and we've heard rumors of CDMA iPad, but, and then there you don't have the problem with calls because you're not making calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes huge sense, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so maybe that's what we're going to hear.  Maybe I'm half right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think if they do the iPad on Verizon, don't you think people will say why not the phone too?  Maybe they can get away with that.  I think I would say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I've been saying why not the phone for three years?  Why AT&T?  You know, I have to say one thing.  Yeah, maybe AT&T is glad they have an exclusive.  It's costing a lot of money.  And it's generating huge amounts of hate.  AT&T, according to PC Magazine, which just did testing all over the country, still has the fastest network.  But ask any iPhone or iPad user.  They're going to laugh at you if you assert that.  I mean, it might be technically true, but people don't feel like it's true.  AT&T's got some bad rep from the iPhone and iPad.  Maybe AT&T is going to say get out of here and good riddance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a good problem to have for AT&T, don't you think?  They say we've got so many users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe they're not making a lot of money.  Maybe they're giving so much money to Apple that it's not making the money on these new users.  Did you ever think of that?  What about that?  I love these conspiracies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the eternal question, which maybe Engadget has an educated answer for, is are the AT&T problems a result of AT&T or a result of the iPhone's popularity?  Will the same thing happen to Verizon once they get the Apple device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you spread it around, many carriers is going to be better than if it's just all on AT&T, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you a question.  Do you know people who have a bold 9,700 on AT&T?  Do you know anybody with a BlackBerry or any other phone on AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of people. They don't hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they have the same problem?  No.  Do you ever think that maybe it's not AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the iPhone. That's what some people assert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you ever think that those notches on the new iPhone might be antennas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To help call dropping issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking maybe it's not just AT&T. I'm not trying to defend them.  But I have gotten the impression that it's possible that there's a kind of a combination happening here.  The phone may not be so great when it comes to antennas.  And we know they've struggled with the antenna issue, right?  The original iPhone had this plastic piece on its aluminum back, and they canned aluminum because obviously they were having trouble.  I'm guessing. I don't know why they would want to go away from it.  And now the new one has an aluminum rim around it, but the back is some kind of tempered glass or plastic.  So I think that the question should be raised. Is it AT&T's network?  Or is it the iPhone itself? Or is it just a combination?  I think it's a combination. I think that if you ask a BlackBerry user, they don't have the same problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room pointed out that somebody called BeatTV, B-E-E-T.TV, I don't know who they are,  had a video interview with a Verizon spokesperson at D.  Don Johnson.  You know him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don Johnson. No, I actually met him at D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, Verizon has, let's see, there is no plan for Verizon to support Apple mobile devices in, quote, the immediate future, end quote.  Well, that could be tomorrow. Maybe. Who knows what the immediate future is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's pulling a job. It's like the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you got to figure if you're about to partner with Apple, you're not going to pull the mistake. Who was it?  McGraw-Hill. McGraw-Hill. You're not going to do that. You've learned the lesson that you don't say, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was great. The CEO is like, oh, yeah, Steve's announcing his tablet thing tomorrow and we'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you still can't buy McGraw-Hill books on the next try.  I believe the punishment is still on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you heard Steve at D, right? They go, when they're wrong, he doesn't take it lying down.  No. Steve holds grudges.  Yeah, he goes for the throat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve, I mean, frankly, let's face it. This whole Adobe thing comes from way back, way back many years ago when Adobe said we're going to stop making premiere for Macintosh.  And Steve hit the roof and said, we are going to screw Adobe every which way we can. Quick, find a video editing program.  They bought Final Cut. And I think it goes back to that. Steve's still holding that grudge. How many years ago was that?  Don't screw with the job, Meister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was just waiting for the right moment, right? Revenge is the dish best served cold.  Exactly.  It's like, I'm really going to get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think you could pull Premiere off the Mac?  Actually, there's a big, we should mention this, there's a huge security flaw in Flash.  Steve Jobs is going, yeah, what a surprise.  Zero day exploit that is in all copies of Flash pre-version 10.  And then Adobe has no fix for it and probably won't have a fix for it for at least a couple of weeks.  So just a word of warning, if you're using Flash, you might want to go to the Adobe Labs and get version 10.1.  The beta, apparently, now it's released candidate seven, so it's fairly stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, all it does is allow people to control your computer remotely. It's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what am I worried about?  Zero day, schmuro day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a complete exploit of your entire system.  Not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, everybody who's watching this live, I was watching on Flash. You have my deepest sympathy.  No, you're safe if you're getting it from a reliable site like us.  It's these, you know, it's just for, well, a couple of ways it could be used.  Places like MySpace where they, I don't know if they still allow this, but they used to allow anybody kind of anonymously to buy ads.  Those ads could have Flash embedded. They could have malicious Flash apps.  Or, you know, hacker.com. I'd stay away from there. Don't watch any Flash on hacker.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of the best stuff there. I know, there's some good stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm done for. Oh, I have a Mac though, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's true. That's another point, by the way, that it does affect Mac, Linux, and Windows.  It's the same bug in all of Flash platforms.  But the hacker would not merely control your machine, he would then have to write an application to take advantage of it.  It seems in most cases these guys would say, well, I'll just write it for Windows when I'm ready for Mac for it. Nobody has a Mac.  95% of the market.  Right. Why should I waste time writing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except the Mac users are all spending more money so they may have more in their bank account.  More credit cards there?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, it does affect Adobe Reader and Acrobat as well, but if you're using that, you're just a schmuck.  Who uses Reader?  How do you really feel?  Come on. Who uses Reader, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do occasionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't use Foxit or QtPDF or some other PDF thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, typically I use Preview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you've got a Mac, you don't need Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm in Mac OS, but Reader, I mean, once in a while I bust out Reader for something, you know, can't select something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would not bust it out anymore.  My advice to you, do not bust it out.  Let's see, Gizmodo was banned from WWDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why does this story say Gizmodo and not Leo Laporte 2?  I mean, if I'm going to get banned...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to do a post about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should say I was banned.  No, I don't know if I was banned. I didn't ask.  We've got plenty of people there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It isn't, I mean, it isn't really a shocker, is it?  No.  I mean, especially the way Jobs is talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were at the D conference, weren't you, Joshua?  So let's get, I tell you what, we're going to take a break, come back in a bit and get Joshua's report from D8.  We can also do a lightning round. I'm sure there's about 800 other stories we've got to get to.  It's too much fun having you guys on. We've got to get you back soon.  But right now, we're going to take a little break. Mark Millions here.  Julio Ojeda Zapata and Joshua Topolsky, one of the smartest groups we've ever had here since last week.  I'm good that way. I don't want to, I don't want to make any implications.  I do want to remind you about audible.com. I'll tell you what I am loving.  I'm listening now to the Girl with the Dragon tattoo, that Millennium trilogy, and I am just loving it.  Simon Vance is such a good reader. Audible is the place to go for audiobooks. It's the place.  I mean, there's just no question about it. 75,000 books, mysteries, thrillers, of course, you know, the page turners,  but also history, nonfiction, science fiction, arts and entertainment, self-development, and porno.  I mean erotica. It's all there. I am loving.  They have now the Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, as well as the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,  and the Girl Who Played with Fire. The full Stieg Larsson trilogy is now available on audible.com.  And I've got all three of them on my Android phone. I'm loving it. Audible.com. Dan Ariely has a new one.  I loved his first book. Predictably Irrational. And his new one is kind of a follow-up to that.  The reason I mention all these books is because I've got a way for you to get two books free.  A secret, secret way to do it. It's called the upside of irrationality.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two, you'll be signing up for the platinum account. That's the one I have.  Two books a month. That's the minimum, if you ask me.  See, here's the thing. I don't have a commute anymore, but I just, I love to read. For a long time I thought I don't have time to read.  I'm too tired when I get home. Then I discovered audible.com and I was listening when I went to work.  I was listening at the gym. I was listening when I did the dishes. Listening when I walked the dog.  And listening when I go to bed. And now I get a couple of hours of reading every single day without a commute.  That means two books a month. Easy. Think of all of the great stuff you're missing.  Dan Ariely's newest is The Upside of Irrationality. The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home.  I loved Predictability Irrational. Get both of those. You could get two of those free.  Here's what you do. You sign up for the platinum account, audible.com slash twit two. Your first two books are free.  You can cancel it any time. You can keep the books forever.  I don't think you're going to do that though. But if you're worried, maybe, I don't know, are audiobooks for me?  This is the way to find out. Listen to a great audiobook from audible.com.  Try it free. Audible.com slash twit two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I sometimes find it amazing that you recommend audible because after I'm done listening to all your podcasts, I don't have any time.  I know. There does seem to be a conflict of interest, doesn't there?  But let me tell you my favorite audible experience. Last summer, my wife and I moved into a...  We lived in Ocana for the longest time. We finally bought a house.  Last summer we were doing things like building retaining walls and things.  Oh boy.  And I was out in the sun for hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were actually doing manual labor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were doing it all ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so amazed. I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I whipped through all your podcasts in no time at all and had nothing to listen to. So I listened to The Road.  Oh, isn't that a great Cormac McCartney? Isn't that a great book?  Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.  Do you have kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a 12-year-old.  Yeah, a boy?  Yes.  Oh, then it's a must read. It's about a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I read it in print before and it just as a father...  It comes to life.  ...killed me.  It kills you, yeah.  But I was listening to it again and it was a wonderful execution of the book.  And the irony of listening to society having been destroyed while I was building, essentially, society with my bare hands.  That's really cool.  It was a great experience.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Often I'll reread a book while listening to it and it really does... it's another experience, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I swore when I read The Road in print I'd never read it again, but I'm really glad I listened to it in audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's another good book that I read in paper form and then listened to and it came alive was Martin Yann's The Life of Pi.  Have you read that? What a great... and the reading of it.  It might be one of my favorite audiobooks of all time.  So I mentioned that it is on Android now. There's a beta. You have to join the Google Groups.  So go to Google Groups and search for Android Audible.  And it's... a couple of bugs I noticed, but boy, this is better.  This beats the iPhone client because the iPhone client is just iTunes basically. You sync them up and you can listen to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much are they paying you, Leo? How much is Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they are in advertisers.  Is Google paying you to say that?  I love Google. I am become a Google fanboy. I admit it.  No, this is great because they've got... you should look at the app.  Put it on your Evo. I've got it on my Nexus One and my Evo.  You've got details about the book. You've got chapters.  You can bookmark any part of the book so that if there's a good moment, you could go back to it.  But it also has four square style badges. It's got a visualizer.  It keeps track of how much... you can see all the stats of how much you've listened.  Total hours and minutes listened. And then there's like a ladder.  But it also I think is really cool. It has four square style badges.  And then it has a sleep function, which I use a lot.  So now I can... I guess the iPhone does that, doesn't it? You can sleep.  So you're listening to the book and you can say, OK, I know I'm going to fall asleep after an hour.  So make sure you turn it off after half an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fall asleep while reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or listening, I guess.  Yes, of course I do. Don't you?  I mean, I don't listen to books. I read...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but now I see maybe this is just me, but I find that I cannot go to sleep unless I read a book.  That's how I go to sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That always puts me out.  Yeah, puts you right out.  Before I actually collapse into slumber, I put the books down usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife does not. Every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not one of those people who like falls asleep with a book on their chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every night. My wife, she's got the reading glasses on, the light on and the book.  Sometimes, I don't know how she does this. It's kind of a magic trick.  The book is... she's still holding the book in the air and she's out like a light.  I don't know how she does it. It's a magic trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're making that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. It sounds unbelievable, but it's true.  It does. It's completely unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think to the point that I think maybe you just lied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, horses sleep standing up. Why can't my wife sleep reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not a good road to go down.  Yeah, yeah. That's a great comparison.  You've made the biggest mistake of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's twice now because earlier, didn't I say something bad?  Oh, forget it. I'm dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best to not repeat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. What are you talking about, honey?  No, you know what the beauty of this is? She does not listen to any of my podcasts.  None. Zero. Zip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'm...  I love her. She's wonderful. Wonderful.  What did I say we were going to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  D. We were going to talk about D, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  D. Yeah, how was D? Was it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  D was actually pretty great.  I mean, you have a jobs interview. You never get to see jobs interviewed.  So, I mean, really, the man doesn't give interviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. In fact, the last one was at D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And believe me, I've asked repeatedly.  So, the thing about it that was great, Walton Carra don't pull punches, as I'm sure you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they did a good job, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They went in and they went in on everything you thought, well, they're not going to ask about that.  And they just went for it. They went right off the bat.  Right. Second question was about the phone.  The first question was, what, flash stuff?  And they just got into it. I mean, that was really good.  But then you had... So, you had jobs. We can talk about that if you want.  But then there was also Balmer was there, Peter Chow from HTC, James Cameron.  And Mark Sweaty Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounded very entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since you were at D, could I ask you a question?  Yes.  In your opinion, was Zuckerberg sweating because he was on the spot or was he sweating because he was hot because of the hoodie?  Was it hot in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was not sweating because he was hot.  I could tell you that if you see it... Have they released the full video of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the full video. I've seen clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they have like a big space heater right next to Zuckerberg's seat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he had, to be honest with you, I think he had like a panic attack on stage.  On stage, I think that he started talking about something that has been a real controversy.  And you have these moments and I've done it. I mean, everybody has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They call it in performing arts, they call it flop sweats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moments of panic where...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just not going well and it's going worse and worse and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it hits you and you start to... For me, it's like I step outside myself for a second. I say, wait a second.  This is awful. What am I doing? And you kind of freak out a little bit.  Flop sweats.  I feel bad for him. It's very... I mean, everybody was like, what is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you could almost make a case that he did himself more good than harm because I think everybody felt, oh God.  Yeah, he seemed more human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It humanized him.  Juli and I were talking about this before and it's like a 26-year-old CEO who's done a lot of great things and gotten lucky.  But you're going up against veterans. You're going up against the hardest reporters out there.  It's a tough situation to be in. I'm surprised he even took them up on it, especially at a point.  He needed to.  He needed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but he blew it.  I mean, the thing is, he needed to get on stage and make everybody feel like, hey, I know what's going on.  I know what I'm doing. I'm going to fix the stuff that people don't like.  We're going to make the stuff that people do like way better.  And instead it was weird. It just got weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was the wrong guy to do it, but there's nobody else either, it seems like.  Not Elliot Schrage for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He never directly answered any questions.  Not one.  He just kind of rambled all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think is going on? Are they inarticulateness? Is it that they're really trying to hide something? What's going on?  Are they really evil? Are they the Illuminati?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've never met Mark Zuckerberg. I don't know him. I probably never will.  But I'm just going on my gut here.  The guy just fundamentally, in my opinion, is not an honorable person in the sense of putting the customer first.  He's really thrilled with the little clubhouse he's built with his friends.  He's relishing the power.  He does have a vision for where the service is going.  And he's pursuing that vision at the expense, often, of the customer.  And that bothers me. And that fundamentally influences my use of his product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as you know, I quit because I didn't know what was going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to go back, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I already went back. I have a site.  So here's the thing about Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I think the problem is that we all expect that because he had a really good idea with Facebook  and he continues to have good ideas about the service, and some are bad, obviously,  but he knows one thing. He did this thing and he did it really well, obviously.  I just think that we make the assumption that he should also have a great mind for knowing how to treat users' privacy  or knowing how to treat users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's just a programmer, maybe. Maybe he's just a geeky programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just think that we shouldn't expect him to be able to have all those answers.  I mean, the problem is they need somebody who has the answers, who can effectively say,  I get what is right and what's wrong for users.  He doesn't seem to understand that aspect of the business.  And I think that it's dangerous for everybody to walk around and say,  well, why doesn't he just have the answer when there are a lot of people who wouldn't have the answer?  So, I mean, he may be very good at one thing but not good at another.  And I feel like he needs a committee, and that committee needs to be really smart about this stuff.  And I'm not sure that that committee is there.  I mean, he says they have these meetings and they go over it.  He's got some advisors. I assume he has people that are very close to him,  but they probably also think like he does.  So, he needs somebody to step in and say, here's your vision and here's reality,  and the two have to find a way to meet, and I'm going to be the person to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very simple. Who said this? I can't remember who said it on one of our shows this week.  Facebook needs an ombudsman that represents the user,  just like the New York Times and many, and I'm sure the LA Times have ombudsmen that represent readers.  They need somebody who can clearly articulate what's going on,  and they need, very simply, to be opt-in.  If they're not opt-in, I don't buy it.  If they don't flip the switch and say, everything's private until you say so,  they're breaking their commitment to users.  And I think that they're never going to do that because it's not as profitable as what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it may not be as profitable, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have to do it. That was the promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick Facebook Day was a failure, right? Isn't that what everybody says?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a failure because only 35,000 quit and probably more people joined in five minutes than quit in the whole day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It hasn't reached critical mass. I mean, will it? That's the question. I don't think so.  I mean, it's like very inside baseball.  The privacy complaints in a lot of ways are very much in the tech world and in our space.  People really think about and talk about it, but to the users at large,  to the people, the high school students and the grandmas and everybody who's joining Facebook,  they're not thinking about it. They're not worried about it either.  I mean, I think the issue is somebody's worried about it and somebody should be worried about it.  And Facebook doesn't need to be necessarily way out in front of it to the community at large.  They need to be out in front of it to the people who are thinking about it and watching them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's possible for Facebook to suffer from this or it would be if there were an alternative.  I think MySpace is a good example. MySpace fell apart because there was Facebook,  but there's nothing right now that people who quit Facebook can logically go to.  I mean, I looked at my quit page. It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Facebook the culmination of Friendster and MySpace?  I mean, isn't it all did all the things that those guys did wrong, they did right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but does that mean that that's the end of the line or is there a next one?  I mean, there's Friendster, MySpace, Facebook. Is that it?  Is there a next Twitter? Yeah, there's a next Twitter, don't you think?  What is it? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, I mean, so we don't know, but at this point it's like, right, there's Google for search.  There's Twitter for... Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it would be foolish. I mean, it would be foolish for anybody to say, oh, that's it, we're done.  I think the patent inspector in 1920 said, well, everything's been invented so we can close the patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, I agree. I think, what is the project called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Diaspora. I don't know if Diaspora is it either, although I noticed that they cashed my check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool idea, though. It's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They suffer from a very, very poisonous problem of having so much money to start and no product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They wanted 10,000, they got several hundred thousand. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Now there's all of this pressure and everybody watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's for NYU students. You know what? What's going to happen?  I think this is actually going to be fine, is that the open source community is going to come to them, developers are going to come to them.  People are going to say, look, you are now the de facto leaders of this movement. Let us help you. Let us help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would make sense, wouldn't it, if the whole idea... I agree, though.  It's tough when all of a sudden you say, hey, we're going to build the solution to Facebook that everybody, you know,  we're going to make everybody feel comfortable and we're going to do the same kind of stuff.  And then you've got to build it. Now you've got all this pressure, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's not a Facebook. Maybe it's something else.  You know, I think open, granular, federated solution is probably a better solution than a single monolithic company.  Bits and pieces from a variety of places. I think there are ways to solve this.  And I feel the same way about Twitter. I don't think one company should be the arbiter of all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Twitter should be the pipes, shouldn't it? I feel like that's the same thing. But Facebook, it's a platform, right?  But I think it's a platform. You know, I don't use it the way most people use it.  I don't know how you guys use it, but you know, the privacy stuff doesn't really.  I'm not worried about it because I expect anything that I put on Facebook is going to be sort of public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm smart enough to say, OK, I'm going to use it as a public venue.  But I just feel like by having a page on Facebook, I'm encouraging others to participate,  maybe others who are not as sophisticated like my family and friends.  So I just I said, I'm not going to be there. I'm not going to play in that space. I don't trust.  You know what? Fundamentally, I don't trust them. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, and why should you? I mean, look at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we trust? Would you trust this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, look, he's looking at what he was speaking was just plotting something to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like Nathan Thurman, the Martin Shorts character, lawyer character on Saturday Night Live was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I knew that. I knew that. Yeah, I'm not being defensive. I'm not being defensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are you being defensive? And what's with the sweatshirt? OK, what's with the sweatshirt?  Poor kid. I know. I know. I'm just piling on that.  Poor billionaire. Yeah, he's got the money. He can afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I'm piling. Going back to what Josh was saying before, I mean, Mark is is just 26.  He's inexperienced as a spokesperson and as a CEO, right, where he's being thrust into this on stage.  He's awful on stage. If you if you see any of those F8 conferences, he's not the first time this has happened.  No, he's not charismatic. He's not a great on stage speaker.  And to put him in front of Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher is like throwing meat into the shark's den.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would they do they feel like they piled on him? They actually weren't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They seem fair, but they're they're seasoned veterans. They're no Sarah Lacey.  He was preceded on stage by by Steve Ballmer and Jobs.  Like these guys have been at it for a very long time and they know what to expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that I agree with Mark. We're not going to pick on him anymore.  I mean, you know, but OK, but you asked about the sweatshirt, the Illuminati thing.  Yeah, it's a little weird. It's a little odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that goes back to my point I made earlier.  This guy is just enamored with the Colt Lake little clubhouse that he's built.  I mean, he he's he thinks more fondly of that than of his customers.  I that really bothers me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there were real learning points and turning points along the way in terms of in terms of building things.  You know, it really went from this position very early on where we were just in this college dorm room to we moved out to California.  It was a few friends and me and.  You know, it just kind of had this project feel for a while and there was this real turning point when when companies are trying to buy.  I've seen this before.  When you work in TV, you see this happen all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody comes on and you're interviewing them and their brain just isn't working.  They're so scared. They're so nervous that their brains not working.  And what comes out is mincemeat.  And I've seen this before and I'm actually very sick.  He should have been drunk. He would have been much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seriously, little glass of vodka goes a long way before you go out.  I mean, it's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's still products that help people stay connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he's just pulling cliche after cliche.  And I think there's going back to like the startup.  Oh, we were just two kids in a dorm room.  Or just myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I could, if I knew what a harp on how small of a company they actually are, you know, and I think that he did try to sort of tell paint this picture where the small company, you know, we're just figuring stuff out.  You know, we're but it's, you know, you have a lot of users.  How many Facebook users are there? 400 million or so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost almost half a billion now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's, you know, more people than.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's this.  Whoa.  Kara makes him take it off.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you should rewind that a little bit.  Well, you don't have to.  I'm not going to tell you what to do.  But he's kind of surprised by how much he's sweating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me rewind it if I can if I can grasp the arrow here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says, whoa, it's weird.  I thought that was fascinating answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's okay. You want to take off the hoodie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I never take off the hoodie.  I know you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a group of women in the audience that wish you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Girls?  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's the whoa is because he can't believe how sweaty he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, look, look how scared he gets.  I mean, it's like I feel bad for him.  I mean, he's seriously having a panic attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen it before.  It's exactly what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, then maybe he shouldn't go and have interviews with Walton Kara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he won't do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or he might try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think there's anybody at Facebook and look Kara is so motherly.  She actually starts to help him take it off.  Do you think there's anybody at Facebook that can tell Mark Zuckerberg not to go to D8 or D9?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are we going to do with the mic?  Put it on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put it on the collar of your teeth.  Yeah, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like two parents with a teenager helping him take off his hoodie.  I mean, there's this real weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not even yelling at you.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Randy should tell him.  His sister needs to give his sisterly advice.  Randy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, how do you feel today?  That's the thing.  I mean, so he had this bad experience.  This is what kind of sucks, right?  Most of us have a bad conversation with somebody or we say something stupid.  And this is kind of how I feel about the book and all the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  That illuminati thing is not on the outside.  It's on the inside.  Oh, that is creepy.  Wait a minute.  You can't even see it unless they take it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They recreated it on SF Weekly.  Have you seen that?  Yeah.  You should look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it has to do with OpenSocial and what the OpenSocial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says 2010 in the middle.  It's like the mission statement for 2010.  It's a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does seem like maybe they had a designer and he was like, hey, check this out.  It's kind of funny or it's cool.  And maybe they said, oh, we should get it in our hoodies or something.  I don't know.  It was a very nonchalant.  They didn't make a big deal of it.  And then all of a sudden now it's a huge topic of discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, everybody knows it's not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it is a conspiracy and they're very evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think I read somewhere where one of the hoodies popped up on eBay.  Yes, $300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some have been saying they gave hoodies out to every employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I buy this.  I didn't realize it was on the inside, though.  I thought this is on the outside like a biker.  This is hidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does really look like a weird kind of religious symbol or, you know, like the Eye of Horus or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No wonder they can't articulate their mission.  That's their mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those of you not on video, there's an SF Weekly blog post you can go look and see.  It's got three arrows with graph, stream and platform open and connected, making the world open and connected.  Facebook plus one.  And then two arrows that don't have anything.  And, oh, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Behold a pale Facebook.  There's a joke there.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a joke.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It definitely is unusual, said the least.  But I am thinking about doing something like that for Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we all should.  I want a Twitter hoodie with a secret logo inside or only you can see it.  A couple of quick lightning round moments.  Mark Millian, you did a story in the blog about Twitter's fake BP spokesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man. Have you seen this?  Tell me about it.  Twitter.com slash BP global PR.  It's awesome.  I caught it.  I caught it fairly early on and reached out to him and did everything I could to make contact.  He still won't tell me what his name is.  He's just some guy, right?  Yeah. He's finally now talking to me like a normal person.  But starting out, first interview I got, he did it in character and it was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  131,000 followers in just a few weeks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Feet is hilarious.  Yeah.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His latest tweet, we take the situation very seriously, which is why tonight's oil wrestling event will be followed by a campaign.  It will be followed by a candlelight vigil.  Geez, I love it.  This is really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real zingers in there.  Unfortunately, you know, I mean, it sucks because they're not really, I mean, it's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little too true.  Safety is our primary concern.  Well, profits, then safety.  Oh, no. Profits, image, then safety.  But still, it's right up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He sent me this sort of like manifesto where he's saying I'm like a dude in my underwear doing this.  And sometimes it's easy just to get mad or keep it to yourself.  But here is like a way to laugh at it instead of getting mad.  And it's reaching a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also probably a lot of people think this is BP.  There have to be people who see this and go, this is BP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I guess Twitter says they'll take it down if there's confusion.  But I don't know.  Maybe nobody's complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be really annoying.  I asked them to take down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a fake Leo Laporte was saying things like, you know, I mean, he was saying like sexual stuff, like crazy stuff.  I asked him to take it down.  They said, no, it's parody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they left up your second account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your secret account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My secret account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All my sexual.  Fake Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake.  Yeah.  Nudge nudge.  He was saying weird, real, very sexy stuff.  Sexy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a sexy guy.  Computex.  Anything big from there?  2010, the big Taiwanese fair.  I know a lot of slates.  Steve Gibson counted 42 or 43, something like that.  Slates that are not good.  We'll never never see the light of day.  We've been we've seen like bad Android.  And Windows, it's called like embedded compact 7, which is basically C87, which they're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to people, OK, this isn't Windows.  Make a different kind of skin for it.  Build your own tablet OS on top of it.  Won't be compatible with Windows 7.  But then you have Balmer saying, well, Windows 7 is going to be the platform.  And then you have Windows Phone 7, which is not the same thing.  And then, oh dear, then you have somebody built on Windows Compact embedded, whatever  it's called.  They built a UI, a couple of guys from Microsoft that looks like Windows Phone 7.  And it's not it was just for demonstration purposes to show people what they could do  with this platform.  So that really confused strategy on on tablets from Microsoft.  And then everybody else was like, here's Android on a tablet, but it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy at Microsoft, Jay Allard, who shepherded Xbox and then Zune left, he says, you know,  to have a life, some say because Courier didn't happen.  You think that's credible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certainly possible.  I mean, Courier was real.  It was real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I always thought, oh, this is just a concept video.  They never were doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The concept video was a concept.  Obviously, it wasn't real.  The idea for the product was real, was being worked on in Microsoft.  I've talked to very good sources that say it was real.  It was in a lab somewhere being incubated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a two-page tablet.  It was very cool and some neat ideas in terms of UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really great at UI ideas.  I think what happened is one of two things happened, I think.  They couldn't get it there, right?  They couldn't get it to where it needed to be after a lot of trying.  They said, well, we've got to can this thing.  Or they just didn't want to have yet another platform to support because inevitably, if  you do this crazy new UI, you have a new platform to support.  Maybe they didn't feel the market was big enough.  I mean, the crazy thing about tablets is Microsoft was there.  They were in the market.  They were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They thought it was the next big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Balmer talked about how with the phone, with the iPhone and phones, they missed a cycle  and now they're playing catch-up.  They've done exactly the same thing with tablets.  They missed a cycle.  If the courier isn't happening or something like the courier, soon, and as far as we can  tell based on what we saw at Computex, it's not because what they have at Computex was  like Frankenstein stuff.  If it's not happening soon, then they're missing the cycle.  Apple's already sold two million.  Now, they're not defining this new market of tablets.  Most people didn't know what a tablet was before the iPad and now almost everybody knows  and a lot of people are buying them.  They'll sell another five million, six million, 10 million before Microsoft even gets in the  game.  Oh boy.  They did it again.  They missed a cycle and it's a huge setback for them.  It's weird because they wanted to do this for so long.  They invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill Gates had been pushing it for 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if they hesitated about the pen input, which is a big part of the-  They love the stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They love the-  Well, Bill Gates loves the stylus and he still does.  He's so wrong and he's so wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know because the Curia had the option, right?  You could use your fingers or you could switch to a pen and it has hand-written recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows 7 has touch, so Windows 7 can do it.  It's multi-touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's the pen input.  I think it's a good idea.  Yes, include pen input, make it great.  Do touch as well.  Make that great.  You've done something that Apple hasn't done.  You have an opportunity there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As much as Bill likes the stylus, Steve hates it.  Does not like the stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you see a stylus, you blew it.  You all know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Although I use a stylus on the iPad quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you use that Pogo?  Yep.  I bought one and I have it.  I found I don't use it that much.  It's kind of not that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a little puff on the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to press really hard.  Do you find that, Julio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm a horrible neatnik and I have my moments where the smudginess on my iPad screen,  I'm just about to lose it and I switch.  For sanity's sake, I switch to the Pogo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Julio is actually oleophobic.  He's the oleophobe.  That is kind of gross.  You have to carry it.  By the way, oh look, the hoodie is now $1,025 on eBay.  Wow.  And 15% goes to the EFF.  Wow.  I get it.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I get it.  Pretty cool.  That lining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of neat.  I have a Talit question and I'm wondering what you guys think.  Is everybody just, is the main thing happening here?  Is everybody just scrambling and retrenching because of the iPad Lenovo slate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, remember that UX1 that they showed at CES, the Lenovo UX1, which is cool but gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what HP said about the Palm purchase?  The CEO says it's not about getting into the smartphone market.  He didn't go beyond that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they keep going back and forth.  They can't decide.  They backtrack.  We're killing the slate.  We're not killing the slate.  WebOS is for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he said really clearly, right?  Mark, he was like, I don't know why people don't get it.  We bought Palm for WebOS to put on slates.  I think they're just trying to push it and say, yeah, we're going to do smartphones, but  look, we're getting in this game big time and we have a great OS for it.  But yeah, I think, Julio, to what you were saying, people are scrambling now.  Everybody said no.  It's the same thing with the iPhone.  People said, well, Apple's not just going to walk in here.  Remember Palm?  Apple's not going to walk in and do this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that is my question to you.  How much of the Apple factor is to blame for the courier being killed?  Do you have any idea?

Transcript:  Why was the courier killed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that it must have been...  If the courier was a great product, I'm having trouble believing that they got it to be a  great product.  That's my theory, okay?  They just couldn't get it to work.  I think that has a lot to do with the shakeup, not just the courier, but a lot of things.  The Kin is a good example.  I think Microsoft has somehow gotten mired in a really...  I mean, they always have a problem with direction, but now it seems sort of worse than ever.  They talk about this great new phone platform that's going to integrate all of these services  like Xbox.  Then a few months later, they say, oh, we also have this other new phone platform and  it doesn't do all that stuff.  It's built on the same thing, but it's not the same thing.  They're miserable.  They're not good phones.  I think that the courier might have been part of that whole can't get a foothold, can't  find their bearings, just directionless stuff.  They need to change.  They need to execute.  You heard what Balmer said at D.  He said, we learned a lesson about not executing with the iPhone and with what Apple did.  They really execute.  Really not.  Maybe now they're getting it.  I don't know.  But again, they missed the cycle.  But I think Apple has a lot to do with...  I don't think they react to Apple necessarily, or they do.  They're just really, really slow to react.  But everybody else reacts and everybody is reacting.

Transcript:  There's so much more to talk about, but I don't want to keep you guys any longer.  Would you like my shirt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd love this shirt.  Is that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did Dig make that for you?  No, I made it.  Dig 4 was my idea.  You know why?  Because it was my idea.  But that's a story for another day.  Kevin says he will come on when Dig 4 comes out and he will demo it for us first on Twitter,  which might be as soon as next week.  I'm not sure exactly when.  Somebody sent me these T-shirts because I told Kevin this.  I said, two years ago I told Kevin, I don't care what other people dig.  I want to follow people like Mark and Julio and Josh.  Those digs, those are the ones I care about, not the dweebs who look super Mario Kart 15.  I don't care about that.  That's what I think Dig 4 is going to do, is going to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the idea that it actually, you tell it your Facebook account and your Twitter  account and it just goes in there.  It's who you care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's your social graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds like Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Buzz doesn't organize any of it.  They just spew it out there like Twitter does.  It seemed like their concept was to take all of this data that you're putting out there  and kind of put it in a logical, readable stream.  But they haven't gotten that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Buzz and I'm going to hang out Buzz forever.  I don't get it. Why?  Because it's better than Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've been getting into Buzz a lot lately for a couple reasons.  It's in TweetDeck so that makes it a little easier for me.  I fired up the secondary Gmail account that I don't use for my primary,  but that's where my Buzz is.  I fired that up in Mail app.  The other thing I'm looking forward to is on posters or postures or some debate  about the pronunciation.  When you post on it, you can automatically push your content to different places.  Buzz is in one of those right now, but it's going to be really soon.  Those three things are kind of making me revisit Buzz and use it quite a bit lately.  Here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like Buzz a lot.  I like a lot of the technology.  I would like Buzz a lot more if it were...  I don't want my Twitter stuff or my conversations with people  to be connected to my email account or any of my personal information.  I don't want it to look at my location unless I tell it.  I don't want it to do...  I know you can opt out of all that stuff now,  but the idea that it's in my inbox is so deeply unattractive to me  that it makes me not want to use the service at all.  I would use it if I could go somewhere.  It had its own portal.  It was separate from all of my stuff.  I logged in like I do with Twitter,  and I could have conversations in there  separate from all of my personal information,  separate from my email contacts, unless I wanted it.  It just feels way too connected to my other stuff, to my personal stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I agree with you 100%.  That's why I have my Google Apps domain customized email,  and that is my primary email,  and then this other Gmail account, generic Gmail,  it's my Google reader and my Buzz, and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the same thing, but then I have to go back and forth between...  I have to be in that inbox at some point,  which just seems crazy to me.  Why not make Buzz a service like Twitter?  I mean, you have the technology.  Say, just make it separate.  Well, there is just a setting that says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  don't put Buzz's in my inbox, and then you set that, and then it's...  And if you're using it in TweetDeck or Seesmic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it is, it is a service.  Yeah, I don't have the same issue, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I'll revisit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's another tip if you can't stand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  staring at that Buzz 100-plus below your inbox  that I found last week.  You can just drag Buzz down into your labels,  and it hides it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just a label.  So you just take that and you drag it down here,  and you put it there, and then you don't see it anymore.  Except I want it there, because I click the Buzz more often  than I click the inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a little slow on the update, by the way.  I just started using colored labels in Gmail, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God, colored labels is huge.  Huge, huge!  Oh, my God, it's like I have so many crazy customized...  I mean, when I scan my email now,  I don't even look at the label name.  Just the color.  Yeah, it's so helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting.  See, I think one of the reasons maybe you guys  don't like Buzz so much is because you love Gmail so much.  It's like you don't want to...  You put peanut butter in my Gmail.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I like Buzz because it is in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I'm the opposite.  I like Gmail as this sort of...  It's pure experience.  Keep it pure.  It's a pure email experience.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, well, we're going to run because...  I don't know why, because I could go on for hours,  but people seem to tell me that that's maybe a little too long.  But, boy, I love having you guys on.  Please come back.  Mark Millian is with the LA Times.  You can read him online.  And his website is markmillian.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice to see you again.  You pronounce my name amazingly well, by the way.  You know, I should do it like they do it sometimes in San  Francisco because they're trying to be very, you know,  hip and Latino.  They'll roll the R's.  I could go Julio Ojeda Zapata.  Would that be better for you?  Would you be happier?  Very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I belong to a secret tribe called the  Twitterikens, which is Twitter using Puerto Rican.  That's good.  And shout out to the mayor, Rafi Mediavilla.

Transcript:  Josh Topolski is the editor in chief of Engadget,  the Gadget blog, as far as I'm concerned,  and also hosts the Engadget podcast.  Where can we find that Engadget podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's on iTunes.  We put it up on the site every week.  We also do the Engadget show, which I don't know if you've  seen, but it's a monthly live show with guests, luminaries  from the tech world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do that on Ustream, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do the Engadget show.  We stream, no, using Brightcove.  And then we also put it up on iTunes.  Oh, OK.  So we do the podcast and the show.  And we have short segments where we go on location places.  Very cool.  See, there's one right there.  We interviewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Rubinstein, Bit Shifter.  That's the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

We do do Twitter.  And again, dig four.  It was my idea.  We do do Twitter every Sunday around three o'clock Pacific time,  6 p.m. Eastern.  That's 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.  And then you can subscribe whenever you're in the mood on iTunes or the Zoom.  Best thing to do is go to twit.tv slash twit.  And that'll give you all the information you need about getting the show in video or audio  or on YouTube, youtube.com slash twit.  We will be back tomorrow.  For those of you watching live,  we're doing a special edition live show.  Tom Merritt, Alex Lindsay, Andy Anotko, Don McAllister, and Becky Worley.  All will be covering WWDC.  Becky, John, I'm sorry, Becky, Andy and Don will be in the hall, blogging live.  Andy and Tom will be here in our studio.  We begin that at 942 a.m. Pacific time.  That's 1242 Eastern at live.twit.tv.  So if you're interested in what Steve has to say, there's no video.  I wish they would stream video of it.  They don't stream video of it.  So you just have to watch.  In gadget will be live blogging.  I'm sure GDGT, all the other sites.  But we will, we kind of aggregate it all into one big mishmash so you can find out what's going on.  Thank you for being here.  We'll see you next week.  Another twit is in the can.
