And we were just talking about old times.  Thank you.  Because we got an old timer here with us.  Peter Rojas was a guest on many Twits back when he was at Engadget and Gizmodo.  Of late he's been a big-time investor at BetaWorks.  Small-time investor.  Small-time investor at BetaWorks.  It's so good to see you again, Peter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably, yeah.  The show's only 15 years old.  You were on early.  I remember being on in the cottage.  Yeah.  By the way, we always loved having you on and your expertise.  It's just great to see you.  I guess since we've seen you last, you've had a few kids.  Keep having children.  Keeping busy.  It's so great.  Anyway, welcome to the show.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Thrilled that we were able to get you.  And also thrilled to see Brian McCullough, host of Tech Memes Ride Home podcast, our  resident internet historian.  How are things with you, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just a mess.  We're just a mess.  It got, there's another, yet another fire cropped up over the hill in Napa.  And it's apparently all the smoke is coming this way.  So even in the studio, it's starting to get a little smoky.  We got the molecules on full.  They're turned all the way up because it's just, it's just a messy, messy, messy.  Last time I did the show, I had that Microsoft Duo to play with.  I just want to give you an update on that.  It's going back.  I loved the feeling of it.  The hardware was very premium.  It was really nice.  It just, it wasn't this.  I think, I think there were a couple of problems.  The software didn't really understand the dual screen, but I also think because they'd  put a somewhat, a slightly older processor in there, it just didn't feel very responsive  or snappy.  So and I figured $1,500 for a phone.  That's just not enough.  So I thought, why don't I spend $2,000 and get a really nice phone?  I feel like what I'm doing is a research project on alternate form factors, but I'm drawing  the line of the LG wing because that's just kooky.  That's the one that the screen flips sideways and there's a little hidden screen underneath.  But this is the Galaxy Z Fold 2.  Have any of you played with this yet?  Because I have to say it's, the reviews I've read were very positive compared to the Duo  and I kind of agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I had one for a couple of weeks, did a review of it and I, and my wife loved it  more than I did.  I mean, she was sad to hear that it was going back.  But it's just, you know, the value for the dollar part of it is just not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so, it's heavy.  It doesn't, it looks elegant.  It doesn't feel elegant.  And I just, I don't think you can, at this point, you can justify the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It feels like a lopsided poorly made sandwich because this skin is so thick.  It's a sandwich where they left the meat out.  And I was very concerned about the folding screen, although I have to say, having used  it now, my concerns there are kind of alleviated.  It actually works pretty well.  It feels good.  It doesn't feel like plastic.  And while you can see a crease if I angle it right, when you're looking at it straight  on, you really don't see it.  It's really fun to take pictures with because it's, it's not as big as an iPad, but it's  a big viewfinder.  So it's kind of fun to do that with.  But boy, was I nervous taking pictures because I thought this is $2,000 if I drop it.  And you know, if you drop it, million pieces.

Start time: 420.22
End time: 440.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the main point, this is the thing, I've not had one long enough to see if this would  be valuable enough.  But for that money, right, the main point of one of these things is when I want a bigger,  when I want more screen real estate, I have it.  Well, how often does that come up for you?  Is it worth it?  Does it come up enough that it's worth it?  No.

Start time: 441.40
End time: 453.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess my thought would be this, you know, they talked a little bit about the second  generation now.  They've made the front screen a little bit bigger.  It's still oddly narrow.  You know, the aspect ratio is very tall and weird.

Start time: 454.06
End time: 459.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you type on the on the front, the front screen at all?  Yeah, but it's really small.  It's like kind of cramped, right?  Yeah, it's cramped.

Start time: 460.26
End time: 492.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you even if you don't need to open it up, you do want to open it up almost always.  Then it's very feels very spacious, especially contrast of the front screen.  But then typing on this is weird.  Now maybe this is just I haven't, I maybe not figured this out yet.  But it does a split screen, which I guess kind of makes sense as a split screen keyboard.  But I wish it would just take the whole bottom up because this isn't any bigger.  These are still small little keys because it's not using the whole thing.

Start time: 493.16
End time: 496.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's designed over two hands.  Yeah, but you know what else doesn't work?

Start time: 497.80
End time: 520.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even though this is the Samsung keyboard, swipe doesn't work.  It doesn't understand that there's a gap there.  So you can't you can't it's just I feel like this is like the same problem I had with the  duo essentially was this is such a new form factor.  Not everything works yet.  Samsung is a lot closer, but you know, one should spend two thousand dollars on a phone  that is slippery and made of glass.

Start time: 521.76
End time: 542.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I thought LG wing design actually kind of made sense because you could rotate  the screen up and then have on the bottom part, you could have the keyboard and then  you could type and you could still have that wider.  I'm not saying it completely works, but at least like conceptually, you could see the  argument for it because you could sort of have the same typing experience you have on  your phone right now and have your real estate.

Start time: 542.54
End time: 550.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I, you know, I traded in the duo to get this.  Maybe I'll trade this in.  Yeah, it's the quest.

Start time: 551.50
End time: 557.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The LG wing looks a lot like when you have it swapped over like the hand terminals in  the expanse.

Start time: 559.12
End time: 561.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there is something to be said for that, isn't that's right.

Start time: 561.48
End time: 565.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the that's what everybody that's the end game, right.  Everyone wants those expanse thing.

Start time: 566.14
End time: 567.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hand terminals. Yes.

Start time: 567.52
End time: 591.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I guess, you know, in a way it would solve the keyboard problems I've had on these  because that bottom screen, I presume, becomes a keyboard.  Yeah. Yeah.  And maybe I don't know.  It's so goofy looking.  I just it's just I can't.  It's not a dual screen.  It's a it's a T screen.  It's just a weird.  It's just weird to me.

Start time: 592.52
End time: 595.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's the best of both worlds, Leo, or the worst.

Start time: 596.64
End time: 621.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we are.  I mean, clearly.  And we've said this before.  We got an iPhone coming out next month.  We are a peak phone.  There's no way phones are going to you have to go to these weird form factors to do  anything different these days.  What do you think, Dwight?  Is this is it?  Is it? Is it a fool's errand?  To try to reinvent the smartphone?  Are we just perfect now and you should just stop?

Start time: 623.04
End time: 641.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I don't think it's perfect.  And I think all these experiments are good because what will happen is there'll be  some technology, say, that comes out of the fold or out of the wing or  that will that will then be perfected by someone else.  You know, Apple, for example, is working supposedly on a folding phone.

Start time: 641.32
End time: 642.21
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's playing around with it.

Start time: 642.98
End time: 652.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, theirs will be thinner and  and there'll be other there'll be things about it that they do with it.  But whether that works, I don't know.  What can they do?

Start time: 652.82
End time: 659.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Samsung own this folding screen technology?  I mean, they make these screens.  Are there others that could make can do this?

Start time: 659.98
End time: 672.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Samsung has talked about selling it to other people.  And I see I vaguely remember and I'm not going to Google it right now,  but I vaguely remember there was some discussion of Apple acquiring  some folding screens from Samsung.

Start time: 672.20
End time: 688.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then it's going to be the same screen.  So it's really going to come down to whether the software can be.  And here's the good thing.  Unlike Samsung, Apple controls both hardware and the software completely.  So they don't they're not, you know, I don't have to make it work on Android.  So it presumably would work better.

Start time: 688.44
End time: 702.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. But I don't know.  I think that the way technology develops is that people try some outrageous things  and other people look at it and go, well, let's let's use that with this.  Right. And then it works. Right.  I think so. I think we need this.

Start time: 703.92
End time: 728.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's, you know, the case with my guess is that Apple might say  it be experimenting with it, but is waiting for glasses  and that they think that I would guess their thought is  and I'd be curious what you think about this, Peter, that the new form factor is not  doing more with a single phone, but having glasses, Air Pods, watch  that extend the phone.  But the phone stays fundamentally the same.  It's the computer in your pocket.

Start time: 729.68
End time: 791.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's I mean, you can see that that's Apple's strategy,  which is in a way it kind of mirrors the original strategy  that Steve Jobs laid out for the PC as the hub.  I was just going to say this devices.  Yeah. And so it goes back to I think 18 years ago or so.  So now the phone becomes the hub.  And for a lot of reasons, one is you can put a more powerful processor in there.  You can put a bigger battery.  You can put the, you know, 5G radio in there.  It's going to be hard to pack that stuff into the glasses.  It's going to be hard to pack that stuff into AirPods.  You know, you can sort of do it in the watch, whether you can get 5G  and watch anytime soon remains to be seen.  Right. But the idea that like you're having this network of devices  that all work together and the phone is at the center of them,  that appears to be Apple's strategy.  And I think that one advantage that it gives for Apple is it actually makes it harder  for people to leave the iPhone.  Absolutely. Because all of a sudden you have, you know, you got to replace your watch.  You got to replace your glasses.  You got to replace, you know, your your your wireless headphones.  And so, you know, the more that they can create this ecosystem of devices  that all work really, really well together, the harder it is to leave  because you got to swap out not just one thing now, but like four, maybe even five.

Start time: 791.22
End time: 815.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works in both both ways.  Yeah. And they want to lock you in for sure.  So, yeah, I think that makes more sense than trying to make a phone that can do  do everything, especially since it's pretty clear.  We've hit the limits on what people are willing to pay for a pocket device.  I mean, 2000 is way too much.  Fifteen people were bitching about the duo being fifteen hundred.  I think a thousand is the sweet spot.  You know, it's hard to charge a lot more than that.

Start time: 816.50
End time: 826.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Samsung was charging fifteen hundred for the Flip Z.  You know, they're right there.  Vertical folding phone that, you know,  that was too much for that that particular form.

Transcript:  flying through the danger zone  with my Samsung folding phone.  I feel the need to fold.  All right, let's take a little break. I want to come back.  The reason I want to take a break so early in the show is because  we need to check if TikTok still works.  And I understand the president is having a press conference.  So maybe I don't know what's going on.  But welcome to 2020.  This was supposedly right, a deadline day.  I don't know what's going on.  Then there's court cases.  Just a mess. We'll get an update on that.  We could, I guess, talk about the Apple Watch.  I have the Series 6 here.  I just washed my hands. It scolded me.  That's no fun.  We could talk about a big birthday.  How old do you think Google is? No peeking.

Start time: 916.12
End time: 1239.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or it's time.  I got, you know, if you like Altavista, try Duck Duck Go.  It's you know, it's equally bizarre.  Our show today, I keep trying Duck Duck Go because I really want to like it.  But it's basically just being and I'm sorry, I can't.  I just can't.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass.  We got a big event coming up with LastPass.  We're going to have a lot of fun talking about security.  What we're going to do is we're going to do teams.  It's going to be a team event.  We've done a number of events with LastPass.  October is security month.  October 8th, 1 p.m.  Pacific, we're going to do Red Team versus Blue Team.  We're going to have hackers versus defenders.  And we've got a really good lineup for this, including  Logmeans CISO, Gerald Buchholt, who's been on all of our events.  He'll be joined by I think we're going to make Robert Balisare an attacker.  Brian Chi from This Week in Enterprise Tech, an attacker.  And then we'll have Jerry, who's a CISO and the great security  guru, Bruce Schneier, as defenders.  I haven't decided yet who's going to be on what team.  But we'll talk about common attack scenarios and the best way to defend against them.  This is going to be not just fun, but I think very educational.  Be almost like a debate format.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We're doing that with LastPass, October 8th at 1 p.m.  We're big fans of LastPass, not just because they bought the studio naming rights.  In fact, I've been a fan for almost as long as I've been doing these shows.  LastPass came out about 12 years ago, something like that.  And I started using it immediately to keep track of all my passwords.  Actually, went well beyond that almost immediately because it's so secure,  because the encryption is done perfectly so that you only are decrypted on device.  You never decrypted anywhere else.  Your password is never transmitted to the LastPass.  So I really trusted it's become kind of a software secure enclave on all my devices.  So I don't just put passwords and logins there.  I put everything there.  My driver's license, my passport when I traveled.  Haven't done that in a while, but when I traveled,  you know, you always want to bring a copy of your passport.  Perfect place to store it in LastPass.  Always have it on me.  It's always safe, but it's also secure from prying eyes.  When it comes to business, there is nothing more important  than that identity and access management that LastPass provides.  They actually surveyed 700 IT and security professionals  in financial services and IT and retail and a bunch of different industries.  Almost all of them said their business has been exposed to risk  due to poor identity and access management.  82% said that.  That's why you need LastPass.  The risks are out there as we work from home.  Our employees are, you know, outside of the shelter of the workplace.  They are vulnerable.  They you don't want them sharing passwords with one another  via text messages or email.  That's why you have LastPass.  They have a secure and safe way to share passwords.  They of course, employees get that same strong, secure password storage  for storing every app and web login they use.  And of course, with single sign on and all of LastPass,  your IT always has absolute insight into who is accessing what and where.  Oversight of shadow IT,  enforceable policies across all password protected accounts.  That's LastPass.  That's what LastPass is all about.  And they also have added, by the way, of course, we love two factor.  LastPass supports that.  But in the enterprise, they now have added multi-factor, contextual factors  like geolocation, IP address, so that you really know  that the right people are accessing your most valuable resources,  your web logins, your your QuickBooks, your data, your customer records.  You got to keep that stuff safe.  AES 256 bit encryption,  PBKDF2 to make it hard to brute force, complete security in the cloud.  That's why I trust LastPass, why you should trust LastPass.  That's why we've been using LastPass in the enterprise for many years now.  Thank goodness we've got it.  It's the number one password manager.  Let LastPass securely manage your user's identity  by letting your employees work efficiently  without making your business vulnerable to cyber threats.  LastPass.com slash twit LastPass.com slash twit  could stronger security cannot wait.  I don't even know where to start with this.  Every every episode, it seems like there's something new with TikTok.  TikTok, of course, went to court.  They said, you can't ban us.  You can't ban us.  The DOJ went back to court saying they ruled against three users  defending the ban on TikTok against the Pennsylvania  judges ruling Saturday or citing the Pennsylvania  judges ruling Saturday against three TikTok users.  TikTok users are requested that the ban be denied.  The judge denied that.  So the DOJ pounced on it.  I thought that today there was a...  Brian, how do you cover the news daily?  How do you even cover this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know what I said this week?  I was like, listen, I'm going to throw my hands up in the air.  Yes.  After every segment.  So here's what I can tell you.  First of all, at this moment, whatever that press conference is,  they're asking him questions about who's playing Biden in the debate.  So whether we're going to find out or we're having this conversation,  what his decision is, I don't know.

Start time: 1261.86
End time: 1264.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1265.08
End time: 1267.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see if anyone knew the answer.

Start time: 1269.38
End time: 1271.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just assumed he wasn't practicing at all.

Start time: 1271.32
End time: 1273.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what he said. He said, I practice every day.

Start time: 1274.58
End time: 1338.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch. Oh, no. Right.  I agree with the I thought he wasn't practicing.  Because he didn't. Right. Yeah.  OK, so here's here's what we know.  Number one, the deal should, in theory, be  Oracle and Walmart to take a percentage.  The problem is the president is saying the percentage is 100 percent.  The tick tock. He doesn't know.  The percentage is 20 percent. Yeah.  Not only that, apparently, the reporting has been that there's not even a term  sheet like typically.  So everyone, the agreement as it exists has always been an agreement and principle.  And so when things get floated like this five billion dollar fund  that the president believes is going to go to education and things like this,  apparently that's nowhere near the term sheet, because again,  the term sheet doesn't exist.  On top of that, if it does exist, it would come after the IPO.  That would happen if the deal goes through, which would pay for the five

Start time: 1343.34
End time: 1388.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But or would come out of payroll taxes and things like that.  So it's one of those things where I keep saying something's probably going to happen  because I feel like there would be a situation where everyone can declare victory  and nothing actually functionally changed except Oracle maybe got a kind of  sweetheart deal out of it.  But I would have thought that that would have happened by now.  And the fact that it hasn't makes me think that it's never going to happen.  And then here's the bottom line.  No matter what happens, if if Trump right now, as we're speaking, says, yeah,  I accept the 20 percent deal or whatever or no, I insist on whatever.  If they iron that out in the end, the Chinese can still say no.  Right. Yeah, they're the ones.  Has the ultimate veto. Yeah.

Start time: 1389.76
End time: 1406.42

So let's say that he announces right now that the app has to come out of the App  Store and Google Play that they can't functionally remove  the app from anyone's phones.  So then the real teeth would be is if no one can do any hosting  like that CIFI or I never know how to pronounce that or whatever.

Transcript:  we can no longer host you or something. Right. That would kill it.  There is don't tell the president, just keep this under your hat.  But both Apple and Google have a kill switch.  Right. They can they can pull apps from your phone.  I think they've done it. It seems to me they can kill malicious apps. Yeah.  So just don't tell the president.  But apparently they could if they wanted to.  Tick tock could disappear from your phone.  Here's here's the only thing I would say we've covered this.  And I've done the same thing, Brian.  Throw your hands up, which is also coincidentally the same thing  you do on a roller coaster.  Throw your hands up and say, I don't know what the hell is going to go on.  Here's what I would say.  Our relationship with China is complex.  It is geopolitically and strategically extremely complex.  They own a lot of assets in the United States, including treasury bonds.  Most U.S. tech companies manufacture their gear in China,  made in many cases with parts made in China.  China is an interesting country.  They're treating their Uyghur Muslims  very badly, internment camps and slave labor.  They have definite economic aspirations around the world  with their Belt and Road Initiative.  They're they're reaching out much as the United States has done  with foreign aid for years to to countries and saying,  let us help you to co-opt them a little bit.  There's intellectual property rights issues with China.  But this is a very big, complicated issue  that requires strategic planning, diplomacy, thoughtfulness,  subtlety, negotiation, banning, forethought.  Banning an app is not  in any way useful to this process.  Do we agree or who wants to who wants to say TikTok should be banned?  Because we've had a lot of people on this panel.  I don't have it on my phone anymore.  Any more than I have Facebook on my phone.  But that's a personal choice.  And certainly the Department of Defense has the absolute right  and probably burden to say no military personnel should have TikTok on their phone.  I would hope they do the same with Facebook.

Transcript:  One more angle for this being Kabuki theater is that Microsoft,  like chumps, made the mistake of negotiating in good faith and saying,  OK, is security your issue?  Well, our deal, let us have it.  We will solve all of your security issues.  So one of the most frustrating things to me has been  if that was really what the concern was, then it should have been Microsoft.  But apparently Larry Ellison has held fundraisers for Trump.

Transcript:  Well, that's you know, everybody and this is a very emotional topic.  People don't talk about.  Everybody's walking on eggshells here because  there are armed people there who will on either side, maybe.  I don't know if there's are TikTokers armed? Probably not.  Probably not. They're armed with Tide Pods.  But they're not armed with guns.  But there are people out there who will enforce this stuff by force.  And so everybody's a little bit nervous.  I'm more scared, frankly, of of the president's  supporters than I am of China at this point.  So I don't I really don't know  if there's anything more to say about this.  We're just going to watch  and throw their hands.

Start time: 1694.25
End time: 1716.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll make one last point, please do.  But but it's that if there are  look, there are legitimate concerns about data and, you know,  TikTok's relationship to the Chinese Communist Party and, you know,  what happens to user data.  I think that those concerns need to be addressed at an industry level  via regulation, right?  A set of rules that everybody Chinese American companies all have to adhere to.

Transcript:  And the reality is that if, you know, if somebody wants to get data  from TikTok users or Facebook users or whatever platform,  you can usually get that through some sort of third party data broker.  And that is an extremely, you know, a very lightly regulated market right now.  You know, I think the people, the average person might be very surprised  to find out how much data about themselves is floating out there.  And I think, you know, we with the CCPA,  there has been an attempt to sort of address and mitigate that.  But very, very few people are taking advantage of, you know, their rights  to be able to have their private data deleted.  I think partly an awareness issue.  And I think partly people, you know,  don't feel especially threatened about that sort of data versus,  you know, their DMs being exposed.

This is a US company run  big investors, Peter Thiel,  run by Alex Carp,  that seems to be doing all sorts of data mining on data  gathered by US intelligence and armed and police officials  and then resold back to police officials.  Things like, you know, pre-crime reports.  I mean, we're  China is not the sole owner of these kinds of technologies.  We're very actively participating in this.

What do you Brian? You know, it used to be there were rhythms in tech news.  And you know that we like next week, the new Pixel phone is going to come out.

Keep on giving for some time to come.  I ordered that weird wristband.  They announced this a few like a month or two ago that will do  a emotional temperature assessments on you based on your voice,  because I really want to know if I'm yelling at my subordinates too often.  Right. I think we're not enough or not or not enough.  Leo, you're too nice.  You're too nice. You should be more mean.  That would be funny if it said that somehow.  I don't think it's going to do.  They announced some very dystopian sci fi weirdo stuff.  Let's let's start by talking about Amazon's Sidewalk,  a mesh network designed to extend Amazon's reach into your whole neighborhood.  They already you know, they acquired Ring and they're already getting heat  for the fact that Ring cameras are everywhere, recording everything  that happens in your neighborhood and sending it off to the police.  Now they want to do Sidewalk.  Dwight, have you have you been following?  Can you explain Sidewalk to me?

Microsoft had Sidewalk, which was their local news. Right.  Now Amazon Sidewalk, which is a shared network, a mesh style network  that helps to this is I'm reading Amazon's copy helps devices  like Amazon Echo Ring security cameras, outdoor lights and motion sensors  work better beyond your Wi-Fi.  And one of the first things they announced is a sensor you put on your mailbox.  Many of us who live in more rural areas  have mailboxes that are somewhat distance from our door.  It will let you know if the mail has arrived,  but it will also  expand the reach of the Amazon network  out to the street.  And they're hoping that everybody who has a ring doorbell  and this will be make this kind of this mesh coverage  over the whole neighborhood.

You know, the the use case that they love to tout is that if you have  a tracker on your your dog or your pet or whatever,

Start time: 2194.72
End time: 2208.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see him. But the point is, is that it is super low bandwidth.  Like you wouldn't even notice it if you join the mesh because it's  it's connecting to the lights and the ring camera and the whatever, whatever.  It's not you're going to walk down the street and have Wi-Fi ever.

So, for example, if you're in Houston and you've got these houses  that are each on a quarter acre lot and there's 700 of them in a neighborhood  and maybe a third of them have it and they're distant from each other,  it's worthless.  You got to have the only way it works.  No, it has wider coverage in the suburbs.  And if it has, it's got better.

The question is, it will default beyond.  I traded in my ring doorbell because of this whole given the  video to the cops thing made me very nervous.  I got a Google Google.  Hello, doorbell.  Which has its own problems.  It recognizes people.  It says, John's at the door.  You want to say hi? It's like, what?  So, in fact, it even says it even has a warning when you set it up.  This may not be legal in all states.  So consult your local laws because it has face recognition in it.

And they have had wild events.  This is what I was going to say is this epitomizes the tension  between privacy and convenience.  And I think that that's going to be the story of the next five years of technology is,  hey, this is really great.  You know, your dog will know where your dog is.  We'll know when you got some mail.  I'm sure there'll be other applications beyond that.  There's some fairly trivial.  And yeah, you give up a little privacy.  So, you know, it's not that bad.  Peter, you seem like you were all in on this.

Start time: 2409.10
End time: 2429.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not. I wouldn't say I'm all in.  But I think that, you know, I think that we have to separate out the parts  that make us uncomfortable, the parts that make us uncomfortable.  And the fact that there's a mesh network where data is repeating  across multiple users like this, I don't think that is inherently problematic.  The data is almost certainly going to be encrypted anyway.  And so tell you're going to have access to, you know, your neighbors data as it passes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more like, you know, do we want to give Amazon, for example, or any big company,  you know, this level of granular data over.  But like, you know, I think the reality is we have given up a lot of this stuff.  And again, to go back to the point around TikTok, I think that, you know,  the only real solve for this is at a regulatory level.  I mean, it's not necessarily the most popular solution or the easiest solution.  But I think that is the one that would be the most effective is you have to set rules  of the road for all these big companies about how they have to treat,  you know, customer data and protect it.  And I think without that, you know, one, you have this sort of race to the bottom, right?  Where, you know, one company might sort of might decide, hey,  we're going to take these protections.  And if their competitor doesn't, then they're at a disadvantage in some respects.

Start time: 2501.12
End time: 2533.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just feel like it's not impossible, but it is hard.  But I mean, you could say this about everything that we have regulations.  It's all right. I mean, whether it's food or transportation or look,  I mean, it wasn't popular to put seat belts in cars, right?  But it was a good thing.  Yeah. People talked about it, violating their freedom and, you know,  the simple laws and stuff like that.  But at the end of the day,  you know, there are certain things that happen in the public interest.  And those things have to be solved at that level.  I mean, you know, they can't be.  They're not things that individuals can solve on their own.  And they're not business.  They're not things that businesses have the right incentive to solve or address.

Start time: 2534.02
End time: 2576.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess the question one should ask, absent government regulation  someday is why is Amazon doing this?  Like, I don't think there's a I don't think people have been pounding  on Jeff Bezos's door saying I need a mailbox sensor.  Why is Amazon doing this now?  I'm going to take a hazard a guess.  You could tell me if I'm wrong.  Amazon is driving a lot of trucks around all the time.  I think Amazon would love this mesh network to locate their deliveries  and to and to this is your I think you're offering your bandwidth  to help Amazon be better in logistics.

Start time: 2577.04
End time: 2593.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're also you're also building their logistics stack.  Yeah. Sorry.  Go ahead, Brian.  And you've got you've got the camera at your front door.  You've got the sensors.  So, like, you know, if the Amazon people delivering to our house now,  you know, you see them take the picture.  Yeah, I love that.

Start time: 2600.04
End time: 2614.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe the this is an honestly.  What's scary about this is this is the best case scenario.  Maybe the best case scenario is that Amazon is convincing all of us  to buy and build out the logistic, the stack that they need  to make their logistics simpler.

Transcript:  They say things in the Amazon blog post like just imagine.  We're going to do a proof of concept with the American Red Cross.  Just imagine if sidewalk could support the tracking of blood collection  supplies between distribution centers and donation sites  to add new efficiencies within the blood donation supply chain.  That sounds like they really had to dig deep to find a public service  use case for this.

Start time: 2645.58
End time: 2651.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2652.58
End time: 2672.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this has more to do with Amazon's logistics, I suspect.  But I also think that there is a larger question of  do we want this private company  to set up a mesh network, kind of ad hoc mesh network over our communities?  Like, is that something a company should really be doing?

Start time: 2674.88
End time: 2725.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, it's sort of it's an ISP question at some level, right?  I mean, should we have publicly funded or publicly created ISPs?  And, you know, the fact that a lot of states are now passing regulation  laws banning municipal ISPs.  That's shocking. That's sad.  Yeah. But you know, you can imagine a city saying, hey,  we're going to set up one of these low bandwidth mesh networks  on public infrastructure.  We're going to cover the entire city and we're going to open it up,  you know, to any provider and we'll charge for access.  And it could be, you know, one or maybe require a lot of upfront investment.  But over the long run, it could be a public benefit for, you know,  the population, but also our potential source of revenue for the city.  And so, you know, these are these are things that, again,  you know, requires people thinking ahead and willing to make the investment.  And that's really tough.  And that's why a lot of this stuff ends up being done by private companies  that have the resources to do it.

This I look at this and I go,  this is this is the camel's nose under the tent.  And nobody's even like it's not nobody's even mentioning it.  Amazon is proposing putting a mesh network over all of our communities  that they will control.  They will reap the data from and decide what the data is.  And they and the and the and the the the offer that they're making is,  well, you know, you'll know if your mailbox has been opened  is so bizarre, your dog will be tracked.  It's so it's so inconsequential.  And nobody's saying.  Golly, this this is an interesting invasion.  That Amazon, you know, a soft invasion that Amazon is perpetrating  and nobody's paying any attention to it.  Or am I my friend Jeff Jarvis on this week in Google  constantly spanks me for moral panic.  So maybe this is moral panic.  I just feel like this is an odd play from Amazon's point of view.

Transcript:  Yeah. And I also think Amazon is taking advantage of a loose  regulatory environment right now.  They've been working on this for a year, but it's time.  I think they wanted to announce this before the election,  because their environment is pretty loose right now.  And you can kind of start this thing ball rolling.  And especially in the fact in light of the fact that they are getting  there, got so much heat for ring.  And then they got heat because they were listening in on echo recordings.  So they were already kind of and then the government's already,  you know, Jeff Bezos got more questions from Congress than anybody  at the antitrust hearings.  I feel like they're saying, you know, you better get this sidewalk

Transcript:  I've I've asked several people over the last year when I've interviewed them.  Doesn't it feel like Amazon has gotten weirdly aggressive lately?  Yes. Like that, like I've asked people like point blank.  Has there been like an executive turnover?  Are there new people in there?  Are there cowboys that came in or something?  But like even Ring was, you know, a reasonable, successful startup.  But it wasn't blowing the doors off anybody.  And ever since Amazon acquired them, like they've become almost the ring company.  Like you never saw Google double down this hard on Nest and things like that.  Like like Amazon has done with Ring.  I feel like half the products they announced were ring related products.  So it's all about to your point.  They seem to see that they're it's the field is wide open to grab the home  and grab the public space in terms of if we're talking about data  and the value of data.  And so maybe you're right.  Maybe they're trying to Indiana Jones style, get get out before the door slams shut.

And they're selling, you know, security cameras for inside  and outside the home for 25 bucks.  They work good enough.  They just introduced a doorbell and they're adding more and more stuff.  I would really love to hear from them about what they think about what Amazon is doing  and and what they think about both the security issues as well as the privacy.

Because at the end of the day, they are a logistics company.  And so this is, you know, there is an opportunity.  And if frankly, you know, if this is going to be something that happens,  it's better from Amazon's perspective for people to standardize around,  you know, sidewalk than if for to be Google or Apple or not.  Many other companies that could pull it off.  But but it's better.  It better for it to be Amazon's mesh network than somebody else's.

So you're right, Peter, that's you know, that's not that much different.  That is that's going to be the let's say it.  That's going to be the next kind of battleground is is meat space.

I want to take a break before we get to the drone,  because I really want to torture Brian.  But I do. I agree.  The drone is the silliest.  But at the same time, the funny thing is my wife says, let's get one.  So I really we got to talk about this because  it's interesting.  Our show today brought to you quite literally by Cashfly.  That's our CDN, our content delivery network.  Cashfly is really is one of the pioneers in this space.  They've been innovating content delivery since the last century.  The turn of the last century, 1999.  We've been using them for more than 10 years.  Remember, when we first started to it, we were begging people to seed  the BitTorrent stream and, you know, we had to web download.  We just then Matt Levine call me from Cashfly said, look, Leo, you need a CDN.  You need Cashfly.  And we have been happy Cashfly customers ever since.  If you if you never complain that it's hard to, you know,  the podcast is slow to download. Thank you, Cashfly.  I never get a three a.m. call saying, oh, my God, the servers are down.  Thank you, Cashfly.  Cashfly also saves us a ton of money.  We'll save you a ton of money with their new storage optimization system.  So the one expense sometimes with the CDN is when you get a cash miss  and you have to load the data from the source, Amazon S3  or wherever you keep your content.  This could be a podcast, could be an application, could be a game,  whatever the data could be streaming video.  Those those cash misses can end up costing you because, of course,  is much more costly to transmit the data across the Internet.  This is what storage optimization system does for you.  Cashfly is a dedicated storage space that's for you,  where you put your data on the Cashfly network.  It will save you potentially thousands a month by shielding your origin.  And with zero cash misses, your download speeds will be drastically improved.  No more buffering video.  And you'll save money on your data transfer out fees  because you're going to have a 100 percent cash hit ratio with Cashfly's SOS.  Once you're a Cashfly customer, just decide how much storage you need.  They'll take care of the rest.  Cashfly is also really improving by adding new.  There are points of presence all over the globe.  That's why we like it, because we have listeners all over the globe.  No matter where you're getting the show, you're getting it from a Cashfly  server geographically proximate to you.  That speeds up the downloads.  It lowers the network traffic.  It's really good all around.  They've just added six new pops in South America.  They actually serving 10 times the amount of traffic in Latin America over the last year.  We love that. We love our Latin American listeners.  Cashfly is not only maintained, but drastically improved the performance  in Latin America and taken on a much higher traffic load.  So that's the beauty of Cashfly.  It doesn't matter where your end users are.  North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific.  Cashfly delivers content quickly and reliably.  And what you would normally think of as hard to reach regions.  They're all local to you.  That's what's great about Cashfly.  Consistency and performance all over the world.  Reliable throughput and scalability five times faster than other CDNs.  And because they have so many servers, they offer a 100% uptime SLA guarantee.  So you get industry leading global performance.  You get a lower price than the other guys.  You get 100% uptime and you don't have these expensive cash misses.  That's going to make a huge difference with video streaming, podcasting, digital downloads.  They ensure cash misses are delivered five times faster than they would be from your origins,  whether it's software delivery or games, video.  Cashfly is also a great company.  They just partnered with World Central Kitchen.  They've donated over $50,000 to help serve 300,000 warm meals to people who are struggling.  These are tough times.  Cashfly is a great partner in the world.  We're really happy to be partnered with Matt and the Cashfly team.  Let Cashfly's SOS save your ship.  Just for Twit listeners, Cashfly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your  current CDN bill and usage trends.  See if you're overpaying by 20% or more by going to twit.cashfly.com.  twit.cashfly.com.  So my wife said no security cameras in the house.  I understand that.  She doesn't want, you know, stray video of her walking around on the Internet somewhere.  She doesn't control it.  I understand that.  So I so when Amazon announced this new Ring camera, I thought she'd say absolutely not.  She says, when are we getting one?  This is nuts. Brian, this is your story.  Tell us about the Ring Always Home Cam.

Start time: 3428.24
End time: 3522.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I actually want one too, because I'm a nerd and it seems really cool.  It is cool.  But yeah, so imagine like a little box and a tiny drone can pop out of it.  And the cameras on the bottom part of it, like the little tail hanging down so that  when it's in its box, the camera's not looking.  But the idea is it syncs to all the other Ring stuff.  And let's say there's a detection of a noise, maybe somebody at the door or a window or  no one should be in that room.  Why is that light on?  The drone pops up and flies over and with its camera investigates.  And I imagine that the use case is you would get a notification on your phone and you  open up the app and you can watch in real time the video, et cetera, et cetera.  So let me give you the first thing that is blowing my mind about this.  And then please, please come back for the second one.  The first thing is that it's going to map your home.  It's going to map the interior space of your home.  And so, you know, by the way, my Roomba does that as well in order to clean floors.  And however, Roomba doesn't also have a side business of selling me things.  And so the first thing is, is we don't know yet because this isn't available.  They just announced it.  It's not 250 bucks.  I don't know what sometime next year, sometime next year.  But crucially, we don't know the terms of service yet.  So are they allowed to do anything with it?  Like if they go by your pantry and they see, you know, what brands, some more Charmin,

Start time: 3523.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  That's right.  So that's number one.  And that gets back to and I'll leave it here so we can come back to number two later.  But that gets back to your conversation about what sort of privacy are you giving up?  What sort of data are you giving up?  Because now they are going inside.  Your home is a castle.  Your hearth, you know, going back to the Magna Carta.  This is where the law can't.

Start time: 3568.28
End time: 3595.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to map your home in order to not run into things.  Yeah. Right.  So at the very least, and then part two will be the law enforcement part of this.  But at the very least, somewhere, you know, on a server somewhere, they will have an  interior map of your home.  And we don't know what they can do with the video of it.  Like, well, they put the couch over here.  They put the what would they do with?  Well, the TV is on in these hours with, you know, Amazon Prime TV.  Well, it doesn't go.

And, you know, they mentioned things like you ever leave the stove on.  You want to know? Ask the drone.  Did I leave the garage door open?  Ask the drone.  Where's the dog right now?  Ask the drone.  Apparently, the drone is very loud.  On purpose. Yeah.  Well, also, because they probably couldn't help it.

Start time: 3624.26
End time: 3631.75

Transcript:  Yeah.  The IEEE spectrum was the most critical of this of all of the stories.  They say why you should be very skeptical of Ring's indoor security drone.  They interviewed among other people.  They interviewed a number of privacy experts, a professor who said,  let me see if I could find it here.  Oh, I just I just went by the the quote that I was going to read to you.  Ryan Kalo is professor at the University of Washington School of Law,  said fixed cameras can be avoided.  Right. There's little light on them.  I see my Nest Cam right there.  It's it's glowing.  Fixed cameras can be avoided.  Mobile ones can't.  Which makes it impossible for a child's spouse or roommate to get away from the camera.

Transcript:  He says the professor says if mobile surveillance  is normalized, my concern is it will permit an abuser to check in on their partner  wherever they are, erase surveillance blind spots  and remove excuses that the surveilled individuals merely off camera.  Surveillance is a well known component of domestic abuse.  Well, that's a very good point.

Start time: 3728.92
End time: 3795.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, let me get to point two real quick, and then I promise I will.  I will shut up. This is your story. You love this story.  I love it. That's good.  Part two is that remember, ring has gotten in trouble or has had controversy  or people haven't liked the fact that they have all these deals  with local law enforcement to share things.  So one would think that when Amazon announces something like this,  that seems a little wacky to people that they would have already thought through.  Oh, will this be included in the video that we will share with our law enforcement  partners? And this is quoting from the Wired piece on this.  Amazon originally said the device would be included  in the hundreds of video sharing partnerships Amazon has with law  enforcement agencies across the US.  The company later sent a correction and said the drone would be ineligible  for this video request feature.  So, OK, aside from the fact that I I don't want law enforcement to be able to act,  I mean, hopefully with a warrant or whatever, but I never want them to be able to give me  launch the drone, tell me where Brian is right now inside his house.  You would think that if they were going to announce something like this,  they would already have their ducks in a row with this very basic question.  And apparently not.

Start time: 3797.56
End time: 3831.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure law enforcement, I mean, I would like this if I could catch a crook and have  good, clear video of the crook in the act.  I mean, the ring doorbell has been used that way many, many times, right?  It's just like having having that everywhere in your house.  Prosecutions that go up. That's a good thing.  So, Peter, could Amazon make this all better with the proper privacy policy and  commitment to enforce it within everything?  All of this that we just talked about, would it all be OK?  I mean, I think part of it is whether people trust Amazon or not.

Start time: 3831.80
End time: 3957.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And, you know, people have, you know, if you have cameras or you have an echo  in your home and you have recordings of your voice, you want to have a feeling that,  you know, random people at Amazon don't want to be able to do that.  Random people at Amazon don't can't look you up and access your, you know, your  private information, your private videos.  It's the same thing with, I think, this partnership with the police, with the ring  videos, you know, your videos aren't being sent automatically to the police.  I kind of was OK with it because you have to give permission to do that.  Yeah. And so, you know, it's not in some respects that much different than, I mean,  we had an incident where somebody stole a car and parked in front of our house and,  you know, the we had reported it and, you know, the detectives like, hey, do you have  any cameras around the house?  And I was like, yeah. And he's like, if you have any videos like of it, I have a video  of someone rolling in and he's like, send that to me.  And I was like, OK, you know, I didn't think that was that big of a deal.  You're a good citizen. Yeah.  And so I didn't help catch the person because it was pretty blurry, but that not withstanding. Right. You know, and so I think that, again, not to go back to this  issue on regulation, but, you know, big companies are in the business of making  money and, you know, they do have to have a certain level of trust if they want to  continue to sell these devices to people.  But at the same time, I think they're not being when there isn't strong regulation  or penalties for them behaving badly sooner or later, there are going to be things that  happen and they need to be able to there needs to be a consequence attached to, you  know, those sorts of privacy violations.  And, you know, you look in, you know, it's not an impossible thing to do.  Certainly the EU, not that their regulation has been perfect, but, you know, they are  holding companies more accountable than we are in the US for gross violations of  privacy. And I think about the stuff that's happened, not just with your video or  audio, but with private data.  I mean, the fact that, you know, what was it?  Was it Experian? Which one had the Equifax?  Equifax. You know, the fact that Equifax is still in business at all is crazy.  And certainly that, you know, much more damaging.  People still trust their information with Equifax.  Well, you don't have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3960.70
End time: 4006.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the fact is that, like, you know, we have a really inconsistent view ourselves of  what is a violation and what isn't.  And, you know, and so, you know, you think about like the potential damages that  happen to a lot of people. Equifax breach actually, you know, has resulted in people's  identities being stolen, you know, things being compromised and not to minimize, you  know, what's going on with Amazon or, you know, with Google or Facebook or any of  these things. But the fact is, you know, the data is being collected.  And if we don't like the risks associated with that, we have to have different  policies. And I know it goes back to what you said earlier, Leo, about the fact that  we don't have a functioning government. But that's on us, right?  I mean, it's our job as citizens to have a government that works, then that works and  solve these problems. I mean, that's the point.  The cynic in me would say that's why big business buys Congress.

I mean, it's it's you know, this stuff is not as simple as  they just have the most money and they get what they want.  I think the fact is and then, you know, it's and I think it, you know, it means that  us as citizens, if we if our only form of expressing our discontent with something is  to not buy something, that's a problem.  Right. Right. We have to have more avenues and more channels for expressing our  discontent and our displeasure with things and that we are aren't just consumers.  We are citizens. And, you know, and I'm I agree.  I just don't want to like throw up our hands and say, well, there's nothing to be  done. They're a big company and it's over.

So we should start thinking about what is what would government do if  we had a functioning government?  How would we get that to happen and how could we make that happen?  I think the first step would probably be to get the money out of politics because.

And again, and people are saying in the chat, you know, like, don't buy Amazon.  Yeah. I mean, if you are uncomfortable, don't buy Amazon.  Like, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  And I think like I don't have a Facebook account.  I've haven't had a Facebook account over 10 years.  And it's because I avidly disagree with the way that they run that business.  And I will say, if anything is history has proven me 100 percent right on on the

On the other hand, I'm thinking if I you know, my mom's 87, I just bought her an  Apple watch because I want the fall detection.  I mean, in effect, she's got a surveillance device on her wrist so that I can keep an  eye on her. And you know what?  I might even put a drone in her house.  There's certainly this is the problem.  There are clear benefits.  You know, every time I watch a crime procedural from more than 10 years ago on TV, I  couldn't happen today because there's cameras everywhere.  There's you can't get away.  Somebody in the chat room said, what would what would happen with OJ these days?  There'd be video footage, everything, you know, you'd be able to piece the whole  thing together. So that's probably good.  But there are societal costs to that.  I think strong privacy policies that are auditable and enforceable might go a long  way towards this. There are definitely moves afoot to get  have people's data somehow be, you know, in a vault that you have control of so  that you share it only when you want to to people who give you the value for the  data that it's worth that kind of thing.  I think there are solutions to this.  But we but unfortunately, the way technology usually works is just a random  walk to the future.  And I think we're right in the middle of that.  That's why I bring these things up.  We're right in the middle of that random walk.

And so it's it's never full time.  And the way the reason for that is then they can cut the class sizes down.  So you're only in a classroom with seven other kids or whatever.  We bought medical grade air purifiers for classrooms.  Yes. We you know, we were trying to do everything.  We're trying like, listen, we're optimistic because it's either  we're going to do nothing or we're going to try to do something.  And look, if I can get two days a week for either of these kids  just to socialize and have a have a first grade.  Oh, it's so good for the first grade class.  Yeah.

Not that I know anything.  All I could say is I haven't got it yet.  Our show today.  You know, as you're stuck at home,  might as well take advantage of that time.  You're sitting in front of the TV.  Sure, you could watch a Desperate Housewives rerun  or you could learn a skill from Masterclass, our sponsor.  I love Masterclass.  I have been a subscriber for years now.  In fact, the funny thing I told my son, who's 26,  I just had just got out of college a few years ago.  I said, good, I'm going to give you a masterclass for graduation.  I'm already.  He does all the cooking stuff.  In fact, I just got a really nice barbecue.  And I was so thrilled to see Aaron Franklin with a masterclass  on barbecue.  Man, I followed his brisket.  You know, it's like there's a ton of videos.  I followed his brisket recipe.  It was the best thing I ever had.  From the point of view of cooking, their masterclass is amazing.  Thomas Keller, Gordon Ramsay, and he won't even yell at you.  Gabriella Camara teaches you how to make homemade tortillas.  Aaron's barbecue.  Massimo teaches Italian cooking.  Wolfgang Puck, Alice Waters.  That's just the cooking section.  But there's much more. Masterclass isn't just cooking.  How about you like theater? You like film?  You like acting?  The arts and entertainment section is mind boggling.  How do they get these  A-list people?  Samuel L. Jackson, Spike Lee.  Learn how to act from Natalie Portman, David Lynch, Martin Scorsese.  And I should point out these classes, it's not just, oh, here's a quick video.  There are many videos.  Scorsese has introduction beginnings, Martin's education,  discovering your process, channeling your influences, developing your style,  directing and technology, finding the story on and on, editing one and two.  There are 30 episodes.  They're all digestible, which is great.  You can watch them at any time on any device.  Masterclass is the way to learn all sorts of things.  Oh, this is new. Neil Gaiman.  Art of storytelling.  No, man, I know what I'm watching tonight.  So if you're tired of the same old, same old, you got to get masterclass.  How about learning from the all six time winner of the World Series of Poker  Champion, the guy who was one more than anybody else, Daniel Negrello.  OK, if you wanted to learn about political strategy,  who better to learn from than David Axelrod and Karl Rove,  Obama's advisor and Bush's advisor.  And what's great is they're sitting next to each other.  There are 24 lessons on campaign strategy,  assessing your candidate, researching your opponent,  fundraising, public appearances.  This you want to know how politics works.  Nobody knows more about politics than Rove and Axelrod together.  Is that hysterical? What a brilliant idea.  Look, all right. I'm sorry.  I just wanted to mention that one because I think it's so cool.  I have an all access pass.  That's what I would recommend, because then you get access to every  single one of these incredible videos.  It's immersive.  You can watch it on your phone, your Apple TV, your web.  Carlos Santana on the art and soul of guitar. Right.  Learn how to learn how to hit aces from Serena Williams.  I wonder if she talks about Ohanian on that.  That'd be kind of fun.  I can go on and on.  Get unlimited access to every master class.  And because you're listening, we're going to get you 15 percent off  an annual membership. It is worth it.  Family and friends.  If you're sitting down in front of the TV, you will find no time better  spent than in a master class. Masterclass.com slash twit to.  That's the special URL to get the 15 percent off.  Masterclass.com slash twit to.  I am ready for a master class in promotional  advertisements. This is what you missed if you missed anything this week on  Twitter. The cat came back.

It's kind of a flashback to the good old days of the space shuttle when they drew  drove the space shuttle to the Science Center through the city.  Look at the size of that thing going down the highways.  People on balconies watching as the space shuttle goes by.  Look at that. Wow.  I don't think I don't think that was very recent, but  I just thought that was pretty cool.  All right.  We should mention Jason Howell was talking about it on all about Android.  Or maybe we were talking about on this week in Google, I guess we were on Wednesday.  We're going to do a little bit of a jiggery jiggering of our shows.  We'll begin early with Windows Weekly at nine a.m.  so that we can by 11 a.m.  Is it 11?  John, do you remember 11 a.m.?  We're going to do the Google announcement that they're going to stream it.  We'll do our usual coverage as we watch the stream.  Remember those days, Peter, when you had to sit and live blog and announcement?  You don't do that anymore, I bet.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they totally. Well, they did.  You know what? They may be gone now.  For a while, there was this boom in live blogging and they had a bunch of platforms.  I bet they're all gone by now.

Start time: 5537.04
End time: 5554.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they are. I think a lot of sites have their own.  They do their own.  I think at one point, there was a plug in for  aim that where you could essentially use it to live blog  and it would send it to certain CMS.  So you could actually do it directly.  You would need the other guy typing it in.

Transcript:  I think some of this went away when companies like Apple, thank God, finally  started live streaming instead of, you know, they put it up on YouTube  so the public could watch. Yeah.  And so we wouldn't have to go to and gadget to see what's going on.  Yeah, there's still some live blog.  Twenty four live blog dot com real time infrastructure for today's newsroom.  So there are still some businesses doing that.  But I think that that's not although, you know what?  Amazon, they didn't stream it.  Had to watch a live blog.  Google will stream on Wednesday.  We'll cover that 11 a.m.  We expect. Well, there's never any mystery with Google.  I don't know what the story is, if they just have no opsec at all  or they don't care.

End time: 5646.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd be getting but not the peak of that was that was the iPhone 4.  Right. Like that was that that was the one where the the the  the demo device leaked and yeah, it was stolen.  That was the stole stolen.

Start time: 5647.04
End time: 5659.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Oh, yeah.  It was left in a bar.  Right. In fact, it was Gizmodo, I believe.  Were you still at Gizmodo when that happened?  No, I long gone.  Was it Brian Lamb who ended up taking it?

Start time: 5660.18

Start time: 5661.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Brian and Jason Chen.  He's done OK since because Brian went off and started Wirecutter. Right. Yep.  Which is now a New York Times property.  And Brian, again, riding off into the sunset on his mega yacht.  So Pixel 5, we'll see.  Does any that was Mike Elgin was asking a good question at promo.  Why bother?  Why does Google even make a phone?  The one rumor I thought was really interesting is that it might not be expensive,  that it might be a six hundred dollar phone, not a thousand dollar phone.  That's what they should be doing. Right.  That's what the Nexus line was.  The whole idea originally of Google making phones  was an inexpensive phone developers could use to test their Android apps on.  And then the public got wind of it.  And it turned out they were the best Android phones out there because they were pure.  So Google, I think, probably said, oh, we can make some money on this.  But in typical Google fashion,  they lost it.  They lost the thread with Google.

Start time: 5720.04
End time: 5731.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they want a pure phone out there?  Wasn't it similar to to Microsoft deciding to finally get into tablets?  But yeah, but do you need where they wanted to say, here's how it's done.  Here's how you. Yes.

Start time: 5732.34
End time: 5773.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. But they don't need that anymore because there's so many companies  that make basically Android phone, even Samsung.  I mean, I'm looking at this, you know, the fold.  It's really pretty much it's got some Samsung in it.  Not got a lot of Samsung in it.  It's pretty much a stock Android device.  Even, you know, the Samsung used to customize the settings like crazy.  They basically gotten much more stock.  And certainly OnePlus and Motorola and many of the other companies  are just making this, you know, they're not customizing it that much,  which is a good thing.  You're more likely to get your updates more quickly.  So then that begs the question, why do we need a new Pixel phone?

Start time: 5773.86
End time: 5816.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always thought that, you know, Google's rationale for doing this  has changed over the years.  But it seems to me like one reason why they continue to do it  is at least to give them the ability to exert some leverage over the OEMs  if they need to.  And whether need to do that wanes and, you know, it ebbs and flows over the  over the years, depending on, you know, at one point,  Samsung was becoming so dominant with Android  that they were worried about having a counterweight to it.  That's right. And Samsung was even talking about forking Android.  And, you know, they had such a large share of the market that  I don't think they would have executed well, but they could have tried to do that.  And so, you know, it seems to me it's like it's a little bit like  don't make us have to make Pixel a big deal.

Start time: 5817.32
End time: 5819.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, is that still the rationale?

Start time: 5820.46
End time: 5833.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. It may still be useful to them to have it  something that they continue to do for that sort of strategic purpose.  They certainly if they wanted it to be something that more people bought,  they would be going about it very differently.

Start time: 5833.84
End time: 5881.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Well, yeah, they'd have more carrier deals for one thing.  Yeah. I have to say not this Samsung fold doesn't have Android 11 on it.  Very few phones do.  So that's one thing Apple, you know, a new version of iOS  comes out like iOS 14 did last week.  And, you know, they get 50 percent adoption within a week.  Everybody jumps on it. And that's good all around.  It's good for security.  It's good for developers because it's they know what people are going to be using.  So maybe that's it.  Maybe they're just trying to say, look, we got to get Android 11 going.  Also, Google arguably does the best cameras out there.  Right. I mean, I think all of the flagship phones now,  iPhone, Samsung have excellent cameras.

Start time: 5882.12
End time: 5912.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I always I always have felt like the pixels are the best Android phones  overall. Yeah.  Samsung has always made the sexiest.  Yes. Yes.  But so maybe, you know, another question, aside from how long will they continue  to do this, because no one ever goes broke betting against Google,  getting bored of something. But  why haven't the pixels taken off more?  Is it just the carrier stuff like they haven't been able to get the deals like Samsung does or?

Start time: 5913.58
End time: 5933.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They certainly do.  They do well with the A versions, right?  The four A's done very well.  The three A did very well.  Those are the phones to get.  They're the less expensive lower end versions of the Pixel phones.  They're more like the old Nexus line.  And they've sold well.  But pixels in general do not sell well.  So I'm sorry, what were you saying, Dwight?

Start time: 5934.82
End time: 5962.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's distribution.  I don't think they just don't get it.  I don't think they're very good at getting the products out there.  They they introduce them.  They're good products.  But in terms of being promoting them and making sure that every carrier has them,  that you know, that all the best sources for getting them have them.  I have heard from a lot of people who say, I'd like to buy a Pixel phone.  How do I do that?  And it's often kind of not.  It's not intuitive for a lot of people.

Start time: 5962.34
End time: 6018.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that that underscores that there are really two markets for Android devices.  There's the enthusiast market.  Those people know how to get a Pixel phone. Right.  But those people also know all the problems the Pixel phones have.  You know, the last two times there have been issues.  And the word goes out very quickly in the enthusiast community.  Then there is the vast majority of Android buyers who are not sophisticated users.  They're buying most of the time, they're buying Android devices  because they're the less expensive phone or the phone they get for free  from their carrier, that kind of thing.  Pixel phones, not even on their radar, they wouldn't, you know,  that's not even they don't even know it exists, probably.  And if they did, they you're right.  They don't know how to get it.  So it doesn't it doesn't work on either for either of the two Android markets.  So it's probably it's probably if they were better at distribution,

Start time: 6019.18
End time: 6057.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if they were better at marketing it, if they if they put it where it needed to be  and had just like, you know, a killer phone.  I mean, I heard some I heard you say, I think that they have  pixels have the best cameras.  I don't think that's true.  I think not anymore.  The last pixel was outdone by the iPhone, particularly with night mode.  And I just think that that they they have a really missed opportunity  because Google is is has its name.  It has one of the biggest websites there is,  but they don't do much there in order to promote.

Start time: 6057.70
End time: 6071.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have ads for the Pixel for sure. Right.  OK. All right.  I'm just wondering.  So maybe we'll see Google.  What we would look for Wednesday is maybe Google announcing carrier partnerships,  because that would be a big deal for Google.

Start time: 6072.34
End time: 6077.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is this is a 5G phone, too.  So yeah, that kind of changes the game a little.

Start time: 6078.60
End time: 6089.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe a little.  Leo, Leo, what was the consensus back to the original question, which was,  is this the last Pixel phone?  What was the consensus on the shows?

Start time: 6089.96
End time: 6101.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody knows, but everybody kind of agreed it should be.  In fact, why?  I don't want it to be.  You do. Do you have a Pixel?  Do you use the Pixel?

Start time: 6103.14
End time: 6107.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6108.14
End time: 6153.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, I think I think part of it is that, you know,  Google is a big company and, you know, they obviously need Android to be successful.  Right. They don't need the Pixel to be successful.  It's not good news.  And it's not. But I mean, I think that, you know, there are things that are  existential or mission critical for big companies and there are things that are not.  And it's not a surprise that things that are not  are not going to get as much support or attention or maybe the best people  internally and not to denigrate anybody who works on the Pixel phone by  by implying that. But you can sometimes tell internally.  You can sometimes tell the CEO's priorities around what they think  is the most important thing for them to be working on.  And I would say that, you know, for Sundar, it's probably not the Pixel phone.  It's probably more around AI more generally and probably like Google  Assistant in terms of consumer facing products.

Start time: 6155.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The information had a story  not so long ago about Rick Osterloh, who's in charge of  hardware at Google  weeks before the launch of the last Pixel, the Pixel 4 saying this battery life is terrible.  Like, Rick, didn't you know you found out just two weeks before the ship date?  And then Mark Lavoie, who was the camera guru, who if Google's cameras were good,  is widely credited with that.  He left, went to Adobe where he's working on, I don't know, software.

Transcript:  There's sunk cost in this one coming out.  And then, you know, also, like you said, it's a 5G launch.  Everyone wants their 5G phones out there.  So, you know, I don't know.

Start time: 6208.76
End time: 6223.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, you know, so that's this a good question for you guys.  Are you are you hearing people, normal people saying, oh, I got to get a 5G phone?  What about you, Dwight?  Do people write to you and say, oh, I need a 5G phone.  What should I get?

Start time: 6225.12
End time: 6317.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was initially, and I think a lot of the reviews of  the networks that have gone live, particularly AT&T, T-Mobile,  where there's only like a 20 percent increase in speeds.  And the really fast speeds  are hard to find for with both AT&T and Verizon.  You know, I did I did a review of AT&T's network when it launched here.  And the only place they have millimeter waves and locations downtown.  One of them is in front of the building where the rockets play.  And and I went out there with the phone.  And when I was sitting in my car on the street next to the building,  I was getting the sub six speeds.  And I walked out and stood in the middle of the of the plaza.  And I got, you know, I was getting like almost a gigabit down.  And but then if I moved like 100 feet away, I got sub six speeds again.  So, you know, the experience right now.  5G has been sold on millimeter wave to the public.  That's where the hype is.  And nobody's and I think that and nobody.  Right. And nobody's getting that.  And I think people are understanding now.  I do think people want it for the future.  I think if you're thinking ahead and if you're an enthusiast  or maybe one step beyond an enthusiast,  where you know, you kind of know what you want.  You want a 5G phone now.  But I think most people are not going, oh, my God, this is a 5G phone.  I got to have it. But in about a year, it's maybe it's going to come.

Start time: 6318.10
End time: 6369.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, this this fold is 5G.  And I put a Verizon sim in it and I got a confusing message,  which I never really understood, but something about your sim needs.  If you're going to get 5G, you're going to need to, I don't know, do something.  But I knew it was nonsense because there's no Verizon 5G anywhere near me.  So because this millimeter wave.  So I just said, yeah, fine, whatever.  So PC Magazine does that annual,  you know, mobile networks testing.  They go to 26 cities.  Sasha Segan does this every year, came out a couple of weeks ago.  He said AT&T's 5G is actually slower than LTE.  Yeah. And then no, you know, 5G isn't is when you can get it.  If you can actually get it is great, but no one's getting it anywhere.  So it's it's kind of a disappointment.

Start time: 6370.28
End time: 6429.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did that story and I said because I've been I've had to do several of those  recently, and the point I've been making is everyone remembers  going to 3G versus edge, you know.  Oh, that was huge. Yeah. Right.  And so everyone has been hearing for however many years that 5G is coming.  So everyone's expecting the same thing, except for the fact that remember,  also, a lot of people never had smartphones before on like we had.  Enthusiasts had smartphones on edge networks and whatever.  So if you remember back like most people's experience of having their first  smartphone and how it changed their lives was having a fast Internet  and having a phone that could handle it.  So I kind of feel like you asked the question originally, are people  waiting for 5G? Yeah.  Yeah, I think that they are because they remember that they either remember  the jump to 3G or they remember that it was around that time  that they got their first smartphone and it changed their lives.  Right. Just not going to do that.

Start time: 6429.58
End time: 6457.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not going to do that.  Here's the the bottom line in the PC magazine.  Here's the quote to make a long story short.  AT&T 5G right now appears to be essentially worthless.  T-Mobile 5G can be a big boost over 4G,  but its speeds are only what we'd expect from a good 4G network.  It isn't a new experience.  Verizon's 5G is often mind blowing, but very difficult to find.  In three blocks in New York City, that's it.

Start time: 6458.54
End time: 6474.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Houston, I've noticed that on the 4G phones I have,  including the 11 Pro Max that I carry every day,  that the 4G network has gotten better because the backhaul  for the entire area has gotten better.

Start time: 6474.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. I got I got 120 megabits down on a 4G smartphone the other day.  And it was just, you know, that was really impressive.  And what was funny, I had a 5G phone with me on the same network.  And like the AT&T example,  it did not do as well as the 4G at that particular moment.

Start time: 6499.22
End time: 6539.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it's kind of because if you get a new phone, it'll be 5G.  But the Pixel 5 will be 5G.  The new iPhone 12 will be 5G.  The Samsung is 5G.  And it's unlike last year when it was a premium priced product  that cost you more because you had to buy a 5G subscription.  It's just it's just more like the evolution from 3G to LTE.  It's just a natural upgrade everybody will get.  But, you know, don't don't hold your breath, kids,  if you're if you're looking for a life changing experience.  I don't think it's going to be that at the same time.  LTE is pretty fast.  It's probably as fast as anybody needs.  Or am I wrong?  Does anybody say, oh, gosh, I need more speed?

Start time: 6539.28

Transcript:  Supposedly, supposedly one of the big deals with  and which is coming with both Sub-6 and MillimeterWave is reduced  latency, low latency.

Start time: 6549.42
End time: 6568.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  The latency, I think, is the bigger issue for a lot of the applications then,  particularly for cars, right?  Well, cars, yes, but I mean, even social applications or gaming,  anything where aiming to the server time is meaningful.  You know, the latency is going to make a big difference.

Start time: 6568.52
End time: 6589.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, that's a very good point, because we are moving  is another big trend, I think, to cloud gaming.  And the idea that you could do  AAA games on a mobile device over a mobile network  is pretty compelling, but it's going to require some low latency  and some decent speed, but mostly low latency for it to work.

Start time: 6590.34
End time: 6605.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that was what all the hype was with 5G all these past few years.  It's like that we'll do cloud gaming, we'll do virtual surgeries,  we'll do your car that'll allow self-driving cars to happen.  But, yeah, I mean, most of the time, though,

Start time: 6605.58
End time: 6608.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and what we're learning is that for the next 18 months or so,  at least in the US, all you're really going to get is faster LTE,  because they're building out the infrastructure.  That's what you get.

Transcript:  Google is also expected to announce a new Chromecast.  Well, we know they will, because Walmart accidentally listed it last week.  So here's the picture from the Walmart listing.  This is saying with Android TV, and it even comes through the remote  with a button for YouTube and Netflix.  So that's interesting.  Android TV has been a laggard for a long time.  I'm a big Android TV fan.  I think I'm the only one.  But that's because I have an Nvidia Shield device, which is a very powerful  speaking of mobile gaming, it plays the GeForce now streaming games.  It's a really nice TV device, but it's over.  It's expensive.  It's as much or more than an Apple TV.  And it doesn't have all the channels because they haven't made deals with HBO  and other, you know, and Comcast and stuff.  So, you know, I kind of limited what I could watch on it.  If it were as if it had all the features of an Apple TV or a Roku, it'd be awesome.  So I'd love to see some support for Android TV going forward.  This might be an important update.  We'll watch we'll watch on on Wednesday with interest.  Speaking of streaming gaming, I mentioned there's a battle going on in Cupertino  with Epic Games and Spotify and Tile.  They have formed the Coalition for App Fairness  to quote fight back against Apple, an independent  nonprofit organization founded by industry leading companies to advocate  for freedom of choice and fair competition across the app ecosystem.  You know, is missing from this list is Microsoft, who actually you could argue  is perhaps the one that will be most disadvantaged from the by Apple's  refusal to put X cloud on there without major modifications.

Transcript:  Well, listen, it's Epic Games, Spotify, Tile.  Those all three have been very vocal for months in complaining.  Tile actually testified in Congress saying we can't compete against  Apple's imaginary air tags base camp.  They're the ones who did.  Hey, the email program that swiftly sank  after a very, very vocal fight against Apple blicks.  Blockchain.  I didn't even know there was a thing called Blockchain.  Deezer, the music company, which, you know, like Spotify is probably  a little scared more by Apple one in the Apple bundle than anything else.  European Publishers Council.  They don't like anything on the Internet.  News Media Europe, Ditto, Proton Mail,  which is an encrypted mail program and Sky Demon.  They're lobbying other developers to join them.  The problem is, these are all these are all people in certain  specific categories are big people, most like onesy twosy developers  are thrilled with Apple. They don't mind the 30 percent tax.  They love it. They can make money on the app platform if they can get their app  through. Is there a problem in the app store?  What do you think, Peter?

Transcript:  I think that the rules that they laid down 10 years ago  with the introduction of the app store were for a different Internet  than we have now.  Certainly, you know, the introduction of cloud services,  the explosion of frankly of like enterprise,  SAS, you know, the new kinds of subscription and  services which are being introduced now.  And I think that, you know, setting aside, let's set aside whether 30 percent  is the fair number or not. I think that's debatable and certainly, you know,  whether or not Apple has a monopoly or not is factors into that.  And that might be a matter of perspective.  But I think that Apple ripping up the rulebook and saying we're going to start  over and sort of try to figure out something that feels coherent now  versus having this sort of exception.  They have like exceptions to the exceptions to the exceptions now.  That sort of govern things. And I think for developers and we invest in a lot of,  you know, people building apps that do have some  product or service of one kind that, you know, Apple takes a 30 percent cut off.  I think it's that, you know, sometimes it doesn't feel fair.  Who, you know, what things are subject to that fee and what things aren't  and that, you know, Apple increasingly sort of twisting itself in knots,  trying to have some coherent articulation of what the policies are.  And so I think they should start over. And I think and I think, frankly,  given how big they are, given how long term and valuable it is and important  for them to have developers on their side, I think it would be in their wild to,  you know, cut the fee or introduce different structures.  I mean, I think that they probably didn't anticipate that there would be  companies like Facebook, Facebook and, you know, TikTok  that would have hundreds of millions of users on their platform.  And essentially, you know, run those businesses for free and not give Apple any,  you know, they don't Facebook doesn't get about 30 percent of ads that are sold  through, you know, their iOS app, Facebook's iOS app.  And so, you know, you can imagine Facebook saying this is great.  But if you're going to have an app with more than a million  monthly active users on our platform or whatever volume,  maybe you have to pay some, you know, fee or something like that.  I'm just, you know, throwing out ideas.  But I think that like they could start over now and sort of say,  given what we have now, the landscape we have now for apps, what would we do?  Because they're constrained by what they decided 10 years ago.

Transcript:  So one of the things that Spotify complained about, everybody,  this this coalition complained about is the side deal at EQ made with Jeff Bezos  for Amazon that allows Amazon to kind of bypass the 30 percent of the store.  And that's a problem because they can.  Everybody points to that, say, see, Apple will make a deal with you,  but not with us.  And that is that is something I would imagine any trust regulators would be interested.  Sorry, Brian, go ahead.

Transcript:  Well, I think the thing it'll be it'll not be epic.  That puts it over the edge, but it will be gaming  because we know that gaming is bigger than Hollywood  in terms of an industry by by multiples at this point.  And no one would ever expect that Netflix would have to pay  per movie or whatever.  I know that there's all these machinations in terms of like the subscription  and like how you go off.  But the idea that everybody in tech and the entire gaming industry,  which is bigger than Hollywood, is moving towards delivering their product digitally.  And Apple wants to step in front of that to 30 percent.  Like, there are ways that that is unsustainable  for all the other people in this huge market and this ecosystem.  Like, Apple's going to have to cut deals because otherwise it's literally going to be  this entire thing that will be the reason that people won't go to.  I can't go to I when I was a kid, I wasn't a Mac user because I couldn't play  PC games on Macs. Right.  And history could repeat itself.  It's going to be this whole move to streaming gaming that is going to,  as Peter says, make them reevaluate.  All right. We have rules in place for a certain period of time,  and they don't fit. Times have changed. Times have changed.

And Apple said, yeah, you can put X cloud on there, but each game has to be a standalone app  so that we can review each game.  It just was these were kooky ideas.  And Microsoft said, we're not going to do that.  And I think, frankly, Epic could have just said they didn't need the lawsuit.  Yeah, go ahead. Ban Fortnite. See how that works out for you.  Microsoft says that G4 says that Sony said all the streaming gaming systems,  because do you guys agree streaming gaming is the future of gaming?

Transcript:  I feel here's OK. I'm a little out on a limb on this,  but I think that streaming everything is the future of computing.  That it just makes more sense to put the computing power,  you know, for the first, you know, 50 years of the evolution of personal computing.  It's been about pushing the computing to the edge.  But I think we're contract.  It's maybe it's like the maybe it's like the expanding contracting universe.  We're now in the contraction phase, where really it makes more sense  to put all the computing power in the server so that you can that you can  just as you can do word processing on any device  and your documents are available on every device.  That's the power of the cloud for productivity.  You could do the same thing with your game.  Then you don't have to buy an expensive PC to game or even an expensive console.  You could do it on your iPad.  That's why I think Apple's missing the boat on this.  This is good for the iPad.  Some say it's because it's anti-competitive because they have arcade  and Apple wants to own the gaming market.  I don't know if Apple's that focused.

And I think that that's going to save Apple TV plus and save arcade,  save news plus all three of which I think are not doing that well  by bundling it in with stuff that is doing well, like Apple Music  and iCloud, which you kind of have to use if you're an Apple user.  I'll end up keeping my Apple TV plus subscription  just because it'll come with the Apple one.

Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, good point.  So what about so we saw this transition from  to streaming from content, right?  Nobody, nobody, nobody owns.  Well, OK, I shouldn't say that.  That sounds way too blanket.  Most people don't buy CDs anymore.  In fact, it's gotten to the point now  where actually more vinyl records will be sold than CDs this year.  That's a story for another time.  Everything streaming.  Why, why even have content on any device?  Shouldn't if you could do if you could do an operating system and apps  and gaming that way, wouldn't people want to do this?  Isn't that five years down the road, that going to be what computing?

Start time: 7269.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the point is, the point is, is that it's not just  whatever the content it is.  The the hardware doesn't matter.  It's what screen is at hand. That's right.  So, you know, my kids don't know the difference between playing on  their the television versus playing on a handheld versus playing on an iPad  versus playing on a phone. Like, it doesn't matter.  The whole point is that computing is the screen is just the portal  and the computing happens elsewhere.

Transcript:  Enthusiasts hate it.  But this is the problem with this show and everything we do.  We're all enthusiasts.  But real people, this is where it's going to go.  Enthusiasts are going to.  They'll still be people building their own gaming PC in the year 2535.  They'll still be people.  If man is still alive, if women can survive,  they'll still be, you know, they'll always be people who are doing that.  There's still people today who have, you know, turntables and giant sandboxes  with, you know, so there's always going to be that enthusiast market.  But I think the mass market is going to move to streaming,  certainly in gaming.  It's happened in productivity.  I read a really interesting piece  on it was on Hacker News on the end of desktop computing,  in which his premise was Microsoft has lost interest in Windows.  This is actually my opinion as well.  It feels like this happening already, because at some point,  the cost of maintaining it's going to exceed the cost,  the value, the benefit, the revenue you make from it.  And so they're they're slowly inserting Linux into Windows.  And at some point, they're just going to stream it.  And and you know what?  At some point, users are going to demand this because every time you install  a Microsoft update now, it breaks a finite percentage of users.  Experience breaks and people are just bitching and moaning about 2004 in Windows.  And I think Microsoft's just at some point going to say, fine, we'll run it.  You stream it.  You'll stream Windows just like you do anything else.  And at some point, it's not even going to matter if you're running Windows.  Microsoft's entire business is moving to cloud to streaming.  That's why they're doing X cloud.  Their money is in Azure.  Azure actually Azure revenues have now actually exceeded that of both  Office and Windows division.

End time: 7447.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Although I got to point out.  By far, Linux is the most popular operating system on Azure, not Windows.  So I and Microsoft's big, the big update with 2004 is to put the WSL,  a Windows subsystem for Linux, so that you have a Microsoft written  Linux kernel running in your Windows machine.  What does that tell you?  I don't know. I just I feel like I know I'm looking at.  I mean, I'm looking at a bizarre streaming future.  I just feel like that's that's where everything's going to go.  So nobody wants to nobody wants to fuss with Windows anymore.  Nobody wants to fuss with an operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's backwards.  I think Apple is I'm thrilled about it as an old time computer user.  But I think it's actually a little bit of a retro thing to do,  because I think the desktop processor is mattering less and less.

Start time: 7476.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I mean, you're essentially your your back is going to become an iPhone.  And and all and and then if you extrapolate out  beyond that, what does that mean for you?

Transcript:  I guess you'll need local computing for machine learning,  especially with Apple, because they're doing everything on device.  On the device. You'll need it for photography.  So you're right.  But actually, you're right.  That makes sense. Apple Silicon, because it's so customizable, can be  it's not an Intel chip.  It's not a desktop class computing chip.  It's whatever it is needed at the moment.  And so it can support the services that you do want to do locally.  And then it'll just be Internet connectivity that matters.  Does it somebody in the chat room says Apple Silicon turns computers into appliances?  Does that sound right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a big question, Leo.  But, you know, we do think a lot about I mean, you know, I'm investing in startups.  Right. And so one of the things we think about is where the startup  opportunity is going to be if, you know, if everything is run on,  you know, from the cloud and it's big companies that dominate  what can be built in the cloud, what the startup opportunity is going to be.  I'm not super cynical and think that it's going to be that there's no opportunities  for smaller players to be able to build things.  But I do think that there are some advantages for people being able to,  you know, locally execute code and the things that you can build.  And I think not necessarily, you know, when it's entirely cloud based system,  you know, the restrictions on what you can do are going to be much stronger.  And certainly like the ability, you know, you talk about having a kill switch  with TikTok earlier.  It's it's much easier to kill something, you know, from  TikTok is just an app that's streaming from right.  You know, the Apple server somewhere.  It's really easy for Apple to switch that off.  And and so, you know, I think that there are a lot of implications for this  that, you know, talking about like unintended consequences, a lot of this  stuff, you know, you're worried about big company, big tech companies having  even more control over the future.  They would want things when everything is streamed off their servers.  And there's really only going to be a handful of companies that can do this.  You know, I mean, there's only really like three companies that can do.  That's the incentive. Yeah, I can do cloud cloud gaming, right?  It's it's Amazon, it's Google and it's Microsoft right now.  Yeah. And it'd be even tougher for Facebook to get into that business right now.  And so, you know, I think that's the advantage.

Start time: 7649.42
End time: 7656.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 7656.66
End time: 7667.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  They have those skills.  I'm just saying it's nontrivial. That's all.  And we've seen, you know, the fact that I mean, Apple has struggled around cloud services.  Right. It's been it took them a while to catch up to everybody else.  And I'd say arguably they're still catching up in a lot of ways.  That's right. And, you know, it's been interesting, you know, to see the alliance,  so to speak, that's developing between Microsoft and Apple when it comes to the cloud.  You know, they are also really well aligned around privacy in a way that,  you know, Apple wouldn't be with, you know, Google or Facebook.  Around the stuff.

Transcript:  So one of the other big stories of the week is app is a Microsoft buying Bethesda,  which is a big game developer for seven and a half billion dollars,  which is, I mean, even for Microsoft, a hefty amount of money.  Bethesda does Doom.  They do fallout.  They do Elder Scrolls and they do.  What else?  There's some of the other big games.  Those are big enough, certainly fallout.  Yeah.  This is a huge play for Microsoft to become big in gaming.  And you really have to ask, why would Microsoft spend more money on Bethesda  than they did on GitHub?  GitHub makes sense for Microsoft, but why?  Why gaming?  And I think that this is more evidence that this is that this is the future,  that this streaming gaming thing, it's not.  I mean, you could say, well, initially it's about Xbox.  They have a new Xbox coming out and they need more exclusive titles.  But I think they have a longer term strategy.

Start time: 7774.60

But going forward, in the same way that you're like, well,  who am I going to subscribe to Netflix or Apple TV Plus?  Or, you know, like it's content.  It's all just content. Right. Yeah. Yeah.  And I came I was I'm feverishly looking for the number.  But like I think that their their internal studios is like now at 30  or something like this.  This jumps them up to the number of gaming studios that they have internally.

Start time: 7805.06
End time: 7817.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody pointed out that is such a big number.  Sony can't couldn't even look at it.  Their revenue doesn't even approximate that.  It's it's it's not it's at a scale that's so even Sony with their PlayStation  cannot contemplate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would say two things about this.  I think one is, you know,  Microsoft is taking a different strategy for this next generation than Sony.  Right. They're focusing on Xbox being something you subscribe  to, like Brian said, and you can consume across lots of different platforms  and not just via streaming.  I mean, you can download games and play them on your Xbox or your PC.  But that's what they're trying to think of.  They're trying to shift it to recurring monthly revenue rather than you buy  a console every, you know, seven years and then you may.  And then they get a cut of some of the the you know, the titles that you buy.  I think the other part, to your point, what you're saying about content,  Leo, is that, you know, they're buying these universes, right?  Yeah. These fictional settings.  And I think that's, you know, what I think the idea that Skyrim  could be a fictional setting that people care about as much as,  you know, Star Wars. I do. Thrones. Yeah.  That is not implausible. No.  And and I think that that and actually I did a something about this.  I'm working on something on the side about these shared creative  universes, about sort of GitHub for fictional settings.  The idea of like, how do you, you know,  create a platforms where people can collaborate together  to create these fictional worlds, not just the the stories themselves,  but the lore and the maps and the genealogies.  There's a term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a theory I can't remember, Peter, in your research,  you probably come across this and I can't remember the term.  It's like metaverse.  But this is the Lucas theory, which is you create a giant universe  with multiple entry points, movies, comic books, action figures,  you name it, and that it all becomes one brand  that is a marketing behemoth, is an economic behemoth.  I can't remember the term for that.  But there's Lucas pioneered it.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's a pair.  It's called Paracosm sometimes. Yeah, that's the word. Yeah.  And that's what I what I might call my project.  But, you know, I think that part of it is that people are going to have  these paracosms or fictional settings or creative universes  that they invest a lot of time in as fans and as co-creators.  And I think that, you know, owning one of them is going to be incredibly valuable.  And I think that the fact that Star Wars was able to transition  from a story to a setting was, you know, why it was.  I mean, it was undervalued.  What was it? Four billion.  It's clearly was worth more than that.  Oh, man. Yeah.  But I think that, like, you know, if you think about where people  are going to spend their time,  you know, consuming content and hanging out with their friends,  it's going to be they might only have like two or three of these  that they care about.  And if you can own one of them and have something that people subscribe to,  you know, to access and participate in,  it's going to be incredibly lucrative going forward.  And I think that I think 10 years from now,  the idea that we may spend a lot of our time,  you know, investing in co-creating some sort of fictional setting,  that does not seem ludicrous at all to me.

There's the Harry Potter universe.  And these are Star Trek.  They've taken a life of their own.  I mean, Harry Potter has gone so far beyond the books and the movies even  and the games.

Transcript:  And if you want to.  So if you are a nation state looking to dominate economically,  looking to become a world power,  what better way than to own a few multiverses,  a few paracosms that are, you know, already in people's heads?  If I could buy QAnon, I would buy it.  That'd be a good thing to own these days.  Let's take a little break.  I'm joking. Joking.  No one can own QAnon.  Our show today is brought to you by Extra Hop, the new IT reality.  We're talking about it, aren't we?  Remote access on a massive scale, rapid cloud and multi cloud adoption,  Internet of Things everywhere.  And you know what? It's all vulnerable to cybercrime.  It's so important that as an organization,  you can see what's going on in your environment  all the way from the cloud of the data center to the customer.  That's that's to scale your business.  It's also to protect your business.  And you need more than just, you know, visibility.  You also need to understand what you're seeing.

It helps you keep your business secure.  SaaS based cloud native network detection and response.  Lots of people use Extra Hop to keep an eye on their network.  Wizards of the Coast, you know, these are the magic, the gathering folks.  They support their AWS cloud with Extra Hop.  We talked to Adam McDaniel, he's their chief architect  and information security officer.  He said, quote, there's no other company that aligns to supporting  our DevOps model, the speed and the lack of friction than Extra Hop.  Ulta Beauty uses Extra Hop to secure their Google Cloud  and keep their networking and security teams closely aligned.  So engineers have more time to focus on innovation.  If you think about Ulta, they have branches, they have stores all over the world.  They've got a huge cloud to monitor with transactions going back and forth.  Senior IT and engineer to Ulta, John Kreese says, before Extra Hop,  we had limited visibility to what was going on in the cloud.  But now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits  and understand how our applications are performing in the cloud.  You need to know what's going on.

They're now seeking to sell themselves less than six months  after launch the two billion dollar play.  I have to admit a little schadenfreude because I look at Hollywood.  I know they're looking at YouTube and say, how can we look at those kids  over there on YouTube and TikTok? How can we get into that?  Oh, yeah. Well, what we need is a Chrissy Teigen as a judge.  That'll do it. And then short seven minute videos and you can turn it sideways.  I don't know what you would be buying if you bought Quibi at this point,  but I can guarantee.

Start time: 8433.06
End time: 8501.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  Tic Tac premium.  So and I've said this before, so apologize if you've heard it before.  But what this really illustrates is the very different models  that Hollywood has versus social media on the Internet.  YouTube and TikTok succeed because they made platforms  where for whatever reason, users just want to put a lot of content on there.  Millions of videos every day just upload, upload.  And then all they had to do, they've got all this content.  And all I have to do is come up with an algorithm  that surfaces the most popular content and profit.  Meanwhile, Hollywood has this completely different model.  You spend all this money up front.  You know that most of the things you develop will be flops.  You hope that one out of ten is a big enough hit to make enough money  to make up for all the other ones.  And then, you know, you put it out there.  And I think we have a winner.  I think we just we just have a winner.  It's pretty clear that YouTube and TikTok and basically social media in general,  it's just a better way of doing it.  And I think Hollywood should just give up.

Transcript:  Well, Quibi has a I mean, it's a scarcity mindset, right?  The problem was that good content was scarce because, you know,

Start time: 8510.86
End time: 8513.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's the ego of saying only I know how to do content.

Start time: 8514.54
End time: 8570.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that they thought there was a gap in the market  that clearly was not there. Right.  Whereas, you know, TikTok, I mean, part of the there's a lot of things  that work really well about TikTok, right.  The algorithm is phenomenal.  And what by dance, you know, brought to bear there with the acquisition of Musically,  you know, musically was not working really before.  I mean, it was sort of working, but applying the by dance  by dances personalization algorithm, you know, supercharge everything.  But the other thing that is underappreciated about TikTok is the tools  make it really, really easy to riff off of other people's work  and to create something and engage in this sort of flow of content.  And I think lowering the bar to participation is something that is, you know,  really meaningful and made a big difference and created this abundance of content  that when you have a good algorithm for servicing the best stuff,  those two things paired together, you know, make something that a lot of people  find very, very compelling.  Quibi, you know, is sort of the inverse of all that.

Transcript:  Good point. In fact, they're doing all right. Right.  Five Republican senators have asked Netflix.  Please don't make a movie out of a Chinese science fiction novel.  What is wrong with these people?  It is, by the way, a fantastic.  I think it's a trilogy, right, John, the three body problem.  We loved it.  Liu Qixin wrote it.  Netflix bought the rights to it.  Senators Kevin Kramer, Marsha Blackburn and others said, we don't we don't like  this guy because he's he's a Chinese he's parroting Chinese Communist Party  propaganda. So you shouldn't make a movie out of it.  Netflix says, you know, there's nothing in here about Uyghur motherhood.  We're going to make the movie.  Now, admittedly, I'm disappointed to know that Liu,  you know, thinks the Chinese are doing the right thing with the Chinese, with the  Muslims. That's clearly not the case.  But I think you can still make the movie because it's a really good book.  Right. We're looking forward to it.  We're looking forward to Foundation.  See how Apple does with that.  That'll be interesting.  So, you're right, there's still there's there's plenty of life left, plenty of  gas left in the Hollywood model.

It feels to me like watching a science fiction movie from the fifties.  I can see the black and white and the dialogue is so like I can't.  I don't know what is I'm trying to get to the ideas that I'm like.  It's similar with doing where it's like I see the ideas.  I see how these tropes generated.

And I had to try all I said, play today's daily, tried all sorts of things.  Finally, I found out if you say latest,  play the latest tech meme right home, you will get the latest one.  So that's a little.

Transcript:  The real riot was the first one that had like a 30 gigabyte hard drive.  But you had this funky thing where it would only play faces.  There was this one song by Faces, which was Rod Stewart's band  called Open to Ideas, which is actually a great song.  But I came to love it  because the real riot would play over and over and over again on any playlist  you made, the very last one would always be open to ideas by the faces.  So there you go.

Transcript:  Software, it's amazing, isn't it?  By the way, I.  I do want to mention that.  Walt Mossberg reviewed the Rio riot in the Wall Street Journal  and said, if I had never seen Apple computers iPod,  I would think the new Rio riot was pretty cool.  So there you go.
