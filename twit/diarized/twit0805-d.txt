Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech, a very difficult week, but we have three really great people who will help us understand everything.  Amy Webb, our futurist, Dan Gilmore, an expert on journalism and media literacy, and from the big technology podcast and newsletter, Alex Kantrowitz.  We're going to talk, of course, about the bands of the president on pretty much every social media network.  Is this the right direction to go? Is big tech too powerful? Who's in charge and why?  We'll talk about something Amy is an expert on, China nationalizing one of its biggest corporations, Alibaba.  And what that really means, we'll celebrate the birthday of Wikipedia and the iPhone.  There's lots to talk about and Twitter is next.

The show we talk about the week's tech news and oh boy, is it's their news.  But I have the perfect panel assembled for this particular wild week.  Let's start with Amy Webb, who is a futurist with the Future Today Institute, author of a number of really good books about big tech.  Amy Webb dot I.O. and Amy, I have my Future Today Magic 8 Ball with me in case we need it.  If it should if it should come up.  You did a great calendar and I forgot to bring it in, but it's beautiful for twenty twenty one.  You hired twelve different illustrators to talk about trends, future trends and illustrate them.  And it's really beautiful. I just really love it. Is that available somewhere?

Start time: 202.12
End time: 245.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's yeah, most of our stuff is free. So we made a speculative travel calendar.  So it's a speculative design futures project every month is a different country.  So it looks like an old school, beautiful 1950s travel poster collection.  But if you look closely, every single month tells us something about technology, biology, things about the future.  And it starts January as a trip to nowhere because airlines airlines are now flying trips to nowhere for wealthy people.  Anyhow, so it's all available on our Future Today Institute website.  You can download the whole thing, all the travel posters, the cool.

Transcript:  That's really cool. Future Today Institute dot com.  Also want to welcome back. It's been a long time, but I still consider him one of the premier experts on media today.  Dan Gilmore, longtime reporter at the Mercury News, who's now kind of focused on media literacy.  Hi, Dan. It's great to see you again.  Fine to be back. Yeah, it has been a long time.  It's been too long. And I apologize. But I'm thrilled to have you on.  And again, perfect, perfect timing.  And we also want to welcome some of the brand new longtime tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz,  who now is doing his own thing on Substack, BigTechnology.substack.com.  It's also the Big Technology podcast. It is great to meet you, Alex.  I've seen you many times on Tech News Weekly. I'm so glad we could get you on Twitter as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo. Yeah, it's a thrill here.  And when I was starting out to do my own thing, I was trying to learn the best.  And I read one of the formative documents for me was reading your guide on how to build a successful podcast.  And I really kept that in mind. And so I appreciate your advice there.  And it's a thrill to be on with you right now.

Start time: 319.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of you. And you'll really appreciate it.  I'm on the way on that front.  It turns out pretty easy. No, it's just been it's been it's not failing,  but it's been a tough year thanks to COVID and advertisers being very I don't think it's just COVID.  In fact, I've noticed as the year went on that they got more and more nervous about the future.  And while I don't think stopping advertising is probably the best way to to face the future,  I understand budgets are tight and a lot of businesses are going, yeah, where can we where can we cut?  And the first thing you cut the first thing you cut is a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, and I know that that's right.  And we did. Fortunately, we do have a number of a number of very loyal advertisers who feel the same way.  Thank you. We're glad we're glad that we can we can still do this show.  I do not you know, I'm just going to say a caveat up front.  While we occasionally get political on all of our shows, we're not here to be political.  We're not here to flog a political viewpoint.  But more and more recently over the last five years, for sure, there's been an intersection between politics and technology.  And it's hard to avoid that, especially because this was the week that the president of the United States got himself banned on Twitter,  Facebook, Spotify, YouTube, even Pinterest and TikTok for inflammatory comments.  And I guess I guess the first thing I would like to ask all three of you, I mean,  I think that there's probably no question that when anybody president or not says things that incite violence and really cause problems,  that it's not unreasonable to censure them in some way.  And Twitter's done that with with warning messages and now completely banning the president.  But it also raises in some people's minds the specter of big tech suddenly weighing in on political issues.  And and it really brings home the power big tech has.  We saw stories that the president's people, press people were casting around, where can we put his videos?  We don't there's nowhere we could put his videos.  And maybe they were looking perhaps at conservative alternatives like Gab and Parler.  But even those alternatives are slowly being shut down.  Both Gab and Parler were under threat.  Parler ended up being pulled from the Google App Store first and then later from the Apple App Store,  which, by the way, caused it to be the number one app as hundreds of thousands of people downloaded it quickly before it got banned.  And now the latest is at midnight tonight, Pacific Time, Amazon Web Services says we're going to pull Parler down because they're not there's too many  posts like the one that says, let's all kill the vice president.  We don't feel right serving that.  So let me start with you, Alex, because you cover big technology.  This is something big technology has resisted.  But all the resistance was over after after Wednesday.  What's your take on that?

Start time: 543.60
End time: 653.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look, there's a reason why they resisted this.  They knew that if they were going to make this move, they were going to form a good amount of antitrust sentiment in the House and the Senate in a way that they  hadn't previously. And they were already on the hot seat, you know, for for being mildly interventionist, not taking action like removing the president's Twitter account.  And I think what they're looking at right now is something pretty serious for their business, which is that you have the House Democrats and the Senate who  basically got turned on to antitrust after the 2016 election, where they felt that big tech had too much power and blamed it for the election of Donald Trump and had taken antitrust  investigations against big tech very seriously.  I mean, really looking deeply into this stuff and getting further than Congress had ever gotten before.  So you already had that brewing with congressional Democrats.  Now you're going to have them joined with a group of Republicans who are furious over what's happened.  And they knew that this would happen.  And that's why they resisted it.  That's why you saw moments where Trump would say, you know, when the looting starts, the shooting starts or any other form of, you know, attempts to delegitimize the 2020 election.  They let that slide. It was only until this moment where they realized it would be basically impossible for them to face their employees and to face their board if they allowed him to stay on.  They waited until this moment.  So it was almost as if their hand was forced at the very last minute here.  They obviously took action to ban him.  Facebook might let him back on.  But I think ultimately what the result of this is, is a very strong bipartisan push for serious new antitrust legislation that's going to come for these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't think anybody disputes that if somebody is advocating violence, particularly the violent takeover of Congress, that that's something that should not be permitted on these things, right?  Dan, I mean, this is very challenging.  Mike Masnick wrote a really interesting piece, his headline, Not Easy, Not Unreasonable, Not Censorship, the decision to ban Trump from Twitter, which, you know, the problem is the goalposts are  constantly moving.

Start time: 685.84
End time: 799.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Twitter had for a long time what we might call the presidential exception to the rules.  Basically, he's the president, so we're going to let him break the rules.  It's not unreasonable.  And I, you can make a case.  And I had been assuming that on January 20th, we were going to learn about a new ex presidential exception.  But Twitter, for its own reasons and their private company, they can do what they want.  That is to say they're not the government.  And it's certainly justifiable on many grounds that they said enough is enough and stopped it.  The issue and what Alex was talking about is really relevant.  This is my question.  And while I certainly agree that the companies have the right to edit, to manage their spaces any way they want, the question I have is, do we really want a small number of giant enterprises to decide what is allowed in the way of speech in the United States, in the giant public square we call the internet?  And they do more than not make those decisions.  I worry a lot about the consequences of the brigade of do something people who have been screaming at platforms to do something about all this.  And when they get their way, they may long in the long run wonder why they wanted quite that much intervention.  We're not thinking this stuff through, and I'm quite worried about it.

End time: 852.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, look, it's not as if the president of the United States doesn't have... it's a bully pulpit, as Teddy Roosevelt said.  He has plenty of ways he can express his opinion.  There's a lot of conservative talk radio, there are conservative television networks.  There are plenty of places he can tell the world what he thinks.  I had mixed feelings too, because at least when he's tweeting, that gives you some insight into what his thinking is and what he's planning and what he's up to.  In some ways, going dark on the president at this point is a scary thought, not a reassuring thought.  And yet at the same time, I think it's completely reasonable if you're a social network to say, yeah, but you can't incite...  There are certain things even the president can't do, and the violent overthrow of the American government is definitely in that category.  Amy, what do you think?

Start time: 854.18
End time: 855.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a lot of thoughts.

Start time: 856.56
End time: 858.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you do. We all do, obviously.

Start time: 858.96
End time: 1140.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. Let me start, because I think disclosures, in my case, are important.  By saying I am politically independent, we do quite a bit of work with different federal government agencies and with the military.  And obviously with lots of other different companies.  So with that being said, Alex mentioned the antitrust enthusiasm in the wake of the 2016 elections, and it actually predates that.  So Elizabeth Warren and some others have been charging now for years that our big tech companies have amassed a considerable amount of power and wield tremendous influence.  If this was an ecosystem in the natural world, we would relate the big tech companies to a keystone species, meaning that these companies have outsized influence now.  The places in which they operate and the things that they do have serious consequences and reverberations.  So as I see it, we have three core problems related to what happened last week, and they're all tech related.  So the first core problem, Dan mentioned we've got a relatively small group of people who are making decisions for all of us.  And that is true.  That group of people is based in the Valley.  We also have a small group of people in Washington, D.C., making decisions that impact all of us.  And that's the Supreme Court.  There's a tension inherent between the decisions that are being made in response to the evolving nature of our technology, speech and society by the technology companies and the static laws of the United States.  Laws that are not intended to change.  There's this tension between the two.  And resolving that tension, I think, is not just critical to get through where we are right now, but it's going to have to be the cornerstone of how law evolves over the next couple of years.  Because if that doesn't happen, then the mechanisms by which we make a lot of decisions no longer make sense.  So part of what's happening right now is an indiscriminate use of terms of service.  The big long post that Zuckerberg relayed, the letter from Twitter, what they are doing is trying to make legalistic arguments having to do with the terms of service.  And the problem is that there was a study from Carnegie Mellon a couple of years ago showing that if we stopped to read all of the terms of service that are presented to us, it would take 76 work days.  So eight hours a day or 15 work weeks because the median length of privacy policies is around 2500 words.  Now, if you assume that you are reading the TOS and you're thinking about what you are agreeing to, you could even go further and show that in terms of work lost in exchange for us reading all of these terms of service, it's like hundreds of billions of dollars.  And my point is that tech companies are making up the interpretations of these terms of service as they go along, which is in conflict with the laws that they are intended to respond to.  So, you know, indiscriminate application of terms of service to some extent is how we got to now.  And ultimately, that's what took some of these key figures off of the networks.  But in some way, they don't matter because it's not just Trump who is the problem here.  It's algorithmic determinism.  It's the systems that are designed to pull content, not just from him, but now from all of these other places.  So Trump may be gone and AWS may have taken Parler offline.  But the problem is the infrastructure supporting all of this.  And I will say one last thing, and that has to do with world building, because all of this reached a sort of fever pitch in the past couple of days.  And again, I say this as somebody who's politically independent, this the people surrounding Donald Trump have done a masterful job of world building.  They created something called Antifa.  They created something called QAnon, which may have been bubbling up here and there, you know, may have had little fits and spurts.

Start time: 1141.00
End time: 1143.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But certainly if they didn't create it, they certainly fostered it.

Start time: 1145.84
End time: 1155.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These this Antifa, first of all, it makes me crazy that that the way that it's being pronounced is Antifa.  There is no long e sound in the word Antifa.

Start time: 1156.10
End time: 1162.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever. The point is that it's short for anti-fascist Antifa.

Start time: 1162.82
End time: 1163.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And whatever.

Start time: 1164.14
End time: 1166.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't matter. It's made up anyway.

Start time: 1166.40
End time: 1203.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's here's why it does matter, because I was at the State Department in 2012 through 2016, as were others talking about intentional misinformation and how this has significant next order outcomes.  And it would be good to red team some of this in advance to think these things through.  And it just didn't happen.  So we really have to think hard because it just taking some of these people offline and taking Parler and Gab out of the Play Store.  There are mirror sites already.  Like somebody created a mirror site of a subreddit that it got and take down.  But this this doesn't.

Start time: 1203.62
End time: 1206.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's virtually impossible to eliminate this stuff.

Start time: 1206.26
End time: 1245.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. That's right.  So we have three core problems that are unfortunately, from my vantage point, not going away.  And the compounding effect here is that we've got a transition of power.  It's cold in a lot of places where Americans live and we have no holidays to look forward to.  January's always sucks.  So, I mean, but this tells us and we've got covid that's, you know, so so we have to really think through not just what happened last week in a vacuum, but also how does, you know, the the mechanisms that we have to deal with some of this  no longer make sense is the challenge.

Start time: 1246.16
End time: 1304.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, despite all the rules of engagement in the terms of service, it it doesn't seem to be enforced equitably across the board.  We all have experience of Twitter being used for blatantly illegal threats and so forth.  And it's very difficult to get those taken down if if at all.  So it almost feels like it's it's the rules are applied.  And this is what was Mike Masnick's point.  They're applied completely ad hoc at will.  And in a way, that's more scary because it's it's it's Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and and they're all who are deciding things that are pretty important.  And yet I don't know of any other mechanism to do this.  Stan, is you focus on media literacy?  Is that a solution?  Is is sometimes people say, well, you can't blame the platforms, blame the people using them.

Start time: 1305.54
End time: 1420.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me let me start off by a disclosure or two on my own.  I'm I have been vehemently worried about Trump since before he was president and loudly and publicly warning about the danger that I thought he represented to the republic.  And secondly, the work that we're doing at Arizona State University News Collab, which is the thing I work on, has gotten some funding from  social media companies like Facebook.  We do. We are involved in a Defense Department project and some other things.  So my disclosures are all on my website and I welcome people to look at that.  If we if we think about it again, from the notion that these this sort of adhocracy of response to these problems that are coming up,  it's exactly right. Mike Masnick, whose tech dirt site is must read from my perspective.  He's correct. That's basically companies wait for a big enough, loud enough, public enough problem and then do something about that because it's impossible to moderate at scale.  It can't be done. There is literally no way to do it except through bad AI that doesn't work well.  It's incredibly hard. Right.  So it is natural that they're going to wait for the biggest problem to show up and then do something about that.  And meanwhile, a lot of things that are much worse don't get noticed except by the people who become the victims of those.

End time: 1482.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still, it's so and Facebook.  But what I'm I'm I'm as worried about rules that would basically drive out almost everything that's interesting as well as the bad stuff.  And we've got to be cautious about how we try to attack this.  And by the way, no one's mentioned the role, the pernicious role of big journalism, as I call it, which does not just include the right wing networks like Fox and others.  But keep in mind, for years until quite recently, our biggest journalism organizations happily parroted what serial liars were telling them every day and occasionally say, by the way, that's not true.

Start time: 1482.16

Start time: 1487.66
End time: 1546.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's part of it.  I think I think there's also journalistic norms, which are clearly out of date when one side of a it's not a debate.  It's you know, there's something that's real and something that's not.  But when when party and power says the sky is green, there's no journalistic obligation to publish that or to broadcast that.  And yet the norms of journalism were hacked against the republic.  And there's very good data now from a Harvard study and from a Cornell study that strongly suggests that more the public got more misinformation via regular television than it did from the social network.  Absolutely.  In in the last year or so, that's not it's not conclusive data, but it's pretty persuasive to me.

Start time: 1547.50
End time: 1625.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you lump it all together into one kind of modern and I think you could say social media is and mainstream media.  There's this it's a modern condition of just kind of a barrage of material factual and nonfactual that makes it almost impossible to have any reasonable discourse, even among people who disagree.  When the Wall Street Journal's editorial board says Trump should resign, the immediate interpretation is that, well, Rupert Murdoch has turned against him.  I mean, he wields a lot of power as probably as much as Twitter and Facebook does.  Kevin Roos writing in the New York Times in pulling Trump's megaphone, Twitter shows where power now lies.  And I think that's to me, that's that's really where the tech conversation goes is when you talk about big tech, Alex, what is the context?  Are you saying what is your feeling?  Is there are they too powerful?  There's certainly you could point to a lot of good that has come from big tech.  I don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water.  Or should we?  Yeah.  What do you do?

Start time: 1625.36
End time: 1695.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can we?  I mean, that's the question that we're going to be focusing on, at least for the next two years and probably longer, given that the antitrust cases are now underway against Facebook and Google at the FTC and Department of Justice.  And believe me, after this week, Apple and Amazon are definitely on their way for cases of their own.  Yeah.  So look, I don't view it.  These are tough questions without simple answers.  Are they too powerful?  Yes, no doubt about it.  These are enormous companies.  I mean, if you think about it, as we've been through this pandemic, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft have made up at times 25% or more of the S&P 500.  That's supposed to be a long, you know, a very diverse portfolio of the companies that really make up the American economy.  So what does it mean when there are five companies that end up taking up a quarter of that space?  It means that the government can't let them fail in certain ways, because if these companies were to, you know, seriously decline, then you could end up taking a chunk out of the market.  So it means that even when there is accountability, it has to be done with a scalpel, right?  It can't be done with a sledgehammer.

Start time: 1695.84
End time: 1711.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my problem.  I don't know where there is a solution for this.  Amy wrote the book The Big Nine, which includes, besides those five, Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba.  How has that changed, by the way, China's censorship of Alibaba?

Start time: 1711.72
End time: 1737.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is, I got to tell you, I mean, as disastrous as what we saw in the Capitol last week, the news story that really went under, reported and unnoticed was China's provocative move just after Christmas  to nationalize Alibaba.  For those of you not familiar with Alibaba, it's an enormous conglomerate on par with Amazon in many ways.  But let me give you a quick...

Start time: 1752.23
End time: 1807.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So this is...  And this was the beginning of the catastrophic scenario that I wrote about in The Big Nine and that it turns my stomach to see we are inching closer to every day.  But here's a really interesting insight into Alibaba.  So just before Double Eleven, which is singles day, so November 11th every year, big shopping holiday across China, it's a sort of national holiday.  It's also a time when Alibaba rolls out some of its new AI.  Last year, Alibaba, some of the new AI systems were using a new, much more sophisticated type of predictive analytics to understand in advance,  not just based on prior shopping habits, but all types of other data sources which are now being collected by a panopticon, as well as behavioral data.  All of those data were collected to try to predict in advance what people would shop for on that day.

Start time: 1808.82
End time: 1813.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember reading that story as like a human interest story. Isn't that cool? Isn't that interesting?

Start time: 1813.86
End time: 1863.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's really not though.  No.  They were able to predict with 80% accuracy, 500,000 people's orders.  They pre-packed those boxes and got them ready for shipment.  So from an e-commerce point of view, like what a win.  But think if you stop for a moment and ask yourself what it took to make that happen.  And now that this is no longer in as much as it was an independent company because it was domiciled in China,  the fact that this is now nationalized should be, it should send shivers up your spine.  And now let's go one step further and say, what if Parler instead of if Azure and Google and Amazon won't allow it to happen, what if it went over to Olly Cloud?  Oh, wow.  What happens if China hosted Parler?  It would be a...

Start time: 1864.06
End time: 1867.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or the Russian equivalent, which I'm sure exists.  Yeah.

Start time: 1868.02
End time: 1901.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  China would be a more realistic equivalent.  But here's the interesting thing.  Like it would be a provocation, but it's not exactly a digital act of war.  I mean, it is totally plausible that all of these sites and people that are getting kicked off of our networks wind up on a Chinese network, which we would be able to access.  And then think of the data stores.  There's something called CIFIUS.  But if you're using that, that would prevent something like that in the US.  The Committee for Foreign Investment in the US.

Transcript:  This was not Jack Ma doing anything.  This is so much like our big tech make up a disproportionate part of the SNMP in the United States.  The economic prowess of not just Alibaba, but again, this is a huge ecosystem.  So there's something called Ant Financial.  There's many other companies within that umbrella that wield so much economic power that in some ways, they are a threat to the CCP, to the Chinese government.  So I don't think this was like Jack Ma ticked off Xi Jinping.  I think this was a response to the enormous power that Alibaba on its own can wield and the sensitive and hyper advanced computer vision,  AI systems that are under its purview, made it a target for the Chinese government.

And you have what happened in China.  And now you look at Facebook and Twitter, for instance, and Google and Amazon shutting down the president's account or pulling the ability for sites that are populated by his supporters to sustain themselves.  And you start to look at it as we've we're still kind of young in the Internet age.  I mean, it's a very small sliver of human history.  And we're already at the point where there's now this unbelievable tension between these big companies and the government.  I mean, it's a fascinating thing.  And this is definitely I mean, we're probably just at the beginning of the push and pull between governments and companies, nowhere near the end.

Transcript:  The problem I have and I want it, we're going to take a break.  So I'm going to give you all a minute or two to come up with a solution, because that's the problem I have.  You split up Facebook, you just create more Facebook's.  You don't it's like it's like Hydra, you're not solving the problem, you're multiplying the problem.  You can't force them to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.  And even if you did, what does that accomplish?  Well, it's almost for me and we spent all we've been for the last at least two years.  This has been one of the big conversations, Amy, you know, we we've had this conversation many times on many of our shows.  But for me, that's the most intractable problem is what is the solution.  So I'll give each of you a little time to think of how you would solve this and if there is a solution, because I'm baffled.  We'll talk about it when we come back.  We have a great panel for maybe one of the most momentous weeks for Big Tech ever.  Amy Webb is here from the Future Today Institute and again, highly recommend her book on the Big Nine, which includes the five American companies,  but Tencent and Alibaba and Baidu as well.  And it's very timely. Alex Kantrowitz is here.  His podcast is called Big Tech, Big Technology and his newsletters at bigtechnology.substack.com and media specialist Dan Gilmore.  It's been a long time. I'm so glad to have you back.  Three big minds. Maybe we can come up with an answer that this little mind has time figuring out.  Our show today brought to you by Barracuda.  You know the name if you know security.  Barracuda is a provider of cloud enabled enterprise grade security solutions to protect you, your email, your networks, your data, your applications.  Let's just think about email for a second.  Ninety one percent of all cyber attacks start in an email.  I'm reminded of the the big aluminum company, Norsk Hydro, which got an innocent email from one of its customers in Italy with an attachment.  The attachment when the customer sent it was benign, but email hijacking meant that the bad guys were able to replace that attachment with malware.  An executive at Norsk Hydro opened it.  All of their operations were shut down for weeks due to ransomware.  That's one email. One bad attachment.  An email you expected with an attachment you expected from a customer you knew.  And imagine now you have all your employees are out there.  They're working from home.  Every one of them gets email hundreds every day.  Laden with spear phishing, ransomware, account takeover, conversation hijacking.  One click is all it takes to cost you money, customers to cost you your reputation.  I think I've probably convinced you to do something about this.  The researchers at Barracuda have noticed a spike of six hundred sixty seven percent in coronavirus related spear phishing attacks.  They impersonate the World Health Organization, the CDC.  They use domain spoofing.  They'll promise employees information relating to covid-19, maybe our new company policy.  Open this PDF.  And of course, it's a phishing scam.  You need Barracuda total email protection.  It includes all in one email security.  You also get backup and archiving, something you need in a lot of businesses by law.  You get AI based protection from spear phishing, account takeover and business email compromise.  Why AI based?  Because hackers don't sit still.  These attacks evolve, they modify, they're constantly changing.  And so your protection has to be smart enough to update itself all the time to notice if  something seems suspicious.  They've got a great automated incidence response system.  And that's important because, of course, the faster you respond to these attacks, the better  able to stop them.  You are.  You get security awareness training so your workforce, your employees, your front line  can be your first line of defense against attacks.  I've got a deal for you.  To uncover the threats hiding in your inbox, you can get a secure free email threat scan  of your Office 365 account, completely risk free at barracuda.com slash twit, B-A-R-R-A,  C-U-D-A like the fish with the pointy teeth, barracuda.com slash twit.  Uncover the threats hiding in your inbox.  A free threat scan.  I know probably there's some of you saying, I don't want to know.  But trust me, you need to know.  Barracuda, your journey secured.  Unfortunately, they have a good solution if you do find anything nefarious in there.  Barracuda.  Thank you, Barracuda, for your support of this week in tech.  And thank you, dear listener, for using that address that lets them know you heard it here,  barracuda.com slash twit.  All right.  Is this crazy, Amy, for me to say what's the solution?  Is that reductionist?  It's not.

Transcript:  I should have been paying attention to Barracuda, but instead I was thinking through.  No, no, that's fine.  That was your job.  That was your assignment.  All right.  What do we do?  So, right.  Typically, you know, when we wind up in these complex situations that are multivariate,  that roll out in different ways into the future, we look for a historic analog of some kind.  And I was just trying to think of one.  I've been trying to think of one.  And I keep coming back to the same answer.  That's part of the problem.

Transcript:  So, I mean, he owned because of his shares.  He has a lot of say.  But this is not just about people and entities.  If it was a people and entity problem, it would be an easier problem to solve.  This is people, entities and code.  So the challenge, at least Twitter is a different situation, but there's a lot of Frankenstein  code floating around Facebook.  And I've had a lot of conversations with folks there about creating different hierarchies  and taxonomies and de-prioritizing things.  And I think the bottom line is when I hear like, yes, yes, we've thought about that,  but we really don't know how to adjust the products.  I think that they're probably right.  I think they probably do not know.  I'm sure that there are billions of lines of code at this point.

Transcript:  I think we can stipulate that there's no technological solution Facebook could employ.

Start time: 2487.42
End time: 2676.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there could be.  Really?  So one of the things that I think that the solution going forward, there's nothing is  immediate.  So any true immediate near term action, I think, is going to lead to any action taken.  There has to be action taken by the technology companies because this reached fever pitch  and because they're facing after January 20th, significant action.  The problem is to take those actions is going to further upset a lot of the people who are  currently angry and they're going to find other places where that anger foments and  it leads to additional problems.  So at the moment, I think the red team response is not a tech one.  I think it's an actual security apparatus one for the next couple of months.  But then what do we do?  I keep coming back to infrastructure.  In the book, in the Big Nine, I make a pretty clear argument for why AI needs to be thought  of as a public good.  I've been having conversations with people about how we could treat our transmission.  So is there a way to create an open source architecture upon which some of these websites  would sit using immutable records?  So that at least there was some additional control beyond Facebook, Supreme Court, whatever  it's called, and beyond Jack deciding finally today to make a difference, that the social  networks would have shared infrastructure.  That's obviously a longer play.  I think Tim Berners-Lee is working on something that's decentralized.  I keep coming to that point and then I remember actually decentralization is potentially worse.  Let a million flowers bloom.  So that leads me to my...  I work on really long-term systems level change and nothing changes until we depoliticize  tech and do that intentionally.  So last October, I was at the Senate talking about a new policy, a national strategic foresight  office.  We do not do long-term plans in the United States.  So I've been working really hard for two years to get that up and running.  The challenge is that the laws that people are using to support everything that's misinformation,  bad photos, bad stuff that's being sent, they're using the First Amendment.  And the problem is that the First Amendment was written in the days before there...  I mean, I guess there technically was an algorithm, but it hadn't been operationalized and productized  on the internet yet.  So that's the problem.  That's a problem that's going to take much longer to solve, longer than the hours and  weeks we have ahead of what might be another violent attack.

Transcript:  I'm very concerned about January 20th.  I think the only...  Well, basically Washington, DC is going to be a battleground and you're going to have  troops.  I mean, I'm just terrified.  And I think not only is there going to be violence, I think there's going to be deaths.  I'm very scared about what's going to happen in a week.  But that's another topic that also has no obvious and easy solution.  What about the free speech solution?  The only solution to bad speech is more free speech.  Dan, is that reasonable?  More speech?

Start time: 2716.64
End time: 2826.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like all simple solutions, it's incomplete and sometimes wrong.  I do tend to be a free speech First Amendment absolutist.  I do think that we...  To address your original question, what do we do?  I don't think there's anything wrong with breaking up to, in whatever way possible,  the power of the companies that now dominate everything.  And yes, that would probably create lots of spin-offs, which are already starting to happen  because of the actions that the big companies are taking as we speak.  I think that's okay, that there's going to be a thousand flowers blooming.  It doesn't mean that I'm happy about the fact that there will be more and more individual  spaces for bad people to gather and plan and do things.  But we have to decide whether we believe at some fundamental level in free speech that's  loathsome, but not at the point where it's advocating the overthrow of governments in  ways where people are actually plotting to do things and saying, let's go and kill these  people.  I think anybody would agree that's too far.  But prior restraint is something that just doesn't have a place in this country.  We should keep that in mind.  I think re-decentralization is a great idea.

I think that there's, and I've been in touch with these people for years, there's a, in  whole places around the valley, Silicon Valley, people are working on re-decentralizing technologies  and doing some fabulous stuff.  Mostly young people say this is crazy, the system that exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the longest of long-term plays because Facebook's so entrenched.  But the notion that we further entrench them by making laws that make them the default  everything is, that's even worse from my point of view.  And I wanted to say that I do think re-decentralizing is a fine idea.  It's hard, but people are working on it.  The final, one of the fixes is that we have to stop obsessing solely about the supply,  bad as it may be, of information and the inundation of bad stuff.  And we have to not just upgrade the information supply, but we have to upgrade us, the demand.  We have to do better at that and that, you know, I would say that because that's what  I work on.  I think there's not nearly enough attention being paid to that side of it.

Transcript:  Do you think it's possible that people could be taught better content, moderation, literacy?  Obviously you do, that's what you're pursuing.  I just, I fear that human nature is such that we really look for things that confirm our  beliefs.  And that's the problem I feel with tools like Facebook is they foster that.  They make it very easy for you to create a bubble that's sympathetic to your beliefs  and that's that.

Transcript:  So I want to make the conditions for competition better.  That's what I want there to be more competition.  Breaking up the companies is very hard, maybe impossible, but create conditions under which  more competition is possible and that may include restricting a lot of what current  winners are doing.  It's very hard, but we have to have more competition from my perspective or we have no chance in  solving this.

Start time: 3015.92
End time: 3043.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does, though.  There's the problem is the network effect.  We have tried federation, we use a federated Twitter called Mastodon, but because nobody's  on it, nobody uses it.  And so you could create a thousand Facebooks, but there needs to be, but if all your friends  are on Facebook 222, that's the one you're going to use.  I feel like the network effect is working against decentralization.  Amy, go ahead.

Start time: 3044.94
End time: 3247.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So right.  I think that decentralization is somewhat of an inevitability, but not for many, many  tiny communities.  Otherwise, Keybase would be bigger than it is right now.  I think it has more to do with how the infrastructure evolves.  I wanted to come back to this notion of breaking up big tech because inevitably this is what  is discussed when we talk about the future of these technology companies.  And in parallel, the breaking up of the baby bells is usually the reference that's made.  We cannot.  It would be a problem for our national security if we break these, if we force these companies  to be broken up.  And the reason for that is because the United States, for the past several administrations,  has not, has either actively not invested in basic science and research, basic research  and science and technology, or they've defunded a lot of the departments that would be doing  this.  Absent of large scale funding into critical areas of development for things like not just  artificial intelligence, but also space and the batteries that go into our autonomous  vehicles and next frontier technologies like synthetic biology.  If the government is not going to pour money, lots and lots of money into these things at  a level that keeps pace with what other, like China is doing, then this causes us a problem  in the longer term.  At the moment, it is just these companies, in part because they're so well capitalized,  that are doing that work, but they are doing that work in service of their own products  and services because the market spanks them otherwise when it's revealed how much R&D  spend there is.  So we can't break, I mean, there are logistical reasons.  The federal government runs on AWS.  I don't know how you're going to break apart Amazon in any meaningful way because so many,  so much of that company is so interconnected.  My question is like, who is going to do the work?  Who is going to fund the work?  And I'm not saying that the way the big tech companies are doing it now is good either.  They're essentially just working with a handful of universities.  It's an incestuous, very narrow, homogenous group of people who are building all of these  things.  But the point is, if they don't, it's not going to happen at the same level and that  is going to put us at a longer term strategic disadvantage.  So breaking up big tech alone doesn't solve our problem.  Figuring out a way to incent them to do better on behalf of all of us and probably financial  incentives are going to be the right way to go, while simultaneously making more of the  systems interoperable, forcing parts of them to be public, for code bases to be public.  It doesn't detract from the bottom line.  We have to take a much more sophisticated approach.  Alex earlier talked about a scalpel versus a hammer.  And this is one of those like, you know, the blunt instrument here is the hammer, right?  That's breaking them up.  The scalpel approach is going to serve us better in the longer term.

Start time: 3251.14
End time: 3300.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the innovation is in policy, not not it's.  You know, these companies have become so politicized and to be fair, it's their own fault.  But if we, you know, because we have this, this is also sort of this Hydra where we have  systems and services that are not interoperable.  We've got companies that are so big and wield so much economic might, they effectively act  as nation states.  I mean, for God's sake, Microsoft has its own corporate foreign policy group that it  has poached from state.  So we have sort of wicked, challenging problems, sort of demand creative approaches.  Otherwise, we're going to wind up in court arguing about all of this and going backwards.

Start time: 3300.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is all going to be in court.  We will be lawyers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, Leo, I think what you're what you're getting at here, right.  So there's two big questions that we have.  One is how can we incentivize an environment of competition in our country so that these  companies do not consolidate control in the way that they have and we have smaller firms  that are able to come up and start taking a little bit of their market share and then  maybe building bigger things at a result of it versus now where they don't have the ability  to compete. And that's like, you know, a definitely worthy conversation.  I think this week, what really demands to be foregrounded is how do we put our society  back together? Right.  Because that's the issue that we've had with some of these some of these platforms.  And you've talked about it, how people end up going into their echo chambers and basically  forming another version of reality that's disconnected with what's actually happening  in the world.

End time: 3384.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. And so when we talk about this discussion and like, should we break up Facebook?  I think we are should be decentralized.  I think we really need to think about the second order effects, which is that, you know,  what network does take off and does it become a partisan network like a gab?

Start time: 3384.88
End time: 3398.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And isn't there a tendency to that because of the network effect?  I mean, right now people are saying WhatsApp.  Oh my God, Dapples revealed all the pop privacy issues.  Let's all use Signal. Not it's not going to happen.  Everybody you talk to is on WhatsApp.  You're going to still use WhatsApp.

Start time: 3412.94
End time: 3585.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct. Look, I think we're getting at the same point, which is that we need to consider  the second order effects and that history doesn't end with a ban because people when you  zap somebody off your social platform, you know, they don't just go away.  They're still have access.  They go to a chairman browser.  Yeah. And they might go somewhere else.  And so and actually, you know, if you think about Facebook, they've been slow and  irresponsible for a large part of their history.  So I think that, you know, rather than saying let's break Facebook up, I think we need to  focus on some of the policies that Facebook could implement to end up bringing us back  to that shared version of reality.  They know how to structure their newsfeed.  And Dan, I think, can back this up in a way that will not divide people by having them  direct their clicks to partisan and sensationalized news.  They can direct their newsfeed to a place where, you know, there are news news organizations  that have some sentiment or some attachment to the truth that people go to.  And they can change the recommendation algorithms to make sure that, you know, people are  not going to they did this right before the election to that people aren't going to groups  that end up in the next conspiracy theory.  We know many people, you know, did that, you know, did that and ended up finding their  way to things like QAnon through Facebook recommendations.  But what our society faces now is more than technology problem, which is something I don't  think should be lost in this discussion.  Right. Because, you know, while technology might have helped, you know, help that horse  leave the barn, that horse is out.  And I think a major part of this solution is we need a people part of this solution as  well, where, you know, I'm hoping and, you know, I think a realist will say this is  unlikely. But the optimistic take is that maybe the fever breaks, you know, from an event  like this. And people realize that this stuff is just totally unacceptable.  We have to preserve democracy and that the elements of the country that, you know, led  up or helped build up to, you know, what we were what we experienced over the past week,  you know, aren't given the free rein and the oh, what could be the worst thing that  happens perspective that we've had so far.  We need people who are, you know, who are who are our political leaders or media leaders  to steer us back to like a world where people can talk to each other like you.  You should be able to talk to your to your relatives and to your friends and about  politics. And, OK, they're part of the reason of that is we can't do that is because of  tech. But, you know, these tech companies amplify people and it's up to the people who  are making these statements. They have a responsibility, you know, to to step up to  the game and realize how close we were to the disruption of the counting of the votes  for the president of the United States.  You know, potentially, who knows, they could have burned those votes if they got into the  hall at the right time and to steer us back from the brink.  That's what we should demand from our leadership right now.  And I think that's just as if not more important as the technology solutions that we're  seeking to implement.

I feel like this is very a very difficult thing to solve.  And, you know, you can say that, Alex, that, oh, it's up to Facebook to fix their news  feed. But that just says in a way, well, it's up to Mark Zuckerberg to solve this.  Let's let's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need the help of the platforms in the short term.  There's no question for a short and medium term that that they're going to have an  outsized role. And we should be asking a lot of them.  And Alex is exactly right.  They could tweak the news feed tomorrow to do things that would be better for all of  us and but possibly not as good for the bottom line at Facebook.  And there's an any number of things that they Twitter and other social media companies  could do to help us improve the conversations and to make them more civil and to  downgrade the BS and to upgrade things that have demonstrated some sort of interest in  truth and things like that.  But we have to just put a lot of pressure on them.  And even then, they're going to do what they decide.

Transcript:  Is it too simplistic of me, Amy, to say it's the problem is algorithms.  And I think people when they join Facebook, a lot of people, I thought, oh, this is great.  It's going to be me looking at a feed of the things my family and friends are doing.  And that's that.  But I left Facebook because it pretty clearly became something other than that because of  evil algorithm.  YouTube, the algorithm pushes people into extremism.  Is the is it too simplistic to say, well, that's that's because the algorithm optimizes  for profit, not for polity.

Start time: 3734.34
End time: 3740.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'll answer that question and then a note on YouTube.  And then I actually just thought of a solution for Facebook.

Start time: 3746.50
End time: 3819.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My answer to your question, is it too simplistic to just blame it on the algorithms?  The answer is no, that's exactly what the problem is.  Now, it's it's not algorithmic determinism on its own.  Humans still play a role.  And both Alex and Dan have made this point clearly.  There are plenty of interventions that that would amount to small tweaks that may not  shift the experience so drastically that would at least alleviate or let out some of the  steam from the pot that's boiling.  So that's that's one thing.  YouTube hasn't been brought up at all.  And again, Trump has been the most visual and vocal presence on Facebook and on Twitter.  And that's what gets talked about a lot.  And I know Bannon got taken off of YouTube.  The YouTube's personalization algorithms are far better, far better than than everybody  else's and and I think deserves much more scrutiny than it's receiving.  And that that would I would actually start there.  I wouldn't start with Facebook and Twitter, but it might be easy to tell Google, stop

Start time: 3822.64
End time: 3846.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, so here's that that that leads into the answer.  So I was trying to think through like I'm always asking the question, what would it  take for X to be Y?  So I was thinking as I was listening to Alex and Dan, what would it take for these  companies to make to change their minds?  Or, you know, and the problem is that individuals, we often lump everybody together.  There's plenty of there are plenty of people working at these companies who disagree with  the policies of these companies, but their employees, they're.

Start time: 3846.96
End time: 3856.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually one of the stories this week is petitions by Twitter, Google,  Facebook employees all saying, you know, take down Trump, whether that.

Start time: 3856.58
End time: 4030.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, but I have some very good friends working at these companies who  are there because they are trying to make a difference, which is why they say at any  rate, what would it take for Facebook to take down the content that it knows is salacious  in the news feed?  And that's what led me to kind of an interesting idea, which is, you know, it would be  tedious, but not impossible to build.  Many, many permutations of financial models that hinge on different, different  variables.  So.  So, for example, QAnon is kind of a big topic, but within that, and I haven't seen the  data on this, but my assumption is there's probably, you know, a thousand sub keywords  related to QAnon that tend to get posted within.  So if you built a regression, you would probably I'm not going to at any rate, there's  probably a bunch of data.  So so what would be interesting is to try to quantify what the value of that post is.  What's the actual monetary value of posts that use, you know, X number of terms related  to these incendiary terms?  Right.  So QAnon Antifa, you know, Trump, whatever.  So going at the content versus the user.  And then if you have those models built, you would be able to project how much actual  loss there might be.  And I wonder if I mean, I'm sure there would be some loss.  Right.  But if you were able to be like a Facebook could be transparent and say we built these  we built these economic models.  High freight like like there are plenty of quant funds that do this exact same thing.  So they could partner with a quant fund to actually do this for them, but to build those  models, run the scenarios and then be able to say, listen, we're about, you know, in a  couple of days, we're going to start policing.  Policing is not the right word.  We're going to start treating the these the this content differently.  And this is our projected impact on our bottom line.  And we believe it's going to cost us X amount of dollars to do this.  We do.  We're doing it because we believe it's for the best.  I wonder, you know, and we're asking for investors to to see the bigger picture here  and to not.  I.  I wonder if there rather than everybody speculating, I wonder if there was an actual  model built and if they used a quant fund model to that idea to do it and then they  were totally transparent about the results and gave everybody time.  You know, I wonder and said like this is this is we're going to do this from now on.  I bet that would help not hurt them and it might solve our problems.  That was super complicated.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  I think when we talk about a VPN to you guys, you know what a VPN is and you even know why  you might want to use it for privacy because Internet service providers and carriers can  see everything you're doing and often log it and sell it to marketers.  We also do it for security because that guy in the hoodie in the coffee shop, he also  could see everything you do and maybe he's got nefarious intent.  You might even do it because it allows you to emerge onto the public Internet at an IP  address not associated with you in a country, maybe the one you don't live in.  And so if you've watched everything on Netflix and who has it by this time, but you like  Doctor Who, you just fire up Express VPN.  It's a single button.  You say I want to be in London right now.  Then refresh Netflix.  Suddenly all the Doctor Who episodes are available in Netflix UK or Netflix Japan, where you  can watch as much anime as you can take.  That's kind of cool.  One of the reasons you can do this is because Express VPN invests in their network.  They have they're in almost 100 countries and they make sure that there are enough IP  addresses. They rotate them enough so that you really your privacy is really protected.  And they're fast enough.  Look at this speed so that you can watch HD video.  It is it is.  In fact, a lot of us keep Express VPN running all the time.  You could put it on your router, protect your whole home and you won't even know that  Express VPN is running.  It is great for privacy.  It's great for security.  It's great for watching content.  And I have to say one of the things I really like and the reason I recommend Express VPN  is it is fully private.  There are free and inexpensive VPN providers that don't protect your privacy, that don't  respect you. That's not Express VPN.  And we know that because they get regular audits.  PricewaterhouseCoopers, who check their privacy policy, make sure they live up to that.  They even check this trusted server technology Express VPN uses.  When you use an Express VPN VPN server, wherever it is in the world, it spins up the  trusted server, runs in RAM, can't write to hard drive.  It's completely sandboxed.  And when you leave, it goes away.  So does every record of your visit.  It's completely private.  That's the kind of thing you really want.  And PricewaterhouseCoopers says, yes, that works exactly as I just described it.  It's probably why CNET, Wired and so many other people say Express VPN is the number  one VPN service out there.  It's the only one I use.  So stop handing over your personal data to ISPs and other tech giants who mine your  activity, sell off your information, protect yourself with the only VPN I trust to keep  me private online.

Would that solve the media problem, the news problem?

Start time: 4246.10
End time: 4310.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  It's it's it's so completely  inadequate and wrong for the Internet age that it's  that it was it was never my favorite thing, even when it existed with a limited number of  broadcasters, which is what it was about.  It was a presumption that the airways are a limited quantity owned by the public.  Therefore, they have responsibility and we're going to make sure they do this.  It.  It was always a good idea in a sort of conceptual way, but hard to make work.  But when you have even even with all the power of the big companies, there's still a  lot of ways to be heard and to speak.  And the idea that a fairness doctrine is somehow needed again seems crazy to me,  especially because you have billions of things posted every day on Facebook.  What are you going to do? Go and try to.

Start time: 4317.38
End time: 4361.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course. And that's one reason that traditional media earned a lot of the suspicion  that has fallen upon them in the last couple of generations is that the notion that there  were two balanced and equally valid viewpoints for anything has always been kind of  loony. And people who had views that were outside of those constrained  right center and left center places had no outlet, no no one talking to them.  And, you know, I'm, to put it mildly, not a fan of Rush Limbaugh, but he filled a major  gap in the media ecosystem, did it in an evil way.

Transcript:  He sure did. And but it was a and again, I'm you know, I loathe what he did, but I  recognize that he had filled a gap that was just huge.  And no one's done that very well on the left.  But their whole point is that I don't like constrained media ecosystems.  I like the ability of people to publish, to say what they want to say and to possibly  reach an audience rather than having to filter through a couple of or three or at most  four networks run by old white men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing I've been standing on the table with big technology is that we're never going  to solve anything if we look only at the outputs and we need to really look at the machine,  which means that it's so easy to look at a bad post or a user you don't like and say,  if you hit the ban button or if you remove this from your service, you're going to solve  all the problems. And that's why I think like over the past weekend, you know, so many  people celebrating the ban of Donald Trump as if it's the end of all problems in the  world are misguided.  I think what we really need to do is to kind of look at how these platforms operate.  And that can be the newsfeed algorithm.  And we did see ahead of the election, Facebook and Twitter basically showed us exactly  you know what they believe is wrong with their service.  But, you know, for one reason or another, they don't think it's possible to make change  permanently. So they did start directing people in the newsfeed to fact based reporting.  This was a noted newsfeed change that they announced where they thought it would, you  know, be there, be less tension.  So, you know, if they have the more outrageous stuff, they might get more engagement,  which is good for their business model.  But for some reason, they decided to switch it back after the election, which to me was  remarkable. They turned off group recommendations.  So we know that that's an issue because they're trying to have a normal political system  and they turn off group recommendations.  What does that tell us about group recommendations?  And then finally, I don't think there's been anywhere close to enough discussion of the  damage that's done by the share button and the retweet button, which allows information  to travel at lightning speed through these networks.  That, number one, means misinformation is going to go quickly.  But number two, it changes the way that people pass along information, because when you  don't need to hesitate, when you just hit a button and you can share it to people, you're  going to share the thing like you mentioned that confirms or validates your belief and  plays to emotion and not to thought.  And there are studies that show that when you need when you pause, you take a moment to  think about what you're sharing.  You're going to share things based off of whether they make sense for your followers, not  in terms of or your friends, not in terms of based off of how they make you feel.  And I think this entire instinctual, emotional based sharing where people are willing to  share something that says, you know, Hillary Clinton is a space alien because it sort of  validates their thoughts about Hillary Clinton.  Yeah, that is incredibly damaging.  And if you have to copy and paste that into the compose box and actually put your avatar  next to it, not somebody else's, it's a completely different calculation.  But for some reason, whenever we have these discussions, we'll leave that completely  out. And I think that if there's one thing we're going to do moving forward as we start  to focus on the machine, especially the share in the retweet button, but also the  recommendations and the algorithm itself.  And that will probably get us into a much better place than thinking about who we're  going to ban or what content we don't want on the platforms.

Start time: 4591.74
End time: 4630.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. Can I ask you a really quick question, Alex?  I know you've got to do commercial, but what if so?  What if Twitter no longer showed externally metrics?  So you knew how many followers you had, but you could not you could not visually see  anybody else's followers or the number of likes or retweets if you took the extra step  to go into your dashboard and see what got retweeted and liked.  But basically all those metrics were stripped out of public view.  I wonder if that would that seems like a tweak that could potentially help, maybe.

Start time: 4632.02
End time: 4671.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is something that's absolutely worth testing.  I mean, the way that these platforms make these decisions is they test with a limited  number of users and they see how that impacts the way the service works.  And if they like the results, then they roll it out.  And to me, it's extraordinary that they haven't tested what you're talking about in  particular. And we've already seen actually a version of this where Instagram  stopped publicly displaying likes.  And I think that that changed.  I mean, obviously, they decided to roll it out permanently, like what it was going.  But it didn't kill the business.  And it certainly changed the experience where all of a sudden you're not feeling bad  about how many likes you get every time you post.  And it's not about measuring up.

Start time: 4671.98
End time: 4686.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's about the experience.  You're not retweeting simply because you see a bunch of people retweeting and you  feel like part of if you remove that incentive, I don't think that changes the  the. It'd be interesting.  I wonder if Twitter just did that for a couple of weeks.

End time: 4740.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that, they also they also stopped the native retweet ahead of the election.  But they said, oh, well, people retweeted less.  So that experiment didn't work.  So they put it back. Nice.  But like, come on. Wrong.  Entering that every single decision they make is based off of that health of the platform.  Conversational health.  And it's really freaking interesting that when they evaluated how well that experiment  worked, they didn't say whether it improved or hurt conversation.  They said, well, people retweeted less.  Right. It sort of goes to show you exactly what's going on inside that platform.  It's about the incentives to keep engagement up and not about the incentives to make the  conversation. Precisely.  We're letting them off the hook.  Yeah. And we need a whole.

Start time: 4744.86
End time: 4822.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think the idea of putting a whole bunch of speed bumps into the process of  sharing and posting is a great one.  And they should, as Alex said, be A, B testing this like crazy.  There's no evidence I've seen that they are.  But there's all sorts of things that they should be experimenting with.  And I think that the Twitter experiment was quite successful from a social point of  view, not obviously from a business one.  And Facebook's ability to change things pretty quickly is extraordinary.  And the thing is that if what I've been arguing or trying to nudge Facebook toward  personally is give users more control over their own newsfeed and give us dashboards  to make some of our own decisions.  And this is the usual answers.  Oh, no one will do that.  Well, why don't you try?  I think we have so much help that we need from the platforms and as far as as yet, not  nearly enough being provided.

Start time: 4822.50
End time: 4841.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's perfectly possible.  I'm hopeful that the government scrutiny is going to make them sit back and think, well,  OK, maybe we need to we do need to do some of these things, even if it doesn't increase  engagement. Maybe that's not the only metric.  Maybe not getting broken up by the House Judiciary Committee on Subcommittee on Antitrust.  That would be a good goal as well.

Transcript:  Amy, go ahead. I was going to say, I think it's worth noting, especially given who who  we are each talking to today.  Twitter by volume is a fraction of Facebook.  Their share value is a fraction of Amazon, of Apple.

Start time: 4863.10
End time: 4935.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. That's what I'm saying.  And and by so by any way you slice it, market cap, number of users, you know, the the  amplification in Twitter happens because there's a concentration of people in tech politics  and media. So I think it's worth I mean, I think that is worth thinking through because  Twitter as a company is not what I would call a looking at it.  I'm looking at their share price right now.  They're not. You know, that's not the place where I would sink a bunch of money into.  And yet they have this unbelievable influence.  And I think the insight there is that this isn't platform alone, but it's people.  I mean, you know, in as much as Twitter is enabling misinformation to spread, people  in positions of power are helping them do that.  I am guilty of the same.  You know, I have certainly spread incendiary content more than once without really thinking  through how others in my network are going to treat that information.  So I all of us bear some responsibility here.  It's it's the platforms are making poor choices that are that are in response to market  demands. But we're all complicit in this.

We don't want to. We know you don't want us to.  But advertisers want to know.  We want to know what you're interested in, what you like, how much money you make,  how much money you make, things like that.  Your education level.  So we do this survey once a year, completely voluntary.  You don't have to answer any question if you don't want to.  But it is very helpful for us.  It'll take about, I don't know, five, 10, 15 minutes of your time.  Depends on how much you think about the answers.  Twit dot TV slash Survey 21.  We really appreciate it if you take that survey.  Thank you.  I don't want to I don't want to just kind of.  You know, beat a dead horse.  That seems rude.

That's important.

Transcript:  So this is, I want to call it the death knell to the campaign and to his ability to raise money.  It's a temporary situation.  I mean, even with Gab, you saw Gab was able to build its own servers and it's running today.  And I think in the 24 hours after the storming of the Capitol, they had 2.2 million visits,  according to the head of the site told me while I was working on a story for Big Technology about that.  So like these are these are setbacks, but it's not like, you know, him, you know, Trump not being on Twitter and Facebook  isn't the end of his ability to communicate.  He could at a certain point set up his own website with his own servers and communicate that way.  Similar with the payment processing, but it is, you know, it is definitely a setback and will take time for them to work through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I do recommend your latest Substack newsletter where you talk about alternative social networks.  As as Trump gets banned from mainstream networks, there are many places like Gab that are still there.  And boy, some of the stuff posted on these sites is horrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, these are the second order effects.  And by the way, Gab's CEO said he had a phone call with a very special person yesterday.  I didn't say who that was.  Yeah.  But given that Parler is going down and like the only other option might be Telegram or some other secondary networks,  I would not be surprised to see a big migration to Gab, which is already set up outside of the tech giant's control largely.  So keep an eye out for that.  Yeah.

Transcript:  You know, we talk about the platform power.  What about the power of just a small number of payment systems to decide who's allowed to make money?  Exactly. Yeah.  And Wikileaks was basically very close to shut down back in the days when it was before 2016.  I'm not a fan of what they've done recently, but they were doing something important for a long time  and were essentially taken out of the fundraising world by companies that had no,  they didn't really answer to anybody except somebody calling them from Washington saying,  we'd really like you to take Wikileaks off of your systems.  That's that's pretty dangerous, too.

Transcript:  Not when you're being targeted for harassment.  Brianna and I can both give you long stories of how I'm you know, I didn't establish my Wikipedia page.  I don't know who did.  I can tell you that it's thankfully and I love everybody listening.  So I know you are not going to go in and start monkeying around it again.  But after my first book came out, there was quite a bit of back and forth and like vandalism,  you know, and I mean, just really bad, like really horrible stuff that was being posted.  And there's no like I'm the source.  I am the primary source.  Could I at least take that?  No, no, you don't get to edit your page.  Yeah. Right.

Transcript:  So I don't disagree with any of that.  And I think Wikipedia is a miracle that gets better and better and better.  And we can always improve and people running it are aware of a lot of these issues.  Maybe don't don't move as fast as we would like them to on some things.  But man, I think the world would be vastly worse off without Wikipedia than what we have with it.

Transcript:  I love it, but I didn't know about all that abuse you and Brianna had.  So that's not so good.  Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.  I got my iPhone SE from it.  This is an amazing deal.  The SE is $15 a month.  My Mint Mobile unlimited nationwide talk and text and data.  I think I get the three gigs of data a month.  15 bucks.  So the total package 30 bucks a month.  That's amazing.  One of the ways Mint Mobile does it, they don't have stores.  They don't spend money renting stores.  They don't have storefronts.  It's an all online wireless service selling you the same service you get with a premium wireless plan.  But starting at $15 a month.  That is an amazing deal.  All their plans come with unlimited talk and text and high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network, T-Mobile.  You can use your own phone, bring your own phone.  They'll send you a SIM free.  You put it in the phone.  You keep your contacts.  They'll even port your old phone number over.  They also sell phones like that iPhone SE.  What a great price.  And if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered with their seven day money back guarantee.  Switch now to Mint Mobile.  Get premium wireless service starting at just $15 a month.  Actually, I liked it so much because I'm a T-Mobile customer.  I thought, you know, why am I paying 70, 80 bucks a month for something I can get for less?  I ended up paying 300 bucks for a year of Mint Mobile for 12 gigabytes a month.  That's 25 bucks a month for 12 gigabytes unlimited nationwide talk and text.  That's a great deal.  Here's what you do. Go to MintMobile.com slash twit.  Pick the plan you like and stop paying all those huge phone bills.  I feel like every phone I use should be Mint Mobile.  Why am I paying more? MintMobile.com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill to as low as $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your door for free.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  This is an idea whose time has come, I think.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Thank you, Mint Mobile, for supporting the show.  OK, how about this? The iPhone 13 years old, at least the announcement of the iPhone 13 years ago this weekend.

Start time: 5730.06
End time: 5833.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really is amazing how the reaction of BlackBerry, Microsoft and others really underplayed what was about to happen.  Clearly a revolution in hindsight.  We know a revolution in computing may be the most significant revolution since the  personal computer. It killed BlackBerry, essentially.  In fact, my last phone before my first iPhone in 2007 was a BlackBerry Pearl.  Love that physical keyboard and all that.  But I never bought another one after that.  And I think I was I'm not alone.  Apple will probably attempt the same thing in a couple of years.  I have a feeling Hyundai may have made a strategic mistake by announcing that they were talking with Apple about making a car.  Apple's not notoriously forgiving in cases like that.  Hyundai's stock went up 19 percent.  And then they kind of retracted saying, oh, Apple's in discussion with a lot of automakers.  It's not just us, but it's interesting because we've heard the drumbeat about Apple making a car now suddenly ramp up over the last couple of weeks.  So this Hyundai story is kind of kind of interesting.  Clearly, Apple doesn't have manufacturing capability to manufacture a car.  They'd have to go to somebody who makes cars.  But an Apple car is an interesting product, probably not till 2024 or 2025, maybe later, depending on which rumor mill you listen to.  I want to I want to see Tim Cook on stage saying.  It's an Internet communicator, it's a phone, it's a transportation device,  Internet communicator, phone, transportation device.

Transcript:  Yes, that's right. It is presumed to be an electric vehicle, self-driving, probably unclear when you'd have it.  Of course, Apple's not commenting.  Also, strong rumors that Apple and Facebook will do augmented reality glasses of some kind this year.  Facebook's already kind of in that business, having bought Oculus.  There have been significant rumors that perhaps, let's see, Andrew Bosworth of Facebook says it's smart glasses that they're building in relationship with Ray Ban will arrive sooner than later.  And will not necessarily be. Oh, my God.  I'm trying to go to this story on Bloomberg and Bloomberg has decided I'm a robot.  So I'm clicking this. I'm not a robot.  And it still thinks I'm a robot.

We have yet to solve the battery issue and because the battery capacity on these things,  that's that's I think the big, big advantage that Tesla has over everybody else.  The battery, the range on this Audi is only one hundred and fifty miles,  and it's drastically underpowered.  It can it has the space for a bigger.  I mean, an engine is you don't need more space, right?  So it could have a bigger, better engine in it.  But the battery won't support it.

And I said, what browser uses?  He says, I'm using Firefox.  And he apparently, because the news site that he read had too many ads,  he turned on cookie blocking.  Which was, yeah, it's nothing to do with ads, but smart idea.  Yeah, people are, you know, that cookie thing.  And then, but I got to point out, if you're carrying a smartphone,  you're carrying a device that has built in GPS and always on internet  connection, a microphone and a camera.  And in my case, LIDAR, that's the perfect spy device.  Yeah, who cares what cookies?  Who cares? Yeah.  Who cares?  Hey, let's let's take another little break.

Transcript:  Or if you're on a Commodore 64, it's twit comma eight comma one.  Don't forget to use the peak command.  I suppose we should probably talk about Section 230.  I don't, you know.  I don't feel I don't really like TikTok.  It's like as the as the Trump presidency winds down, I wonder,  there's these little things kind of hanging out in the world like TikTok  was supposed to be shut down.  I don't think it's going to be shut down, although maybe now that it banned  the president, it will be. I don't know.  I also feel like all of the attacks on Section 230.  They've just kind of gone up in smoke.  Even Ajit Pai, the current chairman of the FCC on his last days, has said,  I'm not going to do anything about Section 230.  Section 230, as some have said, is the what is it?  Twenty three words that created the Internet.  60 Minutes did a piece on it a couple of weeks ago that was completely wrong.  Got it completely wrong, which is a shame.  If you want to know more about Section 230, read Mike Masnick's  Tector, where he explains what it means.  But it is really very simple.  It means that.  Well, there's there's really two parts.  No provider or user of an interactive computer service  shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided  by another information content provider.  In other words, you can't be sued.  Twitter, Facebook can't be sued for.  Any things other people post, I can't be sued for people,  things people post on my chat room.  I can't be sued for people, things people post in our forums or comments  on our Web page, even though I run those sites.  I'm not liable for what people post there.  If you got rid of that.  I'd have to take the chat room down, I'd have to take the forums down.  I'd have to take comments down because I don't want to be liable  for something somebody says on those sites.  I think it's pretty clear we need Section 230.  Is it at risk?  Anybody have any thoughts on this?

Start time: 6747.16
End time: 6771.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's at risk at all.  I think we should cut through some of the bull crap, which is that  the Republicans have been threatening to revoke Section 230  because they don't like the way they've been moderated.  And that's why you see every time there's a label put on  Trump's tweets back when he was able to tweet, he would tweet Section 230,  revoke Section 230, because they didn't want the platforms  to be touching their stuff.

Start time: 6771.50
End time: 6773.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that was a complete misunderstanding of what 230 does.

Start time: 6774.52
End time: 6863.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly. Total misunderstanding.  But they knew they know they're lawmakers.  They know exactly what the law, maybe except for Trump.  They had a good idea of what that law was supposed to do.  The threat of revoking it  was supposed to intimidate these platforms to not touch their content.  Because, like you said, if Section 230 went away,  you'd have to take down their chat room.  It's not a pretty world if you're Facebook or you're Google  and Section 230 is gone.  And now all of a sudden, you're liable.  You're liable for everything that's posted.  So essentially, this was a toothless death threat  that people who didn't like the way that these companies were moderating content.  That was like what they would hold above their head.  But now we're moving into a world where the Democrats control  the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.  And you'll note that very few of them have come out and said,  we need to, you know, either revoke or amend this law.  So for the next two years, at least, but probably longer,  there is not a high likelihood of anything happening to 230.  And honestly, I feel sometimes like I'm the only person who's like,  this is actually a good law because you shouldn't hold companies  liable for, you know, what's said by other people on their forums online,  assuming that they do some form of good faith content moderation  to keep, you know, illegal things like child porn off of their sites.

Start time: 6872.13
End time: 6889.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly right.  And so to me, I think that we're about to see the end of this bad faith use  of holding Section 230 over these platforms had to have them  lay off the partisan, you know, either party's messaging.  I think that's over. Yeah.

Start time: 6899.62
End time: 7021.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said when he said Democrats, you know, basically don't care.  I'll tell you two Democrats who have come out and said  in one case that he would repeal it completely.  That is the president elect. Yes.  Biden specifically called out 230 for repeal.  And his the soon to be vice president led  a campaign in California to a cynical campaign  in California to carve a giant hole in Section 230,  charging people with things she knew were legal despite.  Oh, I did not know about this.  Yeah, I'll send you some info on that.  I think the Democrats are this was when she was anything more likely  to car to to to poke a hole in it than the Republicans were,  because Alex is absolutely right that the Republicans had no idea  what it did or purported not to.  But I think the Democrats are at least as big a danger in this case.  And the thing that's important to keep in mind,  this is not a law written to protect  Twitter and Facebook and Google, which didn't exist at the time  the law was written.  It's a law written to promote free speech.  That's the point of the law.  And we keep losing that in the debate.  That's not really a debate.  So I'm I'm exceedingly worried.  And we almost lost it this time because of, you know,  it can easily be tossed into some omnibus legislation  because Congress doesn't pass like individual laws anymore.  I think we're in real danger and very soon.  Harris was of what?  Losing it of Section 230 being repealed or or gutted.

Start time: 7021.94
End time: 7079.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Harris, when she was California attorney general, was going after  the revenge porn industry, which honestly is, you know, a good thing.  But the way worth going after.  Yeah. But the way she was doing it  was to peel away the legal protections that keep online platforms immune.  And that was misguided, to say the least.  It was the wrong direction to take,  even though it was a popular position, a position I agree with.  I think that's the wrong way to go about it.  I believe that Biden's anti 230 comments were offhand.  And I Jeff Jarvis says that he's talked to people who have been  advising the Biden transition that they have talked with him  and explained why that's a bad idea.  So it remains to be seen.  I think both Harris and Biden, you know, clearly acted against 230 in the past.  But let's hope cooler heads prevail.

Start time: 7080.62
End time: 7096.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my response to Dan.  I think there are things you say as a candidate.  And then it's a completely different ballgame when you're actually there  running the country and you speak with, you know, your your congressional leaders  who have been doing something different.  Is it reasonable to say, as some have said,

Start time: 7098.80
End time: 7107.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, that's obviously we don't want to repeal it, but maybe it needs to be fixed.  Strengthened. What? How would you how would you how would you strengthen it, Amy?

Start time: 7109.92
End time: 7179.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, again, our the central challenge we have in our democracy  is that our laws are not responsive, meaning we can't recalibrate them.  We have to create a new law to to mitigate the problems  in interpreting that law, given the changing like. Right.  So and and our system is set up to not have a lot of gray area.  And you want to know what's acceptable and not acceptable. So.  So not my my.  So if if Section 230 doesn't exist or is weakened in some way  and also everybody wants the big tech companies to be broken up  or to create a situation where there is profound competition,  meaning there are lots of niche, you know,  micro sites and and lots more distribution of content.  Then all of those brand new organizations become vulnerable  because they're going to be tiny, they're not going to have  they're not going to be layered up.  And if somebody tries to sue them.  Right. So Facebook is in other words, Facebook is a little bit safer.

Start time: 7188.92
End time: 7224.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, again, we we can't look at any of these issues in a vacuum.  We have to look at all of these as levers that, you know,  the push pull of the level, the levers,  the levers on how our democracy works, because all of these,  you know, repealing, not repealing, strengthening, weakening,  they all have these reverberating next order effects,  which could impact some of the very same things that people are fighting,  you know, fighting over just adjacently related areas.

Start time: 7227.24
End time: 7250.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, trust me,  if this comes back to haunt us, we will be talking about it and fighting  to save it, because I'm of the opinion that without 230, it'd be very hard  to for us to go forward.  And we certainly have to shut down all public comment on all the things we do.  And that's a big deal, because I can, unlike Mark Zuckerberg,  I can't really afford to fight a lawsuit.

Start time: 7251.34
End time: 7283.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really important point that you and Amy make.  When we had GDPR rollout, there was this view that it was going to apply equally,  but of course, the bigger tech companies are the ones that had the amount  of resources necessary to be able to comply with that law.  And that's privacy law in Europe.  So what you ended up having was, you know, Facebook and Google worked fine in Europe.  But if you try to go to some of the local news sites or smaller news sites,  they just shut down in Europe because they couldn't operate.  So considering the second order effects here is extremely important.  And I'm glad we've we've discussed it.

Start time: 7284.00

Was kicked out of chat, which we have every right to do.  And Section 230 protects us.  He said, I'm going to sue you. I'm going to sue you.  I'm a see. I said, dude, go ahead.  Because of Section 230, if there's no Section 230,  I have to take that very, very seriously.  And so no more banning and chat.  No more. None of that.  Everything goes. Oh, boy.  I would shut it down immediately.  Actually, we I've already taken.  I shouldn't admit this.  I'm taking steps to distance chat.  We no longer run the server.  It's not on our servers.  It's it's a it's a community run, which is good.  So it's it's I'm putting it at arm's length,  and it's partly because of that.

I mean, it just goes to show you that running a forum  or running a scary with user generated content is probably  one of the more difficult things that you can do on the Internet.  We talked about, you know, how do we get, you know,  Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey to do the right thing or make their platforms  a place where everybody can, you know, come together and be happy.  But once you start to run a forum like that, Leo, right, you realize,  oh, man, easier said than done.  Do you have a forum, Alex?  I mean, I have comments on my substack newsletter and they become active at times.  And I just banned someone for the first time this week.  And I sort of went through the same thing where it was like, wait a second,  this is my, you know, it's my living room here on the Internet.  And you're calling me a liar. So I've always felt that way.

Transcript:  Here's to here's to 230. I'll drink to that.  Our show today brought to you quite literally by our brand new tricaster.  I want to give some real props to a new tech and their new tricaster to elite.  John is loving it. All of our engineers are loving it.  It's the most complete live production system on the planet.  We use one tenth of its capabilities, but we still love our tricaster.  It wouldn't exist without the tricaster.  When we started streaming video, of course we chose tricaster.  And now we're using the latest and greatest.  It's more than a live video production system.  It's an all encompassing digital media solution  people can use to create content for Internet, mobile and television distribution.  It's used in so many places.  Our new board, that board you see right there, has an instant replay button.  We're trying to figure out how we can use that.  Maybe the next time I make a it has 10, nine instant replay buttons. Wow.  It's software driven, IP native technology.  That gives you the capability, connectivity and control  to take on any sort of digital media production.  And it's portable.  I mean, we've got a rack mounted, but but we've also taken it on the road.  It's amazing when you consider the sheer variety of features  that new tech offers with their tricaster series.  No other live production solution enables digital workflows  like the tricaster to elite. There's live call connect,  which we're going to we haven't started using, but I'm excited about that.  It lets you connect to anyone, anywhere on any device with high quality video and audio.  You can use Skype, Microsoft Teams, Zoom meetings, Slack, everything.  There's the integrated live set technology.  You may not realize it, but I'm actually at home in my jammies.  But thanks to new tech's tricaster to elite, I look like I'm in a studio dress.  No, I am. We don't.  That's one feature we probably should use more of.  But the live set technology is amazing.  And you get full access to a premium library of virtual sets  so you can create a simulated environment that suits your style and your brand.  And man, they have such a good Matt technology built in.  It's so amazing.  Don't leave out the live graphics creator plug in either.  You can design animated titles, motion graphics.  I'm sure Anthony's going to start doing some stuff with that looping effects.  And you can do it with creative cloud.  Photoshop, the lower third you're seeing was created in Photoshop  and then imported directly into your tricaster live production system.  It's one of the reasons our fonts look so much better now  because we're using Photoshop live graphics creator.  Let's produce and present spectacular live graphics faster  and easier than ever before.  We're just we're just scratching the surface with this new tricaster to elite.  And when you're ready to take your production live, that's when we really get excited.  That's what we do.  You can stream it live to your choice of new media platforms.  The convenient presets for Facebook Live, Microsoft, Azure, Twitch,  YouTube Live and more.  It's flexible. It's powerful.  It's easy to use.  But most importantly, tricaster to elite frees you from the boundaries  of live video production. The skies, the limit.  It's transformative.  It's better than broadcast.  And we love it.  Thank you, NewTek for our tricaster to elite.  Go to NewTek, N-E-W-T-E-K dot com slash tricaster.  There's an interactive guide that'll help you choose the tricaster right for you.  We're pretty happy to have the top of the line.  I got to say the tricaster to elite NewTek, N-E-W-T-E-K dot com slash tricaster.  And I think, you know, as as we assimilate the capabilities of this,  you're going to see more and more of the tricaster to elite's features be used.  We're really excited about the NDI, the network digital interface that replaces SDI  and it gives us all sorts of capability.  It's really, really fantastic. NewTek dot com slash tricaster.

Transcript:  You know what? I bet there's about to be a bunch of lawsuits, though,  because there was so much community sleuthing.  I don't know what to call it.  In the in the day's sense, the the stampede on the Capitol,  you know, all of these people and organizations are going through meticulously  every single image and every single person to identify everybody who took part in that.  And they're doing that really effectively and funneling that back up to law enforcement,  which is a good thing.  But I just wonder how many people are now going to turn around.  Like a whole bunch of people just got put on a permanent no fly list.  There are all these videos now going around showing the people who were  who attacked the Capitol at the airport finding out that they are no longer allowed to fly.  Wow. So they're all of these additional.  There's this entire sort of like swirl of media that's generated.  And I guess technically they were in a public space.  This is probably having more to do with, I don't think, section 230  or maybe an intersection in some ways.  But my point is there's a whole bunch of people who are about to find out  that they've lost a lot of their privileges and are going to be arrested and a bunch of other things  because they were identified even if they had their faces mostly covered up.

Transcript:  So. Yes, I don't think I should tell it.  But I will say this.  One of them said a military coup.  We think of a coup as having the sort of person in charge  direct the military to do whatever they want.  But in effect, directing the National Guard to not act  was also a use of military forces.  Right. Yeah.  I mean, it was a coup in a different way by methodically and actively  not having anybody show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a whole lot that we're still  yet to learn about all of these things.  And I.  I think Amy's points are really important one about  people being identified and  for all the sort of quiet  pleasure I get in bad people being called to account for what they've done.  I'm a little worried about some of the follow on effects of  the notion that we can  that everything we do in public, even if it's not meant to be done,  might someday be used against us.  And then the other thing, which is that again and again  in these situations, people who are actually not there  have been accused of having been there,  they're going back a long time.  But the Boston bombing a few years ago is such a case.  We have to be really careful that we that the  tarring and feathering that we might want to do.  First of all, don't do it to people who weren't there.  But at what point is the punishment  disproportionate?  And we're not we don't know yet in a lot of these situations.  And we have to be it.  It's the wrong time to be making laws is when you're in a total anger.  Yeah, I agree. As as the Patriot Act showed.  And we we I think this is related to the sort of  shoot and aim things we do on social media.  We should try to find ways to take a breath  and not overreact instantly.  And in many of these cases, we're not overreacting.  But I'm concerned about our.  You know, there's a certain level of anger that people  get and then stop seeing clearly.

Start time: 7962.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've talked about this before, Amy.  I mean, you were talking about it earlier.  The government is intentionally slow and slow moving and deliberative.  And while that's difficult when it comes to regulating technology,  which moves at about 10 times faster speed,  they're not such it's not such a bad idea to to.

Start time: 7981.76
End time: 8191.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, look at the the rancor and the the emotional  roller coaster that we've been on, which has been challenging for everybody,  regardless of what your politics are, happened because we faced  such an abrupt and decisive change between the Obama administration  and the Trump administration.  You know, that amount of change in government and all of the  again, that had next order consequences.  So all of the other changes that that entailed became  really difficult for us to to sort of deal with in society.  So we don't want government.  We don't want that to happen.  We don't want this level of rancor and, you know, political.  We want this amount of political rancor to infiltrate every single aspect  of our daily lives, whether that is how technology is being used  or stuff having to do with cars or whatever.  So we we actually want our government to move  deliberately slowly with less politics being a part of it.  So I think the challenge for us going forward is figuring out  how to slow everything down, literally, as we've been talking.  I'm Nancy Pelosi just sent a letter that is now posted on the speaker's website,  saying that the House is voting, but they've basically called on Pence  to respond within 24 hours to a resolution calling to invoke the 25th Amendment.  Wow. I don't know if it works that way, but OK.  Well, but but the fact that that is I don't think the point of that was Pence.  I think the point of that was a public display via using the media  and social media. And what does that do?  It further inflames everybody.  So we're we're operating government isn't.  We need to be more thoughtful.  I mean, I know this sounds like common sense, but we don't we don't act this way.  We all need to be much more thoughtful and think through the consequences  of the decisions or, you know, non decisions that we're making.  Last thing, because I mentioned Capitol Police.  So I used to be I'm friends with a person who used to be the chief police  for for Washington, D.C.  And she was telling me about the challenge in Washington, D.C.  There are I think I make this number may not be right,  but I think there's something like 27 different police forces  all operating in the district, which means that depending on like  between, you know, where they were standing on the Capitol  and the sidewalk across the street, there may be three or four  different jurisdictions, and they they slice and dice that very specifically,  which means that if if there is a threat, if something is about to happen  and you know, because you've been seeing it bubble up  that you can't have a federation of 27 different police forces  that are just going to magically come together like Voltron and save the day.  You know, you need you need a higher authority.  You need more more leadership.  And in the absence of that leadership, one has to to ask, you know,  if you're not putting government to work in a positive way,  then again, all we're left with is that it was a deliberate  it was deliberate.  I mean, what how sad is that for?

Start time: 8193.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It may have an unintended consequence because I think there's now  a bit of a drumbeat to make D.C. a state, which would solve some of those problems,  but would also guarantee two more Democratic senators.

Start time: 8211.64
End time: 8323.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and nobody wants to do that.  Yeah. Yeah. That's a that's a lot of work.  Some I'll end with a couple of good news points before we take a break.  SolarWinds has hired Chris Krebs as a consultant.  Krebs, of course, the former cybersecurity chief who got fired  because he said the election was flawless.  But I think that's a that's a good sign.  And then the State Department is setting up  a new bureau for cybersecurity and emerging technologies.  I don't know if this is going to be what you were  advocating with this Office of Strategic Planning,  but it's a step in the right direction.  CSET will help lead diplomatic efforts around security,  including working to prevent cyber conflicts with potentially adversarial nations.  At this point, a diplomatic solution to the SolarWinds hack  seems like the probably the only reasonable approach.  There's certainly no technical solution.  It's it's pretty much the worst hack anybody's ever seen.  So a couple of, I think, good steps in the right direction.  Interesting article on Substack as well by Matt Stoller,  his big newsletter where he talks about the real problem at SolarWinds was  the fact that it was bought by a private equity company, Orlando Bravo,  which immediately, as has happened with private equity companies,  cut costs, cut security, moved its programmers to Eastern Europe  and in effect, you know, created a real threat  to a security company that offers software  is used by millions of private firms.  So that's another kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm shocked that that was allowed to that that sale was allowed to go through.

Start time: 8343.66
End time: 8377.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what Stoller suggests is that when you,  you know, procure is certainly in government,  but anytime you procure a security solution,  you might want to consider who owns it and what their track record is.  This is one of the reasons SolarWinds update server's password was SolarWinds123.  It it wasn't well secured.  And as a result, essentially, every government agency  has been hacked and many other companies, private and public.

Start time: 8378.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so volatile.  We always end the show with obituaries.  The father of fiber optics passed.  He lived to a ripe old 94.  Narender S.  Kapani, a physicist and entrepreneur  who did more than anyone to make optical research a priority  in government and corporate budgets.  It's kind of this is a picture of him in 1955.  It was very early work.  It's kind of amazing, really.  The amount of data glass fibers can carry when you pass light down.  It is astounding.

Start time: 8485.68

Start time: 8487.72
End time: 8537.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In 1955. Yeah.  Really amazing.  I know. I know.  He was at the Imperial College London.  He entered graduate school there in 52.  For decades, researchers across Europe,  I'm reading from the New York Times obituary,  had been studying ways to transmit light through flexible glass fibers.  But a host of technical challenges had set them back.  He persuaded Harold Hopkins to hire him as a research assistant.  Hopkins, as a theoretician, provided the ideas.  Dr. Kapani figured out the practical side.  And in 1954, they published in the journal Nature  demonstrating how to bundle thousands of impossibly thin glass fibers together  and then connect them and to end.  Yeah. 1954. That's amazing.  Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Someday they'll wonderful.  They'll discover it. And boy, oh, boy, that'll be amazing.  Quibi, which raised one point seven five billion dollars  and then failed in six months, has sold off its assets to Roku  for less than one hundred million dollars, according to our tech.  Well, they got a little money back.  I don't know what I have no idea what Roku wants to create a Quibi channel.  I think the good news is there are Quibi producers,  documentarians and such who were cut off  with the failure of Quibi in the middle of their production.  This will give them some opportunity to finish what they were doing,  which is a good thing.  So Roku bought not only the existing Quibi library,  but anything in in production now.

Start time: 8622.08
End time: 8646.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how we know that 2021 is going to be a good year.  Because if Quibi can be revived in some form this year,  then things are looking up for us even better.  Might they might have democratic stability.  Who knows? And this pandemic.  And then, of course, we'll be able to realize Quibi's initial vision,  which is we watch those short little on a TV, finally.  But even without it, I think we'll be fine.
