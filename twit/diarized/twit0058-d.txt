Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 58 for June 18th, 2006.  Hello everybody, we are at Yahoo! today, which is kind of Yahoo! kind of an interesting thing to be.  This is podcastacademy3.k of IT Conversations, who is part of our TWiT panel today, has done this now  three times, kind of an education in podcasting, and asked us to be part of the podcast academy.  So this is the real world example.  This is it.  This is what not to do.  Let me introduce the panel, starting with Doug K., IT Conversations.  I think he's really the pod father, one of the longest running podcasters, even before anybody called it podcasting.  And then he now does dozens of podcasts every single week at the IT Conversations channel, ITConversations.com,  and the Conversations Network, and Podcast Academies too, which is really great.  That's right.  Good to have you.  Glad to be here, Leo.  Thank you.  Another TWiT is with us, Mr. Chris DeBona, who is a part of the TWiT Network, a great part of the TWiT family.  He does the Floss Weekly, which is our open source podcast.  He is the open source program manager at Google.  That's me.  And we brought you in here just to talk about Microsoft today.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  It's good to have you.  Oh, look, I got email.  It's great to have you.  Molly Wood, the mellifluous Molly Wood.  Of course, you know her well from buzz.cnet.com.  And now, starting this week, CNET TV, which is launched big, and we'll talk about that as well.  It's always great to have you.  Thanks for having me.  She's the only person who actually covers the news.  And so we rely on her for facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Yeah.  Could you bring some facts with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a high bar, actually.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When the rest of us are going, you know, Canon's getting out of the camera business.  We leave it to Molly.  It was that one time.  Oh, a familiar story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had to hear 56 to know that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  We won't go into that.  And of course, my good friend, the sledgehammer wielding Patrick Norton, who has lost all  his hair in a tragic accident with a barber clipper.  We call it aging.  Great to have you.  Should we call him the hammer?  The hammer.  You know, I should do that, you know, that kind of McLaughlin group style thing where you...  The hammer!  It's Patrick the hammer, Norton!  Molly mellifluous Wood.  I don't know what I'm going to call you.  Yeah, I want to say Chris the boner, the boner.  Did they, did they in high school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, grade school.  Grade school?  Yeah.  You make a decision really early on with a name like mine if you're going to get into  a lot of fights or if you're just going to laugh it off.  Just going to live with it.  And it's not such...  Around third grade, I started living with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's such a bad thing to be called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's worse.  Doug, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now let's get to the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As my banker relative said, it's okay to okay.  Sorry, sorry, I had to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, that's too many homonyms for me.  Let's talk about the first story, the big story.  There really is only one story this week.  Bill Gates stepping down at Microsoft.  He says in two years he's not going to be in charge anymore.  He'll stay chairman of the board, but he's already handed Ray Ozzie the keys to the car  saying you're now the chief software architect.  Good news, bad news?  The market said eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The market's holding its breath on Vista's release, I think more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and Microsoft lost something like 25% in April, so it's already depressed stock  to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think judging from...  I looked up the stock price earlier and judging from aftermarket and today, it's after hours  trading and today it's like dead even.  Like no change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is probably what all the pundits say.  I mean, it could be good, it could be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not like everybody's like, he's retiring and it's like he's becoming the chairman of  the board, right?  It's not like everybody who controls Microsoft has been hired by him and selected by him  and groomed by him.  You know what I mean?  He's still going to be a phone call away.  Maybe there's going to be less of the 4 a.m. emails with Bill Gates being like, you're an  idiot.  Why did you choose to pass with a development course on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's more important than that.  I think Microsoft employees go there because of Bill Gates.  He is an icon and I think that he is an important leader.  What are you laughing at, Mr. DeBona?  No, this is like they used to go there for Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now they go to Google for that reason, right?  No, no, no, listen, I'm not here to be all Mr. Competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that when you have a company as large and as expansive as Microsoft is  that people go there for the chairman anymore.  I think they go there because there's a project they like like the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But symbolically, Bill leaving the company is significant.  It's not like Steve Jobs leaving Apple.  That would actually the whole thing would implode.  So it isn't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it imploded last time when he left.  Well, it did.  Well, sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It came within inches of dying.  Well, true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's like, you know, but by the time they walked in, I mean, how many people could walk  into a company and affect the change he did?  The only reason he could affect that kind of change is because they were nearly dead, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, Waz says, of course, Waz is kind of loyal to Gil Amelio, that in fact,  Gil made all the changes that Jobs, you know, Jobs is the president who came in and actually  reaped the benefit of the previous president kind of story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He picked blue in a funny shape and it just happened to be the drop in the bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't an argument about Jobs.  This is about Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At some point, the job had to go to somebody.  So the question is, did they pick the right guy?  Right.  Ray Ozzie?  You bet.  I'm optimistic.  I think they picked probably the best guy they could.  The question is, is it a net improvement or not?  Frankly.  I give it a good chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it explains why Ray Ozzie went there in the first place.  I couldn't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point.  I said, why would he do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The first most of us heard of Ray Ozzie, or at least people became more aware of him,  when the big memo came out about how they were going to get into live, basically.  And who wrote that memo?  And to go on Google.  And it came from Ray Ozzie.  And people are going, Ray who now?  And all of a sudden, then a year later, however long later, you hear that this is the guy  that's taking over for Gates and it makes a lot more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there respect for Ray Ozzie in the programming community?  He created a lot of notes, right?  Very storied engineering.  Yeah.  And I wondered, why is this guy who's accomplished so much going into this kind of corporate  hierarchy?  But you know, you must have been at the Lion's Den.  I think that there was a dinner.  And I think Bill said, you know, I'm not going to stay here much longer.  I'm looking for a successor and I am going to anoint you.  What was for dessert?  See Balmer's head on a platter.  So is this good or bad for Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I agree with the stock market.  I think you can make a case that it's good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you can make a case that it's good for Microsoft.  I think, look, Microsoft has not been doing very well in the last year.  I think there have been a lot of stumbles.  I think maybe it's time for new leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, part of the question, I guess you hinted at it, is what is his acceptance, not  so much by new hires, but by the people who are there?  You mean Ray Ozzie?  Yeah.  Do people look to him as being the legitimate successor to Gates on an internal basis?  Will they take technical direction from him?  Can he set the priorities for how they should deal with security?  I don't know.  That's a big issue to be seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and how involved was Gates day to day?  I mean, does anybody have a sense for that at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand he changed the toilet paper and everything.  I think he was fairly involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he was fairly involved.  Because in some ways it's just evolutionary, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No one stays there forever.  He's obviously not going to stay there forever.  He's got the most bulletproof exit strategy in the world.  I'm going to go help the children.  There's no hint that he is jumping off the sinking ship.  There's no hint that he is getting pushed out in any way.  And so it may be that it's not going to change things that much because it doesn't seem like  a very revolutionary departure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's certainly a benefit to the world.  I mean, he's got $30 billion that he's going to give.  And, you know, he always said, I'm not going to start giving away my money until I can  pay attention to what I'm doing.  It's a full-time job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but in not paying attention, they've already managed to stomp out a couple of diseases.  They've done okay.  Three tears for film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is think what will happen when he actually starts paying attention.  Yeah, they've done okay.  So I guess our vote is it doesn't really matter.  It's a big enough company now that there is no one person that's critical to the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm recusing myself from this particular one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can, you can what?  Not speaking as Google.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's clearly interesting.  Oh, I don't speak for Google.  So it's clearly very interesting, though.  I am actually more interested in the foundation angle, though, I have to admit.  Oh, I think it's exciting.  They just got started on malaria and they could make a very real difference there.  So I mean, that's a very big disease to fight.  You know, because, you know, sleeping sickness is gone.  The river blindness is gone because of what Carter did.  Maybe you could do malaria.  It's pretty amazing.  Which would be incredible.  A million people a year die from that thing.  I know, from malaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google did launch a Shakespeare site.  I don't know if that's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that site.  Shakespeare site.  I think that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just wanted to get something they couldn't get sued over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, just this once, one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to be fair, because last week we talked about Microsoft's Windows Genuine Advantage  snooping on people and Microsoft did admit it, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's not review 57.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm reviewing it because Google's now being accused of something similar.  Which thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That they're going to sort of try to track people's online TV watching.  What's that?  Oh, that was just research.  And then serve them targeted ads.  Yeah, it's just research, but then everybody panicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess somebody in our research lab published a paper that said that, oh, we can  listen to TV and tell you what you're watching.  Big deal.  Can you imagine deploying such a thing?  What you'd have to do?  Yeah, why would you even care?  Oh, software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think someone's going to have to do it, though.  It's interesting because everybody freaked out about privacy.  That's called ratings.  But at the same time, everybody wants ads to be better.  And the way that you make ads better is to make them more targeted, make them more relevant.  I want to know what's going on.  I want to know if there's a cool product out there for me.  But the way that I'm going to be able to find that out is to have somebody, unfortunately,  watch what I'm watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's also like television's a really strange medium to try to observe, right?  Because you either put a box in everybody's television, which is theoretically possible,  but highly unlikely to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I think this is an IPTV thing.  Do you?  I mean, actually, they were listening.  They're talking about real TV?  They're talking about real TV.  Yeah, basically a laptop.  That's crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's been some interesting writing lately, the idea that the whole idea of serving  up targeted ads, and Google's one of the only companies large enough and respected enough  to do this.  That's right.  No, here's the smile.  You know, you wouldn't have to give.  What was that?  But the idea is figuring out how do you target the ex-family, right?  So you either need to figure out where the ex-family is, what they're doing.  And if you can collate all of, like, if somebody's been searching lately for minivans, and you  have the ability to target the advertising that's rolled into the video stream into their  house, whether it's over cable or broadcast, obviously, it's not going to work.  But if it's over cable, then if you know dad's been searching for minivans, and you just  hammer minivan ads at the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wouldn't have to snoop on somebody, though, to do that.  In fact, you wouldn't even have to divulge what I'm watching if you had smart enough  client software that did it.  Didn't pass it along to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how do I target you and your desire to buy a minivan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the software on my TV watches what I do and then requests appropriate ads.  Right.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't have to tell anybody else.  See, the software on the TV is watching me.  That officially qualifies as snoops.  But as long as it doesn't tell anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can just say, can you give me some Chevy truck ads?  Because Patrick, he would like to see those.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember the first time you had a conversation with somebody that ran an ISP and you go like,  so you have access to all my email.  You know exactly what I'm browsing.  And then you get the, you know, you either got one of two things, either got the evil  smile or you got the, I think of myself as more of a benevolent overseer of the bits  that run through my, you know, domain.  Right.  And then you basically realize they're saying, oh, yes, I know everything you do online.  Don't piss me off or I'll tell everyone you know.  That's so bad, though.  I mean.  But it's the fundamental nature of the internet.  Right.  And it's, you know, the bits are monitored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the internet you want to be on?  Is that the internet that people want to be on?  The one where it is the internet we're on.  Bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the internet we've been on for a decade.  Some of us longer.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I guess the question is, what's the alternative to if I, if the alternative is  me being on an internet that's constantly bombarding me with a random assortment of  ads that get ever more intrusive and ever more.  Punch the monkey.  You know.  Yeah.  There's no, if we're not willing to pay more for things and if we're not willing to  Well, that's the irony of it.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that nobody wants to pay for internet content.  Everybody wants it for free, but nobody wants to see ads.  So.  Right.  Or if they do, they want them to be targeted ads, but we don't want people to invade our

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  privacy so we're difficult.  If the ads don't suck, they're okay with the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how do the ads not suck?  You know more about your users.  You spy.  You know what they kind of are about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we are a few years after AdSense launched.  And it's one of the most amazing successes of all the advertising schemes on the net,  Who would have thought that it would work as well as it does and get as little flack  as it does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's starting to get flack.  And the more I think about it, the more flack I want to give it for a couple of things.  I'm not looking at you Chris.  Chris, you're either speaking or be looking out there.  I'm looking at Mountain View.  And actually, they just circulated a survey which I'm putting this in.  Google AdSense is Google's actually quite clever plan to put advertisements on web  pages and certainly monetize the web.  But I think critics are starting to say a couple of things.  First of all, I've noticed that the ads are not as well targeted as they ought to be.  And you put the word blog in anything, you're going to get the same four ads over and over  and over again.  Second, and I think this is more to the point, Google's not forthcoming with what percentage  of the money that they're getting they're sharing.  And I have a feeling that that may be an inequitous relationship, but we will never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I think that the way we want to think about the relationship is, is it worth the  money you're spending on your ads?  So if you're getting the return of investment that you want, then you're in a happy place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And similarly, there's also the issue of click fraud, which Google has also not been very  helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're very hard about this, but that's not my department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, again, I'm not talking to you.  You'll never get on the show again.  There's a tackle particle here about Apple and labor.  Yeah, we're getting there.  I'm just doing all the Google stuff now.  But it's not aimed at you really, Chris.  Shakespeare is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the year it's only at the sun, and rise for a sun and kill the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you know what we do?  This is really sick and pale.  We have the most non-complicated moment on the panel for the rest of the podcast.  Who likes Google Earth Beta 4.0?  Yay!  All the hands go up.  I haven't seen it yet.  You should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm too busy.  Chris and I just-  It's available for Linux now.  Yeah, we just did a podcast with Ryan Gordon, who's the porter who made it possible on  Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Deports everything.  Deports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's new?  What did they change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interface is amazing, actually.  It's so pretty now.  They've got some map data that's down to like 10 centimeter per pixel.  It's absurd.  Which would have cost you, like I was saying to Molly, would have cost you like hundreds  of thousands of dollars to get access to in any kind of volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is it the raw map data that's improved, too?  That's the whole thing.  There's significant improvements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, the program itself is improved.  I mean, it's all because of the little things that have gotten better.  Better go look at it.  I better do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What if 30% of the world's population can see their house in 3D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, 30% of the world's population can see their house now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they have internet access.  30% of the world's computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's funny.  There are some ones who don't have that.  That 30% of the world's computer.  Actually, them too.  But they don't need to steal a computer or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, 6 billion people, the people who can actually get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to get all the Google stories out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Picture David Crane giving me that phone call.  The Dales, Oregon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those of you who are listening, what are you looking at that's causing Chris such trouble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking at the new Googleplex on the Columbia River.  Is it the Dales?  Is that how you say it?  The Dalles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Dalles.  Is there a Portlander who can clarify this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Dalles.  The Dalles.  Dalles.  I've never seen a Portlander on the show.  And I've never...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I...  So it is an evil installation.  I have no agenda here.  I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Evil installations.  So Google's building a very large network operations center.  Apparently, the Dalles in this particular area is a really great area because the tax  rates are low.  There's no...  I think there's no state tax.  And it just happens to be on the confluence of all these data pipes.  It's really a great place for a network operations center.  I know the BPA.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bonneville Power Administration.  Cheap power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because you get it from the...  Well, power, period.  Power, lots of it, apparently.  And they've been building this and everybody's been sworn to secrecy.  And the Dalles, apparently, I don't know.  This is John Markoff's story in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it was a quite entertaining story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it was.  I mean, I did meet one guy who swears that Google is trying to build a hive mine.  I should have done that while you were drinking.  For Chris.  That Google is trying to build the world's largest computer brain and actually create  artificial intelligence.  And I don't know why you would want to do that if you didn't see Colossus the Forban  project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know.  Have these people seen Terminator?  Isn't that how it starts?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine hurting 450,000 Intel boxes is about the same as...  What's the chance of making...  I'm not running Windows, so...  They are running...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the first step of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you basically say, I'm putting the Terminator in open source operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't let Balmer know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's from the 6502 assembly, if I remember correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bunch of old Apple computers.  Anyway, I mean, there's nothing to say about this.  I just think it's kind of, in fact, a sensational headline that John Markoff put in the New  York Times, hiding in plain sight, Google seeks more power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Markoff's always been known in the tech community for being sort of a gentle reporter  of the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and as it turns out...  Thank you for laughing.  But still, why do you need to talk about it?  And as it turns out, the power they're talking about is the cheap power from the BPA, not  world domination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I've been involved in data center operations, and the cost of electricity has become a huge  issue.  Huge part.  I'm sure.  You know, a lot of the data centers that we built in the late 90s are going to have to  be shut down because the density of servers has gone up so much.  The amount of power used to be so many watts per square foot of floor space in a data center,  and those numbers are way out of whack now.  So the data centers we built 10 years ago are going to be decommissioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you have an AMD Athlon-based installation, I think for a standard late 90s data center,  you end up using about a quarter of the square footage before you stop growing.  Because you just can't get enough power in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't get enough power in air conditioning.  And so this is a pretty big line item.  I don't know what it is, but in terms of Google's expense thing, power is a real problem for  them, as is true for all of the large hosting operations here in the Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And just to make you happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that doesn't make me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to make sure that nobody thinks because we're in Yahoo that we are going to soft pedal  anybody, you probably saw on Slashdot, according to Reporters Without Borders, or Reporters  Sans Frontières.  I just like saying that.  What did you say?  Talking about, I don't know.  That's their real name is.  Reporters Grugle.  Yeah, that's their real name.  That in fact, the worst censorship going on in searches in China is Yahoo.  They did a study on six politically sensitive keywords, a search on Yahoo.cn, 97% pro Beijing  results compared to 83% on Google and 78% on MSN.cn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, MSN makes no comment, basically says they do know censorship, yet turns up results  similar or worse than organizations that openly admit that they censor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this George Carlin's six words you can't say online?  Yeah, Tiananmen, Falun Gong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I just think it's interesting that Google gets all the heat for this, but if you actually  do the research.  I'm not looking at you.  I know, I know.  You don't have to defend Google.  I'm going to have some more water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should have started this podcast with a list of things not to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's very interesting.  In fact, China recently stopped blocking Google.com.  So in fact, you can go to Google.com and get unbiased search results.  There are other ways to filter search results.  Right.  In fact, there are a lot of activists who are doing great work making sure that Chinese  activists can get on an unrestricted internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny, I heard that if you go to certain Western hotels, you get a regular connection.  Oh, interesting.  You get the Chinese connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Makes you want to go to China, set up a Wi-Fi spot underneath the dresser of one of those  hotels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always wondered how big the routers have to be to handle all that traffic and process  it in the manner they do.  It's a technical achievement of sorts.  Isn't it a little bit?  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's something.  There's a lot of surfers in China.  So did you see the pictures of the sweat shop, the iPod sweat shop in China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I heard about the story of course.  I haven't seen the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Foxconn is the company, one of the companies that manufactures iPods.  They're a Taiwanese company, but they have a big factory.  200,000 workers in China, mainland China, 200,000 workers who not only work there but  sleep there.  They actually live there.  And the story is that they're working 15 hour days, uncompensated for overtime.  They're making something like $50 a month.  And yet, it's so hard for us to judge this because the other side of the story is, according  to some, that's more than they'd be making in agriculture.  They're sending money home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I've got my evil beard on.  So let me give you the evil part of this.  Is it better than living out in the hinterland starving to death?  Well I don't know.  It comes up in your head sometimes when you read these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the points of this story is, and in fact by the way to their credit, Apple said  now let's hope this isn't just PR.  Apple said we're going to investigate.  We do want this to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be the big story at the Worldwide Developers Conference is that we're going  to triple the cost of iPods.  Well that's exactly right.  Apple's getting the heat for this, right?  Everybody does.  But it doesn't.  Take a look at your notebook, your notebook bag, your backpack, your clothing, the inside  of your shirt, and tell me what's made in China.  All of it.  Yeah.  And then I want you to try to figure out what people are making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's appropriate.  Yeah.  But I mean, Apple, this is a big consumer product.  The bulk of the cost of this product doesn't go in fact to manufacture or parts.  It goes to marketing.  Now we know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It works.  But I mean, you know, but it's like the whole idea of, you know, the offshore manufacturing,  part of the reason manufacturing moved out of the United States is because to reduce  costs.  Right.  You know, how do you reduce costs?  You pay people less.  You go to places where you don't have to deal with the environmental regulations.  You know, and guess what?  You know, things magically get less expensive to make.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Enough bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a story about outsourcing, not about Apple.  Yeah, I agree.  Enough bad news.  Apple is, there are two rumors about Apple.  One that they're going to do an ultra lightweight portable.  This is because they're apparently buying up these NAND flash memories in great quantities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you think it's not going to be hard drive based?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the rumor is they'll make a flash based ultra portable.  Let's start a new rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're buying them for the PDA cell phone that they're going to give you, Macworld in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now here's a rumor that you can actually give some credit to because it comes from,  coincidentally, Han Hai, who is the president, the chairman of Foxconn, the company that  makes the iPods.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's got the Chinese labor problem.  The chairman of iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do a financial services search on Foxconn and see whether or not they just released a whole  bunch of stock into the market.  It may be.  He's talking to the, I think the shareholders meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure exactly what he's, he said that the Apple is about to unveil a new iPod, next  generation iPod.  Apparently we're making it.  Touch free.  Touch free.  It's made from people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Touch free.  The little green chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is touch free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the, so it's going to be a voice control.  I'll show you what touch free is.  Watch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're touching the notebook, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well if I could throw it, if I were willing to throw it, we'd still make those sounds.  Throw it to me or to Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is going to be a great way to operate your iPod on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, this would be good when I get in the, go through the security with my  laptop and I open it up and it goes.  I have ways of, yeah.  I think they'll never let me through.  This is Max Sabre running on the new Mac.  One of the things that the new Mac book has, as actually do, I think all of yours, right,  the IBM's do certainly, is this motion sensor to protect the hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But somebody clever basically.  Clever hack.  When you basically move the notebook, the sensor detects it and shuts down the, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  apparently there's a way in the operating system to read the sensor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what you're not telling you is that's actually the sound of your hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Screaming in pain.  The other one that I've seen like that is this Mac book.  Yeah, you hit the side of it.  And you hit it to sort of switch your application.  It's context switching.  It's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody rigged it in the maps as well.  So you could like drag a map by tilting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is the greatest thing.  I think, you know, I mean, forget the hard drive.  You don't sound very impressed, Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't I?  That was my Riley impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a boy toy, I guess.  I don't know.  I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it is clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  Can you map it in any sound you want?  Can you make it so when you drop it, it goes ouch?  Yeah.  That would be awesome.  Of course you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point, taking like a thousand to two thousand dollar piece of hardware and making  it emulate a $7 toy.  Oh, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chris is doing it with his, is that a Lenovo or an IBM?  No, it's an old IBM.  But see, that's typical.  Now, there's an example of IBM software, Mac software.  Yours is a picture of the computer going like this.  Laptop going wobble wobble.  And mine is a lightsaber.  By the way, what's cool is you can see the roll, the tilt, and the force.  That was 120.  Seriously, I know I'm going to take that laptop right in the nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, dude.  It is this close.  Okay, I'm putting it there.  Let's change the subject.  What'd you say?  Microsoft apparently also going to develop now sources.  I think we're trying to steal back the news cycle from the Gates story and now say that  Microsoft is developing a music device and video, music and video device and service.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something we have service.  Wait a minute.  That's not, the headline though is iPod killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, of course.  Well, or Microsoft developing a rival.  A rival.  A rival.  You know, everybody's trying.  Then it would have community.  Everybody's trying, but only a few companies have, I think, the clout to get the licenses.  So let's review Microsoft successes in hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starting with the mouse.  Right.  Mice.  Mice and keyboards.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sound card.  Wait a minute.  Even before then.  They had a card that you could put in that would let you run.  Was that the CPM card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Yeah, Microsoft made a CPM card.  Somebody bought one of those?  Or a DOS card.  DOS card, yeah.  Let's see, I probably remember sound cards.  And obviously keyboards and mice are a different division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say that the Microsoft Apple keyboard is the best Apple keyboard is made by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use a Microsoft keyboard with my Mac at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have one now with an Apple keyboard.  And you like your Xbox 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have not upgraded.  I have the old one.  Right, you have the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Patrick, do you like anything?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  At all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The part of me is like, remember the whole, no, I'm going back.  The URGE actually is a pretty good music system.  The MTV one?  Yeah, the one that they did in cahoots with MTV.  But then you look at the plays for sure, which was like, Microsoft's like, we have all these  players and some of them work and some of them don't.  Some of them say they work and some of them don't.  Half of them have DRM support and half of them don't.  So they brought out the plays for sure sort of like thing on the box.  And nobody realized that everybody buys MP3 players by walking into a store where they  all like on the CompUSA sort of expensive thing on a stick display where it's all chained  down and you look at it and all the labeling and box labeling has been ripped off of it.  Or they mail order it and nobody cares about plays for sure because I've got still the  Apple still has 83% in the market or something like that.  Creative has these sort of inside angle by trying to sue them.  Sue them out of...  It's getting nasty now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple sued back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple sued back.  to the ITC saying the International Trade Commission saying, you better investigate Apple's practices  here.  And the ITC said, okay, we're going to investigate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop or we'll say stop again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's in trouble in Scandinavia now.  Norway, Sweden and Denmark.  Originally they said till June 21st, now they're going to give Apple until August 1st to reply  to the claims from these governments that iTunes Music Store and Service operates in  violation of Scandinavian consumer laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say that the user license, the end user license agreement is illegal in all three  countries because basically because they don't have a DMCA so they don't require you.  They don't have a requirement about not circumventing copyright.  And apparently the iTunes Store user license says that you cannot convert the files from  AAC to a non-DRM format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When in fact in those countries you can.  When if I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well that's I mean then they either pull the service or they basically make it.  You know.  Yeah.  But they can't change the label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The labels will say well then are you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're illegal to put copy protection on files in those three countries.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if it's illegal to put copy protection on but it's illegal to say that you cannot  circumvent the copy protection.  So iTunes Music Store is like you know offshore.  But that's what they said about France too.  It's the same thing that France wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to allow customers to put songs they buy on iTunes on their creative and other  players.  It's the same exact thing which only can be done if you remove or change the DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which frankly is what a growing number of consumers want too.  I mean I think it's kind of interesting that there are companies.  Absolutely.  There are companies that are sort of leading this effort and at some point one of them  is not going to back down.  I mean France did because they weren't willing to risk not having iTunes in the iPod I guess  in their country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the question becomes how much of a lever does any one country have over a multinational  corporation.  Well you know what's sad all this does is push everybody into Microsoft's camp because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft works with all these other players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah because they have an iPod killer coming.  That's right.  Well they're essentially saying make it work with Microsoft's players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See then all the iPod owners in that country can sue because of the DRM that locks them  out of the iPod.  Well you have to do both right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then that's really ugly.  Yeah.  If everything I buy has both plays for sure and iTunes fair play DRM I'm not buying another

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  song there.  The grand irony here is that Creative Merge with Gem Plus and Gem Plus is the company  that sued everyone for putting up online television guides.  Right.  So they have a very long history of not liking it when people are in their business.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's too bad too because I don't know.  I think the creative players are getting better.  It's just too bad that the you know that their business tactic is the lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This new Mobi Blue B153 has 153 hours on one battery and it has a really neat feature.  It will download your podcasts so you don't have to have podcast software on any computer.  You just plug it on any computer with an internet connection.  It auto runs any Windows computer.  It auto runs its software, downloads your podcast, puts it on the player and you unplug.  I think that's really slick.  Yeah it's clever.  And it's still not enough and that's the problem.  You have to be so much better than the iPod because of the dominance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The iPod, Apple doesn't really own that segment of the market where it's flash based.  You can kind of argue back and forth.  There's a lot more space there and I've run into a lot of people who basically they want  the FM radio or built in or they want the voice recording built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're buying iTunes songs you're stuck with them.  You gotta buy a Nano or a Shuffle right?  Or you've moved the copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I own a lot of CDs and then I convert them into MP3s.  Or you stop at eMusic.  I think they only sell in MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MP3, eMusic and Audio Lunchbox.  Magnetune.  Right and Magnetune.  But they do it without any DRM.  No DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh the Moby Blue is that cute little blue one.  It's weird.  Yeah now they have a bigger one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That actually is phenomenally really really surprising how good the audio is.  The Qt?  Yeah the Qt.  Just don't sit on it because it hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so cute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cute.  Back to that whole jewelry MP3 player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see that speaking of Sweden that Pirate Bay now is moving back to Sweden?  They said we didn't like it in the Netherlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said they missed it.  It's so different.  I'm sure it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a different language anyway.  Yeah there's something that proverbial knows.  I mean saying okay and not only that but the Swedish law enforcement is being sued by all  the other companies whose servers they confiscated.  For some reason they confiscated a lot of different servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just went in and grabbed everything and fought on the racks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand.  How can they move down?  They were shut down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you see if you have a copy of the code that runs your site you just go somewhere  else and load it on the servers and run it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a mess.  And the Swedish are never again going to when the US comes knocking, when the Motion Picture  Association comes knocking, they say you know you solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the guys that, boy I'm going to finish this sentence if I have to kill myself in  the process.  We have very capable editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kenji remember to cut out everything in between the beginning and the end of the sentence.  And at that 47 second Jimmy Stewart is stuttering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Pirate Bay basically maintains that what they're doing is not illegal under Swedish law.  Which also means that Pirate Bay could sue law enforcement.  Yes.  I bet they will.  I'm sure they will.  Those guys, they would show up in suits.  Can you imagine the courtroom antics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would that be a phrase?  They don't seem to pass up an opportunity do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Well that was the best reason to go to Pirate Bay isn't to find torrents, it's to read  their responses to legal injunction letters.  Did you see that in their reverse DNS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just going to say that.  Go ahead.  You say the bad word on your podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the reverse DNS on their server when you go to their site.  Hey.MPAAand.APBBiteMy.Shiny.Metal.ASS.ThePirateBay.org.  I like it.  Yeah.  And I like the name of the Pirate Bay spokesman who said they're coming back.  What was his name?  Oh, I'll see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  But I like their pirate bravado.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pirate bravado.  Arrr.  Arrr.  You know he should have a pirate name but it was something silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about Swedish Chef?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I'm not doing anymore Swedish Chef.  I've learned my lesson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  McSweeney's has a set of jokes for the literate pirate.  Have you seen this?  Pirate jokes for the sophisticated.  I think I can find it.  Well you know there is a pirate day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more fascinating to actually know someone that reads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk like a pirate day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the thing is you know they're a pirate supply store.  No one sent me that link.  They had to have a retail shop at the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is a pirate's favorite aspect of computational linguistics?  Pirate's favorite is parsing sentences.  Oh god.  Ah ha.  That's the last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  No that's good.  I won't do it again.  Timothy McSweeney.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For sophisticated.  Pirate jokes for the sophisticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny.  Funny stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we're just going to surf and read pirate jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what?  Yeah I'm sorry.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  We're doing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is.  No go ahead.  You can tell pirate jokes.  Why is Amazon selling groceries?  Riddle me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they can.  Is that crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What could happen to P-Pod and all these other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of the tiny little organizations that thought they were going to compete with like  the largest and most controlled.  So you think it's a good idea.  Well no.  But it was like the whole.  What was Webvan?  I mean I sat on a panel.  The dumbest panel I've ever sat on in my life.  I pulled on.  No you laugh right.  But it was like three stock analysts that were very invested in the dot coms.  And you know they're all like lecturing about how amazing Webvan is.  And I'm like it's going to die.  It's a smoking crater.  They just don't know it yet.  Right.  Because like all the supermarkets in the US operate on like 2 percent margins.  So you're going to like build a distribution system.  You're going to compete with these insanely huge organizations.  And they got crushed.  Right.  And you've got Amazon who has this great.  They're just going to.  They're doing deals and they're doing it on the back end.  They've got people like to buy stuff.  So it's like it's Amazon.  It's actually great if you can't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon they have a long history of moving.  Losing money on stuff that they sell.  Well.  Like how long it's going to become profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  True.  But they're profitable now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to admit though.  There's no way I'm going to order it because they don't sell any perishables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No it's just pasta, cereals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So why do I want to order cereal and then get it like three days later.  With my shipment.  Some people buy things in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know they could have it shipped to the house.  Actually you know what I've done.  Groceries?  Well no but there's certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean I go to Costco and I buy a bunch of stuff and I have it for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's stuff I can't.  I can't.  And anybody who's like from other parts of the country is going to laugh when I say this  but it's really hard to find sweet touch knee tea.  Which is like.  Oh you're a freak.  I'm a freak.  The way they say that I guess.  Sweet touch knee.  It's this weird sort of you know it's this weird sort of tea that you can get all over  the East Coast but you can't get out here.  Yeah.  And like chock full of nuts.  There's a good reason why.  Right.  Well maybe there is but.  And why is potato chips.  You know I've never been a huge fan of why is potato chips.  But I understand.  Charles chips.  Charles chips.  But there's stuff like that where people will buy or I will buy.  So there's like the market of.  Charles.  Charles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Charles.  I can get behind it if it's regional stuff.  Fry sauce or something like that.  I don't I'm not seeing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can actually buy sliders.  The White Castle hamburgers in frozen in a box a truck will come to your house and give  you FedEx.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's certain things you don't buy frozen.  That's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certain things you don't buy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well no Amazon's in trouble when they start putting pet food on the list.  I mean that'll that'll take us back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could still order pet food online.  It's a delivery console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The real the real problem was the kitty litter.  I mean shipping clay.  Ship gravel.  Overnight gravel.  That was what really killed.  So you see this.  I think this is just classic.  A ring tone.  Actually it's an alert tone for your cell phone.  That is what that is at a frequency too high for you and me to hear Doug.  But the kids can hear it.  In fact I could play.  You know what we'll do.  We'll insert the tone into the podcast.  It doesn't compress.  I should point out now.  It's you know the Times has it as an MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just spent a whole half a day here at the podcast Academy talking about the 11th  kilohertz low pass filter.  So it shouldn't be in the podcast no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Well can you can we turn off the 11 kilohertz low pass filter just for the next few seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Send them the file and have them edit it in because it'll get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I'm not going to play it into my microphone.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I kind of wonder if I'm cool enough to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you hear it play already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hear a whine but I think it's the air conditioning.  Anyway if you heard that then then you can get SMS messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ow.  Really annoying sound.  You hear that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're kidding me.  Do you hear that Doug?  If you hit that again.  I'm trying to tell you.  No really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Truly don't do it again.  All right.  So here I'll hit play.  Ready.  You guys hear that?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No your laptop's too low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do actually hear it.  I can't believe it.  I hear not a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Raise a hand if you hear it.  Okay raise a hand if you're over 40 and you hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually heard it.  Maybe because I'm so close.  I'm hearing it because I'm so close.  I actually heard it.  You think you hear it sir.  I heard pressure.  He felt it.  Yeah I felt it.  I felt it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's great is stop it.  Molly and Shuby, Shuby who's our new intern who is a sophomore in high school, he's covering  his ears.  These guys.  So apparently this is not a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's something.  High frequency penetration for people over 40.  I know it just falls right off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the idea is the teacher won't hear it but you'll be getting an incoming, of course if  everybody, if everybody, all the kids in the class go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The teacher's going to sum things up.  But it also doubles as a mosquito repellent.  Right?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are all sorts of things you can do.  Wait a minute.  Now you guys are teasing me.  You actually could hear something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.  I'm going here.  I could sense it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get it.  Ready?  Tell me when you start hearing it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's weird is people in the back of the room hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh this is a very, well it bounces right off of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm stunned.  And Ann, it just showed you.  I mean that's an MP3.  Ann, it's being played on a cheesy little speaker and yet you can hear it.  So I guess the notion is successful.  I mean what a wild idea.  Except I can't see that really having wide adoption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ringtone podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well there's a grocery store in England that started playing extremely high frequency noises  to keep the kids from hanging out in front of the store.  I mean I think we've got this next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I got a call on the radio show this week.  A woman was complaining because people with very loud basses were sitting in front of  her and they were rattling her china.  And she said is there anything I can do?  And actually if I'd known I would have said you could play extremely high pitched tones  out the window.  And they'll freak out and run.  I am stunned.  I didn't know.  I mean I listened to that 30 times.  Didn't hear a thing and I thought oh this is a joke.  The Times is hoisting on us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if this will be edited out and it can be.  But have you ever heard the hypersonic sound speakers?  Amazing.  They'd be great for something like this.  Just a high pitched like cannon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Woody Norris does this.  And the idea is as you walk by a Pepsi machine you don't hear anything until you get right  in front of it.  Aren't you thirsty?  Drink, drink, drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you keep going and it's gone.  And if you have an RFID chip it's Molly Leo aren't you thirsty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's targeted ads.  That's awful.  I'm taking that thing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how much do you have of this ringtone that you can't hear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh I've got a copy that I'll sign it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a scan.  There's people that can't hear it that are walking around saying oh yeah I bought that.  I think it's the Ember's Nickelode Free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you guys are all teasing me.  I don't think there is any sound.  We're not coordinated enough to tease you like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you hear about this gambling, the Washington State gambling law where they said that online  gambling is now a felony with a punishable, it's a punishable offense like equal to child  pornography.  But now they're saying that it also applies to websites that talk about gambling.  So there was a quote when they originally started talking about the law that said that  this guy's site where he talks about online gambling and links out to it is potentially  in violation.  Someone at the Seattle Times wrote a column about it and they told him that the column  itself might actually be considered in violation of the law.  I want to see that one in court.  That one is that'll never.  I'd like to see it hurry up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know you guys say this but remember what's one of the tenets of the DMCA that if you  link to something that's illegal it's the same as doing the illegal act itself.  You know you sat by and you said oh it's just pirates doing it.  I want to see that one in court too.  And now it's going to bite all of you in the butt.  I testify in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why doesn't this stuff hurry up and get to court and then get overturned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still unhappy about that.  I'll tell you something that is going to court.  Cablevision is suing Hollywood because Hollywood's claiming that the video on demand the DVR stuff  is illegal.  And so this is essentially a countersuit.  What?  Revenue streams sue it out of existence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quickly.  We don't want to make any money.  They're stealing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Call the dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hear a high pitched dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent.  Go ahead and hear that.  I didn't get to explain this one.  This is an important one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's very important.  So let's start with the lawsuit.  The 20th Century Fox, Universal, Paramount, Disney, CBS, ABC and NBC.  I think that's everybody.  MOU.  Filed against Cablevision arguing that remote storage, in other words a DVR, a TiVo like  box which Cablevision and many other cable companies sell, is the equivalent of video  on demand and therefore violates fair use provisions.  In other words you got to pay us if you have DVRs in your system.  If you allow your customers to use digital video records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this the Canadian model, anybody who buys one of these has to pay us a flat rate  like they do for media in the land of the north or is this if you actually download  our content and play our content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well I think Cablevision's deal was that it was online.  It was an online DVR.  The stuff that you record is stored on Cablevision's servers.  It's not the box.  It's a hearing.  It is like video on demand.  They were saying that it was essentially unauthorized video on demand but it's not.  You recorded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's only on demand in the sense that you record it.  It's just as on demand as TiVo.  It's not stored at your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  It's stored remotely.  They want it to be like Betamax and say this adheres to the Betamax decision.  It's a VCR or DVR setup.  So I'm sorry I misunderstood.  So that's the difference is you're recording it on their Cablevision servers.  It still has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean it still has pretty far reaching implications.  Certainly like if the studios win this one it's a little disturbing because it sets  up a precedent about recorded content.  That could eventually apply to your box at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Comcast ships you a DVR as part of your deal.  Is that the same thing?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think any of us who love our DVRs don't want them.  We shouldn't give these guys a chance.  Save TiVo.  Save TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go Cablevision.  Cablevision is actually a very forward looking company.  I like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're like one of the smallest cable providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're small but because they are Manhattan's cable provider, New York's cable provider.  They are influential.  They are very influential.  They're very technologically savvy because they have a dense small market that's easy  to roll stuff like this out to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting too because I didn't actually when I first heard about the Cablevision DVR  proposal I wasn't that interested.  I was like oh well I don't want to store my stuff remotely.  I have a DVR.  I have my TiVo.  But now I'm like go Cablevision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love you little guy.  I think it's not a bad idea.  The thing is I bet you they're not really recording anything for you.  It's essentially putting a little marker.  They have everything right?  And it's putting a little marker saying oh Molly wanted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the technology itself could be on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I doubt very much they're making unique recordings for every person.  Why not?  Because why?  You all use one recording of every channel and you can give it to Molly and Patrick.  You don't have to have a separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But how would you get that content and be able to keep it without having to license  it?  I don't know Hugh Heffner used to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the storage problems are more problematic if you're trying to record every channel you  distribute on the local servers than it is if you just try to record with people.  So you're going to buy one of these Blu-ray players?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung is shipping finally.  A thousand bucks.  Ten available titles.  Ten movies.  Good ones too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they're not shipping in the US until the 25th.  Well okay that's what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was on Netflix the other day and I noticed they're shipping HD DVDs and they said they'll  ship both Blu-ray and HD they couldn't care less.  So they already have like a whole whack of HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the ten Blu-ray titles ladies and gentlemen just so you know what movies you'll be able  to see on your thousand dollar player.  Thousand dollars.  Fifty first dates.  Fifty first dates.  The fifth element.  That's a good movie.  Like that.  Although pretty old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there's a reason they released that.  That's one of the standard.  Almost everybody who tests HDTV they spend a lot of time going through.  It's very pretty.  Hitch?  Yeah.  Why?  Because a lot of the same thing with HD DVD a lot of things that did not quite do as  well as they wanted in the theater they're trying to gain back.  Actually I have a different theory about Hitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because what are they going to lose more money on it?  They've got it it's sitting there.  Might as well put it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  House of Flying Daggers I could dig that.  That's beautiful.  I liked this one.  A Knight's Tale?  I love that movie.  I'm with you man.  I'm so with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Heath Ledger.  This is a great movie.  Really?  Yeah it's scrappy and stupid and funny.  But he's kind of like got this New York accent but he's a knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Paul's last name.  I think we should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul Bettany playing Chaucer.  And I liked the blacksmith chick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was great.  You know?  The scrappy blacksmith chick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah they were.  They went through the whole incredibly stupid modern music.  I'm sorry he can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll put it in my queue but not in HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put it in your queue.  It's like Apple Blanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put it on your Netflix list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll put it in my queue.  Well the selections on HD DVD have been because I've been getting a lot of HD DVD movies because  when we reviewed that and the movies they're picking are incredibly random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's totally random.  And listen The Last Waltz, okay that's a good concert film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the best.  No no no.  The Last Waltz is I think the one they're talking about is the other one.  The one with the J.Lo.  No no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're talking about a J.Lo movie?  Yeah.  They're talking about a J.Lo movie.  Not the band?  No no.  You're talking about The Last Dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well wouldn't you rather I protect you from that movie?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't ever release that on HD.  Resident Evil Apocalypse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not the original.  Wait wait wait.  So that's two Milla Jovovich movies out of the ten available.  Interesting.  Maybe there's something going on here.  A Samsung Milla Jovovich.  I think she's actually, she's in charge.  She's running Samsung.  She runs everything.  Or Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Triple X, another movie that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't have Milla Jovovich in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does not have Milla Jovovich.  That's got Vin Diesel.  So she's in 20% of all these Blu-ray titles.  She's in them.  It's cool looking.  It is cool looking.  I just, a thousand bucks you know.  They say that we'll sell everyone we make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just can't understand who honestly, even if you don't want a PlayStation 3, why wouldn't  you just buy that?  Instead of a standalone player that costs as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the DVD players based on gaming consoles, they either suck a lot or they really, really  suck a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it suck $600 a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is early adopter territory.  This is not rational purchase.  These are people with gold American Express cards and nothing to do with staring at the  same 15 films on the HDDVD downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the really big Milla Jovovich fans.  Or.  Could be that too.  Or Vin Diesel fans.  Vin Diesel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how many times have we talked about a new technology and we said, oh, $1,000, who  would pay for it?  And years later, everybody's buying.  And everyone does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But watch, I can do this.  At this point it's like.  And you paid $150 for that black thing?  Yeah, $150 for black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that it matches you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see what it looks like between now and Christmas.  Movies slated for release on Blu-ray include Basic Instinct 2.  Two, not one.  Two.  Stealth and, well, The Terminator.  I'd like to see that.  Terminator.  Oh, oh, oh, the ninth film, ultraviolet, third Milla Jovovich movie.  Oh.  Okay, there's definitely something going on.  There's something going on here.  You know?  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's something going on.  Come on.  I think we've even got a scoop here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's see, let's see.  Three.  Early adopters, consumer electronics, geeks.  Boys.  Milla.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's a little, it's thin.  She probably had a cameo in Basic Instinct.  That's all I'm thinking.  Is that the thread that holds it all together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we got to watch all these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somehow I suspect there's, is she still married to Luc Bisson?  Yes.  Oh, she is.  They got a divorce.  They got a divorce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Boy, this has turned into a gossip.  I know way too much about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a gossip program.  I would believe that Luc Bisson might have a wife.  I think I'll be buying a Blu-ray player.  This week in entertainment.  So is Sony going to drop the price on players at Thanksgiving or are they going to try to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  force everybody on the PS3s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is, I think you're right.  I think this makes the PS3 a much better deal.  Much more exciting.  I mean, you know, it's still $600.  It's still $600.  It's not cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's still, $400 is not small potatoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung's making it look like it's a cheaper deal, a better deal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  As long as there's a format war, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody's going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there's one, it's one thing to be an early adopter, but to willingly wade into  a format war at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix is going to support everything because, you know.  Up to a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I've actually heard is that porn will decide this and porn is all about Blu-ray.  You know, people always porn porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Porn is all about Blu-ray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, porn is for Blu-ray.  Not HD DVD.  So I've heard that some other studios are saying, well, I think we're going to get  behind Blu-ray because porn's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  Huh.  So what killed Laser Discs, they say, was that they weren't willing to allow it for  a, eventually it did, but initially they weren't willing to.  Too late to save it.  Too late to save it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it was such an easy format to store.  Whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like your laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're good weapons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never saw TheRing or Fear.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Ring is the other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you ever see that?  No, the reason I mention it is there's a...  Mila Jovovich is in the way.  No, there's no Mila Jovovich connection to this next story, but there is a worm called  Black Angel Bee which spreads over MSN Messenger and what it does is it says, the message is  on the first day you get scared, on the second you get desperate, on the third you look for  help and on the fourth you die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't decide if this is a great hack or like some 14-year-old kid that needs to be  kicked in the head.  I'm just picturing them giggling.  There's only one problem.  It's in Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because wasn't The Ring seven days or was he too lazy to think of seven days worth of  things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it would go right over my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there's a picture.  It's actually a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of freaky.  Who reads Spanish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't understand how you can do such good accents and yet fail to fake it when you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  reading Spanish.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That Russian accent was unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't speak Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the French.  I can do an accent.  I can't speak it.  Wow.  There are actually a couple of them.  Does it actually delete anything though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's what really matters.  No, it just spreads itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then it kills you.  Oh, and it makes it so that you can't...  Yeah, I mean, you die, so...  Oh, it makes it so you can't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's at least like a level seven.  A mega level by level 7.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes it so you code purple by virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's code purple virus.  You die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to Panda, you can't use your control panel.  So that's it.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You won't be able to add a printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we were talking about Netflix.  I'm curious about this story about Netflix patent on queues, for rental queues.  They're suing Blockbuster.  Blockbuster.  What does that mean to people like IT Conversations that have a queue?  You have a queue?  I think you should sue them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just a queue for movies.  Go to them and say, listen, I'll go and testify for them unless you pass me some knowledge  of up and down.  The Blockbuster...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they knocking on my door right now when I'm not home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Blockbuster executive said it's akin to a hamburger joint saying, we patented the  idea of a drive-through.  Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like the idea that you could patent the idea of creating a list of movies in the order  in which you want to view them.  But in their defense, that is the thing that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think drive-throughs work.  How could you get that passed?  That's the thing that makes Netflix so cool.  I mean, it really is the defining...  Isn't it the defining feature of Netflix is that you make this list and then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, other than the fact that you've got deliveries of the mail and it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But others have done that.  I think the thing that's addictive about it is this maintaining, massaging, creating your queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you say it's obvious or non-obvious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, then isn't that the crux of patent law?  To us?  Would anyone ever have thought of this?  Did you say the patent system is broken or non-broken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel bad for Joey Ito because he...  I don't know if he's going to be able to put his screenshots on Flickr anymore.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's a big problem, I guess, on Flickr because everybody's putting up their screenshots from  World of Warcraft and Second Life as if it's real life.  Like, oh, a snap of me and my paladin friends.  But you know, this is...  But then Flickr's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the problem that's been killing things like the motion picture industry now.  You know, you go out to film...  Screenshots?  You just got to shoot on location and you've got to think about every single thing in the  background.  That didn't used to be the case.  This is a big problem if you just capture things coincidentally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think it's because people don't have...  I'm trying to say this the nice way.  They don't have the nerve anymore to just tell people, why don't you get the hell away  from me?  You know?  Like, suppose you were filming out here in front of Intel and they send security guys  out there, hey, you can't film in front of our building.  Get the hell away from me.  Oh, I like that.  Make them call the police.  Here's the weird thing about this Flickr thing.  Well, they can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the interesting part.  Yeah, but with film they come back afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  After you've gone and you've made some money.  See, here's the problem, right?  It costs so much to defend yourself.  What we need is a lot of rich people saying, get the hell away from me.  You know?  So that then they can't be sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there any rich people listening now that would like to go annoy people with a video  camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have all kinds of ways you can annoy people.  Do you?  Do you have a list?  I have a list.  This sounds like a good one.  I wish I was rich because I love annoying people.  You could blog these ideas.  You could.  Things for rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could have a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you call Mark Cuban and say, Mark, I've got an idea for you.  Oh, he's pretty annoying.  Yeah.  He's got money and lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He might be the guy.  He might be the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every day a new annoyance.  It's funny because, you know, I think I was in Uruguay Gardens and I was taking photos  and I was like, you can't do that here.  I'm like, go call a cop.  And he just looked at me like I was the alien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lawyer who's actually put together a pretty good set of guidelines for what you  can and cannot legally film.  Because a lot of times security guards come out and tell you to go take a hike.  You can't photograph a building.  Actually, you can.  There's a lot of things you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, don't they say right of way, they have those signs that say right of way,  can be revoked at any time, like you're in a mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't Uruguay in the center?  I mean, you're in there.  I'm okay with them throwing me out.  This is the thing.  If they're right, throw me out.  If you're wrong, I'm going to come after you.  No, the problem is.  Throw me out.  Throw my car.  Get me arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're out on location.  Bixler Corps is out on location.  They're filming something.  Behind them is a poster.  And that poster is copyrighted, licensed, whatever material.  That's annoying.  Right?  But it happens to be in the location.  And now this is something we never used to worry about in that kind of production.  You have to blur it out now.  Yeah, you have to do a lot of stuff.  You have to blur it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although, getting back to the Flickr thing, the one weird thing about this Flickr thing  is that Flickr is not saying that the screenshots that are taking them down has anything to  do with copyright.  If they made that argument, it would be annoying.  It's not even about their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an aesthetic question.  It's even weirder.  Yeah, it's like they're saying that we're only for photos.  So here's the other side of it.  It is their site.  They can do anything they want.  It's a free service.  My internet and I'm going elsewhere.  I think it's their business model.  And that's okay.  It is.  You should go elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they shouldn't do that.  They're not really taking them down.  They're just not making them searchable or showing us the whole thing.  It's not public.  So you can still have them on there and so forth.  I think it's also interesting that increasingly our snapshots are not of real life.  They're of our virtual lives.  That's kind of yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't get into the hotness.  I'm sorry.  I'm afraid of World War II.  So tell us about your virtual life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, Second Life is the only place I look good in a Speedo.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you ring the Speedo today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not.  Okay.  One last story.  Microsoft says there is a critical hole in Windows 98 and ME.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're not going to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the shocker.  And the end of life that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did anybody complain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The end of life is in July.  They extended it.  But it's a significant flaw.  And if you basically their response is upgrade XP.  We will not fix it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have to rewrite it.  They're going to end support anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't blame them.  I don't blame them except for how many millions of boxes, unattended and somewhat attended  boxes are running this.  It's not merely for these individual users.  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We did it.  We talked about this on the Buzz Out Loud podcast and we polled our users and said, write to  us and tell us if you're still using 98.  The emails are still coming in.  So people listen to this podcast.  I mean, we talked about it early this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Comment if you are still using Windows 98 or ME in case you have to, in case you just  happen to.  I think there are a lot of comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, please.  Hey, it's for the 57, right?  57 almost broke the server.  I can help you with that.  Yeah, thank you.  Do you know anybody with server space?  I got some extra money on my hands.  Yeah, okay.  Actually, I know about your 20% project.  It's kind of related to that.  Oh, let's not go there.  All right.  Did you see Netscape's dig ripoff?  I did.  I actually asked to...  Kevin asked to be on the show, but he couldn't be here today, so maybe we'll have him talk  about it next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick, would you like to be Kevin today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, I have a quote from Kevin because we were talking about this on DLTV  yesterday.  We also, I should point out, have the people, the Silicon Valley homebrew mobile phone crew  on the show.  Oh, cool.  Oh, you had Matt Hammack out.  Yeah.  Hammack's a really neat guy.  But Kevin said, this is a direct quote from Kevin, loosely interpreted, they really should  have waited until next week because there's going to be a whole bunch of stuff they want  to copy when they watch 3.0 next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin's showing selected members of the press, including, I think, you and me on Thursday,  the actual site.  I have to say, by the way, Jason Kalakannis, who is running this Netscape thing, was on  the podcast last week.  Didn't give me a scoop.  But anyway...  Oh, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Rose says, I feel bad that AOL cloned us right now.  When they see dig version 3.0, they'll have to redesign their site.  Nice done.  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is still a beta, so they can incorporate their copy changes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kalakannis' remark was that Netscape didn't copy dig any more than dig copied delicious  or...  They copied dig.  They even got the little rectangles.  What do we expect them to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a total copy, but who cares?  Who cares?  If they do it better, they'll do well.  They have four times the audience of dig.  They have 800 million page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is there a patent filed in there that would change the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hopefully not.  Why is this so hard to find this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get this.  www.netscape.com.  No, beta.  www.beta.netscape.com.  You can't just say beta.netscape.com.  No, you need the www.  But it is essentially what Netscape is, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the new Netscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple of things are different.  First of all, they do have editors.  So the top of the page is editorial, but you can't vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what's the top story?  Hooters wants to pay FEMA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want FEMA to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they have this weird rotating carousel at the top, which is the Netscape recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's their editor's choice.  And then below that.  How bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have the voting top stories, which so far every time I've come here have been about  dig.  And on the day it launched, it was Netscape copies dig with a big picture of Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well obviously, it's dig users that are going to be using this first.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I don't work for dig or Netscape, but I'm not really that mad.  You know, they do some things like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, it's hard to care about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  Like, really?  You're right.  Let's go back to Windows 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do I care about that Windows 98?  I use it as a little pop-down feed headline.  How many people are using Windows 98 or Windows ME?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Windows 98 or ME?  Oh, we still have more than I thought.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think people care about that more than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got more than half a dozen.  The point is not so much to protect users themselves, but to protect the network.  If you have millions of machines using this unpassed operating system.  When did you get the check from Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quit listeners if you're using anything old in an XP update now.  No, I'm not saying they should update.  I'm saying Microsoft should fix this.  Okay, I just want to make that call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying.  I mean, no, there's far too many machines out there that's not worth paying any money  for to put XP on it, or you can't, but they're still in use.  They're still on the net.  And because Microsoft refuses to patch, this is a public health hazard, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should they patch it if it means that other, you know, that Vista and IE patches won't  get done or that XP and IE patches won't get done or Vista won't come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've hoisted these operating systems on us.  They have responsibility to keep us safe.  It's only built out of the money.  I think the war chest is still large enough in Microsoft that they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think other companies have abdicated past, you know, past versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's always an end of life, but it's different when you have, you know, 500 million copies  from around there.  It's very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  In that country, sure.  I mean, I think until this point, people have had the sense that they took that responsibility  pretty seriously.  I think this is the first time they've said, look, I'm sorry, we've got to write it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need to run 95, though.  We have copies of Ubuntu here for anybody who's...  Just take that install.  If you're on 98, take this.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe that's the solution.  SUSE.  SUSE.  Get everybody to run Linux.  I guess we could take some questions from the floor if you want to talk about this week's  news.  Or from the people on the floor.  There are some on the floor at this point, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The floor is a witty questioner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not questions about podcasting, because we'll do those for after the broadcast.  But if you have questions about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any questions on this week's...  Nothing.  They couldn't care less.  They have nothing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you'd think this bunch would jump up to plug their podcasts.  Say, hi, I'm Michael Goheba from Real Radio, Real Reviews.  What's the matter with the applause?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great radio?  Does John C. have a blog?  Blogged out of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You almost did it, though.  Reflexibly.  He's famous for doing that on this.  Yeah, I guess he would be.  Yes, he would be.  Do you want to talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not sure.  Go up to the microphone over there.  Yeah, otherwise...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't worry.  Before the microphone.  Otherwise, the audience is taking a word for saying the fact that there is a live audience  here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's an answer.  I heard him laugh.  No, no.  We dubbed that in.  That was edited.  Come on.  That's a laugh track?  It's a laugh track.  You heard our audio editing.  Yeah.  That Leo does not know what he's doing.  Actually, I want to thank there were a lot of Twitter listeners.  I put the raw tracks from last week up.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was cool.  And a lot...  And I haven't been able to post them all.  I was surprised about 30 different people took the challenge on it.  And every one of them did a better job than I did.  Did they do the whole show?  They did the whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so explain that for a second.  Well, we can do that later.  But the fact is that there were some audio problems.  You put up the audio for people to do a remix, essentially, and see what they could come  up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they did a great job.  That's also the sign of how many unspeakably cool people are out there listening.  We have some great people, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going to be our new test for audio engineers is to send them your show and say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Save this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you can fix this, we'll give you a job.  Remember, Patrick, if you can read this, you can get a job.  Remember on the subway?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was one guy, though.  I thought there'd be more joke edits, but there was only one.  I looked at it and said, this is only three megabytes.  What could it be?  And the entire podcast was Patrick saying, welcome to Twit...  What did you say about sending marsupials on fire?  The marsupials on fire thing.  And then I said another Twit send the can, and that was it.  It was over.  The essence.  Did that post it?  Because I want to download that.  I will send that to you.  I should post it.  Make it to ringtone.  I think it was a very good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  My question was regarding Windows 98.  My son has a vast library accumulated of software that only runs on 98, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm not going to spend the money for XP and then try to go back and find these educational  titles that I've accumulated over time and bring it up to snuff.  What was the vulnerability exactly?  What am I looking at here?  Just unplug him from the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I'm pretty sure that it is a it's preventable by firewall.  What I read.  Yeah, it's a problem, but it's it's a serious flaw.  But if you have a firewall, you should be fine.  Is the last I heard about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a flaw in Explorer.  Don't use IE.  And it could let an intruder commandeer a vulnerable PC.  Microsoft's recommendation is use a network firewall that filters port 139.  Fireworks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or a router would do it.  No, not Firefox, because it's just a router would take a net router would take care of  it.  It's a net biosport vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want you to buy another Windows XP box used as a firewall.  It's all the Windows 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  That's a great idea.  So if or just take it off the net.  I mean, really, that's I think ultimately that's what's going to have to happen with  these Windows 98 boxes.  They're no longer Internet suitable.  Right?  Probably true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And thank you so much for encouraging me to podcast my passion because I have.  Oh, good.  What's your podcast?  101 uses for baby wipes.  I know I get a lot of laughs from the titles, but you know what?  I got 20,000 subscribers.  So that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice to meet you.  That's great.  Yeah.  The new podcast, Expos, next podcast, Expos in September, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  Podcast Academy 4 will be at the Portable Media and Podcast.  Are you going to do that?  September 28th, Ontario, California will be there.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  I guess I guess I better go.  Yeah.  Oh, well, we'll make it a party.  Yes, I better go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  So the aspect of the Bill Gates story I haven't heard yet is when the next head of state comes  to visit, who promises to fix their computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I doubt Ray Ozzie will be doing it.  And you certainly don't want Steve Ballmer anywhere near your computer.  He might fix it like Patrick would with a sledgehammer.  No, no, he's the chair.  A chair?  Yeah.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  We don't have the head geek chief of state, the geek of state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I wonder how much longer Bill will do the keynotes at CES and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, that would be sad, because I think that that was the one thing that made CES fun.  Bill Gates performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Watching him fall apart year after year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people had said that Bill, Jerry Pornell said this in his column in Byte.  I've heard others say it.  Jerry said that at Winhec, Bill was unusually downed and seemed like he was really enjoying  himself very much.  I've seen others say he was, quote, relaxed.  I think Bill has been kind of dialed out the last six months.  He's, this has been in the literature a lot.  You think he knew this was coming?  I think so.  I think he's ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shubi.  Hi.  About Netflix suing Blockbuster.  Blockbuster does have one key advantage over Netflix.  Every month you get two of those free video game or movie coupons.  So like it's for people, if you can't wait for your movie, go to the store and rent for  free.  You know, I got a DVD in my Cheerios box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Netflix doesn't rent games, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  Right.  So they, so if you want games, it's Blockbuster.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Netflix needs to start renting games.  There are a number of game rental services.  Gamefly.  Gamefly is really good.  I want one stop.  One stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should be all in one.  I am so lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  You know, Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to do that.  You know, mail it off and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  I think that, I think that's one of the, maybe that's what they should have patented is that  really what people don't like is about movie stores.  It's not so much lazy.  It's just, it's like too much.  You've got to look at every box and you can't really decide what you want.  And then you get a fight with your wife over, should I get this?  You want the, do you want, you know, 50 last dates or do you want, I think it's better  to do it on Netflix.  Chris, now I get a fight with my wife.  She wants control of the queue.  Who has control of the queue in your house?  My husband and I argue over the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He has control of the queue.  See?  And just today, some dumb movie showed up.  Yep.  It's the equivalent of the remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, wait.  How hard is this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who has the control of the queue in your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every box and box you can have to it.  No, we both do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You both do the queue?  Do you have queue meetings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he has control of the queue, but I am too lazy to go in.  I mean, I'm pretty sure I could add to the queue, but I would have to go there.  Like go to the computer.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, we have a five-year-old.  I think that we're just so exhausted.  That's who has control of the queue.  No, no, no, no.  Well, we have a couple of things in their firm.  I think we're just so exhausted.  The last thing we're going to fight about is if in the event we get enough time to watch  a movie, you know, by the three that have been sitting there for a long time.  Three dusty red envelopes sitting on the fireplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm Netflix's best customer.  It's been at least five months since I've sent one back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They love you.  They love you.  And they throttle Molly because Molly and her husband are going to be like that.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  TV.  So, isn't that, wait a minute, I just want to point this out.  All five of us are Netflix customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I'm not.  Oh, you're not?  You're not?  I support my local video rental shop.  Good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You probably live near a cool one and not some crappy one.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I drive to the really, the place I go to is in the middle of San Francisco.  It's a pain in the ass to get there.  Which one is it?  It's actually up at Tower Video.  Oh, you know, it's nice.  There's a really fun night in the Mission, too.  No, well, Night in the Irving is great.  Like, La Video.  Yeah, La Video.  To go to that, you have to commit yourself to sort of a 45-minute park eight blocks away  and then you have to walk back.  You have to fight.  They also have the really, like, the classic snarky video people who are like, you hand  them a video and they look at it and they're like, oh, there's so many other things you  could be watching.  Yeah, there are four of them.  There's facial expression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Netflix doesn't judge me and I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are four better Milla Jovovich movies.  If you're really a fan, you'd know that.  All right, we're going to wrap.  No, no, no, no.  Please.  Yes, please.  Do not make me sick.  Look at this on the cover.  I like that kind of video, Star.  One more lightsaber before we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just have to look out for Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will.  All right.  All right.  I want to thank Yahoo for giving us some space to do this and Podcast Academy and Doug K.  for letting us be a part of your event because it's really been a lot of fun here.  I want to thank Jason Kalakannis for not coming tonight.  Was he bad?  No, I thought he was great, but apparently the audience was a little annoyed.  You know, it's the Brooklyn Axis.  I thought he was great.  He is who he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's who he is and he has his opinions and he gets them out there.  I thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they can only take one John DeVorek at a time.
