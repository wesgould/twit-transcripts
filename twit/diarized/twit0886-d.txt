Transcript:  Walk your policy wonk. Yeah, that's exactly right. Well, it's great to have all three of you  it's really nice to come back to the show with a strong panel because  Well, you've heard of brain fog. Yes, it is it is real. It is real. And so you'll forgive me  I've been getting for some reason I don't feel like I have it, but I've been getting dates wrong all week. So  I said, you know silly things like the Lisa came out in 78 or  2001 a space odyssey was in the the 70s. I knew better than that  The chips act has cleared Congress  Which is a big deal for the tech sector still to be signed by the president. No reason to think he won't  This is 52 billion dollars among other things 52 billion dollars in funding for domestic semiconductor  Manufacturing some people have said this should have passed years ago  China has in the meantime kind of taken over for semiconductor manufacturing  But I noted the TSMC the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company is already open to plant in the US  Intel was waiting to break ground on its 20 billion dollar fab in in Arizona till this passed. So this is this is a  Important not only for competitiveness, but also for supply chain issues  Shoshana you cover DC. Do you cover these kinds of stories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some of my colleagues work on this kind of stuff  I do have concerns just any time the government jumps in to make something more competitive and it can sometimes  You know displace private investment, which we don't want to discourage but more than anything, you know, even despite my concerns  I think it comes at a really good time noting that you know, we'll get chips while there's an avocado shortage  I mean sorry  We have too many avocados there have been some stories on it I thought we had too few avocados  Recently, yeah, there's too many. So if any a time more to make this happen, it would be now more chips is now a

Start time: 449.64
End time: 476.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Necessity so but that's it. But actually kind of is an interesting point  They're putting the thumb on the scale and government moves at a different pace than industry  You know the avocado shards a perfect example  The FDA inspectors were mad at Mexican avocado producers because they threatened some of the inspectors  So they cut off Mexican avocados which caused a shortage and then I guess what happened to the they they turned the faucet back on  I

Start time: 491.20
End time: 528.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't know that avocados were one supposed to be coming from my faucet. I'm going to talk to my  Try to take as much as they can so I'm gonna make sure that that's fixed but um, but yeah  You know just I do worry about government putting its thumb on the scale sometimes and I know that's my libertarian bent  But it's it's genuine. It's from a place of like, you know  When we didn't allow baby formulas from from abroad and then our few corporations producing it  We're having trouble and then the FDA is like, oh well, we can we wait we can wait oops  Maybe we should approve these ones that are totally fine and just have different labeling. So I'm always thinking about it in that perspective

Start time: 529.55
End time: 547.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah appropriately  But at the same time and we always have this debate especially with the technology sector and government  On the one hand, I don't really want the technology sector to regulate itself  But on the other hand is government the right way to do it  But I don't know what other solution we have right we this is a

Start time: 548.66
End time: 631.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really weird scenario too because what we're talking about and this was obviously this passed with with some support from both parties  It's the strange combination of on the one hand it is the government giving money to  Intel and I think to TSM see for some American fabs  and that is that is handing money to a  for-profit corporation just right out of the government and that that goes to that that that has those echoes of like  Airbus getting European subsidies and Boeing crying foul and all that at the same time though  There's this perception that China itself is funding all of its chip gains in China  Which is dangerous some view because of not only  China's increased prowess but the fact that Taiwan semiconductor is basically number one in this space right now and if you eliminate  The need for Taiwan semiconductor to be number one  You're also actually eliminating potentially one of the things that keeps China from invading  Taiwan so there's geopolitics stuff going on here, too  And I feel like maybe in this case what brought the Republicans over to the chips act was a little bit more of the  geopolitics of we need to have  American chip fabs and not just have everything be in Taiwan and China  Rather than the kind of corporate welfare aspect of it because it is that but it's also this other thing

Start time: 631.40
End time: 652.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and I think it was and I'm sorry to interrupt you Jason  But I think you know to that point I I think and it might be in this first story actually  I think it was criticized by Bernie Sanders for being what he called a blank check  So a giveaway  To some of these very large companies. Yeah, he said that exactly. Yeah

Start time: 653.98
End time: 665.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these companies are massively profitable as we're going to discuss momentarily  It's funny when you get Bernie Sanders on one side and conservatives on the other side agreeing on something. I don't know

Start time: 667.23
End time: 667.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What that's

Start time: 668.78
End time: 698.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a win for Biden. Yes, I guess I guess Bernie does not look happy here. He's very very unhappy  About this, you know, and I agree that you know giving  Is Bernie says 76 billion dollars to one of the most profitable sectors in the country?  Does seem like a lot but hey, you know, it's also important for competitive it competent  Competitive it's also important as you point out Jason for geo  political issues

Start time: 699.02
End time: 737.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know. I mean, I think the truth is that I think fabs have not been  I mean, there's a reason that the fabs aren't built in the US anymore, right?  And there is a reason for that  And so what they're trying to do here is provide this extra incentive to say no, no  No, we really want there to be fabs in the US and if you're not gonna build them of your own free will  What if we sweeten the pot a little bit and I get that from a strategic standpoint  But it does always make you do a double-take because as Shoshana said, you know, you're also it's the government intervening in a market and basically  Distorting the market by saying we will write you a check  For you know for no reason other than that. We want you to build your fab here instead of in another country. Yeah

Start time: 738.30
End time: 781.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we can all agree though billions to this is good net billions to the National Science Foundation  for semiconductor manufacturing research, this is you know in a way this has been a  Because of Apple investing so much for iPhone production with TSMC and Foxconn and  They're getting the benefit because they're taking that money  TSMC has done that to really improve their processes to get down to five and three nanometer processes  Thanks to this big influx of money from Apple computers so they can build chips with the iPhone  I think maybe this is a fair place to put money  NSF for semiconductor research because we do need to maintain competitive  We do need to maintain competitiveness. So I think that one is probably nonpartisan

Start time: 782.44
End time: 826.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny too because you think about how Intel has just badly misplayed everything the last decade  Yeah, and they continue to do so and although they're making some changes, you know, why did Apple go to TSMC?  Well, one of the reasons is that Intel for a long time had the policy that they weren't going to make any chips that they  Didn't themselves design and so and then they kind of blew the design and as a result they fell behind TSMC  So I agree I agree  It's great to see some investment in pure  Pure research because that's one way that you end up with people in the United States who are on the forefront of chip  Technology and that that leads to them going into industry and that's a more more of a kind of  Fertilization approach to this rather than writing a big check so that Intel builds a fab in Phoenix

Start time: 827.84
End time: 932.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile Intel's quarterly results not very good  This was a big quarterly results week for all of the tech companies Intel  announced that they  Revenue declined 22% year over year  Revenue missed the market consensus by 14%  So that's why the stock market punished them. This is I always have to explain nobody we don't care about  How the stock market feels about this what we care about is how this indicates how these businesses are doing  But the stock market thought they'd do better and Intel shares went down 10% when they came out with these results  454 million dollar net loss  Compared with a net income of 5 billion in the quarter a year ago. That's a big shift  Intel not doing well at all gross margin down  Basically Intel's suffering and  Now you got to really say you are we giving money to the wrong company Intel and when it announced this also announced that they  Were killing their Optane  memory business  Which I you know remember reporting five or six years ago  This being the future of memory this what do they call it tri-x stacked memory  Super fast. It was being used not only for RAM, but for kind of RAM based SSDs  There it's gonna cost them 559 million dollars in  Excess inventory they made too much and  They're writing it all off. So that's one of the reasons Intel didn't do very well  Wow  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Billions of dollars make up for this poorly managed business is going down the tubes the 3d x-point technology  I you know, I don't know if this is  a  Slam on the technology or an Intel's management of it  They had stopped producing Optane storage products for client PCs  They sold their NAND business already to Hynix SK Hynix  you know I've  Offline chatted with Alan Malvantana who is our SSD expert ended up leaving PC perspective and going to work for Intel  About this and he says it'd be a little bit politically difficult for me to come on and talk about it  But at some point we will get Alan on  To explain is it is it a problem with 3d x-point technology itself?  Or is it just miss management a mismanaged business, you know  Pat Gelsinger said the industry has shifted to something called CXL based architectures  Which I guess is  Preferable to cross point. I don't know  They sold the fab to Texas Instruments so they can't even make this stuff, but they're still stuck with  hundreds of millions of dollars in inventory  Wow  Wow  And weirdly  Tom's Hardware is pointing this out last week  We saw initial tests of their next generation Optane memory modules their DDR5 modules crows pass  They will not now debut even though we saw the results last week. So  559 million dollars down the tubes  with Optane  Should we do better stories happier stories?  Apple's quarter was a little bit better  There's this guy named Jason Snell does these beautiful color graphs, whoops  What happened? There we go. Does these beautiful color graphs?  Eighty-three billion dollars in revenue

Start time: 1063.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was a record third quarter for them and yet everybody's sort of like breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn't a bigger downer

Start time: 1070.52
End time: 1089.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is one where services shrank right services down I  Sequentually on Mac sales down 10% iPad sales down 2% iPhone up 3%  Services were up 13% but not as much as historically they've been up  That's one of the weird things about tech is you can have growth, but if it's not fast enough, that's bad

Start time: 1090.12
End time: 1275.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah because services actually did still grow by 10 plus percent, but it was down sequentially and that hasn't happened in two years  Some of this is supply chain base  Right like the Mac has had a record run and it went down this quarter a lot  But when you ask Tim Cook and they do a call with analysts after they do the results, you know  what Tim Cook says is  It's entirely based on a lack of supply that they assemble most Macs in Shanghai  And there were Shanghai COVID shutdowns during the quarter and just before the quarter started that meant that they basically couldn't make enough Macs  And if you tried to buy a Mac in the last three months, you know this because they were really hard to get certain models  were very hard to get so  Some of it. I mean, that's not the worst problem to have say  Oh, yeah people really wanted to buy our stuff  But we didn't have enough for them is better than nobody wanting your stuff  And of course wall street was relieved that the iPhone sales were okay  Because the iPhone is half of Apple's business at least and on you know in most quarters and that it was not down  They were you know, because I think the the stock market's been so rough lately, especially in the tech sector  I think all the analysts were really relieved that apple did okay. And again, okay for apple  It was still a record third quarter for them. Okay for apple is pretty great for just about anybody else  But there were some of these signs and they said in their in their talk with analysts afterward that in certain areas  They definitely felt like there were macroeconomic issues that were hitting their products not on the iPhone  They said literally if you looked at the iPhone you would never imagine there were any macroeconomic issues  But in wearables of all things it seems like they felt like there were people who are like  Yeah, i'm not going to buy an apple watch or i'm not going to buy air pods. And so they took a hit there  but you know, it's  generally  Uh, I I would say it's a good quarter at least by apple standards  Maybe not a shooting off into the stratosphere quarter, but the third quarter is never really one of their best and and they did  Okay, and they had all those supply constraints and that you know, it was a little less than four billion dollars  They figured that they left on the table because they couldn't sell product because it couldn't make it fast enough  So it's a weird. Yeah, it's a weird time for them  But again, I feel I always get the sense from the apple executives that they're a little bit embarrassed  To to be making so much money and doing so well when things are so volatile  And I also one other note I wanted to mention which is foreign exchange  We don't think about this a lot or if you're an american you may you may know  The dollar is strong right now or if you go to europe right now  It's kind of one-to-one with euro, which is great  If you're a tourist really bad if you're apple because apple's based here  Uh, those foreign exchange rates mean that they can they can see you know, four  Five billion dollars less in a quarter just based on foreign exchange  And although they do currency hedging and stuff to try and balance it out  There's only so much they can do so that the line of the of the week was from the cfo of apple lukemeistery who said  They had they faced a cocktail of headwinds, which is quite a mixed metaphor, but he's not wrong. I love that phrase

Start time: 1276.44
End time: 1292.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A cocktail of headwinds  So you you named them?  supply chain  Uh, so demand exceeded supply. They couldn't make enough. They could have sold more if they if they could only have made them  uh recession  Hurting customers so they didn't want to buy apple watches

Start time: 1293.10

End time: 1315.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't drink the headwind cocktail by the way, it doesn't sound very pleasant. Don't recommend. It's just going to make you sad  Although it's apple it may make you very rich though. It didn't make the stock market sad

Start time: 1315.16

Start time: 1318.98
End time: 1327.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they were really worried that apple was going to take a tumble like the other tech  Stocks and again like for apple. It's a little sluggish. But again apple sluggish is not anyone else's sluggish. Yeah

Start time: 1328.78
End time: 1330.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1331.42
End time: 1392.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meta oh baby  Meta not happy right now  um  Let's I i'll get to the meta story in a little bit because uh, mark suckerberg is already is bracing people  He had a all hands meeting last month in which he said  Get ready for an intense period  We'll get to them. They didn't announce any results this this this week. Did they I don't think so  uh, so let's get through the um  Let's go through the other results. Microsoft had a fairly good  uh quarter  their uh  Revenue fifty one point nine billion. That's up 12  Operating income twenty point five billion. That's up eight percent net income  16.7, you know you make 60 you make uh in three months in 12 weeks you make 16.7 billion  I think it's a good day. I think it's a day to celebrate  uh  Some things were not up xbox gaming was down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the uh, I think azure and cloud was up  Microsoft muddies the waters a little bit in their in their quarterly reports because they they mix up all these businesses into  Into these weird kind of categories office commercial products and cloud services  That's like that's a category but that was up nine percent  Office consumer products and cloud services up nine percent linkedin revenue up 26 percent  So a good quarter for microsoft oem revenue on windows down a little bit that that's because the pc market  Suffered from supply chain issues just like the mac market  xbox down six percent  Now the big story I think across the board is search and news advertising revenue  Google got hit  Microsoft got hit um  Revenue  Including i'm sorry excluding traffic acquisition costs, which is a big exclude up 18 percent surface revenue up 10 percent  So a good quarter for microsoft  It's kind of a a mixed bag all around  amazon  Jumped on earnings, uh, they beat the revenue and have a rosy guidance for the third quarter  Is there any is there a thread to all of this dan patterson?  Is there anything you can conclude from this kind of mixed bag of quarterly results from big tech?

Start time: 1479.92
End time: 1543.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's that's hard on the one hand, uh, this could be  Related to an economic downturn and a recession and these macro economic forces on the other hand  Uh, you know when I talk to people inside of tech firms, it's just anecdotal  I'm trying to get a sense, you know barometer a sense of how people at these companies think and feel and  There is kind of this sense that we have turned a corner and we're perhaps in a new paradigm or a new relationship  With large technology firms where they have kind of saturated the market and each of these companies while they're undergoing different challenges  They are all kind of  facing the same existential  Reflection and they they are  Pulling back they're changing or altering their business and looking for new markets  Uh, so it it's hard to answer your question leo because I I don't know  But I think that there is a sense within technology that things are changing and it might not simply be related to  Uh the recession and and other factors

Start time: 1544.46
End time: 1578.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe looking, uh towards software companies as opposed or content companies  As opposed to a big tech company's comcast for instance  Which had an overall good quarter had to report that they had zero growth in internet subscribers  And zero growth in peacock their their premium streaming platform  Uh, that's not good zero growth in isp customers and peacock. That's not good  Comcast owns a lot of other businesses which yeah probably propelled it in other directions

Start time: 1579.42
End time: 1635.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a rough time peacock. I mean it's premium right they do a lot of giveaways  And they have an ad business and on peacock. So it's not quite as dire as that. But yeah, there is  vulture did a poll recently of a bunch of  industry people about streaming services and  Peacock was right down there by the bottom and the question was like can this  You know is are they going to buy something else or merge with something else because peacock is  Problematic it's not terrible but and I think they did a good job with the olympics  But yeah, they're not setting the world on fire and see clearly they're not selling premium subs  They may be getting viewership through the the free or cheap version where they're doing ad sales  And then they're making money on the ads and maybe that works for them  But the the premium level where people are shelling out money just so that they can watch peacock stuff  Flat um is tough. That's a real tough one. Yeah, and joe in our chat room is is acquisition. Yeah

Did they call it tim jobs? Did they call him? Yeah  Yeah, I met him apple. It's fine. That's brain fog. Yeah  Was saying something like we you know, yeah, we're not against acquisitions, but we want to make sure they can be folded in  But there have been rumors that they might buy  a  troubled netflix

End time: 1712.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was less  Down on purchases than he's been in a while and that doesn't necessarily mean anything but it makes you wonder  I mean everybody who is an expert in  Uh in the streaming biz and here's my plug for my podcast downstream where I talk to julia alexander about this because she's an expert  Every other week  Everybody expects more consolidation. It's going to happen apple's got money to spend whether they want to do stuff like  buy somebody outright or whether they'd rather spend that money on  Like sports rights and stuff like that because they've done some of those deals and they're more in the works is unclear  But it's hard to imagine in the long run that  Peacock and paramount plus and hbo max right like all of them are just going to be there all on their own

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a really good point  And I think that a lot of companies have kind of forgotten how to do the subscription model  Like not even just in this kind of stuff, but I forgot it might have been bmw. That's now having like a subscription for heated seats  Yeah, it's nuts. But all that kind of stuff. I think they're they're  re they're reinventing the wheel and doing it poorly  In a lot of cases and that maybe companies who kind of know this stuff a little bit better have done this stuff for longer  Or just have a better handle on it might be likely to acquire but then you get into like the ftc stuff and the antitrust stuff  And like oh well if they acquire anything then they're a big evil company  So I think there's some competing forces at play  But I do think a lot of the struggles kind of stem from people forgetting how subscription can work how it's likely to work  And that like, you know, I have netflix and hulu and I'm not going to go for paramount  I I get disney just so I can watch the simpsons  But it would be great if I could just subscribe to the simpsons or see, you know, something like that people are I think  Kind of just the reinvention of the wheel is going to get old  Just like the shiny object era of social media got old in that same way

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's gonna get people to uh, you know to just completely stop all kind of stuff like that  But I think you might see people be like, all right  I'm not really using this so that comes off and that's kind of where the subscription model suffers

Start time: 1813.82
End time: 1836.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know how they're trying to solve that is with exclusives, right? You you even said it I subscribe to what is it disney for the simpsons?  uh  That that's what people do or describe for the mandalorian or or for you know marvel  And that's right netflix tried to do they've been struggling a little bit lately because they haven't had that tentpole property  You know stranger things didn't drive a lot of subscriptions  um

Start time: 1837.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it's a real challenge because you can churn it's fairly and it's really hard to churn your  Cellular or your cable company or whatever, right?  It's hard because there's like you got to get new hardware in streams, isn't it?  So easy to turn streaming and I know I talk to people who say well  I'm not gonna i'm gonna keep three at a time  But i'm gonna rotate through them and then the idea there is if it's if it's this is actually one reason why you're gonna see  A lot more streaming deals for live sports  Because what you can't do with live sports is say i'm gonna wait for the whole season to end  And then i'm gonna binge it right like you can't do that with like oh  I'm gonna wait for the baseball season to end and then i'm gonna watch all 162 games, right at once like that  You have to be there for the whole season right or the whole nfl season  But for these others, I think that that's what's happening is instead of it being  I'm gonna just pick three and those are gonna be my ride or die streaming services  It's gonna be more like the live action star trek just ended on paramount plus  And like I heard from a lot of people who said, okay  Well, i'm dropping off of that and i'm gonna go on disney plus and get caught up now with moon knight and miss marvel  And you know get ready for the new star wars show and that that's their strategy is just kind of picking and choosing and it's so  easy to churn  Through those streaming services. It makes me wonder if one of the  Forefronts of streaming in the next few years is going to be some big discounts if you lock in  Uh for a year. I mean they're experimenting with that now  But I wonder if they're gonna yeah if they're gonna push that even more because i've done that i've done a couple of year  Long deals and there does come that moment where you're like, well should I cancel this?  Oh, i've got it for another seven months. So it doesn't matter and that's uh, that's kind of brilliant if you're the streaming service

It changes colors  Now you've got your pantone color for your business. Of course, we do too. It doesn't change that but it adjusts hue and luminance  So it's easier for people with vision issues to read  So user way will generate alt tags. That's one of the reasons it needs ai  It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that matches the picture automatically you can go in if you want you can modify it  Of course, it fixes violations like vague links fixes broken links  Make sure that your website uses accessible colors  And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website.

This is  Okay, you sport ball fans have to help me here  This is I got you. This is this is this the games that aren't in your market. Is that right?  Yeah

Start time: 2345.50
End time: 2382.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  It's it's a package the direct tv has had for a long time and they pay a lot of money for it basically to drive people to  Get a satellite dish on their roof because it's the only way that you could get out of market nfl games  So if it's a local team on a local channel  Then you can't see it and if it's a national game, it's not on there, but it's every other game  So if you're a packers fan and they're playing, you know the buccaneers on a sunday morning and you live in california  How do you see that game? And the answer is nfl sunday ticket. So they they use that to drive huge amounts of  Direct tv installations, which was a really smart move for a long time. Well, it's back up

Start time: 2384.00
End time: 2397.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spent a billion and a half for it  But they've been losing money on it big time it is not it's not good  So they're not going to renew it. It's up next year and  NFL says they want two and a half billion. They want a billion more this time

Start time: 2398.10
End time: 2423.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it never really made sense from a financial direct financial perspective  It made sense in the in the idea that they were doing customer acquisition and I think that  It's kind of gone by the wayside  So guess what the nfl rather than doing what they could do  Which is a direct to consumer product which they actually launched or they announced last week called nfl plus  which is  Kind of not that interesting. Um, because it's only on phones. It's basically what verizon and this is so

Start time: 2424.40
End time: 2431.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2442.20
End time: 2446.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2447.50
End time: 2455.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  I'm sure there are workarounds  I mean there are also workarounds where you change your dns and you can get nfl plus to show everything because it's their international product  As well, but people are not here to talk about that. I have friends who've done that silly

Transcript:  It's lasted about six months start up where you had vertical video  That was hollywood's idea of quibi quibi  Tick tock remember and uh, and that was the flaw with quibi. You couldn't put it on your screen, right?

Start time: 2484.16
End time: 2488.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, whereas the nfl thinks that putting it on your screen for a foot a whole football game

Start time: 2489.02
End time: 2496.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is probably what you want to do. This is how I want to watch a football game  Just just like this just like that just like you're there so nutty

Start time: 2497.48
End time: 2508.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so here's the thing though much you do. Do you like I get such a kick out of it  It's the same reason I like the snapchat hot dog. It doesn't make any sense  It's like this is their like main thing and it doesn't make sense

Start time: 2508.74
End time: 2552.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so it makes sense. It's greed. It's money money money money money. That's what because here's the thing  They could make it nfl plus the replacement for sunday ticket and sell direct and they would get the money from their  From their customers directly, which is actually pretty good money  So why don't they the answer is because somebody will pay them more than it's worth  Because of extenuating circumstances because they want to build out something else like direct tv did it so who who's up next?  Well, it's apple and amazon because they are making video  ecosystem plays that don't have to make direct financial sense because they want to get people to use apple tv plus  Or use prime video and that according to the new york times

Start time: 2552.86
End time: 2588.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Add one more to the mix. Who else is as big as apple and amazon and has other reasons they might want youtube  So sure apparently youtube now is going to be the third party trying to buy these two and a half  billion dollar rights  To the nfl sunday ticket and by the way apple's already started to buy they have major league soccer  They have friday night baseball apple sees this and is it what you were saying?  Because you obviously cover this and they're rumored to do college football too. Yeah, you you got if you're going to watch live sports  You got to have that package. There's no other way to do it

Start time: 2588.29
End time: 2691.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  If you're a fan of anything that is on a particular service you're going to be motivated to get that service and that  has value beyond the  Monetary value like if you're apple and and why do you get friday night baseball or why do you get the mls?  One of the reasons is maybe people will convert and they'll pay they're still giving away friday night baseball  They're not even charging for it yet  But what you are doing is increasing the number of people who know how to get apple tv plus onto their tv  And once you do that the next step is you try to convince them  To you know, you're in the ecosystem now you convince them to watch ted lasso or you convince them to watch severance or whatever  It is right. It's so they've got this ulterior kind of ecosystem motive  Amazon is similar youtube would be similar and for the nfl you're like  Well, we could build this great direct-to-consumer business and it would make sense in the long run  And I think in the long run they will do it  But it's very hard to say no if somebody's going to give you an extra billion dollars  For to be the middleman, right? I was like, okay great  Let's let's do it. And so that's what's going on now. I mentioned college football  All the college football rights are churning around right now too. A bunch of them are coming up  And although espn and fox are the big players there  That's another case where there are these ecosystem companies, especially like apple and amazon who are interested  In being a part of that because again live sports is something that you can't  Cycle through and then binge in a in a hurry. You got to keep paying over the course of months and months and months  By the way, amazon's got the nfl now too on thursday night. That's right. It's an exclusive for the first time. Oh, yeah  It is it's exclusive. It's gonna have al michaels  They hired al michaels part of the problem was finding a partner for al michaels that he would want to broadcast with

Start time: 2710.66
End time: 2731.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually the nfl is the best at this of anybody because they have a standing policy that if it's your local team  It has to be on broadcast tv in your local market  So if you're a 49er fan and the game's on amazon on thursday, it'll be on one of the local channels in san francisco  If you're out of that market, you will need to watch it on amazon prime video and it's there is kirk herb street

I think it was the nfl crackdown on people sharing gifts of their stuff like  Yeah, isn't that absurd?  Yeah, right and I don't think they know how how benefits for them work like it's no no one's like oh here's the gift  You know like i'm gonna just not watch the game now, right? I've seen the gift. What do I need that for? Yeah, right  Right, and I don't trust them not to mismanage it because of this  I I feel like they're really bad at seeing the forest through the trees  um, and also one thing that I kind of don't understand just as a  Nerd who's not a sports person? Um, I watch truner classic movies a lot and I love tcm  Yes, but you have to buy it with a sports package now and i'm like well  Don't you know? Why would you need extra incentive to buy sports?

I mean there is a particular posture that a number of um  Crypto zealots  Adopt and they they chose to adopt this posture which was  Which is to be enticing and warm and try to get you to cover something when you pass most other pr agencies know  Okay. Yes, you're super busy. You get stuff going on. Don't worry. We'll talk the next time we have a story  That's just the way it functions  and  Their posture was to get very  Um, I mean they use swear words and they tried to go over my head to my editor who was also like very eye-rolling  They tried to go to a different department and to to get a story on the air  and I mean they like  Look, it's a small company. We all talk to each other and we generally have have a similar editorial policy and  When you start behaving like that word goes out and I mean we might have covered them a couple months later  But through a different pr agency it was it was just a very aggressive posture  And it was one that that is not unfamiliar if you've covered the crypto space  I think anybody any reporter who's covered the crypto space has probably encountered  Pr agencies that only cover only rep crypto and behave like this.

Well, because it's not legal in most states if I don't why do you mean why wouldn't I?  uh  It there's something going on isn't there?  Uh, and and you know, I think back to the super bowl remember that larry david ad  Where uh was it ftx or it was one of the binance was one of the crypto companies  And and the whole idea was larry david is this boomer somebody my age  Who just doesn't get it and he didn't like the wheel and he didn't like toilets and he doesn't like bitcoin, you know  That's just they don't get it  And uh that I find that kind of offensive  Because I think I do get it and that's the problem.

Transcript:  Uh overall it is it is tough to I mean so they're spotify's number one. I I assume  Oh, yeah  For sure and compete but it competes with apple and this is one of those examples of competing with a tech giant  Who's got an ecosystem play when you are a company dedicated to that thing is it's tough, right? Like because spotify has to compete with apple  And apple doesn't have to compete with spotify apple can just apple can lose money  Apple could lose money like spotify loses money until the sun blacks out  And it would be fine, right?  Like it would be it could just keep doing that and I just it strikes me that spotify has to make a business at this  And and bless them because you know, they are an independent business and this is what they're doing  But it's just every time I see this  I think how rough it must be to have your your closest competition be a company that is a minor  cog in a giant tech giant and that they you know that you have to prove something to your investors and  You know does apple music get called up they don't even reveal apple music stats  They just don't care and spotify has to has to do this every quarter and and go through this rigmarole

Transcript:  I've always thought google shouldn't have been allowed to do youtube that apple shouldn't be allowed  In other words apple shouldn't be a content company  It should be a hardware company that makes software too  Maybe but not a content company youtube should be a search company  Not a content company if if you had those more clearly to eliminate delineated lines amazon should be an online retailer  Not a streaming service and it's because those lines are blurred that you get them competing. I guess there there is an antitrust  Idea here a doctrine here that that's what happens when companies get really big  They get a monopoly in one area  They can become too powerful so that when they enter other areas you can't compete against them  And I guess in a way that's exactly what's happening. Isn't it?  I mean, it's the cart the cart is left the the barn is left the horse is left the cart or whatever, but I mean  There's no horse. There's no cart. There's no barn. It's over.

Bye. Bye  Uh, so what does spotify do as any sensible company did they invested heavily in podcasts and audiobooks and stuff that  The record companies don't control that hasn't kicked in yet. So spotify is I think very vulnerable  I mean the fact that they have  433 million users 180 million subscribers and they're still losing  197 million dollars a quarter that tells you something

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure  But I will say this about spotify which is I admire that spotify has gone it alone against tech giants  Because everybody's got their own music service. He has guns got one  Google's got one and apple's got one right google's got two or they did have two now. They have one again  I don't know and they and they're number one like I really admire that and they've gone their own way  What gives me pause is just I look at these losses and I think  How long can they keep it up because I do like that they're the number one  And they're independent and not one of the tech giants like good for their world because they've created a better product and they have more users

It's it's the uh, ai voice platform used to simulate val kilmer's voice in in the recent top gun  sequel  Uh, that's 91 million dollars and then 117 million dollars  For find a way which is a digital audiobook distributor.

Yeah from an open standard to a closed standard  And the problem is they can draw if they pull advertisers along with them  They take all it happened to blogging too, right?

Transcript:  And I think they're trying to draw analogies with with this. I mean this wasn't a huge deal  It was like 400 million  But I think that they're trying to say look if if meta is going to pivot to virtual reality and this company makes apps  For virtual reality has the potential to be the instagram  analogous to instagram, uh type of purchase and I think that this was the ftc, uh,  Just asserting itself in ways that maybe it regrets not doing so in the past

Transcript:  And I think this is exactly what antitrust is all about a company that has dominance in one market using its market dominance  to enter a greenfield new market  Using its power its its uh, its money to take over that market. That's exactly what antitrust is all about shoshana  Is this overreach?

Transcript:  My view it is and I understand people who disagree but for me it should be about protecting competition broadly  um, I don't think that uh that there was a ton of evidence that this was  You know even like the instagram thing but you know in my view even that comparison is a little off because instagram was starting  To fail before meta took it over. It was tiny. It was a billion dollars, but it was a tiny

Transcript:  Yeah, I think if I remember and I might be off, but I think their numbers were going down  It wasn't looking so great and facebook revived them and even here. Um, you know people complained about uh,  For me when it's about monopolies, I guess it has to really be about monopolies  And it's strange to me to say oh they can't get involved in something else  It's one thing if they were looking to acquire maybe twitter or something like that  Or doing things that would force quit twitter or something else like that to be under them  But when they're getting involved in new markets, um, you know, they can represent new competition in that market  Um, so I don't really have an issue with it. Um, but one thing also just from a government standpoint  It worries me that you know, she was going against internal ftc people  She wasn't really on the same page with her staff  And I think that's really important for leadership of any agency to kind of act as one as that's a little troubling

Transcript:  I agree staff though has been accused. You know, they dropped the google prosecution. They've been accused of being a little lenient  Uh, and of course she's been accused of being uh,  Over aggressive so maybe there's a happy medium just to make maybe make this clear within does supernatural  Which is a very popular, uh, uh  vr app

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vr exercise how they know how well it does they know exactly how they have meta has a competing app called beat saber  So, yeah, it's as if you know, I mean this is oh we have beat saber  Let's just swoop up the whole market for the idea here is you set up an app store

Start time: 4762.94
End time: 4872.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the first to market really at this level with a platform like this  You know the big the the big competition is coming, you know apple's coming  You're gearing up your meta you're doing this  And you can look at your app store data and you can look at your usage data and say what are the hits and then you're like  Well, i'm gonna buy the hits because this is how you figure out how to be successful in vr  Is try a bunch of stuff and see what works and clearly supernatural works  So make and say they want to own it. The argument would be make beat saber better compete  Instead of buying, you know, uh, well and I think what they're really doing here is trying to prevent supernatural from being built for  Apple's vr platform, right?  Like they they don't want their competitors to get a killer app and the end result I think to shoshana's point the end result  If you allow this is that somebody else is going to build something a lot like supernatural  That is going to be on apple's platform and it's going to be a killer app on that platform because supernatural doesn't exist or  Meta if apple's really successful meta is going to be like  Okay, we'll be on apple's platform too with supernatural because we want the money like that that's competition and so I I don't I mean  I get it from the sense that they're trying to say we don't want apple  Apple's platform to be as competitive with us as it would be otherwise on another level if they buy this  It's so early somebody else will make a supernatural like thing on apple's platform or any other competing platform  And it'll probably be okay. That's a good point  That's the i mean, it's great. I mean I do again it's the moxie of facebook though, like I admire again  I'm here. I am admiring corporations, but like what what a scam what a deal you you set up an app store people come up with apps  You find the hits and you buy them and then you say ha ha we all we own all the hits right?  That's what they're doing

Start time: 4873.30
End time: 4884.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, I guess you could say well then they bought instagram and so all these competitors to instagram popped up  No  As soon as facebook bought instagram, that was it they owned that market, right?

Start time: 4884.96
End time: 4925.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess the difference here is that we're talking about a potential like the apple thing  Looming here is like they are gearing up for war, right?  And this really is isn't it and they and they don't want they know that supernatural if it is a standalone is going to  either  Going to be like a triple a game maker who makes a deal with sony or microsoft, right?  Like for an exclusive they're going to have upper hand and they're going to be able to make a lot of extra money and charge  Facebook meta extra money or apple to get an exclusive  It's probably limited and then in the end it's going to be on both platforms and  Like why would you do that if you could just spend a few million now and never have to do it?  Because you own it and that's what they're I think they're gearing up for war here

Start time: 4926.44
End time: 4942.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the ftc knows that and that could be one reason they stepped in rightly or wrongly  I'm not advocating for or against this  But I think that they also understand that there is a war coming and they can set a precedent  Or they can do nothing which also sets a precedent, right?

In fact, you've got a list of your favorite hiking gear if you're a  Big hiker. Oh excellent. Yeah, look at all that  I uh when we were in alaska, we took a little hike  On a tiny little island where junah is beautiful island where we were told there are four bears per square mile  There are more bears than humans on this island  So the guy who led the hike had bear spray strapped to his chest like ready to use  He had uh, one of those uh air horns on his back. So  And he said whatever you do if we encounter a bear do not run they're faster than you  To which I replied well, they I only have to be faster than you. I don't need to be  Faster than the bear.

So kim kardashian and kylie jenner actually made a video  Saying instagram really sucks. What has changed? Uh, it used to be all about photos still photos  And now because of the success of tik tok, I think it's pretty clear  Meta their parent company is saying well, can you be a little more like tik tok?  So every video post turns into a real  Instagram's algorithm promotes videos over photos  It's I mean, it's really clear when you use instagram that it's all about videos now and that's a little bit  disappointing  Instagram has backed down a little bit  They they they what they said is some people are seeing a different instagram  Because we're trying stuff in ab comparisons now adam mosseri says, okay, we're not going to do that  Because we heard we heard from the jenner's and the kardashians  And we're not going to open to full screen photos and videos because that's too tik-toki

Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah, he overruled  Yeah, I mean what they're doing is shifting from like algorithmic sorting  But it's stuff you've already opted opted into which we're all pretty accustomed to almost every social network uses algorithmic sorting  To algorithmic discovery, which is what tik tok pioneered is so good at doing facebook has all of this incredible data  So they think they can be pretty competitive  But look everybody I talked to at facebook says that zuckerberg and the executive team is just terrified  I mean the blue app is also changing like this isn't limited to just instagram and the blue app saw declines  Both in revenue and and active users in the last year face

End time: 5288.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an expectation users have and I think you're on tik tok  The expectation is you're going to see the algorithm because you know, I mean I follow people  I never see their feeds, but I see everybody else's that's fine  uh, but your expectation on facebook is you're going to see  And I think instagram you're going to see the people you follow and what they're up to that's why I use  Instagram I stopped using facebook. The algorithm is the enemy. I think but maybe they they just so worried about tik tok

Transcript:  I I don't I understand why they want to be like tik tok because tik tok has proven to be so effective  It is even better that it's like the greatest  Zuckerberg's got to be kicking himself right because he's like he he is a social media mogul  And somebody else invented like an even better way to turn your smartphone  Into like the ultimate dopamine hit in your hands, right? And it's like, ah, we didn't do that. They did that  And so he's like, okay. Well, what do we have? Let's look around instagram. Yeah, we'll just make instagram into tik tok  Like I get it. I totally get it  Uh, it's a more lucrative market. It is what the the kids like  Like uh, it they're they're of course  You're going to get stuff you want to see if they know everything about you and they're monitoring your behavior  It's kind of brilliant  At the same time  I just think it's a shame that they have a perfectly good or what was at one point a perfectly good product different product  Called instagram and they've decided sort of to just kind of cast it away and I wish they would come up with a more  You know  I would like it for them to come up with a way either in a separate app or with a separate interface and I know  They've done this with the your follows part of instagram to say  Instagram is both things but sometimes I get the sense that instagram is not going to be both things  It's really just going to be the new thing and if you like the old thing and you're here  Yeah, if you like the old thing and you're here for the old thing too bad just too bad

Start time: 5373.62
End time: 5431.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's instagram has jason exactly to your point is it has shifted from being a peer play app that had core competencies  To being a tool that is used to play defense now if we remember especially, you know per earlier discussions  Facebook was really good at fending off competition. They acquired other companies. They killed companies when they had to let's look at  Snapchat for example  I mean their growth was stalled because instagram and facebook successfully mimicked their features and they used instagram as a tool  To beat other companies and for the first time in a long time maybe ever  Discounting discord, but for the first time in a long time  There is a competitor to facebook  Meta's products that they can't do anything about  They they seem to be fairly impotent and and when I talk to people inside the company  It seems as though the thing that's causing them the most anxiety  Is this inability to respond to the competition?

Start time: 5434.18
End time: 5470.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They both facebook instagram and twitter now all three have non-algorithmic  Feed choices right on instagram you can on mobile anyway, you can click following  Twitter has latest versus home  And facebook this week announced that they're going to give you a truly chronological  Feed the people non-algorithmic the people you follow in order  Isn't that all three companies saying yeah, we hear you you hate algorithm  or no  They they're going to do algorithm because the people who aren't vocal

Start time: 5471.32
End time: 5518.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spend more time on the algorithmic feed. That's exactly it's like the nerds and it's not necessarily nerds like us  But it's the nerds of the platforms the social the completists the ones the ones who want to control everything of the thing that they  Love to hate it, right?  They always hate it  But they're always going to be more casual users than there are nerds and the casual users don't aren't completed  So they want stuff floated up. It's more effective. It makes them more money and as a as a  social media nerd on twitter, let's say which I am you you gotta have that moment where you just say  Please just let me watch it the way I want do whatever you want to do to the rest of them  But let me have it the way I want it and and you know, we'll we'll see but yeah  Because they know it works. I mean, that's the truth of it, right? They wouldn't do it if it made them less money  I mean

Start time: 5520.73
End time: 5573.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry  I like the word completists too  I think that really is what a lot of this is about the people who just want to see everything their way  You know really have that control  It's a good way to put it because I can I definitely have those instincts on on platforms that I use a little bit too much  But um, but I think you're right about the algorithm thing like they like it  But at the same time I think with facebook, too  um  Facebook's always try and metas always try to do everything at once  I mean even if you go on facebook now  There's like 10 000 little apps in there that you can integrate into other stuff like farmville isn't much of a thing  But there's still alternatives like that  And I kind of wonder if them not valuing instagram as much as kind of an extension of that like oh well  We need to beat out this other thing  So let's just model this into this other thing and have it become something else rather than like hey  Maybe this is our competitive advantage in a certain way that will compete with them by being different

Start time: 5573.54
End time: 5608.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think at some point they phase out the non-algorithmic?  Feeds they're just doing that to appease us completists and then eventually because the money is  You know to me it's expectation. I'll say it again a tick tock  I don't have any expectation of seeing everything  I go there for quick entertainment hits and I swipe through it and I don't care if the people I follow show up or not  They have a for you page  And a following page ironically, I still don't see the people I follow on the following page  Uh, I know this because I follow my son who is a big tick tocker and I don't I don't see half of his videos  So I know it they ignore what i'm saying

Start time: 5609.36
End time: 5619.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I feel like there is a use case though, right?  Like I think it won't go away forever because there is a use case which is you need somebody says  Oh, did you see that thing I posted on facebook and you're like no

Start time: 5619.40
End time: 5685.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my expectation of facebook and I think this is what facebook started it with  And on instagram too is i'm gonna see the latest pictures from the people I follow family friends  Brands whatever and i'm gonna see them in order and that's that's what I want  And I do think that's the expectation. I don't think it's the expectation on tick tock, but I do think it's the expectation  On instagram and facebook now twitter, maybe I use both so when I when I  When I haven't been on for a while, I'll use the algorithmic feed because it shows you the height  Part of this is how well the algorithm works too, by the way  If the algorithm is sucks doesn't matter but the algorithmic feed if I haven't been on for a while  But if it's the middle of the night or it's the middle of the night and nobody I know is up  But on the other hand if i've been checking regularly, I want to see the chronological feed  I want to see the latest tweets because I don't i'm afraid that they'll the algorithm will filter out stuff. I care about  So I like the choice and on again, that's three different expectations  One expectation for instagram meta one for tick tock and one for twitter and why should everything be the same?

Start time: 5687.36
End time: 5711.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why choice is good, right?  And and because because there is a use case for it, I think to answer your earlier question  I don't think it's going to go away entirely  But I think for people who love it and think it's the number one use case  they're just going to be sad because it's going to be buried away a sort of the  A a lesser view a view that you have to click through a couple of places to get to see something because most people just don't

Start time: 5711.98
End time: 5756.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't want to use it that way and the other reason I don't like algorithmic is more subtle  And more of a maybe a bias, which is I feel like algorithmic feeds  Are the feeds that get you in trouble that totally youtube's?  Algorithmic feed is the one that radicalizes you because it brings you down a rabbit hole that so I  I'm concerned that algorithmic feeds are the way that a company  Can enforce its own world view?  and actually  Modify your world view using its algorithm whether intentionally or not and so and biases and biases  So I that's I kind of against algorithmic because it's it feels a little icky to me  That these guys are telling me what's important because I don't necessarily think that's good

Start time: 5757.10
End time: 5796.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny you sound like more of the conservatives I have in my feed who think the same thing  But they think that you know all the platforms are just trying to turn them into radical woke liberals and all that stuff  But um, but I think part of it too is just that it's it's all our  Biases too that kind of feed into there a little bit  um, you know like I have hiking pugs that show up in my instagram timeline because I love pugs and I love hiking and  A couple of them that can like breathe through it do hike. Um, but uh, but I would seek it out on my own anyway  And I think that ends up being the case a lot of the time like you might discover stuff that you like otherwise  But I think a lot of it really does come down to people like to seek out confirmation bias and that'll happen.

It was top stories of people you follow links that were shared  They've added a of the people they follow which was a nuzzle feature that actually kind of roots up some stuff  That's interesting, but it's it's so basic  And for to like to I was kind of spending three dollars on a whim like okay twitter  Let's see where this goes and where it went was no new features and we're going to charge you more  Well, I mean it's not going anywhere  Forget it

Like so all right nuzzle probably was had run out of road  So they get bought by twitter and it's like a feature leveraging twitter and yet  Okay, if it's just for people like us  Why don't you put a small team on it and make it super awesome and charge us?  $20 a month or $10 a month or something like that or instead it's this kind of halfway thing  For three or five dollars a month and it doesn't satisfy anybody.

It was a front end to a huge data store of social activity and news activity  And what what the acquisition of nuzzle and then the top articles did for me is show  Feature the potential of twitter. It could be a really cool thing. In fact, this maybe should be a regular feature  Instead it's packaged in this kind of mediocre twitter blue  And it's not as good

No, but I am a little curious because  Elon promised to pay 44 billion sight unseen essentially, you know, no no due diligence  Then claimed well, I want to do due diligence twitter said no you signed you're gonna pay  The problem is elon doesn't have all that money. He only raised he has about 21 billion the rest he borrowed  I don't think they can force the lenders to pony up  And they're ain't gonna get 44 billion out of elon. So my prediction is it's just gonna be  They're not gonna get the billion dollar breakup fee. It'll be more than that  The chancellor court's gonna make him hurt a little bit  So it'll be you know some number of billions of dollars going into twitter's pocket and I hope they put it to good use  Because he he really did cause a mess  People left twitter  a lot of  Morale, you know tumbled  It just was a mess and he should have something, you know, you should pay. Yeah

Transcript:  I hate to quote an elon tweet, but he said something perceptive on twitter this week, which I think he immediately then  Did the wrong thing about but he did say like basically it was a moment of self-realization that everybody is looking for his tweets  To see to jump on them and make them into stories and talk about how he's lost it and all this stuff  And and that maybe he should just focus on other stuff and i'm sitting there thinking yes elon  That is you saying stop tweeting  Please stop tweeting now and of course he didn't stop.

Transcript:  priorities  He does tweet a lot i'm looking for the tweet you mentioned and there's so much it's entertaining  It's entertaining. Yeah  Our show today brought to you by collide. I know you know collide jason. They're a good sponsor of six colors.com. I love this  Idea, it's kind of the antithesis  To the old school device management story. You probably know well  An it department locks everything down. They put super glue in the  Usb ports make sure you can't do anything  And I understand if you're an it man, that's uh, that's that's what you need to do, right to keep your stuff safe to keep  Your company safe, but frankly it has a problem and you've probably experienced this too  people rebel  They don't like it  And so what happens?  When you lock down security is you create rebels who end up using their own devices?  Which is far worse and then bring it into the office which could be disaster  Old school device management tools like mdms force disruptive agents onto employee devices that slow performance  And treat privacy as an afterthought and users know it  That way of doing things turns it admins and end users into enemies  And then creates its own security problems because users turn to shadow it just to do their jobs collide's a completely different idea  It enrolls your users as your allies  Instead of forcing changes on them collide sends them security recommendations now. You've got to be a slack house  We are we love slack if your business uses slack  You're going to love this it starts with the user being prompted to install the collide agent in slack  And it explains everything it walks them through it. So now already they're part of the team, right?  And then it automatically notifies them when devices are insecure  And gives them step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem, but more importantly  I think gives them the information they need to understand why it's a problem  So you're reaching out to employees via a friendly slack dm. It's not a public message. It's a dm  You're educating about company policies  And as a result collide can help you build a culture in which everybody is part of the solution  Not part of the problem everybody contributes to security because everybody understands it and how and why it needs to be done  When now as an it admin you're going to love it because you get a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet  And by the way mac windows or linux its platform agnostic  You can see at a glance which employees have their disks encrypted for instance  Who's got up-to-date os's who hasn't updated who's using password managers?  All of this makes it easier for you to prove compliance to your auditors to your customers to your leadership  And you're doing it with the with the with your allies  The employees is great  Collide user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that slack. That's the elevator pitch  I'll say it again user-centered  Cross-platform endpoint security for teams that slack you can meet your compliance goals by putting users first visit collide  Kolide.com  And find out how by the way if you follow that link you'll get they'll hook you up with a goodie bag including a t-shirt  Some nice stickers you can put on your laptop and that's all just for activating the free trial  Collide I really think this is the way to do it k-o-l-i-d-e  Collide.com  Twit it will make your life better  How about that may not make your  Whites whiter or your laundry better, but it will make your life better. How about that?  Collide.com slash twit we thank them so much for supporting  This week in tech  Uh on we go with the show dan patterson's great to have you shoshana weissman  my first girlfriend and  Mr. Jason snell  What else happened this week?  Wait a minute i'm looking at the wrong rundown. This is a different show. I thought it looked  I thought it looked different  All of a sudden i'm doing this week in google  Uh, we did the instagram amazon drive shutting down next year. I don't know if anybody used amazon drive  Amazon photos will continue which is still the best kept secret for amazon prime users unlimited free photo storage  But if you've been using drive, you're gonna have to migrate next year  Uh, oh, let's talk. Huawei  I'm in you know, and dan I I know you cover securities. I'm very curious for i've gone back and forth on this the commerce department  uh  Two or three years ago said to government agencies stop using huawei networking equipment  We don't trust them. It's that we feel like they might be chinese spies  uh  It seemed maybe  That this was at some point during the trump era and we predated trump  But at some point during the trump era it was just kind of  xenophobia  and maybe even uh kind of prompted by cisco and other  U.s companies trying to get that  Networking market there wasn't a lot of evidence that huawei was doing anything disruptive  Uh, well now we have some of that evidence and this is a cnn exclusive  FBI investigation that said huawei equipment could disrupt nuclear arsenal communications  What  Uh, it starts the lead is the chinese government was offering to spend a hundred million dollars  To build an ornate chinese garden at the national arboretum in washington dc  They were going to temples and pavilions. There's gonna be a 70 foot white pagoda  Would attract tourists to be beautiful a great perfect example of sino us  cooperation, but then  U.s counter intelligence officials began digging into the details the pagoda would have been strategically placed  On one of the highest points in dc just two miles from the capital  a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection  Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the u.s in diplomatic pouches  So they couldn't be examined ahead of time  Uh the feds killed the project in 2018  But at least for the least the last five or six years federal officials have been very nervous about  chinese attempts to spy on us  and  For a long time there was some question about huawei  Apparently according to cnn study  There's no question huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also  Highly restricted communications used by the military and furthermore has the ability to disrupt strategic command communications  Dan you must have looked into this over the last few years. Where do you come down on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the rich real challenge in the last  Uh, like three to five years has been this mishmash as you alluded to of various actors and their motivations  um, and you're right, I I think there was a lot of xenophobia mixed in with these stories we can have a very  Similar or parallel conversation with tik tok  uh, but at at the end of the day  the reality is that  our our law enforcement and  intelligence communities  Although they too have their own partisan actors have been in a non-partisan way examining companies like huawei  And there are real privacy and security  There are potentially real  privacy and security  Threats, uh, I think you know this that's the problem. It's potential. It's potential  Yeah, right, right and I say I say that i'm trying to choose my words wisely or at least hedge as much as possible  although this story feels like out of a great maybe cold war thriller like  It has a lot of narrative components to it  um  You can see them saying ah nice try building your pagoda that would have disrupted but at the end of the day  We are in an era where where software and hardware has the potential to gather a tremendous amount of data about us and  not just our consumer data, but  there are secure real security and privacy threats that that are  Higher stakes than you know, the sandwich you you might have eaten, you know, I i'm trying to to be  Vague but also

Start time: 6813.84
End time: 6873.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the stakes are pretty high on this. Yeah, maybe it just be better to err on the side of caution  Uh christopher ray the director of the fbi, uh told cnn that the fbi opens a new china counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours  He says there are probably around 2 000 investigations currently on underway  That's not of huawei specifically but of china in general  We're very nervous about china. I understand why  I still don't think there's a smoking gun with huawei and I guess  That's the thing i'm waiting for although, you know, they make a good point, you know given where this equipment goes it could absolutely  Be problematic and even if it's completely clean now software updates down the road could could turn them into  Uh, you know weapons of of destruction in the united states shoshana is there is this outside your portfolio?  Or do you have an opinion on this? I don't know what?

Start time: 6875.24
End time: 6909.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know sure yeah, no, it's um, it's not exactly in mind  But I do have strong opinions just that like we need to make sure it's about foreign policy threats and not about economic protectionism  Because it's easy to use the first as a threat as a thin veil for the second  Um, there's a lot of that during the trump administration where it could go either way like you could see the security case  But in other cases you're like does he just want to do economic protectionism here?  So i'm always for being wary and objective, but the huawei stuff also does not look very good  So it's kind of one of those things where I think it has to be a case-by-case thing where I find myself going back

Start time: 6909.94
End time: 6982.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And forth a little bit. There's also considerable criticism of the uh, the fcc's rip and replace  policy  Congress set aside well, they said they set aside  1.9 billion dollars to remove huawei and zte technology throughout rural america  But two years later according to cnn none of that equipment's been removed  Rural telecom companies are waiting for federal money  The fcc received applications  To remove 24 000 pieces of chinese-made communications equipment, but it's more than three billion dollars short of the money it needs to reimburse  So these companies are saying well  Why do we have to pay for this?  Uh, and they're not doing it  So it's it's a little bit of a mess  Here and I you know, I understand  Intelligence often doesn't want to reveal the smoking gun  Because that then you can infer on their methods from what you what they know  So maybe they don't want to say maybe they do have evidence and we just and it's not unreasonable for them to say look trust  us there's good reason  That we want you to take this stuff out. So i'm gonna err on the side of that

Transcript:  I guess that's how they're behaving. I do wonder at what point do you have to say?  All I have is your word on this, right?  You know, we are we are banning this company and trying to tell our allies in europe to not use them  Because you are giving us the wink wink nudge nudge that something is afoot here  but  It is you know, I like  I also want to give them the benefit of the doubt to a certain point because I understand this is about  Uh, you know spycraft and you know espionage and it's like you don't want to give away the secrets  At the same time though. It does give me a little bit of pause that that there has not been  Enough for me to feel like okay. All right. All right. I buy it. I buy it now instead. It's more like yeah, okay  i'm taking you on faith and  the other part of this is  Sometimes I wonder if we're not seeing the forest for the trees here because the truth is  Sure, something made in china could be subverted by the chinese government  They could know all the back doors all of that is true  That doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't stuff made elsewhere  That if the china if it was installed next to the icbm silos that the chinese government would not also have an exploit for right?

Transcript:  We don't really know that part. Yeah, they're talking about this is a great article if you want to read it in the cnn  They talk about uh weather cameras  Uh that are it turns out chinese weather cameras high definition surveillance cameras  From a company put up by a company called vallero  Capturing movement of us military equipment and personnel  The cameras provided a 24-7 bird's eye view  uh, not just of weather but of uh  military movements  The intelligence community determined the publicly posted live streams are being viewed and likely captured in china  Two sources briefed on the investigation of the time said officials believed it was possible for beijing's intelligence service to task the cameras  And point them in the direction they wanted to look  The ceo of the company said it never occurred to him that the that the cameras could be a security risk  But he's going to rip them out even though  It's going to cost him a lot of money and the government isn't going to reimburse him for any more than half of the  Of the cost of rip and replace  So it's a problem, you know, I guess patriotism and you know, you're just gonna he's gonna just

The issue is somebody put webcams on the interstate and they could be viewed from anywhere  It doesn't matter who made the webcams it matters that the webcams existed and I would also say I bet you there are also  Some satellites that are able to observe that entire interstate as well. Anyway, yeah, so it  Like I get it and yet you gotta you gotta convince me like this is literally they were public webcams of i-25  like  Yes, and china could look at them.

This is from dan guden writing in ours technica discovery of new uefi rootkit exposes an ugly truth  The attacks are invisible to us and they've been around since  UEFI which is the firmware that boots most computers mac pc and linux  Uh, the problem with this attack is it isn't wiped out by a hardware  Reset by a formatting of the hard drive. It lives on  forever  and uh on monday researchers from kaspersky  Profiled something called cosmic strand a sophisticated rootkit the company detected  Uh, it's been around since at least  2016 in the wild in the wild  uh  and  Kaspersky says this discovery begs the final question if that's what the attackers were using six years ago  What are they using now?  Okay  So, uh, there's and there's you know, what your compromise that's it. You're done. There's nothing you can do about it t-mobile  Uh one of the largest data breaches in u.s. History. You may remember this they've agreed to pay half a billion dollars  350 million will go to customers and lawyers. Do you want to guess the proportions of each?  Um at least 150 million will go to enhancing data security measures  The t-mobile admitted no guilt  The the breach compromised the sensitive personal information of more than 76 million current former and prospective customers in 2021  Yeah, we we maybe it happened maybe it didn't but here's half a billion dollars  Which I have to say is a lot more than tim hortons  Is giving up?  Tim hortons we talked about this some months ago, uh their app  Uh, which people were in tim hortons is a coffee shop started in canada  I think they're in america, too  It's an app that was on people's phones that was just like giving up all sorts of information including location to everybody and anybody tim hortons  Uh has settled the class action lawsuit  And I think this is fair.

Uh, they were being accused of I don't know money laundering or something unfortunately  For the users the customers of private vault the fbi during the raid went through all the safe deposit boxes  Attorneys representing victims of the raid say the depositions could contain important information about how and why the fbi decided to  Seize and catalog the private belongings not just of private vault but of their customers  They didn't the search warrant did not cover  that  But agents seized hundreds of safe deposit boxes  Anyway opened many of them and rifled through their contents under the guides of cataloging the items  a fishing expedition in search of additional  criminality the warrant  Illicitly forbade the fbi from seizing the safe deposit boxes or their contents the fbi  Says we have nothing to report  I think we'll see a few lawsuits over that  Uh, all right  And let's see. Let's you know what? Maybe this would be a good time now that we've given you all the paranoia  I didn't talk about  Google and amazon handing over video from your doorbell, but you know you knew that  You knew that right?  Let's take a little break and come back and we're going to have some other stories some lighter stories  I don't like to end the show on a on a paranoid note  But before we go on with our great panel jason snell shoshana weissman  shoshana weissman  and uh  Of course dan patterson. I want to talk about how we do these shows with this amazing  Tri-caster you  We by the way are uh, it's great to have a new tea. Wait a minute. John's on the tv now  What happened to bonito? Oh, there's bonito  Uh, we have hired a new technical director bonito worked for years. He did uh, we're using tri casters at twitch  And also at cnet. Yeah, so he's one of the reasons we hired him. He's a tri caster wizard  Since day one since we started video streaming video on twitter. I chose the new tech tri caster and I am so glad  Our show today brought to you by the newest the tri caster 2 elite  Bonito, do you want one of these?  Yes  It's the most complete live production system on the planet. We've got a pretty good tri caster elite  But maybe the tri caster 2 elite. Hmm  Uh some great new features new tech offers a full line of tri casters at any price point  And whatever you select tri caster puts an entire suite of media production capabilities at your fingertips  Oh, we are using the two. Are we using the two elite?  Oh, we are. Oh, never mind. We've got the best. Of course we do the one we use at twit.tv is more than a live production system  But we upgraded I forgot we upgraded an all-encompassing digital media solution to create content for the internet for mobile for tv distribution  We only use a we only scratch the surface  This thing is amazing  late last year new tech  Released an updated version of the tri caster 2 elite  Bringing in a host of new and exciting features the live call connect feature  That's such a cool idea now supports facebook messenger and whatsapp and facetime  So any production can bring in content from there in addition selectable audio and video return now enables  Tri caster 2 elite operators to view an audio return like any other output which makes it much more  flexible  the new neural voice isolation tool  Cleans audio using ai can cancel reduce background noise and automatically detect voices  Maintaining an all-important production quality. We we care about that a lot  It's very important even in a video production  increased power  flexibility and simplicity  Have driven these exciting new capabilities. There's variable support in macros john uses macros to video to idiot proof the tri caster for me  Because when I switch in my studio I do it all with macros so I can't I can't break anything  I still break things sometimes but he's it's nice  I appreciate that the system offers a dynamic and powerful tool that allows me to nest macros to deliver  Complex productions more easily. It's actually a great feature you plan ahead  You've got these single buttons you can push that do all sorts of stuff  Tri caster elite 2 elite now supports encoding three channels at a time  From hd to uhd all the same time. That's really nice  They brought the live panel builder into the tri caster, which means you can  People use the live panel builder to create bespoke user interfaces to customize presets within the user interface  Meaning your distributed workflows are simpler more cohesive  But as always with the tri caster never compromising on quality the ndi genlock tool. You'll love that  Genlock's so great ndi is great. That's a tri caster invention that transforms video production the network digital interface  remote workflows  Fantastic, you can send alpha channel through one of the mix outs  I'm all of this stuff is meaningless to me  That's all ndi now. That's really cool. Wow, that's neat  So we were originally sdi. Have we converted now to everything to ndi? Oh, no  We do four and four  So like this this point this ptz camera is an ndi camera  So it has one connection power over ethernet and video over an ethernet. That's really really amazing  Since its arrival a couple of years ago  The tri caster 2 elite has offered us an incredibly powerful live production system  And all these new updates give you so much more capability. It's really transformative better than broadcast  But of course, there's other choices the tri caster one pro for producers content creators and publishers future ready capabilities  streamlined live video production  Live call connect 4k uhd switching live streaming recording. I mean, it's incredible explore the latest in the tri caster family  Here's what we've set up for you visit go.newtech.com  twit-tv  That's a long one. I know  go.newtech  dot-com slash twit dash tv  Where you'll find an easy to use interactive guide that offers advice on which tri caster is right for you  And if you know if if the boss is  Generous like our boss is maybe you get the tri caster 2 elite really nice  go.newtech.com slash twit dash tv.

Transcript:  Wow, I didn't realize how congested I sounded on wednesday  I hope I don't sound that bad  I hope you enjoyed everything that happened on twitter and we'll be back this week with a fabulous week including jason snow  On mac break weekly very excited about that  So do you know about leap seconds?  I think we're we even talk about it from time to time you get you get to new year's eve  It's 11 59 59  And all of a sudden  It's 11 59 59 for an extra second  That's because the earth's  Rotation and revolution around the sun does not cooperate with atomic clocks. It's a little bit off. So every once in a while  Since 1972 world timekeeping authorities have added a leap second  To the global clock known as the international atomic  time  They tuck in an extra second  You know who doesn't like that computers  They don't get it  They don't they don't get it  Uh, and so there is a call now from google microsoft meta and amazon  This week they launched a public effort to scrap  the leap second  What's the big deal in fact they say it's going to take 2 000 years before you even notice  That the atomic clock and the earth are out of sync. You don't have to worry  Maybe we'll correct it once every 2 000 years throw in an extra day something like that  Uh nist actually agrees  As does the french equivalent the bureau international de poise et mesure  Bipum which is even more fun to say  The leap second triggered a massive reddit outage in 2012 problems at mozilla linkedin yelp  airline booking service amadeus  In 2017 a leap second glitch a cloud flare knocked  A fraction of the network infrastructure company off servers offline  Cloud flares software comparing the two clocks calculated time had gone backwards  But didn't know what to do so I just uh screw it  uh  Okay, so, um, I guess maybe the  Google though has an idea that might be better than eliminating the leap second  uh  Google has pioneered the idea of the leap schmear

Transcript:  It's it's actually uh  I kind of a brilliant idea  I don't know if this will work or not  But the idea is you take that that day that is one second too long  And what you do is you stretch every second by a teeny tiny amount  So all the computers think that the day is the same number of seconds as it always is  But for that one day every second is just a little bit longer  But it doesn't you know, there's no extra second. It's just all the seconds are longer. Yeah  That seems like a bad idea, but okay again. Does that solve it though? Google? Does it actually solve anything? Aren't they still screwed up?

Hi, uh star trek 3  My favorite uhura scenes in star trek 3  She actually has a great moment where she helped steal the enterprise and spoilers for a movie from the 80s  Uh, and it's great, but they didn't so in the in strange new worlds, which is a great show  they they have young uhura and it is great to see them digging into that character because  Unfortunately as iconic as she was on that show they still didn't give her a whole lot to do so  She did get to do some more stuff in the movies and and I think her greatest contribution is what nasa tweeted out there. She  Essentially nasa said to her maybe you should recruit people  From uh underrepresented groups to join nasa and become astronauts and of course one of those people was may jemisin  Who was the first african-american?

I mean  Yeah, I was watching I've watched tcm a lot so I was watching this uh, great tcm short they had about you know, basically  black people throughout movies and it's  It really struck me how only recently we've really started to give black people like really good roles  And they've had a bigger role in film and like the industry has allowed them to so thinking that you know  She really had such a big role there  You know a really really notable one more so than I realized growing up because I always heard oh  She you know, she and will shatter always had the first and racial kiss and all of that  But really thinking through it  it's kind of amazing that uh, she was able to play such a big role and that um,  You know that that she was I mean able to recruit people for nasa because of that  Um, I mean even in the 40s and 50s a lot of the roles they gave black people were just nothing  And not that they didn't have the talent.
