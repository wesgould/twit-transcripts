Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I specifically requested that you come in this week because I found your take on the Equifax  hack and what to do as a real practical consumer advice as some of the most level headed and  slow to wait and let it kind of play out because it's such a mess that actually acting too quickly  could be even more of a disaster than it already is.  So we're going to get into that as we move through the show.  So also Bob Sullivan, you can find all his stuff at bobsullivan.net.  I want to make sure I get out there and he has at red tape cron at on Twitter.  So I want to start today you guys with what is in my mind the freshest story of the week.  One that happened at the end of the week and which may have a lot of portent as we move forward,  which is Uber losing its license in London.  London's transport regulator issued a statement saying Uber will not be issued with a private  hire operator license after, I love all the British words that are in this.  This is quote, after the expiry of its current license on 30 September.  Uber.  Basically what they've cited is the transport for London, that's the transportation authority.  They cite Uber's approach for reporting serious crime offenses, how medical certificates are  obtained, how background checks are done.  And what really may be the most interesting aspect that they call out is Uber's software  program to kind of obscure reported issues.  It's called Grayball and the TFL says it could be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining  full access to the app and prevent officials from figuring out what's going on on Uber that's not  perfect and lovely.  Do you guys think that this has a ripple effect that's going to play out in other Uber environments?  Is this London just trying to get them to do what the black cabs have to do?

Start time: 422.18
End time: 445.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think London is just trying to get itself in the paper.  The Uber has obviously been banned from other places and other circumstances and both Uber  and Lyft basically exiled themselves from Austin.  But I think there's something about just the stature and the size of London and also the  suddenness of this.  It seemed to come out of nowhere.  They're talking the expiry is 30 September.  That is really soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now they can appeal it.  Fast.

Start time: 449.10
End time: 451.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then they said they will.  They said they're vigorously going to appeal it.

Start time: 451.82
End time: 467.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going away but it would change things considerably.  I'm really curious if this is a monetary play, if this is a real safety issue or if this is just the  issue of them obscuring their information.

Start time: 467.32
End time: 541.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's two sides to this that don't get reported.  The other side is that the regular taxi cabs have a security problem as well and they under report  some of the offences there and they weren't properly judged here against Uber.  Uber, I mean I've used it all over the world from Russia to Singapore to China to South Africa  and it works great.  And consumers love it.  I love it.  I'm bothered that I have to go back to using taxis in London.  They're more expensive.  Than Uber was.  And it's harder to get one.  Yeah, it's great when you arrive at the airport.  There's always a row of them there.  But if you're in a weird alley somewhere because you're at a friend's house, it's so nice to be  able to pull out the Uber app and know where that taxi is and that it's on the way.  And it's harder to get other taxis to come and visit you.  A lot of times I don't know the phone numbers to call to get a taxi to come and pick me up.  Right?  So now I have to ask and it's a pain in the ass.

Start time: 542.22
End time: 556.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like this is a real political question as well.  It's like who's lobbying the transportation authority in London?  What's their incentive?  And I went and looked and it's, you know, city comms.

Start time: 556.88
End time: 569.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In London, they do have amazing taxis.  Everybody there is very educated.  They know the city very well.  They're generally polite and the taxis are all pretty consistent and pretty clean.  That's not true in other cities.

Start time: 571.08
End time: 618.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a very well regarded profession there.  There's a test that the cab drivers have to take called the knowledge or that's what the  body of knowledge is referred to that is about navigating from waypoint to waypoint,  of which there are thousands in London.  And one of my favorite things about this is they've put them in.  They put London cabbies and fMRIs and they have found the part of the brain  that does this thing.  It's probably part of the hippocampus because it's memory is literally larger and has greater  blood flow than in a mere mortal.  So all of that is amazing.  But it's a very, very powerful lobby because it's an ancient profession and a very,  very well established profession.  And black cabs are so expensive.  I mean, the price differential in San Francisco is appreciable between UberX  and a taxi in London.  It's yawning.

Start time: 618.70
End time: 675.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's at least anecdotally, I've experienced it's at least 2X what an Uber is.  And I think that this really does come down to financial incentives in a lot of ways.  I looked it up and listen to this.  So these are the application fees that a black cab operator would have to pay.  Now, I agree with you completely.  It's like PhD level taxi driving.  So they are top shelf professionals.  80 pounds for the application.  60 pounds for the online application.  Then you have to go see your doctor and get a full medical.  You have to take the knowledge.  That's 200 pounds.  You have to appear and defend your knowledge.  That's 400 pounds.  And then you get a license fee.  That's 192 pounds.  So we're talking about almost 800 pounds of city licensing fees that are lost for every  Uber driver who replaces a black cab driver.

Start time: 676.09
End time: 710.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And the black cab drivers could make that up on a single ride from Heathrow to Notton Hill.  And by the way, the sitting for the knowledge.  Maybe three.  The other thing, I don't know why I'm so freaked about the other thing about the knowledge is  many people have to sit for it multiple times and it's not shameful to fail because it's  almost unheard of to pass on the first time through.  That's the biggest one.  That's 400 pounds.  Yeah.  And if Uber drivers are displacing those people, I think the London, I think the black cabs are  still pretty robust.  I don't think they've been driven from the roads yet, but yes, certainly if they were  replacing them, that would be quite a bit of lost revenue.

Start time: 711.32
End time: 755.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're so symbolic in London during the Olympics.  You remember they brought the Spice Girls in and they were each in a black cab as they  went around the arena.  It was cool to see.  And you really realize this is a place where it's not just financial incentives.  It's not just as the mayor in London, Sadiq Khan says, you have to, Uber has to play by  the rules, but it's also cultural.  It is a cultural touchstone.  What do you guys think about this?  The software that they're using is called Grayball and it's been, it's been brought  up in the news before.  Oh yeah.  Obviously because it's, you know, it profiles users in most cases, but this is when, you  know, they're really saying you cannot use this to obscure problems.  The regulators want to see.

Start time: 755.14
End time: 799.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they were specifically using it to avoid picking up regulators.  So my recollection of its use in the U S and I believe that Uber has basically copped to  it and said, yeah, guilty as charged.  We did that stuff.  And I'm pretty sure that it was in certain cities where they felt they were being particularly  targeted by regulators.  And the purpose of it, if I recall correctly, was to refrain from picking up people from  the local government who might be trying to monitor them.  And so it wasn't as nefarious as it might sound on the surface, but it was all about evading  the law.  So it, you know, it certainly doesn't look good.  And I wouldn't, I don't know if it was alleged that they were using it in London, but I think  they were citing that as this is, this is a company that doesn't exactly play by the  rules.

Start time: 800.50
End time: 811.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the new CEO just said yesterday to his employees that this is what happens.  The London ruling is what happens when you get a bad reputation.  Yeah.  Right.

Start time: 811.90
End time: 831.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the pylon effect.  And that's where I wonder if, if, if you feel like this will be the start of a snowball  where other, other cities feel like this is a chance to get their hooks into Uber and have  more legislative and maybe more financial incentive hooks that they can call from because  the reputation is so bad.

Start time: 831.44
End time: 851.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think London is a pretty unique situation because of its strength, of its educated taxi  force.  That isn't true in a lot of places in the world.  And in a lot of other places in the world, Uber has become so important that it's really  hard to get, kick them out now.

Start time: 853.18
End time: 857.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see what Lyft does too, right?  Well, Lyft, keep in mind, Lyft is not international.

Start time: 858.72
End time: 874.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's, that's one reason I keep using Ubers because I, I fly international quite  a bit.  And you need to.  And Lyft is great here in San Francisco, but it's not that great if you travel overseas.  It's not that great if you're in a place where they simply do not exist.

Start time: 874.36
End time: 874.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 875.80
End time: 950.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Becky, I have some strong feelings about Uber.  I would love to jump in if I could for a second.  I think it's a, I think it's a big deal because of this.  Uber has basically been able to kind of bully its way around, around the world, around  local regulators, largely because consumers do find it so incredibly useful.  And so when a city mayor steps up and says, no, we're going to regulate Uber, there's  all of this outcry.  So that has worked for them so far.  If it doesn't work now in London, this will be sort of the first very public loss that  Uber has.  I think it will put the company back on its haunches.  Obviously it already is because of everything else that's happened.  And I think we could see real substantial changes.  Like I have a story I've read and rewritten on my site several times, which I call the  six reasons that Ubernomics is terrible for transportation and Uber itself.  So there's a lot of reasons why consumers love Uber today, but I think it's unsustainable.  Largely because it's kind of cheating the system and that's why the price is so cheap  and there's this Ponzi scheme element to it.  But I think we really could see something happen if Uber can't get past this London  issue without some kind of major change.  Of course, other cities, other governments are going to try to do the same thing.  And before they had to back down, if London wins, I think they'll they won't back down  as much.  There's a story there.

Start time: 951.10
End time: 982.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that some of the folks in the chat room are agreeing.  User 0440 says, let the market decide if the advantages are there for the Black Cab and  the provisions of the London Cab Act, they'll make a living.  A monopoly isn't required with all the advantages cited.  It seems like this is definitely a financial story as they go through this and try and  figure out where the benefits are.  I mean, 40,000 drivers in the city right now.

Start time: 982.56
End time: 1036.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And 3 million customers.  Right.  And if at the end of the day, the 3 million customers and those, by the way, they're  counting them pretty generously.  I think one article I saw said 3 million people have taken at least once in the last three  months, which is not enough.  Some of those people aren't necessarily hooked on it, but a pretty high percentage are.  And if it is a different price differential of 2x, let's just imagine that it is.  It kind of says, you know, poorer folks don't get to have driving on demand anymore.  And wealthier folks can afford their Black Cabs.  But we're going to ban this aspect of transportation.  And if you're below a certain income, that's a bummer for you.  And if you're one of these 40,000 drivers, that's too bad for you.  Now, that said, when Uber and Lyft exiled themselves from Austin, it was remarkable  how fast local companies were up and running and providing very similar services.  It was a matter of a single digit number of weeks.  I've forgotten.

Start time: 1036.96
End time: 1039.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were those like pre-existing taxi companies that figured out how to?

Start time: 1040.84
End time: 1045.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they weren't taxi companies.  New ones.  Yeah, they were new companies that got up and running.

Start time: 1045.52
End time: 1049.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I used them at South by Southwest and they were all right.  They were all right.

Start time: 1049.46
End time: 1054.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but better than nothing or better than a 2x price or were they?  I don't know.  You were there.

Start time: 1055.24
End time: 1065.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were about the same as Uber and they had a similar kind of app.  The problem is they only worked in one city.  So as soon as you left Austin, you forgot about that.  It was a band-aid.  Yeah, definitely a band-aid.  And now Uber and Lyft are back.

Start time: 1067.22
End time: 1097.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we can't ignore Uber is half the price almost everywhere.  In New York City, I'm in New York City a lot and Uber is an amazing deal there.  But it doesn't make any sense, does it?  I mean, Uber isn't creating a 50% efficiency in its real cost.  So something else is making Uber ride so cheap.  And in the end, that is really why people use Uber because it has this huge price advantage.  But my big concern with Uber is it can't continue to charge 50% less than everybody else.  It does have some efficiency, by the way.

Start time: 1097.18
End time: 1101.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've talked to lots of drivers all over the world.  Marginal gains.  Here's what the Lyft...

Start time: 1102.12
End time: 1113.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cars are dispatched where you are, when you are.  And there's a little bit of efficiency to that.  But that's a very marginal gain compared to the main cost of moving people around, which is gas.

Start time: 1113.84
End time: 1136.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It can be pretty significant gain, though, because the Lyft drivers...  I take a lot of Lyft and Uber here in San Francisco.  And I talked to the drivers and almost everybody's working for both here in San Francisco.  And they say that Uber keeps them busier per hour  and Lyft takes them further away to pick up a ride.  And that further away can be maybe 10 minutes each way.  Right?  That's significant out of an hour drive.

Start time: 1136.90
End time: 1139.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a network effect for the drivers.  There is a network effect.

Start time: 1139.38
End time: 1162.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And a lot of times Uber doesn't even let them go back to Lyft because they keep them so busy.  In Singapore, my rides were almost always saying,  your driver's dropping somebody off.  And I would actually see them come into the hotel, drop somebody off.  And then I would get in the car and off we go.  They didn't even have time to quit the app and try something else.

Start time: 1162.62
End time: 1177.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one of the sources of the discount is the fact that Uber is burning billions and billions  and billions of dollars per year.  So to a certain extent, wealthy VCs are funding your ride.  That's not permanently sustainable, but I certainly appreciate their generosity.

Start time: 1178.56
End time: 1230.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also you would call that product dumping.  That's antitrust behavior.  And one of the consequences of this...  Here's the worst outcome.  By the way, I use Uber.  The technology is great.  Some kind of ride sharing service is absolutely the future.  But what I'm worried about is Uber will burn through that money.  It will crash and burn.  In the meantime, it's going to take down...  What's happening with New York City taxis right now is crazy.  You just listed the fees for London drivers.  It used to cost a million dollars to become a taxi driver in New York City.  People would get mortgages to get medallions.  The value of medallions has cut down to about $300,000 now,  and people are declaring bankruptcy because they can't afford them.  Auctions for medallions are going almost unsold.  What I'm saying is that yellow cabs in New York are in danger,  and Uber could bring down both itself and other forms of transportation  if we don't regulate this properly.

Start time: 1230.64
End time: 1343.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't there a gentleman in New York who owned hundreds of medallions  and was demanding a government bailout because he was a centimillionaire  and it wasn't fair for a centimillionaire?  I actually live in New York currently,  but I've only been there for about a year and a half.  I don't know the system as well as I did in San Francisco.  But I would say, having talked to probably hundreds of cabbies  over the years in San Francisco,  the situation in San Francisco was almost futile.  Not futile, but F-E-U-D-A-L, Knights and Shining Armor, futile.  In that, a very high percentage of the drivers didn't own a medallion.  They were working for somebody who drove a cab some decades before  who owned dozens before the rules changed  and for bad people owning multiple ones.  So that driver would have to be paying this obscene rent,  a de facto to rent the medallion.  Where did the efficiency come from?  Well, you don't have this futile system.  The surf doesn't have to pay the Lord who owns hundreds of medallions.  In the case of our centimillionaire in New York  who's howling about how unfair it is that the price is going down  or the more one-off situations in San Francisco  where folks were paying several dozen,  I don't remember what, it was close to $100 a shift to the medallion holder.  That's where all the pricing is going to somebody who,  in many cases, people who have dozens or hundreds of medallions.  They got a great run for decades and decades.  In San Francisco, they deliberately constricted the supply of medallions  in order to keep the price of medallions high.  That did not benefit the drivers.  It benefited the medallion holders.  It's artificial scarcity.  And it punished the people in the city in San Francisco  who found themselves unable to get a ride late at night.  Women are walking home at 2 a.m.  People are doing stupid things like driving drunk  or refraining from going out and patronizing the bars  and the restaurants of the city  because the medallion holders had this power  that allowed them to constrain the supply.  I don't think those guys deserve a free ride anymore.

I think he's aiming at Toyota  and he's going to try with the solar panel,  the battery in your garage and the car that has no oil.  He's going to try to reduce the cost per mile  of transportation over Uber or over Toyota.  And over car ownership entirely.  That's going to be what really changes this whole model  because I'm sorry people who work for Uber or for taxis.

Transcript:  While Uber is negotiating and working out in London,  the iPhone 8 reviews and the teardowns are out, as is the phone.  I just want to go through a couple of the things  that have kind of come down over the last week as the phones come out.  And the news is all the embargoes have been lifted.  So Mac rumors lists in order of notable differences on the iPhone 8.  The glass back wireless charging, new colors, better speakers.  I'm not super impressed yet.  The A11 bionic chip, six core processor.  They say nothing noticeable on everyday processors, but it may impact augmented reality.  I'm glad we have Robert Scoble here to talk about that.  What has gotten a lot of praise is the camera.  Some say it's the best in any smartphone ever.  12 megapixels, larger sensor, flash is quad LED, much better for night shots.  I liked what Justin Robert Young said.  He says you look less like a crazed raccoon against a pitch black background.  Prices for the 8, $699 for the 64 gigabyte.  Not a lot of lines or frenzy around the purchase you.

Transcript:  I thought Apple was going to be far more aggressive with augmented reality and with sensors.  In the X, which hasn't shipped yet, there's a 3D sensor that sees your face and unlocks when you  look at the phone.  I thought they would be much more aggressive with that sensor and explain it to developers better  and even open it up, but it seems like they've kept it to themselves.  The demos on the first day were pretty lackluster.  Just didn't show off the technology in any really nice way.  I think they did this on purpose.  They didn't show the new OLED screen off against the iPhone 8 screen  because there's quite a bit of difference.  OLED has better contrast, better color, better sharpness,  better battery life.  That's why a lot of my friends and I are waiting for the X.

What actually shipped was on the most conservative side of all the predictions that I saw.  Why would they do that?  I'm hearing that there's a lot of fighting inside Apple at the executive level and  that they just don't need to.  They're the most profitable company right now and if they do a good job of selling it,  they're not going to sell a whole lot more.  If they don't do a good job, they're going to not sell a whole lot less.  Most of us are going to have to update our phones every three years and they know that.

The kind of augmented reality we're now getting on our iPhones and our iPads is fun,  but we haven't yet seen it used for anything really crazy.  That wasn't out before.  In fact, somebody on the chat room was asking about the IKEA app.  Yeah, the IKEA app is great.  I saw that on Google Tango two years ago and most of the app was built for Google Tango.  It's not something that's completely mind-blowing out of the box.

Fun, but the kind of thing that maybe a 13-year-old plays, but I don't see a lot of utility in there.  There is some apps, like you can look at one app with a human heart and you can walk around  the heart and learn all about it.  That gives you a sense of where the value really is.  Education is huge.  Yeah, games are fun, but the kinds of games we're seeing are really pretty pedantic little  fun games for tables.

And so, you know, the best use case I've ever seen for this, I went to a trade show about 10 years ago  where it was only for law enforcement and military.  And they had this huge circular screen that you stepped inside of and you were given this  gun that was tethered and had a laser and then doors would open all around in the screen.  And you'd have to figure out who was the bad guy and needed to be shot and had a weapon  and who was the lady holding the baby.  And it would get progressively harder and harder and it was heart-stopping stuff.  I mean, it was the most extreme experience I have ever had.  And that was a million-dollar installation made for the government or like a huge,  maybe the state of California might have one of those.  Now you can do that in a pair of goggles.

Meta is doing really well with architects and car designers, people who need to see CAD drawings  and see them in deep detail because it's tethered to a PC with a big MV.  So it's got power, yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah, I found HoloLens is almost like having an HDTV in front of you.  And I find Meta to just be so much more enveloping.  I did my very first podcast just a few weeks ago was with Maroon, my first podcast interview.  We had like an hour-long interview.

Transcript:  The problem is I bias my life toward consumers and consumers need to walk into a shopping mall.  We haven't yet seen a product that does that really well because the glasses are too big  and too ugly and too expensive.  And so we know they're coming because they've started coming out of the R&D labs.  I've started...  In fact, I might have a picture of one somewhere.  They're coming in three, four, five ounces.  The HoloLens is 1.28 pounds, right?  And Meta is around there.  Meta, though, is optimized for somebody who's going to sit at a desk and need to see their work in 3D.  It's very B2B.  Like a skyscraper or a car or something like that.  Because it's tethered to a big PC with a big Nvidia card,  they get about half a million polygons per second.  So they get a lot more detail than what we're getting on our little iPhones.  Oh, Lord, yes.

But because it's this tiny little thing in my hand, I feel like it's a demo from the near future.  I'm entirely with Robert.  I don't find it...

And that's why you're seeing most of the apps are like measuring tape apps.  It's kind of neat.  Yeah, and I had to carry a yardstick with me in the air.  That's a fun idea.  Overstock.

Transcript:  But so much more compelling when you have the headset on and you're enveloped with it.  And yeah, and that to me was one of...  Marrone makes a lot of interesting trade-offs with Meta because he made a very bold decision  to say, okay, it's going to be a tethered experience because he does believe, as I'm  sure you heard traveling with him, that AR's first killer apps are all going to be about  productivity.  They're going to be business apps.  And so he's not as concerned about the tethered thing, which would be a non-starter for a  consumer.  And being tethered allows that headset, it's really encumbering, but man, it gives it a  lot of horsepower.  Because if you put all that horsepower in your head, you'd be...

And he's competing with Magic Leap, which got 1.4 billion dollars.  Microsoft has spent billions of dollars and is about to announce a new HoloLens strategy  on October 3rd, I think it is.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  And Google, of course, hasn't given it a rest.  Google, well, Google invested in Magic Leap and then they have their own internal teams  and they're working on a pair of glasses.

Start time: 2224.00
End time: 2254.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it all depends on how reasonably inexpensive the process is, right?  I mean, there's forever the holy grail has been, could I somehow try something on and  see if it looks good on me without going to a store?  Can I order something and immediately get a feel for it?  And that's going to be a killer app.  But it has to feel really good.  And at the moment, so many of these experiments, when we actually...  When they touch reality, they just fail miserably because they're just a little bit too much  friction for the consumer to figure it out, make it work, and it doesn't look quite right.

Start time: 2255.78
End time: 2284.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe because I'm a TV producer at heart, when I try AR apps, I ultimately don't trust them  because I don't trust the color temperature in the cameras.  And therefore, I feel like...  An example is I've done a couple of stories on the makeup apps,  like L'Oreal has a very good makeup app to try different lipsticks on.  Sephora does too.  But I don't trust the shade.  It's all about shade, right?  So why would I trust the shade if my skin doesn't look like it's the right tone?

Start time: 2284.90
End time: 2326.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sephora said they spent a lot of time making sure that their lipstick color  in augmented reality matches the physical product when you buy it.  And so there is a way to do it right.  But you're right.  Because of how augmented reality works, it either has a point cloud and then it converts  that to polygons like in the HoloLens, and then it overlays video on those polygons.  So polygons are little triangles, right?  So think about if I want to take you and put you into augmented reality,  I have to cut you up into little triangles.  And that makes things look a little weird.  And it often doesn't have the right color because it's a lot of math going on.

Apple, Facebook, Snap, Google, Huawei, Samsung, Microsoft, and Amazon, right?  All have, well, Magic Leap too, yeah.  All have billion-dollar efforts underway on the glasses.  And we can see that they're coming.  They're coming sometime in the next five years, right?  And Magic Leap is rumored to be coming in December.  Really?  Yeah, for about $2,000 with a developer preview.  So that's a hint.  And the Magic Leap is still tethered to a box that you'll have in your pocket.  So it's still a little dorky.  We haven't yet escaped the dorky factor.  And until we do, that's going to keep it out of mass market, right?  Because mass market won't put up with dorky factor.

And so I thought this is actually the killer app for runners.  And the news is basically from…  Well, we'll start with the Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern.  She says that it wasn't just her, it was also Jeffrey Fowler.  Experienced cellular connectivity issues on three separate pre-production models in two  different states on two different 4G LTE carriers.  On the AT&T connected models, the cellular connection dropped calls and were choppy.  Siri often failed to connect.  On the one that ran on T-Mobile dropped connections.  They asked Apple about the issues and they said,  Hey, we haven't seen any of this in our testing.  We're going to look into it.  Then Lauren Goetheverge had similar issues.

Transcript:  We have a user in the chat room who says LT on a watch is fantastic.  Some people are having a good time with it.  And that's always true when you hit bugs.  I worked at Microsoft and we knew all of our software had bugs.  They had a bug list on the internet.  But when you have an obscure bug, it might hit a few dozen people  and those people will be very noisy on Facebook.  I'm having a bug on iOS 11 on my phone right now.  Not everybody is because it hasn't come up as an issue with a lot of people.

Transcript:  Well, when you combine this with the lack of lines at Apple stores over the new phone,  clearly you get the sense that maybe this isn't Apple's greatest day.  But I do have to say this issue of handing off between Wi-Fi networks and cell networks,  I've never had a phone that didn't have that problem.  I don't understand why it's such a difficult problem to solve.  But lots of people are frustrated with trying to navigate from a cell connection  when they walk between Wi-Fi and whatnot, especially right now  while people are trying so desperately to not use up data.  So they try to hop on Wi-Fi as often as they can and you walk through neighborhoods  and it connects to a hotspot, disconnects.  So I think this is a pretty typical problem.

Transcript:  All right.  We are going to take a quick break.  When we come back, we're going to figure out why Google bought HTC or bought part of HTC  or did they buy HTC or did they just acquire, how do you say that word, acquire some of HTC?  It's like the double rainbow.  What does it mean?  But first, here's Leo with information on one of our sponsors.  Hey, Becky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So nice to see you.  Let me interrupt just briefly for a moment.  We'll get back to Twitter in a second.  But our show today brought to you by our sponsor, Betterment.  I'm really interested in this.  Unfortunately, I can't use it, but I tell everybody I know, including family members,  to use it.  One of my family members, a young person, my daughter,  just starting out in life, she had all of her money in a CD.  Every three months it would roll over and she's getting like less than 1%.  She said, Dad, help me invest it.  And what did I tell her?  Betterment.  Now, the reason is these days, first of all, you've got to have long term savings.  I'm proud of her at the age of 25 that she has savings.  Really important.  You're saving for retirement.  At her age, she's probably saving for kids going to college.  Maybe a house, rainy day fund.  You've got to save.  But you can't just put it in a mattress or it's practically as bad to put it in a CD.  You've got to invest.  But that's a challenge.  If you don't have the time to do the research, and even if you do,  it's hard to compete with the people who do this for a living.  That's why I recommend Betterment to everybody.  It's the largest independent online financial advisor.  Betterment is designed to help improve your long term returns.  And I like this.  Lower taxes for retirement planning, for building wealth, for all your financial goals.  270,000 customers to date.  Many of them I have sent, I think.  Based on what you share, Betterment will, including risk tolerance, your plans,  they asked Abby a few questions.  It made tailored recommendations on decisions like how much to invest, how much risk to take on.  You know, she's young, so she can take on more risk.  She's probably, I think, though she's kind of risk adverse.  She doesn't want so it balances it based on what you want.  Features like Betterment, she loved this socially responsible investing portfolio.  Their SRI will give you the flexibility to reduce your investment in companies that don't meet  your social, environmental and government's benchmarks.  So you can feel good about your investments.  Betterment gives you a clearer view of your net worth when you sink in outside accounts.  Like bank accounts and other investments.  But best of all, their fees are transparent and low compared to traditional services.  I'm not sure which one Abby's going to choose.  You could get, you can, for 0.25% a year, that's all.  You can get unlimited messaging access to their team of licensed financial experts  through their mobile apps messaging feature.  By the way, these are fiduciaries.  These are people who are not paid, they're not on commission,  they're not paid by the companies they're investing in, they're paid by you.  By your fees and they work in your, on your behalf alone.  So you really can trust them.  I had to kind of explain to Abby what fiduciary means and why this is so important.  Some financial advisors are not really acting on your behalf, but they are at Betterment.  If you want, and I think this may be something down the road she'd want,  you can upgrade to 0.4%.  That's all 0.4% for unlimited phone access to their team of certified financial planners.  I think as she gets older, a financial planner will be really of value to her.  And she doesn't want to listen to me.  She wants, you know, she doesn't want to hear what dad has to say.  Betterment is a fiduciary.  So that means they don't get commissions for recommending funds.  They don't have funds of their own.  And they do what's right for you.  They're working for you.  Betterment cares about keeping your money and data secure too.  They do it all right.  I checked it out.  Absolutely.  Full data encryption, hash, salted, two-factor authentication.  Very, very important.  Your stuff is secure and private at Betterment.  Now, as I told Abby, investing involves risk.  I don't want her to have, you know, oh, it's automatic.  You're going to make money.  But I have to say with the right advice, doing it smart.  If you start young, by the time you're my age, you'll have something to live on.  I didn't start so young.  I wish I had.  And unfortunately, due to SEC regulations, because I do the ads for Betterment,  I can't use them.  Kills me.  But if I could, I would.  And certainly members of my family do.

Transcript:  Oh, Leo's doing his Russian accent.  We're in trouble.  Yeah, we are back with This Week in Tech.  I'm Becky Warlie.  And joined by Rob Reed, Robert Scoble, and Bob Sullivan.  You may have noticed this is the All Robert Show.  You must be called Robert.  Now, I want you to know I thought about it.  And just to really be progressive in how we book the show,  next week, it's going to be the All Richard Show.  We're going to have a Richard, a Rich, and a Dick.  So that's how it's going to go.  That's next week's show.  So you guys are going to have to figure out who those people are.  I think Dick DiPartolo is going to be.  We're going to figure it out.  It's going to happen.  I want to get us back into the swing of things by talking about Google.  They announced this week it's acquiring a big portion of Taiwan hardware maker HTC.  Google pays $1.1 billion, gets 2,000 new employees.  HTC keeps about 2,000 employees, gets a ton of cash,  which they need desperately.  And this is the interesting part is that HTC is going to continue making its own HTC branded devices.  Simultaneously, we know that Google is going to announce the Pixel 2 on October 4th.  So I promised that this would be the double rainbow explanation.  What does it mean?

Start time: 3117.46
End time: 3147.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It means HTC has some more money to invest in its VR headset,  which didn't go to Google, right?  Google bought the Pixel team from last year, right?  HTC made the first Pixel last year, and those people are going to Google,  which gives you a hint to why Google bought this group of people at HTC.  But this gives the other HTC the money to keep investing in VR  until VR starts catching with consumers, which it has not.

Start time: 3147.68
End time: 3173.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the good side for HTC.  But then let's look at it from the Google side.  So HTC's stock price is down 96% from what it was at its all-time high way, way back.  It's bleeding cash, struggling.  Do you think because Google felt held hostage by the fact that one of their best,  their hardware manufacturer is struggling, did they have to do this?

Start time: 3174.34
End time: 3226.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think Google is gearing up for a new age in consumer electronics of glasses,  and they need more people who know how to build things,  because Google knows it's going to be in a war with Apple and Microsoft and Amazon,  and is gearing up for that war.  I think it's a smart purchase on that point.  I don't think Google really cares about the business interests of HTC  and whether it survives or not.  Google has plenty of great partners with Samsung.  LG is making the new Pixel 2 phone.  Huawei, I'm going to Huawei's launch of the Mate 9 or 10,  coming up in a couple weeks in Germany.  And so Google has plenty of Android partners who are doing real well.  And that's why HTC has been in trouble, by the way.  Samsung and Huawei have been taking it apart in the worldwide market.

Start time: 3227.74

Transcript:  And you're seeing all sorts of new products coming out, right?  Amazon has the Echo, Google has Google Home, and a bunch of other products.  I have a new Wi-Fi mesh network that comes from Google, right?  So there's plenty of places to use engineers and supply chain experts  who know how to get things built to build real product.

Transcript:  $550,000 per employee.  I did the math on my calculator.  Wow.  Yeah, the 1.1 billion, 2,000 employees.  That's a big recruiting sum, but they are obviously coming in  and integrated teams that know how to do stuff.  Do either or any of you, any of the three of you,  think that Google now regrets losing or getting rid of Motorola?  Because they're kind of, you know, they had a lot of these people good at making stuff.

Start time: 3285.08
End time: 3295.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that was the first comment when we started talking about HTC's rumor  that Google was going to be buying a piece of it was,  oh, didn't they screw up Motorola before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They buy smaller companies and they screw it up  and then they try it again and screw it up again.  And we'll see if this actually makes something out of it.  But you can tell Google is in a different space  than it was back at the Motorola launch.  Google has quite a few hardware products now.  And we're entering a new era of competition among these big players.  So staffing up at this point makes a lot of sense to me.

Transcript:  Let's hit some of those products just so we go through them.  So the Pixel 2 XL, we saw leaks in black and white, just black,  maybe $849 for a 64 gigabyte phone.  That's coming from Droid Life, I think.  Pixel 2, three colors, kind of blue is one of those colors.  Miles Davis reference.  Love it.  Yeah.  Got it.  OK, that's very Google-y to do that, right?  And the Pixel Book, expensive.  It's a $1,200 Chromebook-ish.  I mean, that's spendy, but people are excited about it.

Transcript:  So all this, Google announcing all this, October 4 in San Francisco.  Yeah, I think they obviously are in the hardware business  and feel like they have to compete.  I'm going to move on to a couple more little sort of business-y stories  just to move us through.  T-Mobile and Sprint.  There are noises, Reuters reporting that the two companies  are close to reaching tentative terms.  DIL rumored to be coming down the pike by the end of October.  So Sprint and T-Mobile are the number three and number four wireless carriers.  If they combined into one, it would be 130 million subscribers.  T-Mobile CEO, John Legere, he's a wild man,  would remain the CEO of the new company.  They've had big regulatory issues all along,  but you're going to remember that Sprint's major stockholder, SoftBank,  SoftBank's owner, Masayoshi San,  met with President Trump at the end of last year  and then announced at the beginning of this year  that this is going to be great.  We're going to benefit from the deregulation.  Sprint joining with T-Mobile.  Bob Sullivan, is this good for us?

Transcript:  Anybody who likes their brand new, great, all-you-can-eat cell phone plan  is going to really hate this.  The best thing that happened to consumers was the last time  a big cell phone company merger was blocked.  And what we saw out of that was all of these incredibly aggressive pricing moves  by T-Mobile that led the industry down and down into a situation  where we all lost unlimited data plans, and now we have them back.  And we have antitrust lawyers in Washington, D.C., I think, to thank for that.  Of course, in order to stay competitive,  you probably eventually figured these two were going to match up.  But anytime, as far as I'm concerned, anytime a quadopoly goes to a triopoly,  which it's bad for consumers, and ultimately we're going to get less  choice and higher prices as a result.

Transcript:  Well, more of this week in tech in a moment.  I'm sorry I'm not here.  Wish I were.  I'm way too much fun.  I will be back next week.  Thank you, Becky, for holding down the fort.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  You've heard me talk about them before.  Rocket Mortgage comes from Quicken Loans, the best home loan company in America.  I can say that without fear of contradiction.  All you have to do is look at JD Power's Customer Satisfaction Awards, number one,  year after year, for both mortgage servicing and mortgage approval.  Now they've taken it a step farther.  I think this is a great company, Quicken Loans, making a product for you.  So you the geek, us in other words.  So if you're looking to get a home loan, unfortunately, I have to say, and I bought  four houses in my life.  Last time was about four years ago, Lisa and I bought our current house.  And I didn't really, I just, I went to where the guy, the guy, the realtor told us to go to,  frankly, and it was that big bank, you know, the one with the stagecoach and the horses.  Yeah.  And what a mistake.  They, it was like, I don't know, like we were prisoners, like we don't trust you.  It took more than a month.  They asked for more and more information to the point we were going on vacation and they  still wanted information.  We were sending faxing information in from the boat on our cruise.  This was four years ago.  We almost lost the house.  I am not kidding.  It took us more than a month to get a home loan.  Next time, Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage.  Rocket's aptly named because it's fast.  And it lifts the burden of getting a home loan because you don't have to go to the bank.  You don't have to go to Quicken Loans even.  You just go online to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  That's rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number two.  And you can do it all online and it's easy and it's fast.  You don't have to go through boxes to find your check statements or your,  you know, your pay stubs or anything like that, because they have,  of course, financial partners throughout the industry.  They can get everything they need with your permission.  All you have to do is give them permission.  They will crunch the numbers and then tell you based on your income assets and credits  what loans you qualify for.  And this happens not in months or weeks or days, but in minutes.  Literally minutes.  It's completely transparent.  You know exactly what's happening.  You can understand the process fully.  You get to choose the loan you want with absolute confidence  because it's from Quicken Loans, the best lender in the country.  I love this.  It's so fast you could do it in an open house and have your loan before you left.  Say, look, we're approved.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Apply simply.  Understand fully mortgage confidently at rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  You're probably not buying a house this moment.  Maybe you are.  If you're not, bookmark rocketmortgage.com slash twit two  and use it when you do.  You'll be glad.  You can thank me later.  Equal Housing Lender licensed in all 50 states and MLSconsumeraccess.org.  Number 3030.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  We thank them for their support.  You can bet next time we buy or refi, we'll be going to Rocket Mortgage.  Now back to Becky Worley and Twit.

Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.  This week in tech continues.  I am Becky Worley, as Leo just mentioned.  I want to focus this block on security.  It seems like it's been a huge week.  We're going to talk about the SEC Edgar breach.  We're going to talk about the C cleaner breach.  And some interesting developments about who that was really targeting.  But I want to start out with the Equifax breach.  It's like a cascade of developments that just keeps getting worse.  So Bob Sullivan, you posted, you have been continually posting and covering this story.  And you sounded like a total voice of reason as the advice was flying willy nilly.  So can you just give us a timeline of what we know now, what happened,  when it happened or why is that?  You know, what's what's the state of the state with Equifax right now?

Start time: 3895.97
End time: 3947.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  Well, just to bring everybody up to speed, I think everybody knows that 143 million  customers, consumers, not customers, consumers had their information exposed in this hack.  And that's probably about three quarters of Americans who have a credit report.  So we might as well just say everybody.  And we learned about this two weeks ago.  Over the past few weeks, little pieces of what has actually happened have dribbled out.  So we still don't know a lot of important things.  The most important question of all for me is who did this and why?  And Equifax has been strikingly silent on that issue.  It's really important because I think the steps that people should take to protect themselves  vary a lot based on who at least we suspect was responsible for this and what their intention  with the data was.  It could be anything from just a drive by hack.  We now know that the way they broke in was not complicated.  It was at that point a fairly well known actively exploited attack.

Start time: 3948.48
End time: 3954.92

Start time: 3955.76
End time: 3997.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think it's undisputable.  We've seen all the steps that have happened in the way that they've handled this.  It's just clear that Equifax did not take any of this seriously,  including the announcement itself.  They came out with a website that was badly constructed.  The latest news just this week, folks who went to that website and entered the information to see  if they were exposed by the hack and were told, come back and we'll contact you about  our free offer of a product.  They're just now getting the first set of emails and those emails are coming from a brand new  domain that was just registered a couple of weeks ago.  So a lot of web browsers are flagging them as phishing emails.  Of course they will.  They look fake.  And there's been one incident like this after another since this attack.

Start time: 3998.98
End time: 4052.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was completely flummoxed by this because I went to go look at what URL they were directing people  to.  So Equifax said created this correct URL Equifax security 2017.com.  And my first thought was why would you not have Equifax.com slash security 2017 or something that  I could verify was the Equifax domain.  And then someone registered an inversion of that URL the opposite instead of Equifax security,  blah, blah, blah.  They registered security Equifax 2017.  And whoops Equifax's own Twitter account was directing people to the wrong URL.  Even they confused themselves.  If the stakes weren't so high, it would be comical.

Start time: 4054.16
End time: 4180.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just again, it's a signal of a company that this would be the equivalent of  cars rolling off of an assembly line.  And before major incidents occur, windows falling out and tires falling off.  It's just obvious they weren't taking it seriously.  They didn't train their employees well enough.  People were calling who hadn't even apparently the only people in the world who didn't know about  this leak were Equifax customer service representatives.  People were calling and getting the verbal equivalent of blank stares when they called.  This is the most important point to me because of course, what's happened since is this absolute  flurry man house of activity.  LifeLock said it had 100,000 new signups within a couple of days.  All sorts of people flooding the security fees, freeze websites of the three credit bureaus.  Security freezes are great, but my recommendation has been to just wait for a minute because  we know the data was stolen several months ago.  So there's no urgency to do this yesterday, today or tomorrow.  We can wait until we find out more about what's happened.  And again, whether it was a prank, whether it was a nation state, whether it was a professional  set of identity thieves, the truth behind that will affect the sensible choices that you make.  But I want people to really think about this.  We already know last year there were more identity theft victims than ever.  And people are kind of bored of this story because it's been going on for so long.  But something like 15 million Americans had their identities stolen last year.  Why that matters is how much has a typical consumer's odds gone up  for being a likelihood of being a victim because of this Equifax incident?  And I would argue one or two percent, maybe.  So in reality, the world is not a lot more dangerous today than it was two weeks before  we knew about this incident.  So I don't want people to overreact to it.  I certainly don't want them paying for products that they don't need.  I do believe that the end result of all of this has already been a couple of bills in Congress  urging this will be that all these companies have to allow us to freeze our credit reports  for free.  And I think that and they'll also be forced to have a simple procedure for doing that,  a simple procedure for thawing our credit reports.  And so you can afford to wait a little bit and see how that shakes out before you overreact.

Consumer Reports came out with their advice this week and they took a while to come out with  some concrete advice.  And they kind of did the you can do a freeze if you want, but they didn't advise doing  it.  They really just said you can if you want.  I have a very practical question for you, though, Bob.  My son is here.  Finn, come here.  He's nine.  And I haven't told you this because it's kind of complicated.  But I went to the site and I put in Finn has a sister who's his twin.  They have sequential social security numbers.  I put them both in and one has apparently been compromised and the other one hasn't.  And it just makes no sense to me that they would have sequential social security numbers and one  would potentially be hacked and one wouldn't.  How much can we trust the Equifax site that says did you know that?  No.  Don't worry.  I check your credit all the time.  I've been doing that since like you were six months old.  So don't worry.  I got you covered, buddy.  Okay.  You haven't taken out you haven't opened any credit cards.  Have you?  No.  Okay.  Good.  All right.  Well, I'm just saying I want to make sure I know that you haven't because if a credit  card ever was opened in your name in the next year, I would know.  Uh-oh.  Maybe it was from the Equifax hack.  So I don't know.  So Bob, should one of my children be worried?  What is going on with their site that supposedly says some are compromised and some aren't?

Transcript:  So I haven't gotten an answer and myself and a bunch of other journalists have been asking  this question since the very beginning.  So I can only presume by reading tea leaves from the outside, but I've heard so many stories  just like the one you just shared that tell me that there was no live data behind that website  that Equifax was sending people to.  I mean, I don't know that.  This is my speculation.  So many people either got a vague answer or got, you know, I've heard people get who received  different answers on different dates.  I mean, I think that might have been, you know, essentially busy work that they gave  people so that they could have give them something to do to try to reassure them and get them  in the process of signing up for this product they want people to have that's going to be  their free gift.  But I am just convinced that they didn't necessarily have real data behind that.  So I would not believe what they told you.  And if somebody who went to that site was told your data was not impacted, I wouldn't  believe it.

Transcript:  So now one of the big developments this week is that the stock sales by the corporate officers  are being evaluated because apparently based on some of the data that we're seeing now,  many of them sold stock before the hack was revealed.  And the DOJ is now said to be engaging in a criminal probe that that was insider trading  or a violation of the SEC rules.  I also read somewhere that the head of security for Equifax made $2.3 million a year, which  is again horrifying.  That word keeps popping up.  And their chief information officer and their head of security are retiring.  So this story just keeps rolling along.  I think it's going to be made into some sort of a business school case of how not to handle  a situation.  It just keeps going sideways.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And they have this history.  I mean, if you just go down the rap sheet for all of the bureaus at the Federal Trade  Commission, you know, consent order after consent order for decades.  So that's in the DNA of these companies is, you know, how do we sort of walk along the  edge of the law and once in a while we walk along the wrong side of it.  But I do think that the most important thing about this hack is what you just said.  I am old enough that I wrote about the very first choice point hack when the first time  that Americans discovered that there were even companies like choice point that had  data backgrounds on you.  That story was on the front page of every newspaper in the country for a week, just  like this one.  But the real story was, who is choice point?  Why do they have data about me?  I never heard of them.  But yet they know what block I live in, what kind of food I eat.  And that's really what this is about.  I mean, people have heard of Equifax before, but in the end, everybody is stopping  and saying, I never asked for this.  How could you put me at such great risk when I have no business relationship with you  whatsoever?  I mean, lots of people like me were running around correcting others.  And the first day that this happened, when people were saying 143 million customers were  exposed by this attack.  And that's not true.  Equifax only has a few customers, banks and lenders.  We're not their customers.  We're their product.  And we didn't ask for this.  And now they put us at risk.  And that's really where the anger comes from.

Transcript:  The chat room makes such a great point that John Oliver needs to cover this.  This is a perfect target for his diatribes.  I want to move on in security and talk about SeaCleaner for Windows.  You've heard of it.  It's a popular security app.  It's supposed to clean temporary internet files, getting rid of malicious programs.  Now Avast, which is a big, well-known security company, hosts, distributes the software.  But this year, this week, it was found to be tainted with a back door.  And it seems like they've served it to millions of its users.  And this was all between August 15 and September 12.  Cisco Talos researchers found the activity.  And what's really come to light at the end of this week is that even though there were  700,000 some infected PCs, 20 of them belong to really connected companies that seem to be  the target here, or at least the fishing expedition.  We're talking about Cisco, Microsoft, Gmail, VMware, Akamai, Sony, Samsung.  And I think it leads to that underlying issue when we're talking about these big tech companies,  when we're talking about security.  Who can you trust?  This is not like a random download from some, you know, Joe's download site.  These are from the companies themselves with embedded malware in it.

And I was like, come on, be honest, how many of you use two factor authentication on your iPhone?  And like one out of four was using it.  And this these are people who are rich, have something to protect.  Targets.  Who are in the tech industry and should know better, but don't practice the best security  on their person.  And that's how these things get in.  Right?  Somebody clicks on an email at a company and all of a sudden it's spreading throughout the network  because somebody didn't follow protocol and probably doesn't even know the proper protocol,  to be honest about it.  When I worked at Rackspace, we saw this all the time and we'd have to go through and  change lots of servers and do lots of things because somebody would get in  through an employee clicking on a link.  And all of a sudden there's bad stuff going around.  Right?

And you know, like human nature is what it is.  That's a known quantity.  I saw somebody in the chat room say this a moment ago and I agree.  I wish I picked up on the nick.  But part of the problem here is that cleaning the registry is hard.  And you know, Microsoft invented registries.  Microsoft could do a better job of making them clean themselves.  And a product like CC cleaner could have been coming from Redmond.  And we theoretically wouldn't have had this problem.  We've seen that.

I'm not saying to blame it on the fished employee in the chat room.  Sorry, getting in with me.  I'm saying it's a deep problem that all of us are at blame for.  And very few of us practice good security practices.  How many of you go to Google and search on how to make a good password?  How many of us use two factor authentication?  How many of us use a separate password for each service we're registering on?  Right.  How many of us really think about security?  I can tell you very few of us do.  I do because I live in fear of my life being hacked.  Right.  But very few people do.  And that's in the tech industry amongst people who should know better.

Transcript:  I've got a question of personal relevance for Bob, but I think it's going to interest a lot of viewers as well.  So Bob, you had suggested that we not get carried away and freeze our...  It's called freezing our credit, right?

Start time: 4806.20
End time: 4808.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the main option that people are suggesting.  Yeah.

Start time: 4808.36
End time: 4896.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I am one of those who did get carried away and froze my credit two nights ago.  And it was actually a last straw thing because I've probably had four or five periods in the  last 10 or 15 years where somebody has given me one free year of Experian or Equifax.  We gave away your social security number.  So for 12 months, we're going to give you this product that when the 12 months are over  is going to start costing you $15.99 if you're not really careful.  And after having all these free years that have rolled into this expensive...  The very idea of Equifax giving me a free product that I would then get addicted to  and have to pay whatever for for the rest of my life because they gave somebody my social  security number was a little bit too much.  So I decided to freeze my credit.  My wife and I, we both have plenty of credit cards.  We're not anticipating taking out any loans.  So my first question to you is why not do that?  If one is...  I mean, not everybody's in that situation.  And we were doing it with some dread because we're like, oh my God, unfreezing it is probably...  We're going to get punished by Equifax because we make our lives a living hell when we actually  need to unfreeze it.  Why are you suggesting that people keep their credit unfrozen?  Because it seems if it is frozen, and please tell me if this is false security,  it becomes almost impossible.  I mean, somebody could steal your identity, but they can't do anything with it because  they can't take out any credit.  Or is that false security?

Start time: 4897.14
End time: 4933.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, you're right.  And I, by the way, I'm in favor of security freezes.  I've spent the last several years telling people that they're a good idea, especially  someone who's in your spot.  But as somebody who sometimes has to give advice to millions of panicked people,  my first piece of advice in this moment was don't do anything because you might do the  wrong thing.  The best example of that, I did a story about this.  For several days last week, when you search TransUnion's website for a security freeze,  what you got was one page saying their security freeze website was broken,  and then a redirect to their identity theft product, which was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I want to hear what about- Well, actually, I can show you something of great,  fabulous timing.  I think it might be available, the screenshot.  Okay, so this is what happened when I was trying to do my credit freeze on Equifax.  I went through the whole process and I got this error message as a screenshot from my Mac.  It said, sorry, we can't process your online request.  To assist us in processing your request, please submit in writing the following things.  And they list in writing, I'm supposed to mail to them a bunch of stuff,  including my social security number on a piece of paper that I mailed to them.  And this is, I was so staggered by the audacity of this incompetence to basically say,  get a mail or something, here's our address and scribble your social security number.  So I called them.  It was still, it was a few minutes before 1 a.m. when their customer service locked shut down.  So I called them.  Now to their credit, I got through to customer service very quickly and I explained what  happened and the woman I talked to said, oh yeah, there's a problem with the site.  Go to this other site.  And she gives me a URL and it's basically an FTC site that has articles about identity theft.  She said, you can do it from that site.  Go to this FTC site and you can do it there or mail this stuff in.  Now thank God, the next day I was like, okay, now the kid gloves are coming off.  And actually after a couple of more attempts, I was able to finally get it done online.  But the fact that I get this thing saying mail us your social security number.  Oh my God.  And TransUnion was broken that night as well, but I got through to them the following day too.  But Experian, boom, three minutes, I was frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, that's a really great point.  Once again, we have to remember that the victims here are not consumers of the company.  So the incentive that these bureaus have to take care of our data is,  on the list of priorities for the meeting quarterly estimates, this is going to be number 99 of 100.  And that's why we need rules.  But the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all of its subsequent additions, like the FACT Act in 2003,  have hundreds of pages of regulations where, I mean, it's incredibly specific.  I went back and found the first credit freeze law, which was passed by the state of California in 2002.  And just as a plug for state legislators, we wouldn't have security freezes if it weren't for  state legislatures that passed individual state laws.  That's why in every single state of the union, there are slightly different rules for how we get  a security freeze.  But it even specifies how they have to do it.  There has to be a 10-digit PIN involved.  Incredibly specific.  And that's the only way that you can get these companies to do things, is to be that specific.  It is very hard for Washington, D.C., or any state house, to pass legislation that's going  to be specific about security at a company like Equifax.  To be specific about saying you have to use, say, a content inspection tool, which would have caught  143 million Social Security numbers flying by.  Even like basic off-the-shelf software should have caught that.  But they didn't use it, and they would invest in it because it's just a mere cost center to them.  And so we need rules, but it's very, very hard to pass legislation that's effective that way.

Transcript:  So Bob, when I can't take it anymore, and I just have to get another frequent flyer credit card,  what hoops am I going to have?  Having frozen my credit now, what hoops am I going to have to jump through to unfreeze it?  I did save the 10-digit PINs.  I have them all very carefully squared away.  I won't say where.  But I got all the PINs.  How hard is it to unfreeze?  And I'm sure a lot of viewers are going to be interested in this as well, because it's  a consequence of freezing some type of thought.  Yeah.

Start time: 5213.08
End time: 5287.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, there's a simple five-step process.  And when you have all those things in place, it'll be fine.  You'll be able to do it quickly.  However, there are so many variables that can go wrong.  And I know you just told me you put that 10-digit PIN in a careful place.  However, four years might go by, and you'll have completely forgotten where that is.  It's very, very hard.  I hear from consumers all the time who can't find that PIN.  And then the good news is it's then difficult to get into your account.  And we want that, right?  Right.  But Brian Krebs, the great security writer, he published a story just a couple of days  ago concerned at some of the credit bureaus actually issuing people these PINs without  asking difficult questions.  And this is going to be the next step in the cat and mouse game that we see.  For the most part, everything I know about security freezes are, they work.  I do not know of a single person who has complained to me that I had a security freeze on my report  and my identity was stolen anyway.  So they work.  However, very few people have used them.  And now that a lot of people are standing up for them, PIN hacking is going to become  a thing.  Of course it is.  So it'll just be another step identity thieves have to go through to commit crime.  And now you're part of this larger, more homogeneous group.  And this is the process.  So people need to watch out for that.

Transcript:  Lest we think that these problems only happen to consumers, to large corporations.  Oh, no.  The United States government also had a horrendous breach this week.  It was disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission's Edgar database was hacked.  This is where you'll find publicly accessible documents that tell you about the filings  of any large publicly traded company.  But it's also where companies do a couple of things that create knowledge that would  be beneficial to someone who knew it before it was public.  So there's a private part of the Edgar database where companies file information that's  required by the SEC but is not required to be public.  And it's where companies post dummy filings.  And often they will create the draft of the filing and post it there to make sure that  it formats correctly and looks right.  And then they'll go live with it at the appropriate time.  Well, when the database was hacked, a lot of that information was made available to  traders and it's been disclosed that there have been some trades made that benefited  those hackers.  And, you know, I've been coming to security since the tech TV days.  And I used to think in a lot of ways as early and nascent viruses, hacks, it was graffiti.  But that it was going to get serious when it got financial.  And then when ransomware hit, I thought this is it.  You know, and now we're seeing way beyond that.  And not only does this incentivize other hackers to go after big, big whale targets, but it  also undermines our faith in the systems that we depend on for our democracy.  And this goes to fake news.  This goes to when the markets are shaken.  I'm surprised that there wasn't a jitters set because it feels like this market is ready  for some jitters anyway.  So I was surprised that this didn't trigger anything.  But do you think this is one more step in that erosion of faith?

Transcript:  I think my the personal step that I took of basically stepping out of the credit system  because I, you know, I'm a that that to me was pretty big.  And it would have been an unimaginable step for me to have taken, I don't know, 10 or 15  years ago.  But I really felt like on a certain level, I was succeeding from a certain part of the  economy because I had absolutely no faith left in people whose job it was to secure  us.  And in fact, quite the opposite of getting back to a lot of things that Bob was talking  about.  I'm the product, not the customer.  And their defense of me is completely not a priority.  And yeah, that personal secession from something just knowing I can't get the jet blue visa  card, which I really don't want, I really don't want it.  I'll buy a car, buy a house.  Yeah.  No, but but taking that step of sort of quasi sequestering myself and I didn't have it.  Thank you, Bob.  You put my mind at ease that when it comes time to thought if I'll be able to do it.  But I did it without any notion that it was going to be easy to thaw this thing because  yeah, it's a last straw kind of thing.  I'm sure every one of these things, it's like a drumbeat.  You know, when Anthem got hacked, I mean that in some ways that's even more intimate because  that's your insurer.  They've got your medical information.  You're trusting them with your life.  They handed out tens of millions of Social Security numbers.  So yeah, I think it does.  It has an eroding effect for sure.

You just have to assume it's going to happen to you and plan your recovery now,  which conceptually comes kind of falls in the category of backups.  So there are lots of ways that a hacker can ruin your life and it doesn't mean  draining your bank account.

One of the most horrible things that can happen to someone is a ransomware  attack or just some kind of file deletion of all your family photos.  I always bring this example up because it's so personal.  Many, many people don't have a single photo of their baby that's not digital somewhere.  And while we all say this, they don't have backups.  And so having a backup for your most precious files is really the way to plan for this.  So it's not about prevention, it's about recovery.  And so use the picture metaphor and then think about your money.  Think about all the other parts of your life.  Think like a hacker is what I usually say.  If someone was to really mess with your life, what would they do?  And how could you plan for that, encounter that, and recover from that?

So we're not, you know, we just we don't get it this week or the next week.  You choose the day you get it.  You choose the menu.  They deliver you a box with up to three different meals for two or for a family of four.  You choose all the ingredients you need.  Fresh, delicious ingredients, never frozen, not even the meat or the fish.  It's all fresh in a refrigerated box.  Precisely the right amount, too.  So if you need one celery rib, you get it.  You don't get all stock that you have to waste later, put in the fridge.  You don't, you know, everything you need.  If you need two teaspoons of soy sauce, it comes in a little cute little jar, a little bottle.  You don't have any extra.  But that's good.  For a couple of reasons.  First of all, makes the recipe easy.  If you didn't use it all, you didn't do it right.  I know I have to use this because it's sitting here.  Plus, there's no leftovers, no waste.  And I have to say the food is so good.  You probably won't have any leftovers of that either.  It is amazing.  Very, but good portions.  Ten dollars per person or less.  There's seasonal recipes from 150 local farms and fisheries and ranchers.  All sustainable.  The kind of food you would buy.  And by the way, every time I get a blue apron box, I marvel at how perfect the produce and the fish  and the meat are.  It's perfect.  It's like, well, I guess it is handpicked.  It's like, if I went to the store, I wouldn't get it.  It wouldn't be as good.  They do a better job than me.  Go to blueapron.com slash twit.  Look at the menu.  See what's on the menu.  Stuff like summer vegetable and egg paninis with Calabrian chili mayonnaise and caprese salad.  Oh, I hate these ads.  They make me so hungry.  I'm sorry.  Soy glazed pork and rice cakes with bok choy and marinated green beans.  These are skills too, by the way.  These are things that you will now know how to do.  And I can't tell you every time we do blue apron, there's one or two things we go, oh,  we're making this again.  But now you know how you've done it.  Skillet vegetable chili.  By the way, this is a vegetarian meal.  Yeah, they have meals for all your dietary needs.  Skillet vegetable chili with cornmeal and cheddar drop biscuits.  No.  That's mean.  Garlic, butter, shrimp, and corn with green bean salad and roasted purple tomatoes.  Look, now's the time.  Go to blue.  Be sure to check out while you're there, the Blue Apron Market on the website.  They've got all sorts of pantry items.  We've been buying all sorts of things, tools and kitchen appliances and things from them.  They even have a wine selection, which is fantastic.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Every meal has a wine pairing they recommend.  I know Becky likes a little wine now and then.  You know exactly what wine pairs with it.  It's wonderful.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Get three meals free.  Yes, three meals free with your first purchase and free shipping.  You'll love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cooked meals with  Blue Apron.  And if you have kids, get the family plan and get the kids to cook it with you.  Trust me on this.  They love it.  You love it.  The house smells incredible and you're giving them a great skill.  And what a great family experience.  You'll look back on and think, oh, those are the days.  Blue Apron.  I wish I could do it now.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Blue Apron is a better way to cook.  And we thank you for their support of this week in tech.  Back to Becky and the gang.

He is seriously one of my oldest friends.  So it's awesome to come do this show, but I miss him when I'm here and it makes me think of him a lot.  The next story is complicated.  And Facebook, they're clarifying it's their advertising policy.  After last week, it was discovered by ProPublica that advertisers were able to target users  based on anti-Semitic terms like Jew haters.  ProPublica did the research and it's caused a ton of fear in how ads are targeted.  CTO of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote that they're tightening their enforcement processes.  They're making sure that ad targeting terms don't violate Facebook's community standards.  And that includes targeting anyone based on negative opinions, based on race, ethnicity,  national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity,  disability, diseases.  And this is where I think the key is they also promise to add more human review to the automated  processes and they're creating a program to encourage people to report abuses.  Alex Cantrowitz at Buzzfeed tried the same thing at Google and basically it allowed the same  types of racist phrases.  He chose black people ruin everything was one of the terms that he targeted.  So he tried to do this not only with anti-Semitic terms but also with racist phrases.  And I guess I would ask Rob Reed, is this the first or one of many steps along the path of algorithms  dividing us as people?

Transcript:  First of all, going to the issues, I don't know if the fact that it was possible for people to  target ads to this.  I haven't seen any suggestion that either of these companies is doing a rampant business in  these actual keywords.  And I also I kind of got the feeling that these were just kind of like open fields where one could  type in any random string of letters and numbers if they wanted to or any four English words  strung together.  So, you know, I'm glad that the companies reacted with horror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was the autocomplete was kind of horrifying because that means people type those things in  the past and the algorithm is recognizing it.  So, I mean, I think the companies appropriately reacted with horror.  I don't know if we can necessarily, you know, be furious with them for not having anticipated  every plausible offensive four word combination like black people ruin anything.  It would so never enter my mind to say those four words.  And most minds, it wouldn't enter their minds.  So it's not surprising that Google didn't deliberately say, oh, somebody might say this.  Let's block it.  Nonetheless, you know, the autocomplete is kind of chilling because I think that's algorithmically  generated thing.  That means lots of people did happen to type in that thing, which is why everything always  autocompletes net worth.  How weird is that?  Right.  You type in anybody's name and it immediately like George Washington net worth.  What does that mean?  He's been dead for 200 years.

Transcript:  I can't remember who said it, but the overarching concept was that if you write algorithms,  it is and you're responsible for them.  It is your duty to think about the worst possible thing it could do.  And so, you know, your your point that I would never think  and I mean, it is an infinite set of possibilities and therefore it's a programming challenge.  But the bigger issue in my mind is that this is a profit margin question, which is the  reason why these companies are such profit monsters is because they have so little human  oversight and they have a responsibility.  And to these companies credits specifically, Google, I think, well, I'll get to Twitter later,  but, you know, Mark Zuckerberg also said this week that Facebook is going to stop allowing  untraceable political ads that, you know, I come from a TV world.  I've been in the TV business since 1993 and we have a duty because the FTC mandates that  we have a lot of oversight on what ads we take, where they air and what standards they meet.  And that is the beauty of the Internet.  And we're really seeing the dark side.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think, well, that's partly a relic, I believe, of the fact that TV stations were  using a public resource in the bandwidths and it was a finite resource.  And because you were taking a public good, you fell under a certain level of licensing  and restriction that the Internet didn't fall under.  So I think that might have been more.  TV stations granted a monopoly.  Precisely.  More that than necessarily a speech regulation.  It was back in the day.  It was back in the day.

Transcript:  They were Thursday Night Football on Twitter last year.  Yeah, randomness.  But with local TV, it's a whole weird thing.  Oh, and the blackouts.  But the thing with being able to know everything, an algorithm to do is very, very problematic  because with particularly with a lot of the neural network program, the programming that's  going on, when you take a training set and a really sophisticated machine learning system  and sicken on that and it starts making connections and it starts processing things, the programmers  quite literally can't tell you exactly how it's working.  They don't understand because it's gone through back propagation and then also in some places  they might do genetic coding where the code is evolving itself and the output can be something  that's radically efficient but is quite literally unknowable to the engineer who set that process  in motion as to how and why it works.  Almost by definition.

Start time: 6330.90
End time: 6337.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying that's because it's learning or you're saying that's because the data sets  are so infinite that it's hard to test every scenario?

Start time: 6337.64
End time: 6438.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because in going through the data and finding this leads to an accurate outcome  and that leads to an inaccurate outcome, it's shaping the pathways within itself in a semi-automated  manner that gradually approaches more and more and more correctness.  This is how image recognition has suddenly worked after not working for decades and decades.  And in a very different branch which is genetic programming, somebody will basically tell software  to evolve itself and maybe it's trying to target a positive return in high velocity  trading in the market and it knows how score is kept.  Score is kept.  If you make money, you win and if you lose money, you lose.  And programs could start evolving in a very, very rapid way where thousands or even more  attempts at coming up with an algorithm that work are mutated and evolved and rejected  in a way that's quite literally Darwinian.  And again, you might end up with an output that you really don't understand.  Now the most arguably, there's a guy named Nicholas Bostrom who is a leading theorist  in super intelligence and super AI research and he is quite concerned about something  that's become quite widespread which he refers to as neuromorphic programming and a better term  might be neuromimetic which is basically where researchers, particularly AI researchers,  are replicating the way the human brain does things because we know it works here and we  can replicate it imperfectly in silicon but the problem is you end up creating something that you  really, truly don't understand.  It's like this is how it works in nature and we can replicate it and we can speed it up  by a million X.  Let's make it simpler.

Transcript:  The CEO of Tury, which Apple bought, gave a talk last year at the data science conference  and he said we trained AI on huskies and wolves and it kept throwing an error once in a while  and they looked into how the algorithm learned about those two things and it learned on the  snow in the picture.  It learned on the wrong thing and you took the snow out of the picture because wolves  are usually on grass and huskies are usually on snow and the once in a while would be incorrect.  You take the snow out of the picture and it learned on the face of the dog or on the wolf  and it got correct and that's just a very simple way to demonstrate where we're going.  Google assistant is learning from our behavior.  It switches words on me once in a while because it's trying to fit me into a search that already  was done and we're going to get some complex systems.  It's going to be very hard for anybody to look at and figure out where it went wrong.

I actually by sheer happenstance, I was in a group of people having breakfast in New York a  couple of days ago and Andrew McAfee from MIT was there who has co-authored one or two of the  leading books, raising the alarm of structural unemployment for many, many people because of  automation.  I asked him that very question.  I didn't actually cite Sven because we had not yet met at that point.  But he said that the advice he gives to his own kids is really pushing into realms where  it's an intensely human interaction.  So it's going to be a long time before we want computers as therapists or masseuses.  Or also things that are really kind of very, very high-end creativity.  He reassured me, he said as a guy who writes 575 page long science fiction novels, you'll be one  of the last to go.  That had a chilling ring to it.  But that was better than first to go.

Start time: 6727.08
End time: 6787.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lawyers before judges.  I don't know if we're going to trust it on the judge front because there are early attempts  that have been made with parole boards and so forth.  People have detected things that look like racial bias coming out of the AI.  And I think that however explicable that might be when you try to crawl through the code  that you don't really understand to figure out what was going on there,  humans will be highly uncomfortable with that kind of thing and will prefer to leave that  role to humans.  However, Dan Ariely, who's done a lot of amazing work in behavioral psychology,  wrote a book called Predictably Irrational and did a bunch of other great work,  has shown that human judges, their decisions and parole boards and so forth are heavily,  heavily influenced by how many hours it has been since they've eaten.  Taken an enormous amount of data, proximity to lunch leads to a great deal of leniency.  Right.  It was way statistically significant.  And how terrifying is that?  After lunch, not before lunch.

Transcript:  I think being super enabled by computers.  So I'm going to pitch, Tim O'Reilly's got an amazing book coming out on October 10th  and I've been lucky enough to read it.  And it's called WTF, Where's the Future?  What's the Future?  Something like that.  We also know it stands for something else.  But he made this really cool point.  He calls them augmented workers, which are people who have been super empowered  by their pairing with technology.  And he makes the point that Amazon, since they brought in their famous Kiva robots,  has been on a hiring-  These are the robots that automate Amazon's warehouses to a degree that a lot of folks find frightening.  They have been on a hiring terror that unlike-  Without precedent in the history of warehouse management in this country,  since they brought in the Kiva robots, because the workers who were in there are now managing  fleets of robots and every worker is wildly productive.  And there is the famous statistic that's been attested to in multiple sources that  after the rise of automatic teller machines in the early 80s,  the number of people employed as tellers in the country has gone up and up and up.  Because again, they're now able to do higher and higher level things.  And so I think if you put yourself in a role where you are, in a sense,  the computer's manager, you're letting it do the things that fall within its super power,  but you're doing those judgment things that fall outside of it.  I mean, Garry Kasparov is very big into this.  He calls, he and others call it the phenomenon, the centaur, which is sort of the, you know,  a human and AI team that you can pair a fairly mediocre chess player  with some pretty lousy software, chess playing software.  And those two things together can slaughter the best software in the world,  which is now 20 years more evolved than the software that beat Garry Kasparov 20 years ago,

They ranked 700 professions and they're likely to be automatable in the near future.  Tellers are at the top.  Call service representatives are at the top, the jobs that you would expect.  The bottom of that list, the least likely automatable jobs, there's the story,  is really, really useful if you're a young person right now.  It's populated by surprising things.  You guys have already said the creative class stuff and working with machines,  but empathy is another thing.  Computers are not going to be good at empathy.  So healthcare workers in general, we're going to need them, particularly geriatric healthcare.  One job you'll find on that list that's really promising are physical therapists,  physical recovery therapists, both for athletes and for people who have other disabilities.  But the key component for all of those things is the ability to empathize with other humans.  So whatever you can do to develop your empathy is going to increase your job prospects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there's going to be way more jobs because of it, because of what he said in the Amazon  factory, just because you don't you have an assistant that's driving your car.  You're going to have a lot of new kinds of jobs coming.  But it's hard to explain that to people who haven't seen mixed reality glasses,  because mixed reality glasses can teach you any job in real time on top of the job.  They use them at Caterpillar to teach how to fix a million dollar tractor,  because it shows you on top of the tractor how to do it.  And that's going to unlock a whole raft of new jobs that look sort of like TV jobs or Hollywood jobs.

Transcript:  All right, one more word from our sponsor then back to the final section of the show.  Thank you, Becky Worley and company for filling in for me while I'm gone.  I'll be back next week.  I'm sure I'm missing you guys terribly.  Well, maybe not.  Anyway, I'm glad you're having fun.  I hope you will take a look at our sponsor today, Capterra.  Capterra is a great idea.  This is free.  There's no cost, no obligation.  Salesman will call.  What it is is a business software directory.  So if you're one of those people that gets tasked by the boss with coming up with,  oh, the boss says, oh, Smithers, find that software to manage the business,  whether it's an auto repair or dentistry or a yoga studio.  You have yoga studio software?  Fine.  It wouldn't be Smithers, it would be Shakti.  Shakti, we need software to manage the yoga studio.  Well, Shakti, don't Google it.  Don't Google it because you're going to get random results.  Go to Capterra.  Whether you're a startup looking to keep better track of customers,  a nonprofit hoping to have a record fundraising year,  a business that simply needs better payroll software,  you can find the software you need at Capterra.  Capterra's got you covered.  Capterra.com is the best easy to use software comparison site.  Hundreds of categories, thousands of programs,  hundreds of thousands of reviews by users like you, Shakti.  People who've used that software and know the pros and the cons,  the good and the bad, and it's all there.  All your homework is being done for you.  And this is free.  There's no obligation.  There's no registration even.  You're not going to get emails or phone calls or anything.  You go there, pick the category you're looking for.  You do yoga studios.  And then you'll see, you know, it's amazing, like a hundred different programs.  So you want to narrow it down and say, well, I only want to see four-star reviewed.  I want stuff that runs on the web and can manage clients, classes, and staff of 10 or whatever.  Narrow it down.  It'll find all the software that fits your criteria.  Then you look at it in the capsule reviews and the stars,  and you check the ones you want to know more about,  and you'll make a comparison chart for you  that you can see exactly what all the features are,  where it installs, how it installs, everything you need to know.  And then read the reviews, vetted reviews from real people.  I think this is all you need to do.  This is the research that your boss wants you to do,  or if you're the boss that you want yourself to do, before you try a program.  It's awesome.  Captera.  It's like a secret weapon for people who need to find business software.  CAP, but don't make it, don't keep it a secret.  Tell everybody.  Captera.  C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.com.  Go to captera.com slash twit and join the millions of people who use it every month  to find the software that will save your business every day.  captera.com slash twit.  We thank you so much for making this week in tech possible.  Now back to Becky.  Thank you for filling in for me, Becky.  We'll see you soon.  It is my pleasure, Leo.

Transcript:  And thank you guys for talking to my kid.  That was actually, I really benefited from that.  And in the chat room, RevDanLP says,  Robert's explanation of saving us from the robot overlords is like a warm blanket of logic.  A warm blanket of logic.  Oh, I feel all warmed up.  What makes me not feel warm is that as a consumer reporter, I recommend things to people.  Most of us, either to our friends or publicly, we recommend apps to people.  And I am an athlete and I've been so positive about getting people to be healthy and fit  and working out.  And I loved an app called PACT or OurPACT or GymPACT.  These are all names that have been associated with it.  And the premise of it was that you pledge that you will do something every day.  You'll either walk 10,000 steps by four o'clock.  You will check in at a gym that you've designated.  They evolved the app so that you promise certain eating habits.  You could tie it in with your Fitbit or any of your trackers.  And in your pledge, you said, I will give $10.  $5 was the minimum per week, but up to $50 or $100.  If I don't do it, I lose that money.  So you gave it your credit card and it was going to take the money if you didn't do it.  And then if you did do it, you got a piece of the pie of all that money that people  lost because they didn't keep their pact.

Start time: 7582.08
End time: 7617.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wondered what the stake was.  That perhaps was my error in not knowing exactly what the rate was.  Turns out the PACT app owes nearly a million dollars to people.  So it wisely says on Gizmodo, it owes nearly $1 million for not paying users to exercise.  Bob, as a consumer reporter, I'm horrified.  Can you absolve me?  Can you tell me that I should have known this was always going to come and I should not recommend  it to our viewers?

Start time: 7618.16
End time: 7629.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the saving grace here is the amount they owe people.  We're talking generally in the $25, $50, $75 range, which is much cheaper than a personal trainer.  So perhaps it was actually a plus for them in the end.

Start time: 7631.44
End time: 7649.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to take that as partial absolve, absolve, absolu.  But I am feeling guilty.  On the other hand, I have tried but not recommended the watch that zaps you with 220 volts of  electricity when you don't have Pavlov's watch.

Start time: 7654.58
End time: 7655.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When does it zap you exactly?

Start time: 7656.48
End time: 7686.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can tell it.  I need to do 10,000 steps by 4 p.m.  And if it doesn't come, if you don't do it by 4 p.m.  it will zap you.  Unless you have Pavlov watch.  And it hurts like, oh my God.  I had such an interesting experience wearing it because it was like as the day wore on and I knew  I wasn't accomplishing the goal that I had promised I needed to do that I could feel the watch  heavier and heavier on my arm.

The guy who invented it told me that he created it because he was procrastinating so badly  that he posted on Facebook that if he did not finish his paper that he needed someone to come  to his house and slap him.  And he said it really motivated him.  There's like a line of people at his door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I am a tech entrepreneur turned science fiction author.  So I'd like everybody to use Rhapsody, although they've renamed it Napster.  That was a music service.  I started.

Start time: 7796.00
End time: 7798.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it became Listen, then Rhapsody.

Start time: 7798.28
End time: 7926.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was Listen.com was the name of the company I started.  Rhapsody was our product.  Then we sold it to Real Networks, who sold half of it to MTV.  And at some point, somebody brought bought the Napster brand out of whatever purgatory  it had gone into.  And they glued it on top of Rhapsody about a year ago.  But it's still Rhapsody to me.  I'm a Spotify user now.  I'll admit.  But these days I write science fiction for Random House and I have a new novel that came  out a month ago called After On.  It's about a diabolical social media company set in present day San Francisco, which it'll  sound like a spoiler, but you really see it coming from the very beginning, attains  consciousness and rather than going all Terminator and trying to kill us all, it becomes something  much more terrifying, which is a hyperintelligent, super empowered 14 year old mean girl.  And it is terrifying.  And there's a certain amount of playfulness in the book, but it's a very serious rumination  on artificial super intelligence risk and and synthetic biology, promise and peril,  nihilistic terrorism, a bunch of other things.  And as you know, I started a podcast in connection with the book.  So good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What my original plan was, was to do eight episodes that would go deep into the science  and tech connected to the book because you could only go so deep in the novel without  hijacking your story.  And, you know, I there's an episode on quantum computing with the venture capitalist Steve  Jervitson long interview.  I talked to Marrone Grimitz, who we were talking about, who runs Metta about augmented reality,  which is a major thing in the book, had a two hour interview with Sam Harris, who's  very outspoken about terrorism.  Terrorism is a major subject.  And I just decided actually a few days ago that episode eight goes up on Tuesday.  I've been having so much fun.  I'm going to keep it going indefinitely.  And so it's going to graduate from its loose affiliation with the book.  It's called the After On Podcast.  It's going to graduate in a week from its loose affiliation with the book.  And it's the theme is going to be on hurried conversations with thinkers and founders and  scientists or maybe founders and thinkers.  I haven't figured out the sequence yet, but that's good news.  It's going to be long interviews.

Start time: 7927.14
End time: 7967.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really good stuff.  I get, you know, I am a person who is a intuitive.  And so I intuit after I listen to a tech podcast, I get a feeling like, oh, I'm so glad that  I did that because I learned more and I feel knowledgeable and that was unproductive and  blah, blah, blah.  But I get a different feel when I listen to the After On Podcast, which is the way I feel  after a sort of a Terry Gross interview with an entertainer.  It's more like, wow, that was an amazing journey that I just went on.  And it's just it's a really different take on the genre of tech podcasting.  It's not really tech podcasting.  It's intelligence podcasting.  And I just am really enjoying it.  So I am delighted to hear that.  Great.

You're going to eventually look at an iPhone and a menu is going to pop off that.  I saw that already at iFluence, which Google bought.  So Google's working on that.  And I bet that's sort of what Amazon's thinking about, too, because they want you to walk  into a store and start looking at things and they'll let you buy things right right by  looking at them.
