Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is twit.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is twit.  This Week in Tech, episode 91, from March 18th, 2007.  All at Twitter.  It's time to twit and a fun panel today.  Today, in fact, a first for twit, we're doing it on Talk Show as well in front of a live  audience.  So what we're going to do today is do our usual twit roundtable, talking about the news  of the day, and then we will open the lines to this Talk Show audience, Talk Show audience.  So if you're listening in Talk Show to our live stream right now, go ahead and get in  the queue and we'll just go through the queue one by one.  It'll take us about 45 minutes to get to that.  Meanwhile, let me introduce the panel because we've got a great one.  Two guys I've wanted to get on for a long time.  One who's been on twit, I think once or twice before, Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer.  Hey, Robert.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are you doing?  I'm honored to be here.  Oh, it's great to have you.  And I wanted to have you on to talk about South by Southwest because I know you were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was all barbecue, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, at some point I wanted to turn off Twitter because it was basically that's all  I was hearing was, you know, I'm having barbecue next to Dan Rather.  I think that was Merlin Mansfield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got home and my wife yelled at me for saying to her.  She said, if I ever say Twitter again around her, I'm sleeping on the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also with us Alex Lindsay, who was also at South by Southwest from the Pixelcore.  Hey, Alex, good to talk to you.  Hey, I had barbecue, too.  We missed you while you were gone.  I missed you, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we're glad you're back, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex is the host of many shows, including Mac Break Weekly.  Of course, he's the head honcho at Pixelcore.  Now with their own podcast site, Pixelcore.tv, which is linked directly from twit.tv as well.  So we're brothers in arms.  It looks oddly similar to Twitter.  It does, but a better color scheme, I must say.  I like your color scheme.  I'm about to steal it.  And now a fella I've wanted to get on Twitter for a long, long time, an old friend, and  I think one of the real visionaries in this business, one of the authors of the Clu Train  Manifesto.  He is just a brilliant guy on this subject.  Doc Searles, great to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to be on, too.  Thanks a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Santa Barbara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm hiding out in Santa Barbara where normally it's beautiful, but today it's gloomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're teaching at UCSB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm a visiting fellow at UCSB, or a research fellow, depending on which letter  from which chancellor or something that we go by.  Which means we have a parking pass and half an office and a bunch of stuff like that.  But I'm not teaching, no.  I'm actually working in too slow a motion on a book, which if I talk about, we'll make  it go even slower, so I'll hold off on that.  But that's basically it.  The interesting thing is I'm a fellow at the Berkman Center at Harvard, which means that  I get to savor relationships with two universities that never would have let me in as a student.  And two really prestigious programs to be part of.  They're great.  They're great, great universities.  It's the Berkman Center in one case, and to get a plug in, the Center for Information  Technology and Society at UCSB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  UC is doing some amazing stuff.  We just interviewed a guy named Smarr from UCIT2, which is the joint venture, I think,  of UCLA and UC San Diego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got a name like a droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not a great name, but it's their media lab, and it's fascinating what they're  up to.  Just amazing.  So neat stuff going on.  So let's talk a little bit about South by Southwest, and then I want to get to the big  story of the week, which of course is Viacom's lawsuit against YouTube.  Did you go to South by Southwest, Doc?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  I missed it this year.  I decided to take time off from going to conferences.  And actually, after my kid, I have a 10-year-old boy, wanted my schedule so he'd know when  I was home.  I decided that was about the time to hold off on something.  I have to spend a week, a month in Boston anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dad, can you sink your Blackberry with mine?  Because I can't figure out when you're home.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My kids have said things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't let them use any of that stuff yet.  Oh, you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah.  Robert has a ninth grader or a seventh grader, I should say.  Does Patrick use a Blackberry or anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  He has a little sprint phone that he carries around.  Everybody has cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My 12-year-old has a cell phone.  That's a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I have given my 12-year-old does not have a cell phone, but she has informed me that  it is time for her to have a cell phone.  Father, it is time.  I really felt like she's grown up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wants an iPhone, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He wants an iPhone, but I can't justify a $600 purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My daughter is working with a beat-up old sprint phone.  And I say, let me get you a new one.  She says, no, no, I'm waiting for the iPhone.  You'll be getting me that, Papa.  Let's add one more voice to the conversation from across the pond.  Will Harris from, well, formerly of, I guess he's still at BitTech, but now of willharris.co.uk.  Hello, Will.  Hello.  Always, it's so amazing.  The best quality Skype.  And it's from Britain.  Yes, it works pretty well.  I don't understand it.  And it's the middle of the night.  Maybe that's why, because nobody's on Skype right now.  Nobody's online.  Yeah.  Well, you didn't go to South by Southwest.  I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, unfortunately, I was kind of stuck here being envious of everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was envious until I started getting inundated on Twitter with postings.  Let's ask Robert a little bit about South by Southwest.  What was the most impressive thing?  What was your sense of what went on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing was I asked hundreds of people, have you seen anything cool?  And nobody could come up with anything.  Really?  Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's often said at South by Southwest that the most interesting things are what's happening  in the halls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true, but I was in the halls asking the question.  Nothing there either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think at South by Southwest you just say, hey, y'all, let's go eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess Doc and I are pretty happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love going to South by Southwest, but you're right.  It's a good conference surrounded by great food and great entertainment.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the barbecue in Austin is just, if you've never been to Austin, forget South  by Southwest.  Go to Austin for the barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did the screensavers there once and we went out, I think it was called State Line  Barbecue.  I think that was in the...  A county line.  A county line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was at County Line earlier this week and it was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They set a long table because it was Patrick, me, Martin, I mean the whole gang, probably  20 of us, the whole production crew.  They set a long table, they just said sit down and they just started bringing plate  after plate after plate and they kept coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to actually wait tables at County Line.  Oh really?  Yeah, so I always go back just to have the bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they took us back into the smoker and my clothes still smell like pig.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That thing is potent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, here's what the South by Southwest was like.  I was lying in the hallway.  I was lying down.  I actually have pictures up on Flickr of me lying down and I was talking to Ethan Zuckerman,  the guy who started Global Voices Online, which is an awesome blog, but it's not really  a blog.  It's more of an aggregator of blogs from all over the world.  You can read what's happening in Zambia and Israel and Afghanistan, all over the place.  He just had come home from the TED conference and he said that for the first time in years,  he didn't feel like a rock star at TED.  The green movement was getting all the heat.  I mean, John Doerr, who was the VC of Google, was crying on stage about his daughter's admonition  to him to fix the global warming thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems like a meme that has really hit its stride thanks to Al Gore.  Of course, Al Gore spoke at TED last year.  Bill Clinton was there this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said to Al Gore, I said, there's no skiing.  Things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're expanding now.  TED is now doing TED Global, which is going to be another TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania  in early June.  I'd love to go to TED, but $6,000 on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's too much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  TED Global is cheaper.  It's only $2,600.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in many ways, South by Southwest really was the place to be rather than TED.  It's pretty amazing.  It's actually the first time.  It's the next big conference.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually unconference.  It's no conference at all.  Unconference.  Yeah, I'm not kidding.  We've had around the user-centric identity subject, we've had ... There's no publicity  around this.  There's just a lot of technology development.  The biggest leaps forward that I've seen in technology have been at unconferences.  These are basically events where people get together with a single purpose of anybody  who feels like it raises a subject and everybody breaks out into a table or a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of like a bar camp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A bar camp is an example of one.  But bar camps are generally a general purpose.  Most unconferences that are really good, like the blogger cons that Dave Weiner held, you  just see tectonic leaps forward, 1.0 to 2.0 levels of geek progress happening at those  things.  And vendors don't run them and big conference givers don't run them and they don't have  panels and they don't have ... If they have PowerPoints it's only to demonstrate something.  They're amazing to me how well they work.  And if you're trying to get something done, they're great.  If you just want to have the usual, probably South by Southwest or Tetherwick, some of  the better ones of the remaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that definitely one of the things that I heard while I was down there is I spoke  on one small panel and then went to a couple of other panels.  I think there was a lot of hunger for a lot more meat than what they were seeing at South  by Southwest.  I think there was a lot of good stuff, but it was just a lot of talking about things,  but not really getting to the heart of how to move things forward.  I think a lot of people hope to get more information.  That's what it seemed like for me, at least for the interactive conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can someone tell me, the impression that I got from South by Southwest not being there,  was that there was a lot of very talented people there.  I mean, the sort of the register of sort of, you know, Scoble and Ze Frank and all these  video bloggers that are big, but not a lot of people like with sort of old school,  old money influence and cash.  And it seems like it should have been like a venture capitalist's dream conference,  but it kind of wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were definitely some venture capitalists floating around in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were. I met a venture capitalist from AOL and a few others.  The VCs are hanging out in the val...  Aren't those the guys you want to keep out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you want to have the guys who are doing something and not the money guys there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  South by Southwest's power is that it's people who actually build websites.  A lot of web designers, a lot of web developers.  That's what I really like. That's who I really like meeting there.  I don't go there to meet the CEOs and the money, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that I thought was really interesting was that the wide range.  You'd end up with little bloggers that are doing, you know, little bloggers or little podcast creators  that are talking about stuff. But then you had...  Micro bloggers.  Yeah, micro bloggers. But you also, in the same room, you'd have the head of interactive for Discovery Channel,  the interactive guys from PBS.  And everyone is still digging through trying to figure this stuff out.  I also want to say from a speaker's point of view, it's probably the best run conference I think I've ever been a part of  as far as giving me enormous amounts of information as a speaker.  I had a place I had to show up. I had to do...  I was scheduled to be on a panel, but I had a bail at the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I was impressed up to the point where I bailed with how in contact they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, really, really tightly run. And I speak at a lot of these things as all of us do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that the problem with a conference like this is that stuff's just moving too fast?  By the time you've put together a presentation on it, something new...  Well, look, I'll give you an example. Today, four hours ago, Twitter map went up.  Twitter Vision went up, which is a David Troy's live Ajax Google map mashup of a Twitter map.  Now, that just happened four hours ago, and it's the rage right now.  And it's probably moving like a brush fire through the Twitter community.  And it'll be gone tomorrow or in a week.  I mean, how can you cover this kind of stuff at a conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that also there's a lot of pressure when you're putting together a panel  that you want to have the names that are going to attract...  the names in the companies that are going to attract a lot of people to the panel.  And sometimes what you really want to hear from are the guys that are in the trenches going,  okay, this is how we're actually putting this stuff together.  They're not as impressive to see.  They're not as impressive to...  You're not sure if that's a name that's going to drag people into a room of 500.  But they're the ones that can really tell you how they're actually piecing this stuff together  and making it all work.  And I think that sometimes that's a hard thing to kind of figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have never been to South by Southwest. We've done coverage of it.  Amber was there last year.  And my sense of it was it had this great gathering of the tribes feeling last year.  It was almost a hippie fest where people who are making a difference,  who are doing interesting things, get together in a completely altruistic fashion.  It's not particularly competitive.  Is that a mistake on my part? Was it like that last year? Was it like it this year?  It was like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was there last year and it had a little bit of that to it to me.  But mostly it was a gathering of the people I already knew and really like hanging out with  and some people I like to meet and hang out with  and a bunch of panels that are all the usual.  And it had the problem that all conferences had, which is that panels are mainframes.  They're old. They've got tail fin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the unconference more of that kind of gathering of the tribe kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's less tribal. It's very practical.  Interesting.  I mean, it has, there's fun to it.  But in the open source world, which is where, which I cover,  I can't say I really work there as much,  but which I cover there's this saying, show me the code.  We could be as friendly as anything, but if you don't have the code,  you don't really contribute.  There's this culture of contribution that really matters.  The contribution doesn't have to be code.  The contribution would be standing at a whiteboard  and having some interesting things to say.  They are inherently constructive rather than just instructive.  And that's sort of the big difference.  The conferences of the old sort are instructive, but it's like school.  Like you said earlier, a topic like the Twitter thing can blow through like a brush fire,  and that's inherently transitory.  It may be important, but it has too short a lifespan and too fast a movement  to be treated in an instructive way.  And that's the model of the old conference.  It's school.  Somebody's in the front of the room.  You sit still.  You receive.  They transmit.  There's a curriculum.  There's published works that have the whole syllabus in there.  And it's bold at this point.  I mean, it's really old hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the old school conferences are coming back with entertainment.  I mean, Kathy Sierra gave the keynote at South by Southwest  and did a talk that really wasn't that instructive.  I mean, I didn't learn all that much that I could take home and really use like a physics lecture.  But it was entertaining because of the imagery she used on stage and because I knew who she was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that sounds like almost a waste of time then.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not.  Actually, Bruce Sterling gave a closing talk last year.  It was one of the most moving things I've ever heard in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he's amazing.  I mean, anything he says, I will listen to.  It's not, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And even if it was entertainment, it is about seeing people you know and you like and seeing them in a different context, trying to do something for you.  You know, I don't think that's a bad thing to go and see Doc Searles give a keynote somewhere and listen to him.  And yeah, you might not take away that much that you wouldn't have been able to learn on his blog or on his book in his books.  But, you know, seeing him face to face and being able to get him to sign a book or something like that is a big thrill.  Hey, you mentioned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Alex.  And then I'm going to move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that I think that would be really, really fun would be to see this kind of unconference, which I admit like I did the unconference in Pittsburgh for podcasting.  But seeing something like mixed with some of these big conferences as a kind of a happening at the same time to give you that kind of on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The birds of feather meetings usually are like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that that would be a nice start to mix those two together.  Well, South by Southwest had a bar camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was there a bar camp going on at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  South by Southwest had a bar camp.  Yeah, they always had a bar camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the music is really good, too, by the way.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's Robert. Did you get to the bar camp there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It was awesome.  I mean, in one corner was Matt Mullenweg, who started WordPress, giving a little talk to 15 people.  And in another part, Microsoft was giving a little talk about expression.  And another part of the bar was, I don't know, Chris Messina talking about something I didn't hear about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I'd love to be at something like that.  Forget the rest of the conference. That's what I'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My main regret not going there was actually missing the bar camp.  Pretty amazing.  Which is great last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they had free burritos, which were awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Back to the food. Robert, I worry about you.  My hearties.  Last time I saw Doc, he was on the Atkins. You're still on the Atkins? Is it working for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No. I lost 25 pounds and I found another 30.  That's a way of doing that, doesn't it?  Yeah, it has a way of doing it. And probably South by Southwest had something to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get out of the pop-up movement, man. It's a little hard looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So somebody mentioned Zay Frank.  And I guess Zay Frank presented both at TED and South by Southwest.  But he's retiring. What's going on with Zay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's closing down his video blog.  His video blog was a year-long show and his last show was yesterday.  So you can go to ZayFrank.com and see his last show.  And he told me that he's going to take a little bit of time off to fix his website and do some projects  that he's been sort of holding off on. And then we'll see whether he comes back.  I'm sure he's going to come back with more content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I applaud him. Yeah, but I mean, doing a daily show is tough.  And he was consistently creative, funny, clever.  I'm amazed he was able to do it as long as he was.  And I applaud him for saying, hey, I'm done now. I'm going to move on to something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was the best thing off TV, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I think he might have been the best thing including what's on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know how he did it without blinking. Maybe he just wanted some time off to blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he doesn't blink very much even when you meet him in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting. So that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, he wrote me an email one time and said blinking is for pussies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's his slogan. Well, go see.  I mean, the good news is there's a large body of work there that if you haven't seen it, you have a chance to see it.  If you have, you can see it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was a late latecomer to the whole movement of Zay Frank.  It's just such great stuff. I agree with you.  It's just so hard to believe that someone could do that day after day after day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the show on the 13th, by the way, is really one that you should watch.  And he's not even on it.  He asked his reader or his listeners or viewers or whatever to send in video of their own.  And he got a thousand videos and he put the best ones up.  I think it's like 20 minutes. I forget how long it is. It's pretty long video.  But it's just 34 minutes.  Viewers. Yeah, it's awesome.  It's the best. It's probably the best video I've seen on the Internet.  You know, and it's all normal people saying what Zay meant to him over the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He encouraged. It was really encouraging to see him because he kind of lived up to that notion that the net should be doing something different,  not just another TV show, not just another radio show or newspaper article.  That should be something new and different. And he really he kind of made that happen.  Moving on to the biggest story of the of the week, Viacom sues Google, pulls a little Dr. Evil for one billion dollars.  They claim one hundred fifty thousand copyright violations.  They claim a lot of money made by YouTube and of course by its parent company, Google, on these copyright violations.  And they say we want our share. What does this mean?  Doc Sears, why don't you kick it off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, boy. I've actually sort of avoided the topic because the way I see it is a company like Viacom, which is an entertainment company.  It's Hollywood, essentially, employs entire buildings full of lawyers that do nothing but things like clearing rights for everything.  And I can't imagine that that any industry as driven by their legal departments as the entertainment one is could stand still for very long  while pockets as deep as Google's were walking around owning what they would see as copyright violators.  That's sort of the public side of it. The private side of it is the same as whatever was that happened between Cisco and Apple over the iPhone name.  They'll work it out in private, whatever it is. It's a negotiating ploy.  And, you know, to me it's almost a, it serves as a kind of smoke screen for what really matters, which is the absolute need for copyright reform,  which won't happen until the geeks get behind making something happen and become as strong a lobbying force as Hollywood is right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple of different point of views from PC Magazine. Editor Lance Yulanov said Viacom's making a big mistake.  They could destroy perhaps the best publicity vehicle Viacom ever saw in YouTube.  Jim Latterback disagrees and says that in fact Viacom's lawsuit was not only necessary, he does agree in the one respect that it could be very bad for YouTube.  Actually, I guess Lance believes that YouTube will survive, will triumph over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's bad for YouTube. I don't think it's bad for Viacom either. Viacom had to protect its existing business model.  But YouTube, the magic of YouTube is go back to that Zay Frank video that played on the 13th of this month where he had a thousand people video in their videos.  That's where the opportunity is. And what Viacom did by suing YouTube is just close itself off to that opportunity.  I think they built a box around their business model and that's fine. They're going to get the million, the billion dollars.  Google can afford it. Google's gone up many times since they bought YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the larger fear though is that a court's going to... and this is what Mark Cuban says, that the issue really comes down to the Safe Harbor provision in the DMCA.  Is Google protected by the Safe Harbor, which is intended to protect Internet service providers and web hosting companies, or is YouTube really a media company, which Viacom claims?  If a judge decides YouTube is a media company and is responsible for protecting and finding copyright violations, doesn't that cause a big problem, not just for YouTube, but for this whole industry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, a lot of people have compared it to the old Napster scenario, which is where Google is basically saying what Napster said, which was, well, we just provide a service and people can put legit stuff on it.  But if people put illegal stuff on it, that's not really our fault. We're just hosting the service.  And of course, I think the Napster and the Nutella and all those kind of guys fell on the sword on that one. I don't know why Google is going to be any different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of PR danger for Viacom, given the kind of content, a lot of the kind of content that they do with Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, so on and so forth, of looking extremely uncool.  And the problem is that their business is based on looking cool. And they have now just smacked a large number of their viewers are now being, you know, watching something that they spend a lot of time watching, getting smacked on the head.  And I think that that can be, you know, very, I think overall, it can be dangerous for them in that area.

Transcript:  Lance brings up some interesting stats. He says ratings for CBS, which is a Viacom properties, late night shows have gone up.  And he believes, and I think you can make a good case that it's because of these clips on YouTube. I'd never even heard of Craig Ferguson until I saw him on the Late Late Show on YouTube.  That show is up 7%. The Late Show with David Letterman up 5%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. And you got to remember the the influentials in the industry are on the Internet.  And so if they see something cool on YouTube getting popular, they're going to write about it and talk about it and tell their friends and blog about it and Twitter about it.  And, you know, I am about it and email about it. And because Viacom has decided to pull everything off of YouTube and therefore put a chilling effect across the entire industry, they're not going to get talked about anymore.  They're not going to watch Z Frank rather than watching a Viacom video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is what you've been saying, Alex, all along about the record industry that by clamping down, for instance, as they are now on Internet radio, all they're doing is hurting themselves by forcing people to turn to independent artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that also this really opens up a lot. We've talked about it this little on this week in media of if they really push this down the path and they really force the courts to make a decision and the courts vote, for instance, go against YouTube.  One of the things that happens is that it's very, very hard to get the copywritten material material out there, except for what they think is the best way.  But the problem is, is that is that this what people are going to go might go towards, especially as we see this huge competition between Apple TV, Xbox, PS3, Juiced, all these other companies.  What you may start seeing is a lot more content that is that is not controlled that way, being easier to find, easier to get to and getting to be getting to a point where it's almost just as good.  And that might be enough to for people to just stop watching some of the copywritten stuff.  They could be slowly killing off their market. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would add that what happened with Internet radio was was the end, the most recent event in the history of copyright lawmaking that began with even before the DMCA with the 1996 with a variety of things happened in 96.  In any case, it was a decision made by the Copyright Royalty Board, which nobody even knew existed until last week, a couple of weeks ago when the decision came down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wrote a blog post on Linux Journal, which I thought was really right on Internet radio on death row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. No, it's a death sentence. It's the way people think Hollywood doesn't get the net in the sense of fear.  They get it in an enormous way. They got it early on and they saw that what was going to happen with the net was that it was going to eat all of media as it was known.  And what they wanted to do if radio came along, what radio happened on the net, they wanted to deal with radio.  That would be much better than the deal they got with radio with in the 1930s when only only composers were compensated through EMI and CSAC and BMI.  And the performers were left out. So they went out of their way to have radio, Internet radio, defined not as radio, but as a performance like you might find at a club.  And created a bunch of lawmaking that basically said this is for admission only and it's going to be something we'll define as well.  Anybody who listens to these, what they call perfect reproductions, it was digital, it was perfect even if it was only 24K, that anybody who listened would have to pay.  And that would be the business model. They decided what the business model would be in 1996. That passed in the fall of 98.  But because they left it open to negotiation between webcasters, which barely existed in 98, but it actually got pretty well underway by 2001.  They left it up to negotiations between those parties. But the webcasters were very weak lobbying-wise, they were very weak lawyer-wise, and they got pretty much clobbered.  And then they were saved only by Jesse Helms at the last minute on the behalf of the religious broadcasters who wanted the nonprofits to remain protected.  And NPR and non-commercial stations were to some degree protected by a separate carve-out, it was called, that was very hush-hush and secret.  And that deal got revealed by the royalty board in their decision like three Fridays ago.  And now, of course, NPR is suddenly in the same bucket as all of these little webcasters that are kicking around out there.  And they kind of saw that coming, that at NPR a few weeks ago, and they were kind of looking forward to something bad happening there.  Nobody expected it to be as bad as it was. But it is a death sentence. It basically says, your business model is X and it's going to be too expensive.  I said in that piece, it recalled the Vogue on the decision to wipe out the earth and to put the notice on Alpha Centauri and blame the earthlings for not picking up on it.  It's a ludicrous thing, but there it is. I'm hoping that some of the geeks will get crazy about it and help wipe out that legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  SaveOurInternetRadio.com seems to be the locus for a lot of this conversation.  SaveOurInternetRadio.com. It's appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that artists, though, can start really thinking about whether this is the kind of people they want representing their music.  And more and more artists are going more independent and they can make decisions about where their music ends up.  I know we've been looking at doing some podcasts that are geared around independent labels and independent music.  And we've had no problem. We call the record labels directly, the ones that are not part of the RIA, and make requests based on that.  And if it's not covered under some of those pieces, we're able to use that music and we're able to do those pieces.  Now, how long will it take for that to become organized and large enough to be useful? I don't know.  But if it keeps on going down this path and it's hard to listen to it on a radio that we don't listen to anymore.  I mean, every car I get into now, I rent a lot of cars, and every car I get into now has an eighth inch jack.  And I don't listen to the radio anymore. I mean, I plug my iPod in, I go back to whatever I was doing.  And I don't have any reality of listening to the radio at this point.  So I think that there's, once again, this could be another example of the industry cutting its nose off despite its face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, you see this as an opportunity for the independent artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a huge opportunity because if the independent labels and the independent artists sees on the fact that the large labels are cutting themselves out of the system  and find ways to make it easier for these companies to get a hold of their music, through their music, so on and so forth,  I think that they can make big inroads into a market that's just about to become more and more open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that's where YouTube is going.  If YouTube can't show off the Viacom content, what are they going to show off?  And there's still a huge audience checking out YouTube every morning.  They're going to show off Zay Frank and all the cool kids, all the new kids who are showing off little home videos.  Well, I think we're going to see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a lot of people who are going to... Absolutely.  I think we're going to see YouTube getting very organized about producing new content that's on YouTube, that is well produced and designed and so on and so forth.  I mean, there's a lot of rumblings going on about that.  And so, right now, they've got this huge audience and hopefully they'll make the turn faster than Napster made, which is Napster didn't make the turn fast enough.  And hopefully if they get to a legitimate new content available on YouTube, they could cause a lot of damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as I remember, what happened to Napster is that the judge required them to put in a technology that would capture copyrighted material and keep it off their network.  They couldn't do it and they had to go out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Napster was a single point that could be attacked.  To me, the interesting thing that happened after Napster was the open protocols allowed anybody to share with anybody and made it impossible to stamp that kind of stuff out.  Do all of you use BitTorrent by any chance?  We would admit it. Yes, of course we do. We all use BitTorrent.  Yeah, of course. BitTorrent is stunning.  I mean, one of the things I said at this public broadcasting conference a few weeks ago was, at some point, the PBS could just put frontline, make that the alpha seed on BitTorrent and why even have transmitters anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we push on these podcasts on Twitter, we push 44 terabytes a month, which I just recently found out we were fortunate because we get that donated by AOL and Cashfly.  Very fortunate, Leo.  Yeah, very fortunate because AOL just told me if you were paying for this, it'd be over 40 grand a month.  Wow.  We couldn't do it. But when we first started, because we didn't have those relationships, we used BitTorrent.  And while it's not ideal because it's difficult to use, you can't just click a link and so forth, it certainly is, would it be the solution if we lost our partnerships? You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then just to bring it back around to where we started, I mean, YouTube really is a single point of failure.  And if a judge comes in and says, look, install the filtering or you're in total breach and they can't install the filtering, we're back to the Napster situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but wait, wait, wait, wait. How many companies are out there that are Viacom? Five or six? So now we're talking about six billion dollars.  Google can survive a six billion dollar round of lawsuits and they'll come out smiling.  So do you think they'll settle?  Look at how much money is going to be spent in the next decade or two on advertising on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will they come forward and settle? And then because they don't want the judge to make any decision about whether they're the ISP or a media company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they'll settle. I think they're going to go all the way. They'll fight.  I think the risks are mitigated already. They've already made their money off of this thing.  They've already gotten a brand love that YouTube brought them. They've already gotten the equity out of it.  They're going to go all the way with this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Chad Hurley is going, whew. Yeah, I'm not kidding. That was close.  They wouldn't have sued Chad Hurley, but they'll sue Google because Chad didn't have the pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, look at what's going to happen in the next two years between now and the end of this lawsuit.  Two hundred or three hundred million people are going to get video cameras on their cell phones.  Are we going to not see another Ze Frank out of the next two years? We're going to see like fifty million Ze Franks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of the same point that Alex has been making, which is that this is merely for music or in video.  It's just an opportunity for the independent.  And if you're currently not independent, you might want to start thinking about being independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've had just to note to that, I have been meeting with a variety of artists that are pretty well known in Hollywood,  you know, talking about, you know, they're trying to figure out what they're going to do and they don't really have a whole lot of interest in working with Hollywood anymore.  They can smell blood. I mean, they can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're Robert Rodriguez, you're not going to make another Hollywood picture. Why bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On Friday night, I was sitting at Robert Rodriguez's table at the Austin Film Society.  And he's totally, I mean, his crew is totally into this stuff and his crew is totally into disrupting Hollywood.  I mean, that's what he's been doing.  And Robert Rodriguez, for those who don't know, is the guy who did the Spy Kids films and other films.  And he's doing it for, you know, a fraction of the cost of an average Hollywood show.  He gets stars to come on his shows because he takes them only for a week instead of a month or two months.  He's just, he's a brilliant guy. Everybody should pay attention to him a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And by the way, the biggest cost is not always the stars. It's really the legal departments.  And it's having to deal with the big old corporate interests. If you can work your way around that, you're better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to remind our listeners on Talk Show, we are streaming this live at TalkShow.com, that we will be taking calls in just a few minutes.  So if you call in and get on the queue, if you have a question about any of the topics we've talked about,  you'll have a chance to talk with Doc Searls, who is with us, Robert Scoble, Alex Lindsay, and Will Harris.  This is the first time we've done this on Twitter. And it's kind of an experiment. We'll see how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, Leo, I got an IM from a friend in Scotland who says,  tell Leo to stop being so funny on MacBreak Weekly as I keep laughing out loud while listening on my iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He must like my Shrek imitation. That's what he likes.  I guess.  A podcast is like an onion.  So any other big stories we want to get to before we go to the calls?  Anything else happen this week that any of you think is worth bringing up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this week was a CBIT in Germany, which is one of the biggest tech conferences in the world,  if you're a kind of equipment manufacturer.  It's a huge event.  Absolutely massive. I mean, it's, you know, to walk from one side to the other. You're talking some serious mileage.  Did you go well?  I didn't, but I had a bunch of guys that went out to cover it.  And there was a few, you know, a couple of interesting things there. There weren't many big announcements.  I think we were expecting both ATI and Nvidia to come out with new graphics cards and neither of them did because they're all delayed.  But we did see the return of Commodore.  I was going to say the Commodore game.  You guys remember the C64.  Yeah.  They're back with a new line of sort of elite gaming PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, before you get all excited, this is no more Commodore than Packard Bell was the radio company, right?  I mean, this is absolutely this is a company that bought the Commodore name a couple of years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're trading pretty heavily on the history.  They're saying, you know, these things could be, you know, collectors history.  And they got the big Commodore logo on the side.  And it's like and you get a you get a Commodore 64 emulator.  Well, that's all I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to use my dual SLI cards to run Chopper Command.  C64.  Excited. Yeah.  So these were pretty heavy duty machines. It looked like according to the specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And they got some nice, you know, nice artwork on the side.  Looks all fancy and modded and and, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the C64 was known because it had 64 K of RAM, will the new Commodores have 64 gigs of RAM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they go about two.  Oh, OK. Standard stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Samsung is going to start shipping hybrid hard drives.  We mentioned that actually from BITTECH.  But now we've seen an announcement of a 32 gigabyte all solid state hard drive from Sandisk.  Thirty two gigabytes. Interesting.  Can you say MacBook Lite?  It'll be an SATA.  Do you think Apple adopted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the rumor, isn't it?  Well, the rumor around the the Mac Rumorville.  I guess someone used that table that you had last week, right?  Making a rumor.  And it's going to be a MacBook, you know, kind of mini mini Lite thing with with all.  Flash storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's open. Go ahead, Alex.  I would say it sounded like Apple.  One of the rumors was connected to Apple being able to put a your startup,  basically a lot of the startup information that you needed into a flash drive so that your  startup is almost instant.  So it still has a regular hard drive, but it also has flash memory that it can go back to.  Sounds like the Vista Ready drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen that TechCrunch has made a big announcement about its business?  There's a new CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty interesting.  What does that mean?  I don't understand what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It means that they're going to start going and acquiring companies because that's what she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How could Arrington have that much money?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going to get I think in the next month he's going to announce that he's going to get he's getting funded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then then you've got to say, well, wait a minute.  TechCrunch is known for covering Web 2.0 companies.  Now their business model is we'll cover Web 2.0 companies and we'll buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's bigger.  I think it's bigger than that.  But yes, I think it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How can you trust them anymore in their coverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they're going to buy Web 2.0 companies.  I think they're going to buy other media companies.  The opportunity for media right now is really interesting.  And why couldn't they buy something like BlogHer for instance and get a whole other thing going?  Or why couldn't they buy a parenting website like Maya's mom or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have any insight into this, Doc?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really.  It makes sense to me and I'm not even sure if I can tell you how.  I mean, I guess if you're if you look at TechCrunch as a as a mechanism for having a really good finger on a pulse.  Yes.  And if you assume that people are not going to trust that finger and that pulse less just because they're busy acquiring companies.  Well, I will.  Yeah, well, you may be more discriminating than the average pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think that that really muddies the waters.  What are they? Are they are they journalists or are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then that's like but then every media company has that dichotomy.  I mean, every journalist working for a magazine has had a colleague who goes acquired or has acquired.  Yeah, but that's the people they're helping is that Harrington is going to be the journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So Mike is just going to be the journalist and this and Heather is going to get on with the business of business really.  Tell us about Heather. Who is she?  Well, she used to be a couple according to the post mergers and acquisitions at Fox.  So bought a whole bunch of stuff into Fox Interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So big media didn't she buy MySpace? Wasn't she on the team that brought MySpace into Fox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think she she then led on a whole bunch of stuff after Ross Lemonson left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how big of a war chest could Mike have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As big as whoever funded.  Yeah, that depends who funds them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess if I'm a VC and I'm looking for somebody who's got his finger on what's going to be the next big thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would go to Mike Harrington and say, all right, Mike, here's a billion dollars.  Buy me the next MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think he does.  And you know, when I was over in Germany, what did we talk about it?  Drinking beer in Germany. It was talks that it was tech runs.  It was not Twitter.  It was a little bit of a tech run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter was South by Southwest.  But every you know, everybody, a lot of people watch TechCrunch and I think Mike has something going.  And I think if you know, you look at pod show, our pod techs competitors, they got 15 million or actually they got 23 million dollars so far.  You know, Mike could get easily 20 million dollars and start acquiring some interesting companies and doing some interesting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Heather Hard joins or Hardy, I'm not sure how she pronounces, joins them at the end of the month.  And how long before we see the first announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. 30 days.  Pretty quick.  Let's put a sweepstakes on it.  Pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And who do you think it would be? Will it be Facebook, Twitter, who will it be?  Odios for sale? Dig, maybe?  You know, Dig, I have to say Mike's been very friendly all along with Dig.  In fact, he was the one who said Dig ought to sue CNEC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think he's buying any kind of company.  I think Doc has got it right.  It's all, you know, it's about media companies.  It's about buying up.  Well, aren't they the new media companies?  And making a kind of blog network kind of thing of top blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much to buy pod tech, Robert?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk offline.  What do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am not hiring a CEO, I'll tell you that.  Let's go to the phones now.  This is again something we've never tried before.  We're going to try it right now.  If you're in the queue, just hang in there.  I'm going to make sure I've got all the buttons pushed right so that everybody can hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, Jason Calcanis earlier was saying TechFrench will buy CNET in two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let Veronica run it, is I think what Jason was saying, which is...  We should ask Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be really smart, you know.  Jason's on the Talkcast.  Is Jason in here?  Yeah, he's going crazy.  Yeah, he's listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God, I didn't see him.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen him on Twitter Vision a couple times.  Hey, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh boy, he's barely audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, that's my fault.  I got to twist some buttons.  Jason knows about this.  He has a studio now for the Calacanis cast.  Hello, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so I can fill you in on the Mike Arrington stuff.  He's not going to buy Web 2.0 companies.  I mean, he's obviously growing his media business.  And obviously I'm partners with him on the TechFrench 20 conference.  So I've known about the head of the thing for a while,  and she's just a great operations CEO type person  who's going to be able to let him focus on editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Old media or new media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, obviously new media.  I mean, the conference is obviously old media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Viacom's a great price right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to be going for Viacom or anything like that,  but I will tell you guys that I checked in on my T-Mobile account today  and I went 2,300 messages over,  and I now owe $236 in one week to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's all Twitter, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm destroyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't believe you were using SMS on Twitter.  I turned that off right away.  I thought, my God, I mean, my phone was buzzing constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have the same problem that now I think Scobel has,  which is so many people are adding me  that there's no easy way to befriend them back.  So it takes like an hour to do 100 people,  and the servers are slow and stuff like that.  Well, no wonder you got so many messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're befriending everybody who adds you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I don't like that.  That would be the right thing to do.  No, it isn't. That's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason is everybody's friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not insane. Actually, it's awesome.  It's such a firehose of early adopters.  It's too much of a firehose.  Oh, my God, it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I have almost 2,700 people following me.  I'm not going to have 2,700 friends.  That's almost 2,800 friends now.  I have 68 friends. That's how many friends?  That's plenty of friends.  No wonder your bill is so high.  I have 1,000 friends right now, 1,043.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I have 300 friends and my best 100 followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you getting constant Twitters?  What is the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's awesome.  I mean, I'm seeing 1,000 people writing to me.  You guys are junkies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My wife, I got in a fight with my wife last night over it.  She was like, you have to put that down.  We're having dinner.  Like, what is going on on your BlackBerry?  I was like, it's Scoble.  It's this person.  It's that person.  So I turned it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen you?  Actually, John Edwards, campaign guy, you know,  John Edwards running for president,  his campaign guy said I was pulling his BlackBerry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Filling up his BlackBerry.  I actually was about ready to stop watching you at  South by Southwest, Robert,  because I was just getting so sick of it.  It was like, I don't want to know anymore about the show  I am not at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's basically a never-ending chat room now.  It's like we're just all in a chat room for 24 hours a day.  And like the last thing I was doing before I go to bed  is say good night and then wake up in the morning,  say hello to Scoble.  Dave Weiner is drinking his coffee.  I mean, it's CB Radio for Web 2.0 without the static.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that just IRC?  Just a bunch of fairies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's not IRC.  It's IRC without the idiots.  Because if somebody turns idiotic,  I unfriend them immediately and they're gone.  It's not like when I ran Leo Laporte's chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're not supposed to have back and forth conversations,  are you?  I mean, that kind of defeats the whole purpose of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now you're sounding like Terry Hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I suppose it's supposed to be what you're doing.  So I guess if what you're doing is having a conversation  with some of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason did a very interesting thing today.  Tell us about your experiment.  I thought that was quite interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  I basically was watching the Knick game,  and there was a lot of breaks.  So I said, OK, I'm going to ask Jason any question.  And I got, I think, 30 questions in 10 minutes.  I started answering them.  And then Jason Schellen, who was partners, I guess,  with Evan, those guys on Blogger, before they did Twitter,  was like, that's it.  I'm done.  I'm leaving Calacanis.  It's too much.  You know, and it was pretty funny.  But it definitely is like a moving conference  or something like that.  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it's tongue in cheek,  but you're talking about monetizing it, Jason.  That's when I started going, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you guys think I'm joking.  I think you guys should go check the internet  for who owns auto Twitter, gadget Twitter, parenting Twitter.  I want about 100 Twitter names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  I want 100 Twitter names.  I'm announcing right now, I'm leaving Twitter for all the people.  I'm not using Twitter anymore.  That's it.  It's all over.  Forget it.  Jason, I'm starting a network Twitter blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, two weeks ago, I said, who wants to meet at Southwest for dinner?  And within two minutes, I had 30 people.  And we had a great dinner at the Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's something to be said for that.  I think that's kind of neat, this kind of locational Twittering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I announced that I'm doing a beach party on June 16th on Twitter.  And already I have people from all over the world saying they're coming.  Well, who's buying a dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, aren't you buying a dinner if you, oh, you lost the poker tournament though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I came in sixth place last night.  If I won, I was going to buy everybody sushi.  But somebody told me on Twitter that Jeff Pulver is a big poker player  and that he's going to kick my butt.  So I said, okay, fine, I'll play him anytime, anywhere, any amount of money,  heads up poker.  So I think we have some betting going on on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I saw Pulver now wants to put a big Twitter screen up at Vaughan.  Which I think is a great idea for a conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I had to leave Jeff Pulver's thing because he was basically talking about his  podcasting company like 20 times a day.  And it's like the etiquette for Twitter,  you don't need to tell everybody every blog post you're doing on your Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because there's definitely disagreement about  what is acceptable on Twitter and what isn't.  And I'm sure I violate all the time.  I mean, there's no rules. Who knows what the rules are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's working itself out.  But anyway, great show and I love this talk show thing.  I'll get her off and you can take another crawler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. I appreciate it.  It's great to talk to you, Jason. I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The rules are you can do whatever you want in 140 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as it fits in 140 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the rule.  Avila Fame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should get a load of rubbish in 140 characters.  Hey, Avila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're doing this mixed drink show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on a second.  Alex wants to talk about his mixed drink show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, we were doing it.  We're doing this show on mixed drinks for Network.  And it was really funny.  I was trying to explain to the host that she might want to think about being  Twitter and trying to explain to someone who's not as techie on Twitter.  Like you can't.  So you tell people about where you are and what you're doing.  And she's like, and why would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I tried to explain it on the radio show and I'm halfway through the  explanation and I realized this is not working,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is funny because she sends me, you know,  I get like four or five text messages from her day.  You know what I think now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you show somebody Twitter vision dot com, okay,  just show them that page, just say go to Twitter vision dot com and say no more.  I think that'll get the job done.  Here we go.  Avila Fain.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hi, how you doing tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Welcome.  Andy from Phoenix again.  Hi, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, Andy.  Andy, you must actually live on Talk Show.  No, I just find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh oh.  I find you.  Uh oh.  A stalker.  Which is very easy with Twitter.  Twitter makes it easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, my exact location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I accidentally put my longitude and latitude to too great a precision.  And people don't know that.  I always seen your house before on this.  Remember that thing you tape?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That's my old house.  I moved after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's scary.  If you find Leo's house, my son's house is like two blocks down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Andy, what's your question for our panel?  Well, I wanted to talk to Scoble.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know you worked at Microsoft for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you hear about the conventions that would happen this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In San Diego, I think it was a little bit of a shock.  Did you hear about the conventions that would happen this week?  In San Diego?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Microsoft convention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, a convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what you can't say.  Say it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a convention.  It was in San Diego.  It was Steve Ballmer's press conference earlier in the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, nobody at Microsoft pays any attention to Steve Ballmer, do they?  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Scoble, come on.  You're not there anymore.  You can tell the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they do.  Isn't Ballmer a joke?  Isn't that where they talked about the new CRM stuff and all that?  Let me put them on hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the MVP Summit.  You wrote the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, MVP Summit was Zip and Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other one was talking about SharePoint and enterprise.  Is there, you know, is Microsoft really, I mean, look at what we've been talking about lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Microsoft even really an important player anymore?  Yeah, you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know why?  Because they have $60 billion in the bank and they can buy something.  In fact, didn't they buy something this week that was pretty interesting, Tellio, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they buy stuff and it disappears.  It sinks under the waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not true.  They could be important and irrelevant at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they do have 95% of all the desktops.  They just don't seem to know what to do with it.  Maybe the job...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're not doing well with the bleeding edge.  They're doing very well with serving their existing customers.  Look, but Live is such a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, it was...  I love their maps, by the way.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have some... and look Live.  There's some great stuff on Live.  It's a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, has it started yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I rest my case.  It feels like it's about 85% promise.  Is that still the case, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You had a wonderful roster of things that weren't done over and over again.  Over and over again.  It's quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So many smart people are leaving Microsoft.  I just hear a lot of frustration from inside Microsoft that they can't ship stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get more on mic, Robert, because you're kind of fading away in the distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We hear you.  You sound like you're...  Can you hear me now?  Yeah, right.  I'm trying to listen, but anyway, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's just a lot of frustration coming from inside Microsoft.  I mean, there are parts of Microsoft that are clicking pretty well.  The Xbox team is doing fairly well.  The business side of Microsoft, the CRM, which is what the caller was talking about, is doing  very well.  They own business, and nobody is going to sell that part of Microsoft for a long time,  no matter what Google tries to do.  Good point.  Yeah, Google might move into their turf over the next five years, but I just don't see  them being available on the business side.  The thing I follow is the internet and the consumer space, and there they're really struggling  to get traction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's it, is that we're much more interested in what's going on in the consumer.  I am, anyway, much more interested in what's going on in the consumer space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am.  I mean, I'm not interested in SQL Server.  I mean, SQL Server makes billions of dollars from Microsoft, and Exchange, which is real  important, makes billions of dollars and is really attractive.  Even, continued for even our startup is looking at Exchange instead of Google's email server.  But, you know, the stuff that's really attractive to me is the consumer side stuff and the  website stuff, and there, Microsoft really has not had a good strategy going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think a lot of people, I mean, I think you're quite right, that a lot of people  say, oh, you know, what's Microsoft doing, and Microsoft is going downhill, and Microsoft  is in trouble.  And, you know, I think the thing is that Microsoft is so, so massively successful in that kind  of business arena, and it is no doubt going to make billions and billions of dollars over  the next three or four years from Windows, that it could afford to keep having a lot  of goes at getting stuff right until it does get stuff right.  So, it's not going anywhere.  And they can afford...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they can say that about them, and something would get done right.  But, name something lately that they've been going at.  Silent strikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually, I can name something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What they're doing with Identity is leading, or certainly participating in a very big way  in the user-centric Identity conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you say Identity, you mean OpenID, or what do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm talking about OpenID.  They're embraced OpenID.  And they were involved in the whole conversation that ended up with OpenID being as strong  as it is.  Their own effort called CardSpace, they're involved in an open source effort around the  CardSpace, so there are non-proprietary versions kicking around out there that can interoperate  with them.  And so, they can interoperate with OpenID.  And that's brilliant work that's been done, but it's been done more at the rank and file  level.  I don't know if it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's always true at Microsoft.  The individuals at Microsoft are often brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's been...  Speaking for the open source community, there's been a lot of very positive interaction with  Microsoft around Identity.  And of course, it's one area, and it's not something you can point to and say, well,  here's a product.  It's really a feature that's part of other products.  And yet, you could say they fumbled Passport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they were there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but it's because they fumbled Passport.  See, that's the thing.  They learned from Passport.  If the smoking corpse of Passport weren't laying around, Kim Cameron and the people  in the Identity group wouldn't have been able to do what they did.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes sense.  And I still have a Passport sign on.  I try to use, but...  It's still there.  You can still use this thing.  It's pretty much ignored by everybody.  Paul Ford...  Let me go and do another call here, because I want to get as many people as we can.  And Paul Ford, welcome to This Week in Tech.  Hello, Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, Leo.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm calling from Colorado.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what can we do for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just wondering, with Twitter and everything, where does it go from here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where does Twitter go or the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just Twitter in general, because it's pretty basic software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There isn't really much to Twitter.  And I know that Ev is selling the rest of his business of audio and focusing on Twitter.  What do you think?  Robert, what would you do next with Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have no idea, because it's the stupidest software you've ever seen.  It shouldn't be anywhere, and yet it is.  Well, the reason it is, is because all my friends are on it.  And that's what really got me.  I'm not a visionary.  I'm not the guy who builds the software.  I'm not Douglas Engelbart or Dave Weiner.  All I do is look for doubling effects in society on software.  And around November of last year, the doubling effect kicked in, where I noticed it.  I jumped in.  I said, man, this thing is doubling every couple of days or every two weeks.  And that's what made it interesting to me.  All my friends were on it.  Everybody I care about, you know, Ryan is on it, and my employees are on it.  And so that told me that it was full.  Doc Searls, you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a question about Twitter before I answer anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, go ahead.  Is it a silo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, it's got an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is a silo.  Does somebody own the whole thing?  Yeah.  Okay.  Then it's terminal in the long run, for the same reason that even AIM and MSN and all  those closed systems are terminal.  It's got to be...  Well, I can use...  If it needs open tech, whatever tech Twitter is, I confess to not knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can use my Jabber client to talk to it.  In fact, that's how I talk to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's fine.  I suppose if it's open in the sense that it's a Lego block that doesn't...  If it's a Lego block and not a whole walled garden one has to go into it...  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more of a Lego block.  I would say in that sense.  Okay.  Because there's an open API, because it works with Jabber, it works with all SMS systems,  it works with...  I mean, it is much more open than, say, AIM is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In that sense, I've not tried it, but can I use it on my Linux client because I've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jabber?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  I mean, that's why I felt bad for Jason.  I don't know why.  No kidding.  Yeah.  I mean, that's crazy to use your SMS client.  That's just nuts.  I don't know what...  I agree with you, Robert.  It's kind of hard to build...to know what the next thing to build out of Twitter is.  I was kind of surprised when Ev said, this is where we're going to focus because where  do you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, part of it is it's like an RSS client where you know every item is going to be 140  characters or less, right?  So what kinds of things would you like to see in an RSS client where everything's 140  characters or less?  How about traffic information?  How about weather information?  Well, they've got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about stock books?  They've got all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know...  But that's just RSS, isn't it?  Yeah, they obviously...  I mean, you can just do that with RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is RSS, but because everything is guaranteed to be 140 characters or less, it affords a  certain kinds of information.  And I certainly like getting headlines here better than I do in my Google Reader because  I like to see the full text in Google Reader.  Right.  And how there's two different usage models here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cyber Larson, welcome.  You're next on This Week in Tech.  Hello, Cyber Larson.  Where are you calling from?  What's your real name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  My name is Mike Duffy.  I'm calling from Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  I love grew up in Pawtucket.  Oh, yeah, I think we might know each other.  Actually, you mentioned the street that you lived on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I lived on Glenwood Avenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I lived on Blodgett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was like six when we moved, so I don't remember you, Mike.  It sounds like we're the same age.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You were talking about the way that they're trying to get rid of Internet radio.  Does that apply to the podcast too?  I've been doing so I have a podcast and I wanted to add music to it.  And from looking at the ASCAP and...  Forget license fees on music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't play.  I mean, just forget playing licensed music on a podcast because it's not even streaming.  It's stored and they charge through the roof for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not what they charge.  It's that as bad as the rules are for radio, there are rules.  Right.  Unfortunately for podcasts, it's a minefield.  You are required to clear rights with every copyright holder.  Oh, boy.  Now you can launder it.  There is a way of laundering it and that is by running it through an actual licensed over the air radio station.  So there's a station in San Francisco called KYOU that's actually offered to do that.  There are others.  There are low power radio stations.  There are your college stations and so forth.  I mean, if you could get a relationship with an FCC licensed station because they have their deals, right?  That's how my podcasts are handled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I have to say, why even do this deal with the devil?  This is your opportunity.  Play podcast licensed music.  Play play stuff from Pod Show.  Play stuff from Creative Commons.  This is an opportunity to play in the artists who want to be on your podcast.  Why play licensed music on a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, let me jump in on that.  I was in radio for years, not for years, long enough so that it's still athlete's foot and I can't ever get rid of it.  There's still that in me that wants to be on the radio.  It just galls the crap out of me that the enormous knowledge that I have of old rock and roll, for example, even old classical music, some jazz, I can't use that on a podcast.  I mean, I love the fact that lots of new music can be played, that independent music can be supported, and even that the insane license regime allows that to happen and in fact encourages it.  But it aces out everybody whose expertise is in music that's licensed.  This is an enormous pile of stuff that just can't be touched.  It's in fact one of the reasons I don't podcast.  I would love to use the music that I know.  And the fact that I can't just, it feels like just extraordinary censorship to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think some of that as we as participants in this whole process, some of this is up to us.  If we start to say we're really not, I mean, if a lot of us, and I'm not saying that we will, but if a lot of us decided we're really just not going to buy anything from these guys anymore, we're really not going to play anymore because we don't want to do what they're, we don't approve of this.  We're really going to move.  And if a lot of podcasters, if a lot of listeners, if everyone decides to take a decisive move to a certain direction, they'll have to react.  And that's the thing that we're not doing is we sit there and complain and hope that our lawmakers will fix it, which they won't because they're getting paid by these guys to not do that.  But they, but what we, what we can do as users, as producers, as all this is to start moving the thing in a much more concise way and then force them to react and open it up to a point that works for us.  In my humble opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also have to say that this music restriction is great for talk radio and talk podcasts.  Oh, no doubt about it.  We don't have to worry about that.  And, you know, that, that, that's why there's an explosion of talk pockets.  But I, you know, you made a really good point, I think, duck.  And there are some of the podcasts I love the most were, in fact, people talking about real music, you know, licensed music, old music, and they're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in the fact is, you know, you're you couldn't do it.  I mean, you know, I've heard lots of podcasts that have licensed music on it and the RA double A isn't going after them.  The copyright holders, I believe, I already know they probably wouldn't probably copyright holders directly might.  And they, for the most part, don't give a crap.  But in my case, there's just one item that I wanted to use as a, I mean, one song that I wanted to use as a theme song for my podcast.  And I just hit nothing but dead ends in trying to even find who owns the rights.  It was absolutely impossible.  A KCRW, which is one of the top public stations that actually plays music in Los Angeles, probably the most forward looking of the bunch, has a daily show called Morning Becomes Eclectic.  It has an enormous listeorship for public broadcasting program.  And about one out of every 20 or 30 of their shows is actually on a podcast.  They stream them every day, but it's actually on a podcast because of this rights clearing issue.  And even there, they're one of the stations you can launder on.  They're being cautious about it. They're in Hollywood, right?  They're a Los Angeles station.  And they don't do it because it's such a huge pain in the ass to even begin to try and figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say hi to Phil in Greenville, South Carolina.  Phil, you're next on This Week in Tech.  Hello, Phil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Leo and the gang.  You know, we're an hour into this thing and no one's really talked about the Vonage and the Verizon deal much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us what happened. I didn't know about it. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, essentially, Verizon, a judge says that Verizon has patents and that they're,  that Vonage essentially owes them, owes Verizon money.  And they said the tune is like $58 million.  Oh, that's good news for Verizon. Geez.  5.5% of all future revenues, although it looks like Verizon's take is that they're trying to just put them out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, they play hardball, those guys. It's just.  Wow. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess I'm not surprised. I'm surprised that they had these patents, but I'm not surprised that Verizon's going after Vonage.  I mean, that's a big threat to any telco.  And Verizon seems to be the most predatory of all of them.  They're the ones who've got Wi-Fi kicked out of Pennsylvania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you check out, so Business Week has got the story on this, which is basically that Vonage sued over five patents.  Sorry. Verizon sued over five patents that it said Vonage was infringing.  The jury said it only infringed on three and didn't do it willfully.  And so they minimized the damages at $58 million. Geez.  And it's, and now Vonage has to pay 5.5% of its customer fee per month to Verizon.  Well, you have to think that's putting them out of business. I mean, they weren't in such great shape to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, yeah, it's important to remember that these guys are inherently legal entities.  They are not. They are, you know, they are. I think I'm pretty sure this is true.  The telcos are the lobby, the largest lobbying organization on Capitol Hill.  They're larger even than the pharmaceuticals. They live in a regulatory habitat.  If they were outside a regulatory habitat and operating like a real business with real competition and they weren't in this regulatory protectorate like a bunch of zoo animals, they would fail.  But they live in this legal zone and they win these kinds of things. It's really creepy and bad. But there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's move on to RedDragon3883. Not his real name, Allwager. RedDragon, what is your real name? Where are you calling from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My name is Felix. I'm from West Lafayette, Indiana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great to talk to you, Felix. You have a question for the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, about Juiced and the evolution of next YouTube. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting because Viacom made a deal with Juiced when they wouldn't make a deal with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and now they are suing YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing with Juiced is that they're ironically given the people who are founding it, it gives copyright holders an enormous amount of power.  It's very encrypted. It's very closed. They're only looking for medium to large sized producers. They're not looking for individuals.  It's not the next YouTube really because you're not as an individual going to be able to upload to something like Juiced.  It is an exciting platform. It's a pretty interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It strikes me as in a way taking the old business model and putting it on the net. It's not exactly where I'd like to see the business model go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, and I think they're fighting the web. When PodTech went to a player that you can put on your own blog, our traffic tripled.  And why did it triple? It tripled because now you can put our stuff on your site or on your place, on your mice.  Hey, that's a good idea. I'm going to steal that idea.  You should, man.  I like that idea.  That's the thing we've done in the last two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just have a little embed thing. What was I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but we stole that idea from YouTube, right? Why did YouTube become the media distribution center for the world?  Because they decentralized. They let that player go on my blog so I could put a video on my blog without linking over to YouTube and making them richer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why I didn't think of that. Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's fighting the web, right? The companies that fight the web, the principles behind the web and the movements behind the web are going to be less exciting, less interesting.  I like juice because it looks cool, but I hate it because it looks cool. It's really hard to shut that fricking thing down. I won't say it does bad work.  Because if your boss walks in and you're watching video, where the hell is the close button on that window?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think John Furrier is yelling at you for watching juice. I certainly know he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John's a cool guy. I have cool bosses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be the last guy to be yelling at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But normal people who work at normal companies have to worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. There's no boss button. Make note to self.

Transcript:  I think that juice is very much designed. What they're hoping to do, of course, is to build something that is like the next TV.  It's this hyperactive TV content because when you look at what they're including, the ability to chat with other people watching the shows, the ability to get other interactive content, these are the things that I'm not saying that they're going to be successful.  But it's not really designed to be the web in a player format. It's really designed to be TV with added interactivity.  I don't know if they're going to be that successful, but I think that what's interesting for us as producers, and since I'm one of those, and for the consumers, is I think we're really about to see a nuclear war between about five or six of these big guys that are about to, not CBS and NBC, but the Juices, the Gootube, the Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Verizon and AT&T want to be in that business too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting that we've seen is, well, actually, they actually are. A lot of what these cable companies are doing, the cable networks, so the Comcast, the AT&T, the Verizon's, the problem with their cable offering has been pretty much commoditized.  You're just buying a cable subscription.  I don't even know what cable company it is. Exactly.  Exactly. A lot of them though, is what they're moving towards doing, and a couple of them are really taking a forward push on this, is they want to buy a lot of their own custom content that's video on demand for their network.  And I think that's what we're going to start seeing them do to differentiate their network from others, is they now have this big pipe.  They can give you all this video on demand. They've been moving towards this IPTV, and that is exceptionally good for producers and really, really good for niche content being available.  It's not so good for Hollywood, because now suddenly on your cable network, it's not just Apple TV, it's not just Xbox, it's not just PS3 or Juiced.  On your cable TV, you're going to be able to watch a whole bunch of these little short pieces, and these aren't pieces that are like YouTube quality.  We are doing five shows right now for syndicators that are connected to a lot of the stuff that's happening, or a syndicator, a company called OnNetworks.  And we're delivering at 1080p. So this is not, we're not making lots of little content.  We are, it's their ones that are finding those things out. So it's an interesting time to be, being both a consumer and a producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to wrap this up. I think we could go for hours. It's really been a fascinating conversation, and I want to thank you.  Alex Lindsay's Pixelcore is at Pixelcore.com. And by the way, I think we still have some seats left for GMT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A couple. There's a couple left for, so yeah, and that was really funny being at South by Southwest. It's the exact opposite, where it's just all gear talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

PodTech.com.

Transcript:  I go around the world and interview cool geeks that Leo doesn't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very, very cool. Yeah, because I'm not willing to leave my home in Petaluma. So that's why I'm stuck here in my chair.  They come to you, man. They come to me, baby. Well, hey, this was a great panel. I'm thrilled. Will Harris has a new blog. It is Will, W-I-L Harris dot C-O dot U-K.  What's the name of that again? It has a great name. The end of the world?  No, it's nothing. It's just called Where's Will. Where's Will? That's it. Where's Will? Well, now you know. WillHarris.co.uk.  And I'm so glad we could get Doc on the show. I've been a huge fan of Doc Searles ever since the Clupe Train Manifesto.  Well, thanks. It's likewise. Does such good stuff. And I hope you will come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll do whatever you want, man. And I'm available. Sure, I'd love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now that Steve Gilmore no longer has his hooks into you, I'd like to get you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he's always got his hooks into me. It's just what he's going to do. Who knows? Steve is not pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's working with me, by the way. Is he really? Yeah, he's telling me what to do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I always wanted to get Doc on Twitter. I always thought he'd be a great contributor. And obviously I was right.  But because you're part of the Gilmore gang, I didn't want to break up the old gang. But now that they're behind us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, these things are, you know, it's not like old, you know, teams. No, we all work together. Of course. It's collegial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Collegial. Doc, what do you want to plug? Anything you got going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually what I'd like to plug is Project VRM. It's at projectvrm.org. VRM is the reciprocal of CRM.  It's vendor relationship management. It's how the customer manages vendors, rather than vice versa.  It's my project, not just mine, but many people's at the Berkman Center at Harvard. That's where it's being headquartered.  And that's the work I'm doing there. And it's actually just not my work. It's a lot of people's work.  And it's a new idea. It's experimental. And it's something we're thinking out loud about.  But anyway, go to projectvrm.org. It's just a wiki. But that means if you care about that, you can get interested in it and contribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the idea. We do need to manage our vendor relations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, CRM is so broken. That's the subject of the whole show right there.  But rather than complain about what's wrong with the way customer service works, let's fix it from the customer side. That's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. That's fantastic. The work in a way that you began with ClueTrain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly right. I'm tired of waiting. We need somebody else to fix that. Let's do it ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
