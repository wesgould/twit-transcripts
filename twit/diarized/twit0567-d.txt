There's a rumor new MacBook Pro  There were rumors about what else I?  Don't remember there were some other rumors none of which came true. There were rumors. They were gonna completely rewrite iTunes  No  And instead it was all software. It was all about what really a  Developers conference keynote should be about updates to iOS Mac OS by the way it's called Mac OS now not always 10 Mac OS  watch OS and TV OS  And are you pretty excited  First let me let me see here who uses a Mac Owen you use a Mac.

Start time: 441.58
End time: 484.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I use both  But I'm using Linux right now  But oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy  Well, I'll tell you why I wanted a couple of reasons one obviously I was getting a little tired of Microsoft  Foisting Windows 10 on everybody and everything I like Windows 10, but I felt like that was really rude  How wooed and then yeah germane to this conversation. I was looking at Apple thinking you don't care about a  Desktop you don't care about OS 10 anymore  You're all about the iPhone and I was starting to get a little worried and thinking well  I mean I may need to find a new kind of home  Sir, so say you went to the worst home, but okay. No I beg to differ for one thing  I think open source is the future do you not agree I?

Start time: 485.34
End time: 508.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know it's a it's funny Leo like I in high school  I was watching you on the screensavers and all the shows like experimenting with Linux  So yeah, it is really it's funny like I feel like we've been saying open source is the future for a while  It's very important  For desktop platforms. I know we've seen like  The value of having something I know stable with a lot of developer support so both from Apple and Windows

Start time: 508.24
End time: 518.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that was the joke for years this year. Yes, it's gonna be the year of Linux on the desktop  No, no this year. Yeah, the truth is in the intervening years Linux has won in many respects Android is Linux

Start time: 519.75

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right

Start time: 520.96
End time: 627.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sexes was like some unix, you know, oh as 10 is based on BSD. It's a bad star when it's open source under the hood the  Graphical layer on top is all proprietary Apple stuff most anytime you surf at  You know half the sites if not more that you're visiting are running Linux  So but here's what I do think that open source is the is the only sensible way forward  I think this kind of comes back to also the the crypto conversation that people have which is how can you trust?  cryptography if you don't if it's just some blob and  You know that the companies that make that blob are under intense pressure from  Governmental agencies to make the blob accessible to them  Mm-hmm, if you really want to use cryptography if you really want to be private and secure you can't trust a company  Not that the companies are untrustworthy, but but but Apple Microsoft Google Facebook  Have no legal standing to with to say no frankly, or it's very hard for them to say no  If asked in the appropriate way, I mean that's why the Apple store was interesting because they did say no, but they would have lost  you know  Very important understand the San Bernardino phone case  They would have lost in the long run had the FBI not dropped it because they have no legal standing to say no  They have to agree there. You know that they have to go with the law  and so if you want  Privacy and security you can't trust an individual company and you have to trust open source where you can or others can  Validate the source so I always say use open source crypto, and I think in many ways  Open source software is going to be the wave of the future partly because desktop operating systems don't matter as much anymore the cloud  Doesn't care whether you're using Linux or OS 10 or Windows doesn't matter

Start time: 628.48
End time: 670.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What you're using when you say that it sounds correct, and it is correct  But remember the rest of the world thinks of open source as  Like you said all the operating systems and sites are built on top of it  They're all wearing dresses and makeup and they're all the pretty pay their lipsticks on the pig  Yeah, you you keep saying it like like regular people don't know if I said Linux to the average person in America  They'd hand me Windex. I agree  But nobody needs to know that's exactly right nobody needs to yeah doesn't matter as far as the way the future is the way of  Now and what we know because we're knowledgeable about the information, but I don't know like you know  I'm with you, but just relax

Start time: 674.04
End time: 678.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

There's a new file system  Siri is now programmable app developers finally have access to the hooks inside Siri  There's stuff that actually might make a difference  But we'll also talk about invisible text and three times bigger emojis  But first a word about sleep you are the sleep expert, Georgia  I know  George has actually done videos and better sleep at our anxiety dash videos site anxiety dash videos calm  One way to sleep better a better mattress that's Casper Casper mattresses  They are made in the US of a and ship direct to you from the factory which eliminates a big markup  For the mattress store and the mattress store is a broken idea. Let's let's face it  I know you think well, I'm not gonna buy a mattress until I can lie on it  But really do you want to lie at it in the mattress store in broad daylight?  With the salesgirls looking at you got your shoes on you can't curl up. You can't roll over you can't drool  You need to have the mattress in your home and Casper lets you do that for a hundred nights  Casper is amazing. They've reinvented the mattress business two kinds of technologies to give you exactly what you want in a mattress  Which is support that is the sinks that gives you the right bounce and sink  It's springy latex foam and supportive memory foam Casper mattress is a 2016 business intelligence group  Innovation award winner because they've just taken this business that really was stuck in the 50s and they've reinvented it now when your Casper mattress comes  In a surprisingly compact box  You you open it up and it by the way smells great the minute you open it up it breathes  Well, sometimes I think people worry that's oh, it's a memory foam. Maybe it's gonna smell latex. You're some no  No, it's smell. It's the it's a it smells fresh. It's great for the hot weather  That's coming our way this summer because it breathes you will never sleep hot and we know that's another thing people people need to sleep cool  You can buy it online and there's no risk because if at any time in those first hundred nights  You don't like it you call them they'll come and get it. I think they donate it to a charity  I don't think they'd actually ship it back to the factory  They donate it to a charity, but they and they refund you every penny so there's no risk no fuss no muss and  The price is amazing it starts at $500 for a twin, but I'm gonna get you pillows which are great as well

Let's get back to that. Okay. Mm-hmm  I'm gonna do this in an orderly fashion now  The next Mac OS will not be OS 10 will be Mac OS  Sierra  It will be there's a developer edition coming out while the beta you can get now and then there's a public beta  That's next month for actually for all of this  developer bits were available a day of  And a public beta if you're adventurous  Next month and then the fall like September probably  It it is not gonna have the new file system you can try it but they don't recommend you do it because it's very  Very early days, but there's a new file system a PFS which will be rolling out to all devices  Not just max but even the TVs the watches everything in the spring and I was very excited  In fact, we got Aaron Hilligas on the new screensavers yesterday  He is a developer big nerd ranch and I wanted to know about a PFS the new file system  Because it's very like a ZFS which a lot of people say well, here's the here's the point Apple's HFS file system  It's 30 years old  It is antiquated by any standard it is not a modern file system and  ZFS which is a much more modern file system. It's used with Solaris Apple was considering  Incorporating ZFS. It's owned by Oracle now  But as in consider considering it a few years ago and then that just that whole thing just fell off the face of the earth  I think now we know why they were developing their own it has snapshots was one of the chief  Benefits of ZFS is you can roll back roll back roll back anything goes wrong. You can roll back you lose file  You can roll back. It's a really effective  And robust file system. It's faster. It handles large drives better. It handles SSDs better. So that  You know, it's not the kind of thing and they didn't even mention it on stage  It's not the kind of thing you can get people all excited about not like fairy dust messages  But it but in fact makes a huge difference. Oh  Doctor, are you excited now?

So she loved those things and she made all kinds of cool stuff for a friend and she's deep into it  She knows she has been in Jewish grows up and this summer we were gonna be doing coding  Great cuz she has started to learn code and I'm like, oh man  This is gonna make it so I don't have to have her kill me in my sleep  Because it'll make it a little bit more fun because the way I was gonna do it was not

Transcript:  Unless somebody else have fun with it, but that so do you code? Are you a coder?  I used to code and then I started paying other people to do it for me  So now that's what I get back into it for her because it's a horrible terrible thing  I mean when you watch on WBC like  Legit like when the people in the crowd were crying and tearing up  I was like I can't even be mad at them. Normally the Apple seal fest the  Everything they say kind of annoys me  But like when they watch their little video people learn to code and I could code now  Everybody in that room knows how frustrating it is to code so to see somebody happy to learn to achieve  It is an emotional moment because it is a frustrating thing to learn and to do this Swift playgrounds

This is kind of I'm good at this and this is a great opportunity  Just put it on the iPad and see if they find it

Transcript:  Now Apple is in an interesting position because Google at Google I O announced that we're all we're doubling down on machine learning  We're gonna put machine learning and everything  Your phone which already knows a lot about you and Google which already knows a lot about you is gonna be able to predict where you're going  What you're doing and offer you help and you're gonna be able to ask questions of it and Apple has of course  Resisted this trying to position itself as a steward of its users privacy and security  Which makes it a little harder for them to do all of the cool things  That Google and Facebook are doing because they're willing to spy on you. So Apple has responded they did talk about machine learning  They said yes, we're gonna be doing it. But there are two things Apple's gonna do that  They say is now again, this is marketing  So this is what they say is different one is a lot of this will be done on the phone  So for instance Apple debuted new features in photos  Giving them parity I think with Google's photos things like recognizing faces and recognizing subject matter and letting you search your photos  You know for pictures of Paris in the springtime or whatever, but they said but we're gonna do that on device  So we're not gonna do the code in our cloud we're not gonna load your messages in the cloud  We're gonna do it on device. And the second thing they announced is this differential privacy  Which is a really interesting idea coming out of a university research wires articles quite good from Mandy Greenberg describing this  But also our friend cryptographer Matthew Green who really is the king of all this wrote a blog post to about  Differential privacy and he pointed out that it's one thing to say he was said first of all  It's great to see you know university research applied  In this way that many many people will be able to benefit from it, but he said differential privacy is very  Dependent on implementation and  There's really not it's  Until Apple says exactly what it's doing and shows us the code we can't say whether they're doing it right  They're doing it well or even whether it protects your privacy in theory it could  So but I'm I'm liking actually I want to ask you guys. I'm gonna start with you Devendra  I'm liking the idea that Apple says we have a way forward machine learning that still protects your privacy

Start time: 2194.38
End time: 2230.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a I mean it's a good way for Apple to differentiate itself from Google especially and Facebook and honestly every company that we're  Worrying we're giving them too much information  It seems like such an Apple solution to I guess like such like the the way the iPhone was like  Not the first smartphone, but kind of a refined version of the smartphone. This seems like maybe a smarter way of dealing with computer  Learning going forward  But yeah, there's still a lot we need to see it right now feels a lot like marketing  I want to I want to know exactly how this is working there was it was it was Craig Federighi kind of yeah

Start time: 2230.34
End time: 2328.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's working. It's gonna be amazing and you're gonna love it. It's magic  And and and what the Matthew Green says is in fact even I think he has a graph. Let me see there's yeah  It's probably not very helpful, but here's the graph which  Essentially there knobs there knobs you turn and you turn it too much one way you fuzz the data too much  You're not gonna get enough information out of it  You're gonna increase privacy without getting information out of it. You turn the knob too much the other way  You're fuzzing the data, but not sufficiently and privacy is  compromised and we know and the reason this is important is we know that  These data dumps actually turn out to be surprisingly revealing, you know  We've talked a lot about how metadata, you know, the FBI says oh, don't worry. We're just using metadata  It can actually say a lot about you  Netflix dumped a few years ago a huge database  They say had it had been anonymized in their attempt to get a better recommendation engine  They had a million dollar Netflix prize and they said here's the data set then some on  Enterprising researcher took the anonymized data set and putting information together from other sources was able to identify  The movies and individual people were watching and liked and so you can  anonymize but it doesn't have to be effective and so really the  Bath green says we just had it just depends how well this is implemented  It could it could be it could be great and it could be not so great and it could just be you know  They could wave their hands say oh, it's deferential privacy that by enough itself doesn't do anything

Transcript:  So if Apple's gonna be doing this on phone  Does that mean that we're finally gonna get rid of this 16 gigabyte now?  No, I can't do nothing on the phone because if you're gonna do it  Yes, we need a little bit more space  Yes  Every mom that I know all they do is cry and complain about how they can't do anything on their phones  I'm like, well, there's a reason that phones are cheap  But Apple slick marketing and ripping people off  Stupidity if you're gonna be doing a phone the first phone better be a 32 gigabyte phone at least  That's all I'm saying at the very least didn't they to vendor?

I've seen the you know arguments why and people have you know  Made very logical arguments for why it makes sense for Apple to have a low space iPhone because maybe not everybody fills up their  You know storage, but yeah, it doesn't make sense today

Transcript:  Well, no, it's there's no more 32 gigabyte, right?  You know, you have to jump jump to 64 and that shows you the value of 64, but it's it doesn't make sense  Yeah, if Apple kept the 16 gigabyte made it a hundred bucks cheaper or something if it was actually  Below the premium of a typical iPhone maybe fine you can make an excuse for that nobody in this crowd

Yeah, it's not free. It's not free and you have to pay more for it  It's one of those things that just seems really like I hate to say this  you know too much these days because it seems like the thing people jump to but I  It feels like something that Steve's job. Geez Steve Jobs Apple probably wouldn't do right  This is a bad user experience that Apple is selling for its marquee product. I think Steve Jobs Apple would do this

No, no, no, no, no, no, no that has nothing to do with that although people usually assume it has to do with that  No, no, I feel like I mean because look I was an early Apple supporter. I bought a  Macintosh in 1984 and did you buy that cube you bought I bought the cube the day they got home and they and they announced they  Discontinued it. I've owned every Mac and I'm a big Mac fan. I've owned every iPhone. I've owned every iPad  I'm not anti Mac but but and I this is why I have to be careful because I kind of agree with you Devendra  I see the writing on the wall that that it's not the Apple that I fell in love with  is an Apple that's a little bit more interested in  in  consumers in in margin in  fashion and that bothers me because you know what and I'm sorry Georgia, but I  See all these style and pictures from Renee and the I'm more team your I'm more Instagram is like fashion shots of  iPhones and Apple bands and watches right? I'm sure that's conscious

So  That means Apple is gonna continue to own that one  That's the other thing I kind of got like messages  You know, okay. This is ketchup with snapchat. This is nice. This is great  you know what I'd really like that it works on Android as well as iPhones because  Android people get left out right? It's and it's really Apple's all about the lock-in  less about its customers its convenience and more about how can we lock them in and  All right. Let's quickly talk about the Apple TV because that was in fact a stealth  Trojan horse into the home for home kit and now they they came out they said yep  We're gonna have an Apple home app the hub in your house will be your Apple TV  Although for those who don't have an Apple TV in there many countries  You can't get one  You could also use your iPad as the home and that will be the always on it has to be plugged in and always on  Always on the Wi-Fi, but that will be the way you can when you're not home talk to your house  and a lot of people signed up for  the home kit  Including our sponsor ring just announced today that they're gonna support home kit  That could be a big win home automation is not a very you know, it's a very fragmented very difficult.

Oops  And then there's this whole security issue in general to the Internet of Things and these companies not paying any attention at all to  protecting your network  I'm sure Apple will though and I think if Apple becomes  The you know, we keep waiting for a company to come along and make this easier maybe it'll be Apple so

I have all the apps in one block.

Xda developers say as far as we can tell  Because they're fairly aggressive about killing background apps you never really get close to using six gigs of RAM  So it's more like a spec they put in there that but nobody's gonna ever need it sounds good though

Transcript:  Oh, but this would not be a good choice for VR because it's a 1080p screen  Oh, right so lower-res screen means not so good for VR isn't they call it an optic amulet. It's not it's amulet  Pentile though, so it's not as good as the super amulet that  Samsung has the best screens they just Samsung owns these screens  You know they've locked in the market

Transcript:  And the thing the thing about like true VR 2 is that I've talked to the oculus folks  They like what you need an OLED mobile screen to do VR, right?  So that's one thing like even the iPhone right now like will not you can have some 360 degree experiences  But you can't have even something like the Samsung gear VR at this point. Why do you need OLED?  it's because of the way the I think it's the  Response time is just much lower and you latency is everything on these that's what makes people

Transcript:  Like the latency is something that you you want to and it's also just like, you know  If you see it becomes pixelized you're not gonna feel as comfortable while you're using it  And I think that that's the thing is that even when at one point on the the vibe  I like this floor kind of like moved at a different like, you know when I wasn't moving  I had something with downloading on my computer at the same time and I was like, well, I have to sit down  Yeah, if you have a bad VR experience, you're never gonna go back to it  So it's better to have you know a screen that's gonna be able to  Really not give you a latency and also to be able to see things really smoothly

They have something called dash charge  It requires a proprietary adapter. You have to use their adapter  But it apparent according to specs and in fact to Florence  60% charge in just half an hour  Yeah, in fact one reviewer I can't remember in a gadget said this changes how I think about charging my phone  I don't even charge it overnight. I just charge it  You know what meal it like for like for breakfast or something because it charged up so fast  Fast fingerprint reader. I was very impressed with that. It's very feels very snappy. It's a very fast phone  Call the screen colors good  No, no, that's my job I need to review and I could have called one plus and said hey we need a review unit  But I don't like I don't want to be called back.

I'm not quite sure if it's the same  I haven't looked at the specs, but I'm surprised that more companies aren't taking full advantage  Of that stuff like right they're all using these same chips, but they may not all be enabling the same features  But you can get something similar from you know, the new galaxy s7 and everything and other phones

Oh, it's pretty cool  Yeah  And they're actually gonna be doing this moving forward in all of their cases and that's smart, right?  Because you can make an argument for having a battery case but having one that you just plop down and they have these cool  magnetic charging cradles and stuff to you and even like a stand for your desk or your car and  Your phone just clips on like that's a really smart use of  You know wireless charging and yeah, it's it's been nice.

Transcript:  The next step is like truly wireless like magnetic resonance charging and I've seen a couple companies work with that  Right now and that could be that could be really sounds like my toothbrush does it had it. What is that?  That's like it's a I think I was talking to you OCEA. This was the company they have like this they were at CES  They've like this big, you know, it's a machine that sits in the corner of your room or something  It's just like sending out power, you know wirelessly and you if you have their chip or like one of their cases or something  You just have to be looking at it and your phone will be getting power  Look at it in your phone charges  But how far  I'm not sure how far it was like in a room  Like a few feet no, maybe like it can be like maybe 20 feet  Well, I didn't like get to test it fully but it's more like in five to ten years  Like it's sort of like how we used to think about Wi-Fi, right?  Like the idea of internet just you put your computer down and you're getting internet from nowhere  That was amazing and yeah, that's call me what I want to get I'll think that stuff's gonna work

Start time: 4685.28

Start time: 4705.38
End time: 4726.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultimately, that's more interesting than even the wireless charging pads because then yeah  You just walk in and everything is getting power or even like they they pose they pose this idea of like you walk into like  Maybe a mall or something and they're you know  Charging as you go  Five bucks and get your phone charged as you walk around the mall.

So this was the same idea only using hype sounds  supersonic sound  Across the room to charge there's still a company as far as I know  But one of the engineers wrote a post saying yeah, no that doesn't work  Well, I'm not a dolphin and the investors were pissed at this guy. No that it doesn't we never really it didn't  But I would trust sound waves more than I would trust whatever the high-power magnetic resonance waves  Let me ask you this if you get an MRI  Does the technician stay in the room or does he get behind a lead sheet?

It was Final Fantasy 7 or not 7 Final Fantasy 15  They had a weird little VR experience that was also making people sick  Like I'm worried that the ps4 as it is right now doesn't have enough horsepower to like really give good smooth VR  Experiences and that could be a big problem for Sony
