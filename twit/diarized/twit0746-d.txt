Transcript:  So, all right, even though you're not the Seth I thought you were let's talk about oh boy  Electric vehicles. There's there were two big announcements this week  There was one that got a lot of people upset and that was the Ford  Mustang Mach-E which doesn't look like a Mustang. It's Ford's first like high-end electric vehicle  I liked it so much. I put a deposit down. I was gonna ask about yeah, did you really? Yeah Wow, cuz it  Basically, they cribbed the Tesla Model X. They have the big screen in the middle except it's got a knob on it  It's very a Ford Ford slant on the on the Tesla, but I think it looks like a great vehicle and unlike Tesla  They probably have parts. They probably can get parts fixed  You probably don't have a crazy is that me talking not me. I think it's your butt

End time: 476.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's serious as I mean very fun better job. Well, thank you for chiming in  The funny thing is she was way back there, I don't know how she even heard that that's impressive  Not the the Mach-E but that's really not the news they got completely eclipsed by  Once again, Elon Musk and the cyber truck. Yes. What do you think of that?  grief  Yes, it looks like an urban assault vehicle  I

Start time: 477.30
End time: 485.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Won a Mach-E because I like the idea of an electric muscle car to me that seems very American and I like it  It doesn't look like a Mustang traditionally, but it's very attractive

Start time: 487.50
End time: 566.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you sit if you look at the cockpit it actually it reminds me a lot of mine because I'm a must I used to  Have a Mustang for a long time before I must have a bright red  5.0 GT  2009 Mustang to them. Yeah, 2009 Mustang  And it looks the same so they've got it's weird and the lights are the same so they've got some Mustang touch  But it's a crossover. It's not a muscle car a sports car of any kind  But here's the funny thing and I don't know if this really got a lot of attention  They have recordings that play  In the cabin while you're driving to make you feel like you're driving a Mustang. There's three levels  There's a relaxed level which is kind of  That's just loco, but when you turn it up to the like aggressive driving level. It's got clunks. It's got clanks  It's got  Muscle car sounds playing into the cabin. Are they are they are they live or are they?  They're recording because it's an electric vehicle silent  In fact, one of the problems with electric vehicles is it's you know pedestrians can't hear you coming  Especially blind pedestrians can yeah, right. So they so a lot of electric vehicles now have some sort of sound especially at low speeds  And I imagine these sounds are piped outside as well. I don't know but the Mach-e is quick. It's a fast vehicle  It is as it is especially their high-end  They have one high-end expensive model that is zero to sixty in in three seconds

Start time: 566.56
End time: 573.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, see that's why I want isn't the real question how many polygons the Mach-e has no, that's the cyber truck  Well, we know we know how many polygons

Start time: 578.18
End time: 606.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, though the Mach-e like all other modern cars the metal is soft I don't understand metal  Yeah, the metallurgy exactly but to get those soft things  I guess that's a lot of work the way the cyber truck is made. It's made out of three millimeter thick  Hard rolled stainless steel so it's very hard. Mm-hmm, and they just you know, you put a little crease in the benton  And so there's no soft lines at all. It it it looks like  polygons, yeah

Start time: 607.32
End time: 611.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did when they debuted the Mach-e did anyone take a sledgehammer to the windows? No

Start time: 612.36
End time: 678.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I feel a little bad for Elon. He I think there was a misunderstanding. I understand  Yeah, they rolled the wrong truck on stage. Well the front the windshield is armored right?  It's a it's multi layered polymer and it's apparently is very impervious  You know Elon didn't get the memo that the side windows are just glass  So he had his chief designer  Heft a shot with Klaus or someone Klaus huffed it a shot put the side of a baseball through it and whoops  It broke and then they laugh so awkwardly that well it threw Elon  I think the biggest mistake Elon made was well, okay, let's try the other window  which they did and  Let's let's try it again. Maybe that one will not break  So Klaus throw it again. Let's show them that it won't break  so then  What they didn't think of is Elon now has to do the entire rest of the presentation with a broken  Broken windows and everyone said and it completely threw him  I mean his presentation was completely thrown and every once in a while you could see him look over his shoulder at the hole in  the window

Start time: 680.20
End time: 689.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said we'll fix it in post on stage, which was hilarious  But then they did put out a video of them before the show trying it trying it and it worked on those windows on

Start time: 690.00
End time: 700.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The side window of the car I guarantee you that Tesla will sell stickers that place those same broke broken holes  So you can have a test. That's just really yeah, exactly

Start time: 702.82
End time: 719.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so worse than the than the windows which are funny  Who is who actually drives a pickup truck and uses it in a pickup capacity that is looking at this thing and saying?  Oh, I need that in my life. I mean you can't do anything with it. How many orders did they take?

Start time: 720.88
End time: 736.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  146,000 it was I think was a mistaken up  It was a missed opportunity because with the capacity that's your answer  Instead of the pickup truck, they should have filled that with batteries  And then put a solar panel on the top and have an electric vehicle that can go coast to coast without on a single charge

Start time: 737.26
End time: 747.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now be true. That would have been amazing. Now. I don't know but it looked like so they have a hatch on the back  Yeah, which opens they showed at the end one more thing an ATV designed to go in the hatch. That's oh, yeah

Start time: 748.66
End time: 749.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was like a transformer from 1983

Start time: 752.32
End time: 777.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it's funny because the driver of the ATV plugs it into the bed of the pickup so it could be charging while you're  Driving around but look at this back. I think that back actually could have solar panels. Maybe I don't know  It looked like it kind of looked like it did so I don't know  But you can't generate enough electricity with solar panels right no, but you can maybe extend it a bit  I mean you have a park at night and the Sun will come out. It's just the two shattered windows as they show off

Start time: 778.02
End time: 778.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's sad

Start time: 779.72
End time: 783.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so sad but this is not should at least on the other side and then they could

Start time: 783.84
End time: 800.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should have spun it but this is not designed for people who want to have a serious truck to drive to a work site  It's for the people who buy those like  15s with all the extra kit on them people who want to look tough  Yeah, not people actually use this stuff  Yeah, no one who goes to actual construction sites or show up in a cyber truck because they'll get laughed off the site

Start time: 800.60
End time: 807.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's literally a road warrior vehicle. Yeah in the worst way possible or the best way possible  I still want one. I'm gonna make fun of it. I want oh, absolutely now

Start time: 809.58
End time: 815.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He announced a price of $40,000, which is probably undoable. Yeah, he won't be available for two years

Start time: 815.76
End time: 821.58

Transcript:  Nevertheless and they're gonna have to stick side mirrors on it somewhere because that otherwise it won't be street. No, it's not legal

Start time: 821.64
End time: 838.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I'm wondering if in a couple of years finally  The Department of Transportation will say okay cameras cameras  Yeah in the in Europe you can and there are cars with little screens in and instead of having mirrors  They have cameras and I you know, the Ford doesn't have door handles

Start time: 838.70
End time: 858.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you hear about the brake pedal on the cyber truck? No, how it doesn't have one. I read tweets about this  It doesn't have I read an interview with Elon  That's it doesn't because if you run into somebody you're gonna win  I don't know if that was the logic, but it's one of those things that here's what I like it  What what does it do to stop just I think it's supposed to be intelligent to do it for you

Start time: 858.28
End time: 863.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You hang your foot out the door. I think you scream in terror louder. You scream the more it stops

Start time: 863.40
End time: 877.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's what I like about it. It's fun to make fun of it looks like a doom video game sprite  It has no detail looks very low-res practical. It's gonna cost more money  But here's Tesla just being weird and going out there and doing stuff that no one else is gonna do Ford made a crossover

Start time: 877.82
End time: 1001.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo they made this this is what I would say in response to all of this is it's Elon  He yes, he thinks he's living in a simulation. He takes drugs. He does not think about who's gonna buy this  Right. He and do you know which ones I've seen him do it?  Well, we saw him smoke on join on Joe Joe Rogan, but I think he's taking hallucinogenics a lot more  But nevertheless who cares  Elon is the kind of entrepreneur who says I'm just gonna do it  I don't I don't think about who wants this or whether that's a showstopper  I don't think he's really thinking about a market  He says this is what needs to be done and I like it and I bet you there are other people and he's right  Because they've got a lot of orders for it. I would buy it if I did if I needed to pick up  Imagine arriving at the job site in this thing. You'd be the envy of all your co-workers  Do you still have a model X I don't and I'll tell you why I decided I want the Ford instead of a model X  My model X lease ran out. I turned it back. Okay. I'm never again buying a gas vehicle  I really am all in especially here in California on EVs  But I would don't trust Tesla because  Elon lives in a simulation and he doesn't he's not worried  So you've heard maybe you've heard the rumors that if you break a window on your model  X or 3 or s it could be up to 3 to 6 months before you get a replacement now  If that's the windshield you're not driving the car for that time and and there's a lot of other little things like that that  It's not  Tesla's not a car company. It's a software company. My wife always said we're driving a beta  Mmm, and she's kind of right the door would hit her in the head  Shouldn't like that. She'll fix it later  I mean the goal is that the goal the the software update if it was raining  When you open the door  the gap would suddenly pour a sheet of water down the side because it was trapping the water and then as you get out you'd  Be walking through a waterfall. There's little things like that that honestly Elon doesn't care. I don't think they care  They want to change the world and they have vision

Start time: 1003.00
End time: 1008.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they may power to it like all car companies. They make concept cars except Tesla. She sell them. Yeah, right

Start time: 1008.84
End time: 1011.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1014.84
End time: 1031.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not you know, I didn't mind it that it was beta. Okay, right because I'm a geek and so that model of  Vehicle as software where you're constantly updating constantly iterating if it breaks  Oh and this happened you'd get updates things would break a week later to get fixed. It was like software

Start time: 1031.86
End time: 1067.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well the difference with with I mean not to be a  You know negative Nancy here  But the difference with with vehicles when they're beta and they ship and they're on the road is that they kill people, right?  and  one of the problems with this is that you actually want a  Computer aided driving or fully computerized driving on the roads  You want to have the added level of safety that you know  Google and others have been promising since 2013  But the problem is is that they're not there yet and they're putting these vehicles on the road  Which is I think in the long run actually gonna harm the rate of adoption

Start time: 1068.66
End time: 1096.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're not road ready in Tesla's defense  They are it's a very they sell very safe cars. I mean Tesla's are safe and they're very very well  They're very aggressive about about rolling out and and driving  Safety  Ideas, I felt where's the rest the industry how many people are you can't blame the like, you know  a company like GM or something like that for all the people who die because they haven't been aggressive and rolling out new safety

Start time: 1097.06
End time: 1102.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Forget because but but Ford shipped a vehicle that burst into flames when rear-ended. Yeah, right

Start time: 1102.40
End time: 1158.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and and and looking at the at the number of people who die in car crashes  Across the United States as a percentage. I'm pretty sure it's lower than it was in 1980  Yes, when there when there when there was when there were no safety features and seat belts were optional  So in that sense there has been improvement over time  But now that we're getting computers involved my fear is that people will become afraid of computer aided driving  When we know that on on the whole it's going to improve things  We have 30,000 some odd people get killed in car crashes every year  And it's not broken out as to whether they're pedestrian or in the car or whatever  But ultimately we can benefit from this if it's being done in a way that I think it  Takes into consideration  Pedestrians takes into consideration other people on the road and we don't have that and that's what worries me  And we see what happened with uber a year and a half ago

Start time: 1158.72
End time: 1163.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just about to say, you know, we're gonna talk about that action a little bit because the final investigation is finished

Start time: 1163.60
End time: 1167.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was and it was found that it was human error. Yeah, you know, what a shot

Start time: 1167.84
End time: 1206.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, it was the safety I guess we talked about now the safety driver and we knew this because there's  Video the safety driver not paying attention sure looking down  Driving but also uber software didn't account for pedestrians right anywhere  But during the cry in the crosswalks, right?  It didn't help the woman who was run over walked into traffic in a poorly lit area  She was apparently on meth because she had a very high level of methadrine in her bloodstream  Plus some marijuana  So she was a homeless person she she kind of stumbled into the street  But a normal driver would have not hit her. Yes

Start time: 1207.74
End time: 1225.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and and that was an area where the crosswalks were over a quarter of a mile apart  I mean it was people would have probably happens is people who even are not on drugs are not are crossing there because that's where  As a community the people want to go that's where they need to cross not a pedestrian friendly area

Start time: 1226.34
End time: 1248.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an understatement. But just to go back to Tesla one of the innovations is there a  Documentation of everything they use the sensors on the car to figure out everything that happened  They zap that back to headquarters and crunch that information that also bugged me because they know exactly what I do  But if there's an accident they say well, why would you know why and they can again they treated software exactly, right?

Start time: 1249.48
End time: 1286.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're getting telemet telemetry and they're no and they're improving their software. I think Tesla's a safe vehicle  I think they're if they did something wrong was marketing it as autopilot. Yes, it is not right  It's not and so I as a Tesla driver never treated it as such. I treated as driver assist lane keeping  Adaptive cruise control. That's what other companies call these technologies. That's fine  And I there is a one feature that I didn't really like which is if you hit the turn signal and autopilot  It'll change lanes for you  I tried it once and it all and it cut off a car and behind me because it didn't judge the distance properly  And I never used it again  so

Start time: 1287.30
End time: 1346.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that you are going that you were approaching your Tesla experience from a more rational point of view  Does not seem to be the way that one they're marketing it which is a big problem and to and to that people are  Actually applying it and we know that there are people who are we've seen that there's crashes and everything from people  because they put on their autopilot and they think it's a full self-driving car and it's not and and  Ultimately, it's going to be people who are going to die and get killed and that's what I think is is is the real  concern here is  Tesla's is innovating perhaps in some ways and how they're building cars and how they're treating them as mobile computers, which is good  but the marketing is chaotic and  Leading to bad driver behavior and ultimately it it is people behind the wheel of these vehicles  And it's and until we change our insurance industry, that's how the cars are going to be  That's how crashes are going to be blamed for whomever owns the vehicle or is the driver

Transcript:  Is is I think remarkable more and more we've been swatted and more and more police departments are recognizing that there that this is often  Quote prank a very very dangerous prank. Yeah, the police report said that Tesla's call center called them  Because they said they'd received a phone call which a female subject stated. She was friends with Martin Tripp  Described him as being heavily armed and distraught was on his way to shoot up Tesla  So they said the good news is they sent an intelligent deputy chief deputy Dosen  Who went there to see if he could make contact? They did not send the SWAT team  They did not send a bus of heavily armed police with armor body armor in and so he wasn't you know harmed  But this is a police report.

Dorsey has lost his phone. Can you send us another sim?  And now remember these customer service people are customer service people so they're gonna say well  Sure, we have the number of the address on file  Oh, no, can you send it to work because Jack needs it?

Oh, I hate that just log on stadia theoretically and then off you go  Now if you're if you're an adult with a job and stuff  Your consoles are often off for a period of time and you want to game occasionally stadia  I thought would be a good outlet for that the issue is

Start time: 2404.02
End time: 2436.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I just before you go with the issue. This is not a new idea. It's been around for a while  Remember online I was oh, yeah online. Yeah, they tried to do it and failed for some economic reasons  They they couldn't have enough servers to handle the peak traffic  Google I'm sorry a Sony bought a company called guy Kai and Sony has a service that does this  Microsoft's announced their xcloud service, which will be based on Azure which will do this. What's interesting about stadia?  It's not it's not particularly the technology is that it's from Google. Yes with no history in gaming whatsoever. What's the difference?

It's not quite there. I had a I paid for the founders edition and cancelled it

Start time: 2488.02
End time: 2548.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Days before it was to ship. I literally cancelled the last week because I so we had a review on our hands-on tech a show I  Jason Howell reviewed it. He's a founders. We also had a copy here Anthony Nielsen  Let me play with it. It was actually pretty good. I just decided here's the  There are a couple of problems and actually I'll let Mike address one of them, but one problem is you pay  right now anyway a hundred thirty dollars to get the  chrome ultra comb cast ultra and the  Joystick controller and then ten dollars a month for a subscription  But you don't you get destiny 2 you get a free game  But everything else you have to pay for and it's the same price as if I bought it for my Xbox or I bought it on  Steam at sixty dollars you don't hold the game. They hold it. It's on their service running on their servers  So that was to me  problem number one and it was a problem to me because of what I want you to address which is  Google's not known a for gaming and they're not known for stamina, right? They're not known for not canceling things

End time: 2573.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Double negative there  however, and and that's true and I think they're gonna have a hard time getting people buy in because  People both gamers and the game makers  Want a platform in the gaming space that's gonna be around for at least 10 15  Consoles typically a ten years like you invest yourself in a game to really master it and so on so people get really like look

They've got Google Cloud. They've got millions of dollars. I like video games  I'm bored a lot.

I mean they completely dominate the market so lots of students high school students. I have Chromebooks sure and  Of course people start gaming in high school. That's where you do it  So you have all these students who have physical access to a Chromebook who are gonna be able to play these games now

You know sure I'm sure there and and so so and so by the time they go to college  They may be upgrading to something like you know  Maybe to another Chromebook, but very arguably to a cheap Windows PC  It was still or or a cheap Mac all the games you bought your account

They don't say anything about that  you know, I don't I  The problem other problem is you're going against two companies that are very well known in gaming which is Microsoft and Sony  They have similar products. I think if you're a serious gamer, you're gonna look at Stadia to say well, that's interesting  I'm not gonna pay to be in the beta. Yeah X cloud comes out next year  Let's take a look then like like Alex says the price is the is the is the is the pain to be part of a beta

Transcript:  At Google I own they announced that the technology was quite interesting and there were some interesting features for instance  All the rendering is done on Google servers  And they said if we need to we can we can have two or three servers working on your game  So if you want to play cooperative gaming you'd each have your own server, but they are can interconnected at the Google  Network Center so that they're interconnects much faster if you  They did some interesting things with YouTube if if you're a YouTube streamer and you're playing a game  You could put an invite on the screen that a stadium member could click and instantly be in your game  So there's a lot of interesting technology there, and this is very Google-based  A lot of interesting technology there, and this is very Google the engineers drove this of course look with all the cool things we can do  right, but what happened I think is the marketers or the the business people just didn't  Understand what the market is like gaming is a unique and challenging market it is

Transcript:  One small point that before we move on which is when fortnight was first blowing up like I guess a couple years ago now  They were gonna bring fortnight to your phone, and I was like that's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life  I played for not a couple times on a PC, and I thought it's kind of fun alright  I was terrible, so I gave it up, but um how wrong was I yeah?  I love playing more people play on mobile now than play on I bet they play up for an ad on an abacus like people play  That game anywhere yeah, and you know what that's partially why you took off  I mean kids these days quote quote  I mean take it on the go with them, and so you know I'm a bit out of date now  But I think it shows that this idea of gaming on Android phones that we've talked about does have more legs  And you might think if you're watching twit right now on a 40 inch 4k monitor at home the fiber connection because you're not the majority

Transcript:  I pay five bucks a month for Apple arcade and one of these selling points is I could play it on my iPad  But I could all play it's a hundred games  I could play it on my iPhone  But I also can play it on my Apple TV on my big screen TV and and I think soon if not already  I could play it on my Mac so there that is a compelling argument like those games for free, but it's five bucks a month

Start time: 3264.16
End time: 3303.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean in my case the only possible way that I would play a game is if it could be on one of my open tabs  In the device that I'm using right because I'm not gonna put all my stuff away  Right and then go and use this special thing and sit there for hours and hours just playing a video game a lot of people  Will but I'm you know I think lots of people won't they want to integrate it into their mobile life into their work life into their?  Whatever so I you know there's a place for for casual games  It has to be said that the the biggest platform for games in the world  Is iOS and and very successful very successful and these are mostly cheap and dirty games and not dirty games

Start time: 3303.16
End time: 3309.86

Start time: 3320.44
End time: 3344.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think part of the problem there is that is the UI is intended for a game controller  What do they call that a remote a remote?  And and really if a successful iPad game is designed for that touch interface exactly and not having to kind of move things around  But there are some really wonderful right iOS innovative iOS games out there the context of this

Transcript:  So I think it actually is because fortnight has built a culture around communication with people like like kids these days  It's a chat room as much as it is a game  And I think that that's an interesting factor  But what I think what matters is we don't really need to have these hard  Definitional genre definitions by analogy the heavy metal scene loves to have that's technical death metal  Gothenburg melodic death metal you don't need it's heavy music and it's a delight games can just be games and we don't get tribal  About it, right?  I think stadia will break down some of the the console boundaries that we've traditionally interest only versus Microsoft thing  But I'll say this Microsoft has PCs and Xbox Sony has PlayStation and Google has a shot at stadia  They need to have something in gaming to give themselves relevant with the children  So I hope they're serious about this and they're not gonna do what they did to cloud print but the comments that's the next story

Transcript:  Now never killed gmail  But I cloud the idea of cloud print is you'd buy a cloud print enabled  Printer and most printers these days both do Apple's air print and Google's cloud print, right?  You sign into your Google account on the printer and then you can print from any device with a Google account and that printer  Even if I'm at work, I could print to that printer at home. And so I thought that was pretty cool  I'm get although I notice I don't use it that much anymore  And I'm guessing that's one of the reasons Google's killing it is that they they have the numbers and nobody's using it exactly

Start time: 3449.20

There's a lot of things that approach it  But but I don't understand the cloud printing because I can't imagine can you print from their Chromebook? Sure. How do you print?  Well, I used to use Google cloud print

Start time: 3472.64
End time: 3477.50

End time: 3505.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the the Chrome OS has its own printing system. Yeah  But your printer has to know about it yes, but it's it actually works better than cloud print  I don't think this is a terrible thing that they killed this because superfluous really it's been like like you said  It's been around since 2010 since then there have been lots of ways to print from mobile  Browsers and so on that are superior to to that and yeah, there's a few stragglers still using it  But so Seth did you set up your printer?

I had no idea  So many people would download it and I had really no idea how we were gonna get it to you because the cost of  It this the problems I actually went to at one point we were offering it as BitTorrent  We were begging listeners to please seed our BitTorrent that way we could get to everybody who listened  Then along came Matt Levine the founder of cashfly said Leo we can save you  Come on over to cashfly, and I have never regretted it since never a worry about the servers going down  never a worry about our bandwidth bill because  Cashfly is  The best global content delivery network servers all over the world mean it's got a hundred percent  SLA you never goes down  It also is faster  I mean all CDNs are faster than the than anything else certainly a lot faster than BitTorrent  But cashfly besides being ten times faster than traditional delivery methods is up to thirty times faster than other major  CDNs they really are good and they will save you money. I could tell you from experience  And this was the thing for us our demand  I bet yours is too if you have an app or content that you provide if you're a podcaster is  Spiky right we get a lot of downloads for Twitter on Monday, and it goes down Tuesday Wednesday Thursday by Friday  There's you know it's much slower and so that's spiky stuff could easily hit a bandwidth cap  Except that I don't have a bandwidth cap with cashfly  We worked with them to create a yearly billing cycle to smooth out the spikes  So it's based on our yearly usage trends, so I never have to log in to see are we all right?  I know exactly what's gonna cost me on average customers who switch to cashfly save more than  20% now I can't promise you but I can promise you a really easy way to find out  twit that  Com if you go over there, they will give you a complimentary detail analysis of your CDN bill no hard sell  They're not gonna push you  But they will show you what your cost is now your usage trends now and what cashfly would cost you  See if you're overpaying I bet you are as much as 20%  That's crazy twit that cashfly.com and no more 3 a.m. Phone calls the servers are down  You're by the way, I think anybody listens to our shows will tell you when they click that link to get the show we come  In fast we come in immediately without hesitation.

That's not their fault  But if we do it right, they'll do it right and that's what I want  Oh  Man, I loved it when the professor president Trump went down to Austin, Texas and opened that brand new Apple plant  Wow to make the new Mac pros Tim Apple was so grateful Tim Apple  You know we knew we knew that in fact we even said I'm actually we watch Tim's face  Whenever Tim is in the presence of the president. He looks  stoic  One of the things that happened here is the president said I am thrilled to be opening this brand new facility that  Apple's been using to make Mac pros since 2013  Obama  It's a mistake he made a little mistake  I think he wants to take credit for opening a factory that's been there for quite a while before we talk about the t-word

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to give Tim Apple a lot of credit and the reason is that he works for the shareholders  Yeah, and it's doing shareholders do Sherry do exactly it's in it's in their  Interest for him to suck up to the president to get whatever relief on tariffs or whatever you can get and that was the deal

Start time: 4267.24
End time: 4289.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because there were going to be some significant tariffs against all the parts that Apple uses and  They were able to get at least some of those tariffs lifted by saying no no no no we're gonna  We're gonna build a facility in Austin. We're gonna hire fifteen thousand people  We're gonna keep this plant running and and so that yes, he did the right thing as a CEO right  Screaming inside sometimes you got to eat broccoli right sometimes

I respect it  I know your point just 10% of me was like come on just just tell him  Tell him to his face do it for me because I want to and I can't yeah, I don't matter

End time: 4412.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean that so so not the incident of that particular dinner  But the fact that Facebook had Facebook's policy shop in Washington leans very heavily Republican  It's leaders a Republican knife that was in my disinformation story back in October or September whenever that was and  Again like nothing new there  They're going Silicon Valley Silicon Valley is going to wind up agreeing with whomever is in charge in power

Transcript:  Stupid I agree okay, so let me let me do the ultimate in devil's advocacy  And I'm gonna advocate on behalf of the general Trump attitude  Which is try to get manufacturing out of China and into the United States, and that's what he's doing well his credit exactly  Well, they're doing their most low-volume  manufacturing which is for the for the desktop max basically  In the United States because the the numbers are so low if they wanted to do something like iPhones  They simply couldn't do it because there's so much of the supporting infrastructure the education infrastructure the managers to manage the factories the  Components that have to be close by all that infrastructure is all in China because they've been pushing pushing pushing for  Manufacturing and the u.s. Has been like wow great. It's cheap  Let's just do it all in China, and this is a problem to have one  Country be kind of a chokehold on global electronics manufacturing and so in general  Something or someone should try to kick-start  More manufacturing electronics outside of China not necessarily the u.s.. Maybe Mexico maybe Brazil  Maybe other countries maybe a lot more in the u.s.. You do that with tariffs

Start time: 4502.70
End time: 4512.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, yeah Brazil has Brazil has done that with tariffs  India does that with laws and tariffs India says you can't sell a phone that's not made in India in India

Start time: 4512.82
End time: 4543.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So okay, sorry to interrupt, but this was happening anyway before Trump was even campaigning for president  There was manufacturing that was leaving China because costs in China were already going up. It was moving to Vietnam  It's moving to India. It's been moving elsewhere and the fact that like Trump decided to  you know to  Throw these tariffs at China as if it was going to help u.s. Manufacturing is  Wrong, but well it helped India

Start time: 4544.34
End time: 4563.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly it helped every other country where manufacturing was already going and yes who paid for that the American consumer  So we've essentially through taxing the American consumer through tariffs  Which is what they are we have moved some manufacturing out of China into neighboring countries, but no gaining jobs in the u.s  No  But it's still a net benefit to this country as we decouple from China both politically and economically

Start time: 4564.36
End time: 4573.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I so there is a there's a political value to it because of the Chinese chokehold  Yes  But if what you're saying is we want jobs and that's a big part of this is it's not helping us with jobs

Start time: 4573.40
End time: 4586.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Terrace never will get your jobs  But we did get a weird silver lining in the in the supply chain situation that Mike was talking about  But I don't are we gonna see an iPhone plant in Texas. No, we don't want I personally I don't think we want manufacturing jobs

Start time: 4586.64
End time: 4617.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are sweatshop horrible jobs. We want robotics manufacturing, right?  And lots of jobs around around the robotics high-tech manufacturing exactly and you know, the u.s. Has  In general the u.s. Has many or most of the cushy jobs in the world  We don't do the sweatshop labor. We do the financial consulting stuff  That's like sweet work if you can get it  And so yeah, I don't I don't like the idea that we're gonna have like Chinese style sweatshops. We're never gonna do it as cheaply  I'm glad we're making computers in Texas though. That's great  Yeah

Start time: 4618.93
End time: 4653.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are expensive computers  They're not gonna sell a whole lot of them and by the way that flex factory has been there for a while before even Apple  But they make that's where they made the last Mac Pro  so  Speaking of Apple they tell Congress you'll hurt yourself if you try to fix your phone  So Apple right now is really trying very hard to block the right to repair movement  Yeah, they've done some things I have to say I have to commend them  They have finally allowed parts and manuals to go to third-party repair companies. That is a huge shift

Start time: 4653.96
End time: 4687.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that they were even allowed to get in on this early was it was a massive mistake  none of these companies should be able to lock up their supply chain like that and should be able to  Employ the shenanigans that Apple did to get around  People being able to replace their screens or keyboards or whatever  I mean utter nonsense and the fact that that people have to fight for the right to repair when it was  The literal right to repair that got Steve Jobs in on this in the first place  I mean Apple should be ashamed of itself for this

Start time: 4687.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Apple's vice president of corporate law was testifying on Tuesday didn't get a lot of attention. I guess there were some other  Hearings might in Congress people were paying attention  So I'll tell you what they said this comes from a vice  Apple  Apple's primary argument was iPhones are too technical for the average person to repair without special training  That doing such repairs could be dangerous and here's the one that just doesn't pass the sniff test  It costs Apple more money to do repairs and they charge they lose

Start time: 4722.62
End time: 4732.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Money I have a theory about this my theory is that what they're doing is they're saying okay  We do a lot of the repairs in the Apple stores  Apple stores  cost

Start time: 4734.30
End time: 4765.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, $100,000 per square foot. They're assigning the cost of an Apple store to that  They're also probably including the cost of repairing damaged goods under warranty. Yes, right, right, which costs them money  Nathan Proctor who is the director of the campaign for the right to repair said Apple's argument is absurd in defending their decision not to make spare parts or service information available  The company claims certain parts and information are necessary for a reliable repair. It's a circular argument  I can't have the parts you can't handle the parts

Start time: 4766.52
End time: 4771.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many how many of these repairs that they that Apple was doing itself were related to those stupid keyboards?

Start time: 4771.74
End time: 4783.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing there's a lot of recall and warranty repairs and I bet you that goes under the cost right?  That's why they can say oh it caught we lose money on repairs  Yeah, and those made some stuff that didn't work for four or five years and told you that it did. Yeah

End time: 4819.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who must love his name or her name gay Gordon burn as opposed to straight Gordon burn his brother  executive director of the trade organization repair org said Apple's hanging their hat on their front door  Apple's hanging their hat on their perceived need to protect consumers from their own batteries  Which seems odd since they could design batteries to easily be removed by a fifth grader and the world would be better for it  In fact, we all remember phones where you'd pop off the back put in a new battery safely  With a minimal cost and you'd get another two years of life out of it

Start time: 4819.64
End time: 4830.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just just to be clear on this  I mean the the ways in which Apple is completely full of it here  First of all, the reason it's challenging difficult possibly dangerous is because they designed them that's right

Start time: 4831.20
End time: 4835.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The second thing now in their defense they design them that way because we wanted thinner more compact phones

Start time: 4835.98
End time: 4841.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know anybody who wanted the thinner thing  Everybody wants a better battery, but they don't want pre-channel is Apple's obsession

Start time: 4841.88
End time: 4845.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, this newest phone is a little thicker exactly a little heavier with a little more battery

Start time: 4845.98
End time: 4896.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right  And that's what people want  Give them what they want  but the other thing is that they what obviously what Apple needs to do is to have a  Certified Apple program to expand the existing program to train all kinds of third-party companies to give them the documentation to give them parts  Give them everything above board so that they can have this infrastructure that is beyond Apple's control where this stuff is repaired at much lower cost  The other part of it is this whole idea when they say that they they lose money on repairs  That the mine goes to the idea that oh they make ten dollars on an iPhone and then it costs them fifteen dollars to repair  It and so they lost money that phone. That's not what they're saying  And the reality is they made two hundred and fifty dollars on that phone and it cost them  $15 to repair and they charge fourteen dollars for the repair. That's what really what they're saying  And I don't even think that's what they're charging is a loss  But in general they're the most profitable company in the history of mankind

Start time: 4898.34
End time: 4946.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the the fear with with something like this also is not just that  You can't repair your own iPhone right?  You can't repair the screen or whatever else you've damaged  The real issue is is that if Apple succeeds at this which company is going to be next to adopt this point of view and  Getting us back to Tesla  Can you imagine if you if Tesla was able to construct its cars in a way that you couldn't repair a headlight?  That you couldn't were you know fix an LED or something glued together, right? I mean  Like it's nuts. It's not how we have historically worked with vehicles  it's not how we've historically worked with our own tech and  The ability to hack things and innovate on things is  Crucially important because otherwise you're nothing other than a consumer and what people aren't talking about enough is the

Start time: 4946.32
End time: 4988.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  environmental cost of non-repair. Yeah lately agree  to manufacture a smartphone is a  Catastrophe for the environment the amount of toxic chemicals that are produced the mining  It just goes on and on and on and so the only  Environmentally friendly smartphone is the one that is never manufactured the way you do that  Is you make sure that the phones that are manufactured last 15 years somehow you figure that out you repair them you move them down  The food chain you have a you know resale value you make them super high quality  So they do continue to last you have a way to swap out the battery so that you know that because that's the first thing  To go and that's really the core of this  Smartphones are being manufactured by the billions now and it's a really bad thing for them

Transcript:  All that talk Apple does about how you know this is recycled aluminum and all that stuff is essentially green  Washing because they're making their phones hard to repair and everybody replaced more.

Transcript:  In general I heard this concept lately and I absolutely love it and I'm applying it to everything here's the concept  Anytime there's something wrong in the world. You always blame the operator  So let's blame Leo for the fact that his phone isn't repairable like that doesn't make sense  You have to look at the system makers like that, you know  The fact the the reason Leo has so many phones and and that they're not as repairable as they could be is not Leo's fault  it's this

Transcript:  It's his credit card but the repairing point exactly exactly so it's me a lot to be an environmental nightmare, please  That's right. I want credit. That's right  But no, you're right. It's Apple's fault Apple could make a much not a priority for them, right?  In fact, I fix it tore down the new 16 inch MacBook Pro, which by the way, I love I bought it's a great MacBook  It's got a one out of ten repairability score because Apple  Wants everything to be thin and reliable and they glue stuff in so it won't rattle around  They don't pay any attention to the notion of repairability. Yes. It's just not on the radar educated consumer

Start time: 5076.28
End time: 5084.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can never get more RAM in there because it's soldered in so not not to take Mike's role here, but  The idea that a company has to make something  Reparable I think is is very interesting and worthy of debate  I think what out what Apple's done by sort of  Ramrodding their point of view home and and having done it for years and being able to get away with it  Kills off that debate but whether or not a company that makes a tech product should make it repairable is  really really interesting and  Because then you're looking at things not just like how the device's hardware is made you're looking at things like software you're looking at firmware  You know software bill of materials  Movement is is a big part of this and I'm I'm personally not sure how all these things integrate and I think what's needed is  actually a larger discussion among  Among tech companies and you know tech aficionados as to how to handle these these issues

Transcript:  No, and no, okay  I'm making a point about thickness going back to about five minutes ago when you were talking about we want thicker devices the original zoom  30 gigabyte thing was tremendous because it had like an insane amount of battery life. Thank God. It's still around  I think I still have one off the first chart. It still works such a great device  I used to work night shift driving farm harvesters  And so I would be outside bored to tears and my zoom would last the entire shift because it had a battery built from  I don't know what but it was amazing  Were you were you like in a combine driving around open open cat berry harvester? Oh my god  Yeah, it was long not a great job  No, it was night shift too  So I had music to stay awake and the zoom would last from the first time I sat down to the very end of the morning  What kind of berries?

Start time: 5309.32
End time: 5330.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's can have a lot of different meanings and I think Congress is by the way moving in that direction  Yeah as our courts as our state legislatures  And I think you could reasonably say it's in the national interest that if you have a lithium ion battery  It'd be removable and easily replaceable by consumers. Yeah, that could be a law and that would be a law  I would gladly support right sure

Transcript:  I'd also like to see like mandatory software updates you have to make this thing  Updatable and upgradable in software. It has to have a  It has to be like Google saying your Chromebooks gonna last three years on software  That's fine. As long as you know that going in right you can't have some sort of like oops, it's dead now  System especially for devices that are designed to last 10 years or 20 years

Transcript:  We're kind of moving in somewhat that direction there are now laws about warranty lengths  I think the EU is going for two years  We have some of that California has one year so that would be akin to that in addition to a warranty requirement  You could say and you're it has to be suitable and updatable through our five-year

Transcript:  And you know the FDA is mandating pre and post-market guidance for medical devices  So there's some movement in certain space and that's a really important hugely important  But but by and large I worry about where it's going and how there's not a  Discussion that connects these different movements together repairability is getting worse

Start time: 5394.14
End time: 5401.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we need to we do a rest of that trend and we get to push the other direction  I don't know where to start  I like everything you said but pick a starting point and let's do some laws

Start time: 5401.36
End time: 5434.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a Congress for this so they're supposed to do well the interesting thing as the about the FDA situation is that there were  No laws passed. It's simply it's regular guidance  Yeah in regulation and that I think is really important because you can then see who the  To the top actors in the space are right which medical device makers are taking this seriously  And when you deal with one that isn't like I don't know if they need a sticker or something that indicates  We're you know, like energy stars something that says like this is a good actor in the space or not  but  Maybe that's the kind of thing that has to happen with right to repair

Transcript:  So again looking at situations where we've seen success right even if it's limited like the FDA situation right that situation  happened in a  Resulted in a  favorable outcome for consumers right where devices have certain pre and post market mandates because  There were more stakeholders involved than just consumers. We're all consumers  We all have very very little power when it comes to interacting with giant corporations and the US government there have to be  other organizations involved at the regulatory level that take on the voice of  the consumer as well as the voice of companies that think that the right to repair is a good idea and  There should be enough of them to collaborate where if there's actual movement towards something over a few years  It'll actually happen, but when you're it's just consumers versus the goal, you know Goliath  It's it makes for a nice biblical story, but at the end of the day it doesn't it's not reality

Transcript:  Nobody believes this but in fact we're going to be entering into an era where smartphones stop being the main device that we use  Entering an era where it's going to be smart glasses, so we need to make sure that smart glasses have a right to repair  I think within ten years it's gonna be you  Ten years, okay five to ten years. I mean think about it Leo  2009 was ten years ago, right?  If you look back it goes a lot faster we think so  We have to make sure that smart glasses are repairable that have removable batteries all this kind of stuff and and maybe because  This kind of stuff you're talking about Seth this takes you know to get the the the consumers involved this takes forever  so  Speaking of environment.

Transcript:  It's it's got a big battery. Is that the new desktop?  The white no, this is actually the new molecule  This is an awesome device the we were it was so smoky here a couple of weeks ago from the fires  The state was on fire. The state was on fire and honestly  It was like smoking a pack of cigarettes when you go outside you'd feel it your throat you feel terrible  We had received the brand new molecule  This is our favorite air purifier and I and I was I was out of the country, but I I slacked our team  I said you can open the molecule and set it up. I know you need it. We have molecules everywhere  I started our first molecule  was in our bedroom because Lisa has allergies and she would wake up with a headache and she'd be all stuffed up and  as soon as we put in the molecule it completely changed everything and I know it's the molecule because  occasionally like  It'll get unplugged or you know, so maybe the housekeeper unplug it or something and then Lisa wakes up  She says I got a headache and I saw the molecules off. So we know it's the molecule. He liked it so much  We got one for our son  We have one the big with a big one in the studio and now they have these new little molecules  That are great for smaller areas. Why does molecule work? So well  It was the technology was developed a couple of decades ago by the director of clean energy  Research Center at the University of South Florida they patented a breakthrough system  They call it pico photo electrochemical oxidation now. This is not a filter like a HEPA filter  HEPA filters just trap particles  They only trap big particles a lot of the little particles go right through  Many of the worst particles go right through a HEPA filter pico doesn't just trap it it destroys it  No matter the size of the room you choose the option that's best for you  Whether it's the full-size molecule air on the left we use that or this new molecule air mini for smaller rooms  The way it works. It's got a filter on it. And then it's got this pico technology  That it's I don't it's hard to describe you can see it on the web page  It's it's I kind of like a catalytic converter. It captures  Things that are too small for a filter they go right through a HEPA filter mold, you know black molds  Terrible for you viruses even bacteria even volatile organic compounds like formaldehyde  It's off gassing from your carpets and drapes or the paint  fumes coming off your freshly painted  Room those things are very bad for you go right through a HEPA filter the pico not only captures it it destroys it  It just breaks it down into basic harmless components. This is a remarkable  Technology and you've got to try it. I am a huge fan of the molecule  You will be too once you start using it. You'll realize you can't live without it  Frankly 10% off your first air purifier whether it's the molecule air or the molecule mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So on the one hand the notion of high-speed internet no matter where I am for me  This would be amazing because I could work in Rome right I could do the show anywhere I am. Yep  So I love that idea on the other hand astronomers are starting to get very upset  In fact, I just read an article by an astronomer who said one of the problems with Starlink  I mean just imagine having these this is just Starlink 30,000 satellites  Doubling the number of low-earth orbit satellites and by the way, they're low-earth orbit. So they're very bright. They're close  That's what they have to be to do, you know, it's the same thing that makes it fast internet makes it terrible for astronomers  Yeah  An astronomer was talking about this. He said we do satellite we do images of distant galaxies with long exposures and  Even now it's already a problem. You'll get a satellite trail. It'll destroy it  So I do many images because most of the time one of them will be clear, you know  It's a five-minute exposure. No satellite went through it  He said once you've got Starlink in the air, there will be no time you could do a long exposure  There will always be satellite trails in every image. I do. Yeah

Start time: 6135.74
End time: 6152.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is the other side of this argument though is that we were gonna get to this point  Anyways, Elon is accelerating the point which we reach this  Saturation point of satellites, but like we were gonna keep launching these things. Anyways, I don't care screw astronomers  I want high-speed internet everywhere. I respect astronomy. I think it's very important, but I'm just saying

Start time: 6152.76
End time: 6163.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Yeah, one of the things I'm confused about is that multiple billionaires have have suggested this idea  Tell me if any of you  Remember the brand name teledesic. Yes  Bill Gates said I'm gonna put put billions of orbit. We're gonna have blanket. This is what happens to it  That's my question. Exactly. It's sort of like this is the future it was happening  Maybe so and then there were a few others intermediate remember iridium, which was the low-earth orbit satellite phone

Transcript:  Well, he's this is his second launch of 60. So I mean they're going up  There's only right now three thousand active certain satellites orbiting Earth. He's gonna launch 30. I was gonna say it's more than so  It's a thousand times more. Yeah, so a thousand percent more so

Start time: 6245.34
End time: 6278.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference though between the  Tele desic and iridium and so forth is now actually thanks to SpaceX and the ability to have lower cost more frequent space launches  This tech is now more possible and also, you know, the technology itself has gotten better satellites can be better and smaller  It may not work this time  But if it doesn't work this time it will work the next time and that's really exciting  Imagine a world where you can actually go anywhere and have functional internet  Yeah, I could live in Montana by a river with an elk and work from there  You can't now because it's gonna be DSL.

I think

Start time: 6308.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The International Telecommunications Union is is has been asked to approve another another 30,000  They are going to do  24 launches in total to get global coverage  After they do those 24 every launch adds capacity, right?  So the 24 will launch enough to get the entire earth covered. I think this is I don't know  I don't know what to say. I feel bad for astronomers, but wow, I'm optimistic and I'm excited

Transcript:  furthermore  In addition and the web and but in addition you'd also have the issue of if you have too many satellites  You can't launch any more satellites because you've got you'll hit something and a minute you hit something  You really got the Kessler effect and you got a real problem. What's the Kessler effect?  That's when you hit a  Satellite it breaks up and its little  Breaked up particles hit another one and another one and another one's a cascade and pretty soon you have a dome of cast of satellite  Shards blocking all sunlight from the earth ending the world as we know it trash  Your mic is off.

Transcript:  so last week we had a couple of guys from NASA in here they drive a  plane that flies at 60,000 feet right at the edge of the atmosphere and they do it because they take pictures of  incoming space flights and and then he also sometimes drives the jet to Kazakhstan  Because it turns out now if you want to be an astronaut  The so the former Soviet Union has to launch you because we don't do anymore  Humans in space port is in Kazakhstan. Yep. Yep  So they send a an executive jet to kagasa sign to get the astronauts back home when you go up to the space station  I didn't know you flew private as a well on the ground. You know what these guys they're coming back from six months in space  Did you see and this is a cause for concern as long as we're talking space?  They I didn't know this but they have the astronauts do  It's ultrasound while they're in space on their blood vessels to see if there's clots or any problems and a number of astronauts  Have they've now discovered?  Pooling blood and blood they're not clots, but kind of like clots because of their long time in space  These are astronauts were completely healthy on earth went up into space and because of the lack of gravity  There are they're seeing some circulatory issues. Fortunately, they recovered when they came back from space  They recovered when they came back to planet Earth, but it does cause

Transcript:  Let's talk about the ring video camera, I think this is a really interesting story so  I  Keele O'Neill I didn't know this is a part owner of ring Amazon bought it and he does their ads  Mm-hmm. I think he's a part owner because they probably had to give him a lot of stock just to get him to do the ads  I don't know. I'm just guessing here, but the EFF has issued a challenge to Shaq  saying we need you to come and debate our  security experts because we believe that rings deals with local police departments are in effect creating an ad hoc  Surveillance network through towns across the United States  Yeah, and these deals that ring an Amazon company makes with local police departments are generally  NDA the police department can't tell you they get a sweetheart deal on the cameras  but more importantly, we're just now learning this they also get the video from the cameras and  We've just learned in a testimony. It's it's Ron Wyden  Is it run Wyden or?  It's Ed Markey of Massachusetts who is who has been very active in this trying to  Get to the bottom of this but apparently  600 police forces have partnerships with ring  630 now and allows them to keep the video forever. Yeah and share it with whomever they want and

Start time: 6610.94
End time: 6647.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have two perspectives on this that I think are not  fully appreciated one of them is that  If the if the video captures only the the owner of the ring video doorbells property and  Then they choose to share it with the police. I have no problem with that  Yeah, I think that's fine most ring video door many ring video doorbells  Not only do the property but the sidewalk and the street to get the street outside front and there's really what there  The ideal scenario is somebody robs a bank and then they take off into some residential neighborhood and the police can go and say  Hey, you know want to see

Start time: 6649.22
End time: 6658.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  So I have I had a ring for a long time. Yeah, I replaced it with something even worse  Which is which is Google's hello doorbells  And the only reason the reason I replaced it is the reason it's worse  It has face recognition, right?

They have cameras everywhere  Yeah, you you you you know cannot walk through a fog bank without being videotaped  and or recorded I guess I have tape anymore and  And the problem is is that crimes not only still occur  They're always gonna occur but they the the law enforcement there have not been successful in  Catching people who perpetrate crimes even with all this additional video. It is a deluge of information  It is too much information. It is not being used to actually protect people. It is not being used to prosecute criminals and  Ultimately, it serves no purpose other than to flood law enforcement with stuff that they don't know how to handle anyway

It can recognize you there may be one or two  Rare edge cases where it can be fooled  But overall it's a safer way to log into your phone that or unlock your phone  Then touch ID when touch ID was years ahead of everything else that was available when it came out, right?  But the the number of failures and false positives with face ID are something like one in some very large number  It's it's remarkably effective. What I worry is that people don't understand how facial recognition is being used  outside of personal application and when you start using it in things like like  law enforcement law enforcement historically has terrible terrible  Use of technology for tracking people especially when they're not allowed to and yet they cannot use or have not yet been able to use  This technology in most cases to solve crimes that we know have been committed and along those lines

Transcript:  Well, and and if they don't charge you you're getting convicted because the judge is to say well, you know  Yeah, but but but back to the ring video doorbell thing  The problem is that the police aren't just getting access to all the ring video doorbells. Let's be very very clear about that  They have the right to ask permission and there's a system that Amazon is has created  Where people can grant permission and then the police can so who's to say?  if for let me just do a  I would have the Petaluma police access to my video exactly. I trust them right and so who's to say that you?  Shouldn't be allowed to do that. I mean, that's really the question that's so vexing about this who who can say?  No, no Leo has video of a possible criminal

Start time: 7263.98
End time: 7313.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a fallacy there. It's not that Amazon isn't trustworthy  That's that none of these companies none of these corporations are trustworthy because they are not beholden to any of the consumers who buy their products  They are beholden to their shareholders  Even in the shack or a shack  Right and and and and I think and I just I think it's a very very bad idea legally for  for privacy reasons for security reasons even to say that a  Company can determine whether a camera gives all of its data to the law enforcement  If it's you Leo, and you want to do that that's between you and your neighbors and your and your neighbors may not like that  but for  for a company to decide that is  Is I think is a really dangerous position to be in well, I think it's a little bit more

Start time: 7314.56
End time: 7375.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Weird than that because essentially they're not  Sharing people's videos that the people don't agree to but you know that Amazon has all the videos  They don't talk about that stuff  They're super secretive about the information they harvested ever since I did a deep dive on this when they had the fire phone remember the failed  fire  Every time you in order to harvest anything to take a picture to record audio you pushed a single button  And when you did that it recorded everything the camera went on the microphone went on every record  So if you were gonna and it all got sent to Amazon exactly  So if you were taking a picture of this glass and you're like, I'm gonna see if it can recognize this glass the audio  Which you were not thinking about went to Amazon and there's what and when asked what do you do with that?  They said no comment and so data baby data  Gold  Handsets, so I'm not concerned that the police has has access to video from Leo's doorbell with Leo's permission  I'm concerned that Amazon has that video without all the face recognition from my hello doorbell.

Transcript:  Well, here's why everybody should be super happy about this because it appears that  PayPal is getting really serious about directly going after Amazon. So right now  We all use Amazon or I'll just speak for myself  I use Amazon even though I'm not crazy about the company simply because I know their delivery is super fast and solid  They have my credit card. I know they have everything. I like the ratings  I like the everything about it. It just it gets me the product  I want when I want it and I can rely on it  And so they're starting to chip away at what Amazon does and one of them is this pricing thing  So on Amazon you can go and you can price compare multiple things  You can say give me the cheapest one whatever and their prices are very good  so what they're doing is they're going to extend that not even not just for  Whatever partner companies they work with but across the web so that they want I think they're getting to the point where  They will just give you an Amazon like experience that will cross the internet where you get the cheapest price you get discounts  they're gonna work on shipping they do apparently want the technology but

Transcript:  of honey's complementary it just tells you now I did a little math actually one of our audience members did a little math at  17 million active monthly active users and by the way  That's underestimating the data they're getting because you don't have to be active at all  If you just got honey installed you're giving them the same volume of data. So we don't know how many people have it installed  But let's say it's 17 million divided 4 billion divided by 17 million means each and every one of you is worth  $250 to PayPal and and honestly, I  Think it's worth that you're worth even more than that and it's not  To drive engagement and play a more meaningful role in the daily lives of our consumers  It's data about you that they're gathering  You get something it's not I mean the good news is it is a fair trade because you're getting as long as they tell you  What they're doing with it  But I have to think the real value of this the hundred million dollars a year or more is coming from selling that data

They're gonna start doing commerce where the people who play ball with PayPal  Companies get this information get the information and this is the this is the virtual model that's gonna take on Amazon  Somebody has to take on Amazon. So I guess I'm a little desperate for competition against oh, I agree  But but I think that they're it's the Amazon playbook in a way  One of the first thing is you get all the data on all the consumer behavior, right?

So I think this is a great idea  It's an iOS app do not pay  This was a robot lawyer service that was used I think in the UK primarily to contest parking tickets  Even sue people now. They're launching a new tool do not sign  Now you'll get this you have to pay three dollars a month for the do not pay subscription fee  You can upload scan or copy and paste the URLs of any license agreement  The service will use machine learning to highlight the clauses it thinks are problematic  Including options to opt out from data collection  It is you can either get the do not pay app on iOS or get it on the website  Here's what you the kind of a this is from the verge a display of what it looks like  I think that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boomer's brought on Star Wars and climate change. Yeah finally last story, but I like to end on a high note  Prosecutors this is fifth the fifth amendment to the US Constitution  Pennsylvania Supreme Court four to three ruling  said that now admittedly  The perpetrator was a child pornographer the police knew that his hard drive contained troves of child pornography  It was encrypted with a 64 character password. He said I'm not giving it to you  The lower court said well, this is what they the doctrine is foregone conclusion  Because the police knew what was on the hard drive the lower court said it's okay to demand that 64 character password  It was appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court now admittedly the child pornographer bad guy  But I think it's an important ruling for all of us the the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said no  People cannot be forced to turn over pass because the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination based on this is the this is the  majority  Opinion by Justice Deborah Todd based upon these cases rendered by the US Supreme Court  Regarding the scope of the fifth amendment we conclude compelling the disclosure of a password to a computer  that is the act of production is  Testimonial to still do its evidence or essence the revealing of a computer password is a verbal communication not merely a physical act  That would be non testimonial in nature. That's why for instance police can draw blood take DNA take a handwriting sample  Take a take a voice print. That's a physical manifestation  Manifestation as a passcode is necessarily memorized  One cannot reveal a passcode without revealing the contents of one's mind. This is the important doctrine  Indeed a password to a computer is by its nature intentionally personalized and so unique as to accomplish its intended purpose  Keeping information contained therein confidential and insulated from discovery here under United States Supreme Court President  We find the Commonwealth is seeking the electronic equivalent to the combination of a wall safe the passcode to unlock appellants computer  The Commonwealth is seeking the password not as an end but as a pathway to the files withheld as such  Compelled production of the computer password demands the recall of the contents of appellates mind  And the act of production carries with it the implied factual assertion that will be used to incriminate them thus we hold  The comp that compelling the appellant to reveal a password is  Testimonial nature in other words, he's testifying against himself. So there's two really important threads here

Start time: 9045.36
End time: 9122.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that that have to be pointed out one is that as we move towards a world where devices are unlocked biometrically  We do not at least in the United States have legal protections for using biometrics to lock our devices  That's physical that's not changing slowly in some lower very lower court cases has not yet filtered its way up to the Supreme Court  level  There's not good historic precedent for this  If it's physical if it's your fingerprint if it's your face if you're using facial face ID  You at this point can be compelled to use that to unlock your device  The other thread that I think is really important here is that is the is the horrific child pornography thread, right?  This stuff is abhorrent. I have no words  I can use on air to describe what I want to see happen to these people who  perpetrate this stuff  however  Child pornography is being used as the latest excuse for opening up back doors in encryption, right?  And we've seen that once you have a back door and encryption the only people who use it are people who you don't want using  it, so  This is this is I'm glad to see that that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court

Start time: 9123.50
End time: 9150.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chose a rational pathway here and and terrorism is the other excuse that they use but it's always that  Consider the women terrorism. It's always one of these but but people have to understand that this does not mean that this  Child pornography can't be arrested convicted. There's plenty of other ways to get it  It's a price we have to pay for the Fourth Amendment, which is a super valuable and it's just keep it fifth amendment  Yeah, I'm in here. Yes all the amendments, but this matters a lot for cryptocurrency guys

Start time: 9150.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are similar decisions in front of other state Supreme Court's including Indiana  But it this I think in I don't know if Pennsylvania appealed to the Supreme Court the US Supreme Court  But it's not really a precedent till the US Supreme Court says it then nation. Yeah, it's a proto precedent  So they're likely to uphold it a many the good news is for a while  It was kind of up in the air and because there had been some adverse court decisions  But now I think it's pretty much the case that everybody agrees your password is part of your mind  You can't testify against yourself
