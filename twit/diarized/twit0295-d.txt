Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little later on, Robert's going to start a new feature on Twitter.  News of next week.  No, seriously, Robert wants to do that.  All right. Like stuff people will be talking about next week.  I'd like that. I got a few.

Start time: 254.42
End time: 262.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I got a few things that we were talking during the pre-show about these new  3D cameras that are coming out tomorrow.  And I got some iPad apps.

Start time: 262.28
End time: 280.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually got a little bit of a discussion over 3D because I'm of the opinion.  It's a gimmick. I just don't understand why why people are still making 3D stuff.  I don't think anybody's going to end up buying it.  Consumers are going to be upset that they fell for this scam.  But then you, Brian, you like the idea of 3D, at least in terms of  movies in the theater.

Start time: 280.86
End time: 286.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes. Well, don't hate the idea for the implementation.  Certainly we have a very crude implementation of 3D right now.

Start time: 286.30
End time: 288.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have the same crude implementation we had in 1956 with House of Wax.

Start time: 289.88
End time: 309.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We do and don't. But when you get to, for example, you know,  James Cameron created the entire entire real 3D  company so that he could tell the kind of stories he wanted to tell.  And he made big changes as far as the circular polarized lenses.  He can tell your head left to right.  And he's getting ready to make more announcements saying that Avatar 2  is going to be in more than 24 frames per second, which we have.

Start time: 309.32
End time: 315.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does that mean? I mean, that's what film is.  So it means he's shooting it like video style.

Start time: 315.38
End time: 386.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But no, he's talking about 48 or maybe even 60 frames per second.  And now the advantage.  Well, Roger Ebert wrote a giant article trashing 3D saying,  I hate the fact that we're spending all our time focusing on 3D.  I think like you, he says, I think it's a gimmick.  He says, you know, a decade ago, I saw film shot in 60 frames per second.  And that was magical. That was like a window into another world.  Now, if James Cameron, who is a big believer in 3D, also seems to agree  and says, let's also take it to 60 frames per second, that's going to be a win.  And I think I think this is the equivalent of it's a good idea  with rough implementation.  And as each successive generation gets better and better and better,  there'll be a time when all of a sudden 3D won't be a joke.  Now, let me state unequivocally, I love 3D in the theater.  I hate 3D in the home right now. I think it is gimmicky.  I think it does induce nausea.  I think the the glasses are horribly overpriced.  And, you know, of course, there are some with the passive lenses now,  and they are dimmer.  But it's a step in the right direction.  And I'm not I have no problem with 3D as a motivating force  to get us to develop new technologies.  Did you see did you see there was one YouTube video somebody released  of them using multiple projectors to create a floating hover,  hovering 3D image in the fog that you could see from different sides  as you walked around it. You guys see that?

Start time: 387.18
End time: 400.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't seen that.  We've seen sort of holographic projectors in one form or another ever since Star Wars.  But it just doesn't. And there's multiple technologies for it.  It's just what's the practical application?  Why do we need this?  Why is the industry shoving this down our throat?

Start time: 400.26
End time: 401.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, to sell more TVs. Right.

Start time: 401.74
End time: 405.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And but is there an and you know, the irony was the movie industry started it

Start time: 405.50
End time: 414.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because they wanted to give us something we couldn't get at home. Right.  Because they wanted people to keep going to theaters.  Then the TV industry responded by, OK, we'll make those two.

Start time: 415.50
End time: 435.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And that's the hard thing.  It's like it's a rough position I'm trying to defend because I am in favor  of a novel, awesome experience at the theater, which 3D could be a part of.  But I am not in favor of the commercialization  and the way people are telling you, you got to buy a 3D TV.  Do not buy a 3D TV right now.  If you want to get into 3D now is not the time.  And of course, you don't have the choice. Here I am.

Start time: 435.38
End time: 437.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just bought a new TV and chose not.

Start time: 437.54
End time: 446.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here I am arguing for a 3D TV because most of the best TVs  from every manufacturer have 3D capability. You may not use it.  But if you're going to get the top of the line plan.

Start time: 446.22
End time: 476.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, what what we were talking about before the show started  was these new cameras are going to get hooked together  and you're going to be able to film 3D at home and put it up on YouTube.  And I didn't even know this until I visited this company on Friday.  But YouTube, if you put the video side by side of the left and right eye,  it actually lets you watch 3D on YouTube and it lets you choose  the kind of glasses or TV set that you have.  It senses that there's these 3D videos that you're putting up  and lets you switch them. It's really smart.

Start time: 477.06
End time: 483.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we saw the Sony blog you come out at CES,  which had the same 3D capability.  It didn't come out. It was announced.

Start time: 484.10
End time: 499.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They talked about it.  They don't know when they're going to ship that sucker.  Yeah. This is the.  Well, you know, it came out this week.  Let's talk about real stuff.  Let's talk about this week in this week.  And the Nintendo 3DS.  They say, why are you saying I saw it?

Start time: 500.08
End time: 501.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw it. Not not impressive.

Start time: 502.18
End time: 518.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? It's got a little slider.  And I think this is the best thing.  And I wish all 3D devices had this.  You could turn down the 3D or turn it up.  It's OK. Stuff jumps out at you.  It's kind of interesting.  It almost feels. And it's glasses free.  Yes, glasses. It's lenticular,  which means you have to hold your head  just in the right position.

Start time: 518.64
End time: 526.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But with a single viewing screen, that's not hard.  It's easy with that kind of thing.  Yeah. And you've got total control over it.  And it's moving according to your head.  So that's not a big deal.

Start time: 526.32
End time: 532.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting how the reviews range from a game changer to  they sold 113,000 of them in the UK.

Start time: 534.62
End time: 539.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, if there's ever a demographic  that this is ripe for, it's going to be the children  who are buying the 3D.

Start time: 539.60
End time: 548.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, my nine year old nephew, my, well, I consider him a nephew.  He's like a godchild. But anyways, that's not important.  He's a sucker. He's a sucker.  He's been playing it.

Start time: 548.40
End time: 552.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's being suckered by Nintendo, who's convincing him  he needs to buy this thing.

Start time: 552.60
End time: 558.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He is getting a novel experience in a low definition format,  which is exactly what nine year olds want.

Start time: 558.28
End time: 578.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a toy. It's not only that, but in Petaluma High School,  Patrick says the Nintendo is white hot right now.  The 3DS or the old 3D? The old one.  But, you know, they haven't even seen the 3D.  But if that holds true,  the 3D is going to be used in high school as well.  But they use it for chatting back and forth and playing games with each other.  Really? That's interesting.

Start time: 578.04
End time: 586.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if it's because the the the Nintendos aren't banned  the way the cell phones are.  I think it's exactly what it is.  Or in the high school.  Ban is less expensive.

Start time: 586.30
End time: 592.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a feeling they're banned. Petaluma doesn't ban cell phones.  They don't?  No, he takes his iPhone every day to school.

Start time: 593.78
End time: 594.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My kid takes his to school.

Start time: 594.90
End time: 596.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends on the age. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 597.76
End time: 603.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't keep kids from bringing  cell phones because parents get pissed off because they can't call their kids.

Start time: 604.96
End time: 616.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  By the way, somebody told me some research  that six year olds are getting cell phones now, especially in divorced families,  because that way they don't have to talk to the other parent to get to the kid.  They can just call the kids. Oh, geez.

Start time: 617.20
End time: 622.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's brilliant. I'm down for that.  As a parent of a seven year old, I would totally, if I just had extra money  laying around, hook her up with a cell phone.

Start time: 623.60
End time: 629.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not. There are kids cell phones.  I gave Henry a kid cell phone.  He promptly left it in his pocket and made sure it got washed.

Start time: 630.48
End time: 655.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness. We're getting out in the weeds here.  But a friend of mine's child is also seven, like my own.  And he came to me with his iPad the other day and said,  Hey, my dad said I could download Skype.  Can you help me set it up? And I said, OK.  So I set him up on Skype. And oh, what a disaster.  I mean, all of a sudden, this kid has a cell phone in his hand  where he otherwise wouldn't be allowed to have one. Interesting.  Yeah, I got in trouble.

Start time: 656.90
End time: 674.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put chat roulette on the friends.  Oh, no, I didn't.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Although that's what people are saying, that color application  is just basically a chat roulette with strangers.  Have you seen it? Can we talk about color?  Yeah, this is the one that that came out last week. Hold on.

Start time: 674.74
End time: 677.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Robert's pulling himself together.

Start time: 678.52
End time: 683.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, we're not in the same room, so it won't work.  You're 116 kilometers away, so color won't work.

Start time: 683.04
End time: 686.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's OK. Even when we are the same room, nobody watches it.

Start time: 686.60
End time: 706.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, it's an iPhone app that you take pictures with  and it shows you pictures that other people in your vicinity  have taken pictures. I think it uses the Wi-Fi or the Bluetooth.  I'm not sure which. Maybe it uses 3G.  And so it's strangers.  The problem is, most of the time, nobody else is using it.  So it's just you.

Start time: 706.46
End time: 714.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was driving through Silicon Valley yesterday, trying it and not  did not get one single hit.  And I mean, obviously, it's new, but no, it's just it.

Start time: 714.40
End time: 719.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the thing that reason incenses people is because they raised  forty one million dollars.

Start time: 719.34
End time: 772.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, here I actually interviewed them on Thursday and I'm curious  what you think how it works.  It has to be in the same room almost as somebody else who's using color.  It uses the compass to know where your camera is shooting.  It actually is listening to the audio.  It's not recording audio, but it's recording a fingerprint  of the audio signature of the room.  What you can tell.  Yeah, here's here's why they're doing that.  He says what what we're trying to do is make it possible for a lot of people  to go to, let's say, a Lady Gaga concert and all be shooting pictures.  We'll know where the performer is because everybody's aiming at the same place.  And we're listening to the audio signature of the room to join everybody  into one color space.  And they'll they expect to be able to show you live  the closest picture that's being taken of that event.  So somebody's in the front row.  The big people in the back row will see pictures that the front row is shooting.

Start time: 774.06
End time: 798.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of the argument that that is all a red herring  and that really the reason they got forty one million dollars  is because they figured out a way to collect all sorts of info.  It really scares me. They got the mic on all sorts of information  about their users, which they'll be able to sell.  I mean, it's there's no there's no there's no sense in the forty one million dollars  unless you assume they're up to something clever.

Start time: 799.16
End time: 841.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They we talked about that a lot.  They got their money for a couple of reasons.  One, that it's a superstar team.  And remember, friend feed for fifty million dollars.  Yeah, you know, the guys who started color started Lala.  It's a superstar team.  They built already a good team.  And that got them a call from Sequoia. Sequoia came to them, actually.  But they are building a new kind of social graph.  If I actually am in the room with you and shooting pictures,  it joins us.  It knows that we have something in common at that point in time.  And then from then on, in fact, on my phone, you can see other people  who've shot pictures.  These are so people have collected by going around Silicon Valley  and going to various parties and things.

Start time: 841.12
End time: 845.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it's it's a little bit out of focus to us, but I'm assuming  those are all half naked people.

Start time: 846.46
End time: 849.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of like photos, other people, babies.

Start time: 850.48
End time: 885.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to tell you, I as soon as I thought about it for half a minute,  I erased color immediately.  And I would recommend anybody who listens to the show immediately  erase that program. Nobody under 25 will hear that advice.  That's like because this there's a now that I know that it's also doing  sound analysis, that really creeps me out.  And this is a real flaw in Apple's permissions system.  At no point were we informed that this program was turning on the microphone.  I don't care if they say they're not using it.  They're turning on the microphone on my phone.  And they never told me that.  That's bad news.  Well, I told you on my show on.

Start time: 885.14
End time: 912.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They didn't tell me that when I downloaded the Grey's Anatomy  iPad out, it listens to you to it, listens to the TV to figure out  where it is in the show so that it can sync its simulcast of iPad  information to where you are in the show.  That's kind of cool, actually.  I mean, I kind of like that.  Well, I mean, I used it once.  It didn't like speak to me, but it has the same functionality.  It's basically using it as a geolocator, a triangulator.  In this case, that's interesting.

Start time: 912.82
End time: 929.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but again, this strikes me as something really wrong with the iPhone  that the only people who know this and can give permission are Apple themselves.  They decide presumably they know.  But there's nowhere when you download this app that it tells you,  oh, by the way, we're going to turn on the microphone.

Start time: 930.00
End time: 950.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is the flip side of the curated garden  that they have at Apple versus the Android free range market.  I would love to see.  The big debate is, of course, you know, Android's a crappier web store than  than iTunes is, but I prefer to think of Android as a shopping mall  where there could be a whole bunch of individual curated store experiences.

Start time: 950.98
End time: 960.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm as Amazon is in fact shown exactly on Android as well.  Yeah, you know, and I'm actually going to download it now and see if it tells me  that the microphone is turned on.  Do they turn it on in the Android phone as well?

Start time: 961.32
End time: 985.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, they're using all the sensors in the device to make a new kind of experience.  Well, presumably, I mean, one of the paranoid because, you know,  first of all, no one's using this.  Second of all, once you start seeing how it's working,  you're realizing it's studying stuff about you that you might not have thought  about before. It's doing stuff that Instagram or Pic, please, is not doing.  The first thing it does is ask you.

Start time: 986.10
End time: 992.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that? The first thing it does is ask you for your name and a picture.  It doesn't tell you what it's going to do with any of it.  I'm not crazy about the whole thing.

Start time: 993.32
End time: 996.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think the bigger question is, is the premise good enough?

Start time: 996.74
End time: 1004.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not all the that's the other issue is not there.  But that's why I think that there's more to this than meets the eye.  Otherwise, what's the business model?

And that's why I got rated two stars in this in the store,  because if you're not with somebody else, it doesn't do anything for.  And also, the UI is goofy.  And the guys who started it admit they really blew the UI.  They tried to make it too simplistic.  And it's just too hard to figure out.

So whereas Google gets these biannual reviews now as the result of Buzz,  there's really nothing to clamp in on as they're having done something wrong here  because the law is still in such flux as to what mobile applications have to do.

Transcript:  It's not the only app that uses the microphone.  Shopkick uses the microphone to know whether you've entered the store.  You turn on Shopkick and it's actually listening for an inaudible signal  that they put in the front of, let's say, Macy's.  So they have a speaker in front of inside Macy's that when you take your iPhone  inside Macy's inside the front door, it senses the audio signal that's inside  and gives you points for entering the store.  And that's one.  The other app that uses the microphone is into now,  which does what Denise says.  It listens to your TV programs that you're that you're actually watching.  Yeah. Yeah.  And this is a new new app coming out of a company in Palo Alto.  And it listens to the TV signal they've been for five years.  They've been recording one hundred forty eight channels of TV.  So CNN, ABC, NBC, Discovery Channel, et cetera.  And they have a way for it to look at the audio footprint of any minute of TV  or any 12 seconds of TV and tell you what you're watching,  where where in the show you're actually watching.  And that's pretty interesting.  And then it shares that.  So it checks you into the TV show like Foursquare does and builds a feed.  So you can see a feed here of all my friends and what they're actually watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right. Correct. The government has nothing to do with this.  This is this is to be honest, I think in the free marketplace of ideas,  what happens is, is somebody has an unfair policy and it's an individual business  that that is too intrusive.  A show like this talks about it, word spreads around the campfire.  And either people decide they don't care and they accept it, in which case that's  that's fair, too. Or they decide that's not cool and color has to change it or they  go out of business.

They're not listening to audio.  There's no audio file being transmitted up to their service.  But they're they're recording the waveform of the audio and building a fingerprint out of it.  And that's sort of how this new into now app works.  They actually didn't record the audio of the TV shows.  They recorded some sort of.  I understand they're fingerprinted.

If you want to be worried, you should be worried about the stuff that's  in the Patriot Act that's already been on your phone and start listening  into conversations randomly.

I mean, for them to have come to this accommodation with the FTC, as opposed  to some more severe, you know, a two year biannual review is not it's not that big  a deal, you know, presumably they should be able to pass that with flying colors.  And what what they got in trouble for was  breaching their privacy policy, right.  So, you know, all that's going to be reviewed is their policies.  And are you complying with them?

In fact, business travel, as we all know, is just lately worse and worse.  It's no fun. It's stressful.  And of course, it's hugely expensive.  You could just kill your profits.  But you do have to meet with people.  That's why we revert resorts to the conference call.  But come on, a conference call.  You know they're out there, you know, playing with their Facebook  while they're listening to you.  That's why GoToMeeting is so great.  When you hold your meetings online, they're more compelling, more exciting,  more interesting. In fact, I use GoToMeeting.  Even if it's just going to be a conference call, it's so easy to set up.  I click a link.  It puts an email out to everybody, sending, giving them all that information.  By the way, this includes the conference bridge.  So you get a phone number, you know, the meeting code and all that.  That's part of the... it's built in free.  So it sends that all out to them. They call in.  If they don't have the GoToMeeting software installed, it takes 30 seconds.  They've got it installed. It's secure.  And then, by the way, if you decide to show them something, you can.  Because they've got the window open.  They don't even have to make a phone call.  They have the choice in the GoToMeeting software.  It says, would you like to call this number or just press this button?  We'll use your mic and speakers.  If you've got an iPad, it works so... they ask permission.  What are you laughing at?

It is such great software.  128-bit SSL.

Transcript:  All right. Let me move on to Amazon, which this week made a big play.  They basically said, yeah, we are here, baby.  Bring it. Bring it.  So maybe, Becky, you can give us a summary of what Amazon announced.

Start time: 2037.94
End time: 2046.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 2071.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's weird because it's a buck a gigabyte.  You can go up to a terabyte, but it's a thousand dollars, which is ridiculous.  What? You can download music.  Everything you buy on Amazon, all the music you buy on Amazon doesn't count against your total.  All right. So basically, they're saying, hey, forget that iTunes thing.

Start time: 2071.44
End time: 2101.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can stream it on your Android device.  They have an app for that.  You can download it to as many computers as you want.  I called Amazon for clarification on that because I thought, oh, well, the download, that's kind of crazy.  That's the big thing that Apple has that five authorized devices.  And they said, no, no, as many devices as it's unprotected.  Yeah. So this is is this the solution for multiple devices?  Music everywhere. You know, there's one limit.

Transcript:  I think it's pretty clear that Apple has planned to announce exactly this.  They bought Lala, which does this.  They have built this ginormous operations network  operations center in North Carolina.  I think they were going to do this.  And I think Amazon jumped their announcement.

Start time: 2187.98

Start time: 2210.24
End time: 2234.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and when Amazon was asked about the issue of licenses,  because obviously, if Amazon is just going to offer this service,  then why is Google wasting their time trying to put together their music service?  We're looking for licenses.  Same thing for Sony.  According to Amazon, quote,  we do not need a license to store music in a cloud drive.  The functionality of saving MP3s to cloud drive is the same as if a customer were  to save their own music to an external hard drive or even iTunes.  Hey, big two different.

Start time: 2234.98
End time: 2253.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Here's a different way to look at it.  I showed my son this and I said, isn't this cool?  You can upload all your music.  It's like, Dad, we listen to Pandora in high school now.  It doesn't matter that you can upload your audio and your music to some place.  You just go to Pandora and type in your artist name and there's a difference.

Start time: 2254.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. And Amazon has stepped into this legal morass that's been going on.  Did you guys see the Hulu April Fools joke where they put you back to the late 90s?  So they stepped right back into that time zone when they decided to do this.  Because Michael Robertson, who Leo, you should have MP3.com.

Start time: 2299.82
End time: 2330.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a really interesting fellow.  And he's been at this since the late 90s when his first company,  MP3.com, got sued into non-existence with the then largest copyright  verdict ever awarded hundreds of millions of dollars, which has been blown past now.  But anyway, they they were trying to do this.  What seems like a totally commonsensical thing that, you know, you've bought it.  You should be able to time and place and device shift it to your heart's content.  But the content industry has never bought into this.

Start time: 2330.94
End time: 2341.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as Robertson points out, the law has nothing to do with commonsensical.  It's the law, whatever the law is.  But have we do we have a law? Do we have?  Is there ever been any decision on this?

Start time: 2342.78
End time: 2414.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There has there have been decisions along the way that are sort of incremental.  And I've seen the Wall Street Journal and other people say, oh, well,  the fact that the Supreme Court didn't step into the cable vision decision,  which came out a while ago, you guys probably remember in 2009,  the Supreme Court decided we're not going to touch that cable vision.  If they have these remote DVR facilities, we're going to let that happen,  because really, it's just it's not it's the users  making a copy on their own local space, which we know they can do  under the Betamax decision from so long ago.  And, you know, all that cable vision is doing is providing  some sort of remote backup of that.  And it's really just the users making the copies.  This is a little different, right?  I mean, we've been talking about here. You have a locker.  You have a drive where you can upload stuff that you have downloaded from Amazon.  You can upload whatever's on your computer.  It's like when you first open iTunes and it does a scan and it says,  can we see what MP3s you have and we'll add it to the iTunes library.  It's the same thing. They're going to add it to the Amazon's.  And now it comes and makes sense.

Start time: 2415.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just Dropbox. What's the big deal?

Start time: 2416.96
End time: 2452.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and as I understand it, part of the reason that they shut down MP3.com  because it was a very sensible thing.  This is a time when a lot of people were still on dial up.  And they said, you know, we've talked about this before.  But instead of actually uploading and encoding your CD and spending hours to upload it,  why don't you just put it in?  We'll look at the Red Book audio tag on there.  Like, oh, you've got that disk when I have access to those.  Part of the problem, as I remember it, it's been over a decade now, was just like,  yeah, but but you are that's not theirs.  They did not encode it. You did not upload it.  You're just giving them your files and that's illegal.  Whereas this is different.  This is a case where it really is grabbing the files and uploading them.  Is that correct? Or is that the distinction that makes us OK?

Start time: 2453.96
End time: 2467.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because the users, you have to remember that the whole digital music arena  is governed by the licenses that apply when you download those things,  unless you've gotten them off of some P2P file sharing service. Right.

Start time: 2467.60
End time: 2468.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then I'm in the clear.

Start time: 2470.96
End time: 2481.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you've gotten them legally, then you're hemmed in by all the licensing  around that file. If you've gotten them illegally, well, then, you know,  you're already a thief. Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 2481.84
End time: 2484.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what did the licenses say? Do they say you can't do this?

Start time: 2485.14
End time: 2542.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the fascinating thing.  Amazon and I was really thrilled to look into this and see  that Amazon has gone out on a limb with its own MP3 download service.  It's telling people and for everyone listening to this show,  you're all going to say, duh, well, of course we can do this.  But the law doesn't agree with you necessarily.  And the entertainment industry certainly doesn't agree that you can copy, store,  transfer and burn for personal entertainment, noncommercial use,  everything that you download from something like Amazon's MP3 music service  or iTunes. iTunes has very different terms, by the way.  They don't tell you that you can copy, store, transfer and burn,  but Amazon does, which I thought was really interesting.  These terms of service aren't that old.  They might have been drafted with this kind of service in mind that, yeah,  we're going to go ahead and let people start transferring and storing them.

Transcript:  Denise, you live down there with the music industry.  Are they changing their stance because of the proliferation of these  streaming services now? Because Spotify over in Europe,  you just type in a song name and it starts playing.

End time: 2565.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They know that's where the world is moving and I think they're starting to change  their... If I was in the music industry, I would start changing my legal  stance on this stuff because I know kids of the future, kids of today,  are streaming. They're not downloading anymore.  They're not... My son is not stealing music.

Start time: 2586.47
End time: 2600.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of these services like Rdio, Mog, and I think Spotify,  I haven't used it because it's in Europe only, allow you to download copies  to your device, don't they?  They are local copies.  You just have to validate that you have a license for it once a month  because you have to keep paying the 10 bucks a month.

Start time: 2600.90
End time: 2602.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's true if you're paying the 10 bucks.

Start time: 2602.76
End time: 2624.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so in other words, you do have a physical copy on...  Well, I don't know if that's physical, but you have a copy on your device.  You know, it strikes me that Apple actually knew what it was doing  and they were just playing a little game of chicken with Amazon  and Amazon blinked, launched this service.  And now Steve's sitting back saying, let's see how that works out.

Transcript:  As a consumer advocate, what I'm hoping is that Amazon has done this.  And either it's as you said, Leo, this is what I think is the worst  case scenario that Apple goes fine.  Jeff, you fight this battle.  I don't want to deal with this. I got too much stuff.  But as a consumer advocate, what I'm really hoping is that Google and Apple  just speed up their timetables and go, fine, we're all in.  Let's all get in tomorrow. Take us on.  Come on. We're all in.

Start time: 2668.98
End time: 2695.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Could this be a case where Amazon is doing something to bust out of its second  or third place because it's trying to get in.  Of course, it's second place in music, I assume, in digital.  I know it's way behind Apple.  I think Walmart's second place.  OK, so it's the third place, right?  Same thing on online video.  You know, you got your Netflix and your Hulu, and then Amazon is in third place  in there. Maybe this is a way where they can try to get a first  mover advantage to change the rules or shake up the landscape  to get a better position, both for their music and for their video.

Start time: 2695.92
End time: 2714.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look what Amazon's doing with the Amazon Prime with streaming.  They're going after Netflix.  They're going after Apple on the music front.  I mean, Amazon is they're going after publishers.  They're saying, you know, with the Kindle, I think they're going to do  an Android application.  They're going after Google with the Android market.  You know, marketplace.  I mean, Amazon is moving on all fronts at this point.

Start time: 2715.12
End time: 2744.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So what's interesting is, again, Michael Robertson, he's now at MP3 Tunes,  which does a very similar thing.  And he had an interesting quote in an ARS technical article.  He says, quote, Unlike us, Amazon is also a music retailer.  This means they've entered into a license with all the major  record labels to sell music.  But these licenses have specific restrictions, things Amazon can  and can't do and things they've agreed they won't do.  So maybe it's kind of a moot point, whether it's, you know, illegal  what they're doing.  It's certainly a violation of their current licenses, and it could screw up  their ability to sell music.

Start time: 2745.00
End time: 2761.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Reuters said that Amazon only informed the labels a week prior  to the announcement that this is what they were doing.  And one of the people who was quoted in this Reuters article  said, I've never seen a company of this size make an announcement,  launch it and then figure it say we're going to figure out this.  I have.

Start time: 2769.98
End time: 2781.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And in a way that works, right, because they they get known by us  as a first mover.  And so what if they have to pay out a billion or two later on?  It's a good market strategy, isn't it?

Start time: 2781.54
End time: 2801.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, is this a case where finally Amazon is doing what we've all wanted  or what all of us thought was common sense for the longest time?  And they're pushing the issue.  Maybe they have the money to spend on it.  Maybe they stand to gain market share as a result of the publicity  or changing the landscape.  I mean, regardless, it's like, I don't care if this is legal or not.  Like, good for them.  I mean, push the envelope on this ridiculous laws.  They have nothing to do with common sense.

Start time: 2801.88
End time: 2821.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it also goes back to what the fundamental ethos of all these  different companies are.  I mean, Apple always says we're a design company.  We make hardware.  You know, Google has always been about information.  Well, Amazon has always about been about the consumer.  Amazon has always been trying to sell.  And this is fundamentally benefiting the consumer.  It's in their best interest.  We want it. We want it.

Start time: 2821.60
End time: 2875.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have they have two ways of protecting themselves legally here.  And they're covering themselves on both fronts because we talked about  the terms of use for their own music download service  and how they're going out on a limb there and saying affirmatively  that users have these various rights that the music industry  doesn't necessarily or has not historically ever agreed with.  But then they also have you signed up for the service yet?  Yeah. You've gone through the process.  Yeah. Have you noticed that it's quite a process to first?  You have to log into your account.  Then you're presented with the terms of service.  And it's not just something that's lurking around on the bottom of the web page.  Oh, there are some terms of service.  No, you have to you have to read them.  You have to click. OK, I've read them.  And then there's a capture that says, you know, yes, I've read them.  And here's a capture confirming that I am a human being and I have read these.  And I agree. I didn't let my bot read this.

Start time: 2878.10
End time: 2904.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when you go and you actually read the terms of service,  there are all kinds of representations when you sign up for the cloud drive  and the cloud player that you are only going to use them for your own personal use.  You are not going to share. You are not going to get everything that you upload.  You have the rights to upload.  They are all legally your own designated file that you can go ahead and do what you will with.  I also they are trying to cover themselves on two fronts.

Start time: 2904.30
End time: 2933.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me point out that it isn't just music when you go to your cloud drive.  There are pre-made folders for documents, music, pictures and videos.  I mean, this is a storage as much as well.  It's dropbox without the clients. But how long before we get clients?  I mean, it's that's just a question right in a little software. Right. Right.  And so that's an interesting business.  It seems to me that the business model here is we give away this free service,  we get everybody to store stuff here.  And, oh, by the way, if you keep buying albums from us, you know, we won't charge you.

Much, much bigger than when you get into streaming on services like, you know,  like RDO or or Emoji or any of those guys, like in order to make the same amount  of money for minimum wage, the biggest one at the bottom, depending on,  I forget which service was at the bottom of it, was one point five million streams  in order to make the same amount of money that if they if they press  their own CDs and sold them out of the back of their welcome to our world.

But has anyone used the Facebook migration tool to go from private page to a public one yet?  No.  Well, because they had it, they came out with it quietly like a couple of weeks ago.

Start time: 4274.46
End time: 4284.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's a great thing, because people like you, you really don't want your public on your personal page.  You want to move them to a fan page.  Right. I had this problem and the way I got rid of it was I deleted my Facebook account.

Start time: 4285.04
End time: 4333.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right. Well, for those of us who don't want to follow in the footsteps of Leo,  this sounded like a dream come true.  But then I read they yanked the tool earlier this week because people were using it,  not understanding that it was a permanent shift.  Your private page went to your public page and it became this only thing.  It lost all of the content that you had created.  It lost all of the messages.  Lost all it preserved who was following you.  That's not true. But it lost all the tags, all your photos, all everything.  And in fact, there was an article.  Sounds pretty buggy in Facebook.  They yanked it because nobody understood what they're doing, including Facebook, it sounds like.  Christina Warren on Mashable details her horrific problem.  This hell on earth she created her for herself.  And however, since then, somebody has softies them through it.  But I was hoping one of you guys had experienced it because I think a lot of personalities,  when they first get started, you say yes to everyone on Facebook.

But there's enough people who I care that they get what I'm that they get what I'm  putting out there right now that I I know I should use this.  But apparently, like, it's difficult, like you can't have the same phone number attached  to both your private one and your public one because they're separate entities and no two  entities can have the same phone number, apparently.  Yeah. So I don't know.

And I have about seven, eighteen hundred friends right now.  But I got to the five thousand limit very early and quickly realized that was unworkable.  I had something like five thousand people waiting to be my friend after they got to  five thousand and it just wasn't workable.  And then I changed the role.  I have to actually know you.  Yeah, I do that too.  Yeah.  And that actually, my private page is more like a regular Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But it doesn't matter though.  It's one of those things, you don't put a solar cell because you want effective charging.  You put it on there because.  It's just a little bit more.  Well, because you want to have a green reputation.  You want to make money.

Transcript:  I don't think that prototype is real.  I bet there's going to be an app, an Amazon phone or some device like that.  We're also hearing that.  It just makes sense because of the strength that they've had with the Kindle.  Why not get into this game and try to build a brand around mobile phones?

Start time: 4928.34
End time: 4947.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The reason I think it's either it's a hoax not affiliated with Amazon.  Who published the story?  AndroidCommunity.com  No, I don't know.  I mean, it just seems weird that they would do it two days after because everybody makes  sure to wrap their presents very deliberately for April 1st and to miss it by two days and  release that would be pretty stupid.

Transcript:  The solar cell gives it away because a solar cell does absolutely nothing on a mobile phone.  It does nothing and it would increase the cost by 30 or 40 dollars, which is prohibitive  for a mobile device.  Just use some of your thinking of how to design a mobile device that would be hot in the marketplace.

Transcript:  By the way, one of my April Fool's jokes, I think three years ago was before the Kindle  came out.  And if you go back and read it, it was announcing the Kindle because I had already seen it at  that point.  So it wasn't a joke.  I didn't call it Amazon.  I called it an Apple thing.

And she was in the demo room and we were using FaceTime to talk to her.  It was the best grab we've ever done on Twitter.  And Steve Jobs comes up to her.  We were live and she says, Steve, Steve.  And she interviews him on FaceTime.  Two questions, two or three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So going back, you know, we were before the show, we were watching that Charlie Sheen  video on ABC's Good Morning America today about his live show.  And I had pitched yesterday to do the story about the sequel injection that lies a moon  virus.  And they said, now we got a lot of stories we got to do.  And so we didn't end up talking about lies a moon at all.  But I thought that was people were asking, is that an April Fool?

Start time: 5155.36
End time: 5182.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's one of the biggest stories of the week.  In fact, I was bit by it on the radio show because people are calling up over and over  again.  To give you that story, it's a bug in MySQL, which is a database used by pretty much everything  everywhere on the Internet.  It is a sequel injection bug that allows a bad guy to take over the database that a website's  delivering inject some JavaScript into the page that you get from that website.

Start time: 5183.06
End time: 5194.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I put a link in your lineup of WebSense did a whole video of what happens.  And if you fast forward, I'd love to see that.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  All of the scareware that it then downloads onto your computer.

Start time: 5194.40
End time: 5216.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing that's, you know, WebSense is watching the growth of this when  they first announced it on Tuesday, I think it was twenty four thousand sites had been  impacted.  By Thursday, it was six hundred forty thousand sites.  And I just did a search on Google for that Apple for that JavaScript string.  And I got several million sites.  So it's growing exponentially.

Start time: 5216.36
End time: 5226.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and we'll see if it grows beyond that.  Keep in mind to put it in perspective, we've got tens of billions of Web pages out there.  So we're looking at, you know, point oh one percent.  Right.

Start time: 5227.12
End time: 5248.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what it does, you know, I'm knock on wood because I we run my SQL on every one of my  sites.  This is part of the lamp stack.  You know, Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.  That's what LAMP stands for.  Now there are alternatives like PostgreSQL, but most people use MySQL.  So I'm going to go down here and see there's a video.  All right.

Start time: 5249.52
End time: 5272.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just fast forward.  But it just puts up some really compelling scareware that looks they call it Windows  Stability Center as opposed to, you know, Security Center.  And it has you install and then reboot the computer.  And then what it does is says you're compromised.  You need to buy something new.  Right.  And then you end up it has a perfect input.

Start time: 5272.92
End time: 5308.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it that they're showing this on Windows XP.  It's kind of says something, doesn't it?  Using Internet Explorer, too, I might add.  But the truth is, you know, the hacked sites are initially websites, not your home computer.  But if you go visit websites, some of which are completely normal websites you've visited  many times before.  But once they're hacked, they start affecting and impacting your system.  And we heard from a lot of people on the show today who had exactly this warning.  You've got a bug.  They install the bad stuff and they're stuck forever.  I mean, they're just they're just bad shape.

Transcript:  I just talked to Brian Aker, who was one of the main developers.  He wrote about my SQL.  Yeah, yeah.  And and I he was talking to me about the new Drizzle database, which is a fork of my SQL.  And he said they did all sorts of reengineering to make that really small and light and get  rid of a lot of the crust that's the cruft that's built.

Start time: 5327.58
End time: 5334.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5334.72
End time: 5359.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But Drizzle started before they got bought.  You know, he he put it this way.  He said a lot of the corporate customers who are using my SQL like SAP force force them  because they were paying millions of dollars to put in features that the Internet, you  know, me and you don't need.  And also, there was just a bunch of stuff.  So there there was a pause right here on this video.

No, that's that's not Microsoft Security Essentials.  That is the pop up that you get potential threat details.  Unknown Trojan.  And you have three buttons clean computer apply actions or close.  Of course, you're not going to close it.  You're going to say, well, gee, I better clean the computer and or apply actions.  I don't know what.

Start time: 5447.62
End time: 5461.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we've been saying that for 12 years.  Why should they attack the Mac?  Because the market share is higher and the...  Still not high enough.  But the income level...  It's so easy to do this on Windows.  But the income level of the targets is so much higher.  Why wouldn't you?

Start time: 5462.24
End time: 5486.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all I can say is we know that these exploits are possible because Safari was hacked  in five seconds and bone to own about three weeks ago.  We know that there are plenty of vulnerabilities in the Macintosh.  Now, there's one thing on the Mac that is a little different.  I think you would be asked for your administrator password before any of this could have happened.  That's one extra layer.  But I don't think that...  I think that a lot of people would just say, yeah, fine.  I need my password to install this.

Start time: 5486.56
End time: 5494.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, that's something that always drives me nuts.  Not that I'm saying you're doing it right now, but everyone says, oh, there's no viruses  on the Mac.  And it's like, that's because you're not a big enough target with the Mac.

Microsoft used to invite hackers up to Microsoft every year when I worked there and they have  conferences with them and they all use Macs.  So maybe there is a little bit of a...  You mean the bad guys all use Macs?  A lot of them did.  That's interesting.  They feel safer with Macs.  A lot of them have Linux as well, but you would walk around the room, you would see  a lot of Macs and a lot of Linux machines.  Not very many Windows machines.

I think automatic backup is very important because nobody, let's face it, nobody remembers  to do that.  It also safe in the cloud.  And now it's okay to have a local hard drive backup.  That's fine.  I'm not against that.  The problem is if there's a fire, you know, some bad habits, a tsunami or whatever, you  lose the backup.  When you put it in the cloud, it's offsite, it's safe.  And carbonite is kind of like Dropbox or Amazon cloud because you can go to your carbonite  account on any computer, anytime they even have an iPhone, Android and BlackBerry app,  there's your data.  You could download it and use it.  So really it's unlimited cloud storage.  Forget this, $55 a year.

Transcript:  First of all, you have to turn on your Google profiles.  You have to go to profiles.google.com slash.  Yeah, slash and hit return and set up a Google profile.  And then you have to turn on the plus one feature.  And I forget how to get there to turn it on.  And then there'll be a page.  So if you go to my profile, you can actually see the page of all the plus ones I've done.  I've done a couple hundred already.

Start time: 6143.38
End time: 6172.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's what freaked me out.  When I first started to read that, I'm like, what's the point of liking it if I'm the only  one who knows?  Because it's not like anyone subscribes.  This is typical Google, isn't it?  Yeah, well, I haven't friended or whatever.  And then it dropped like, oh, by the way, the people who could see it are anyone who's  on your Google chat list.  And then that was the moment I was because I keep my chat open.  And so I got a bunch of people following on that.  I don't even know.  But it's like it's the fact that all of a sudden it hit me that's like, wow, Google  knows everything I do in my Gmail and everybody I should do is turn it on.

End time: 6228.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And it shows up plus one and then it'll show up on my on my profile.  Now, what this what I'm expecting this to help is Google search results.  We'll notice that I've clicked plus one and some pages actually have a bunch of people  have clicked plus one.  So if everybody in the audience goes and clicks plus one on Twitter, you'll what do you do?  Does it affect the search results?  Does it?  First of all, it shows you 15 of your friends or 15 people have clicked plus one on this  search result.  So visually you'll see, oh, a lot of people like the single result.  I'm expecting that that will help the result.  It will help that single result move up the list and to more places.

Start time: 6229.36
End time: 6254.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, you might be looking at you might be looking at customized searches down the  road. But the reason that the like exists right now is because it gives you access to  the deep user involvement for everybody on Facebook.  A Facebook life like is way more powerful than a tweet or even a search result because  it's sticky and it sticks around for a long time.  You can like something and a week later, your mom can finally get around to checking it  out.  There's no user involvement like that with the Google results.  I want to go.

Start time: 6254.34
End time: 6269.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google ultimately wants to mine this information and use it somehow in a social  search results. So when you search for a page, it'll say, well, here's what our results  are. Here's what your friends liked.  But it's not going to that's there's not going to be a mountain.  That's not going to be useful. There's a mountain of data.

Start time: 6269.88
End time: 6283.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, yeah, after everybody adds plus ones to a bunch of things like restaurants and  stuff, think about being able to go to Google and say, show me all the sushi restaurants,  my friends have liked.  That would be interesting.  Here's what I think will happen.

Start time: 6283.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  thought. What I think will happen is this.  It will be data mining this information and you'll pay attention to who your friends are  and what they plus one.  And I could see a time in the future where every time you do a search, just as on Gmail,  you have the was it the important email emails up at the top in their own little section,  I could see important results like priority results.  Exactly. Priority search results specific to you.

Start time: 6311.64
End time: 6324.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not doing that yet in terms of well, I see this as hugely positive to the overall  algorithm, because if you have this kind of human oversight, maybe you're crowdsourcing  it. But nonetheless, you're getting eyeballs on your results.

Start time: 6324.22
End time: 6339.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Matt Cutts admitted that, yeah, you've got to have a human.  We're doing some human stuff, everything.  And even an algorithm is a human imposing something on some curation on a search result.  But what's happening is Google's getting left behind a little bit because social search is  going to be the future of search and Google needs that.

Start time: 6340.12
End time: 6366.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that not enough people in the mainstream can subscribe to Google, Google properties  in this way or have any social interaction with Google.  So we're actually a bad test case because many of us do, you know, are aware of buzz,  have tried it out. This goes back to the point we were making earlier, which is Apple is  a hardware company. Google is an information company.  And you know what? Facebook is a social company.  Exactly is a social company.  You're you're just you're putting your peanut butter in my chocolate here, people.

Start time: 6366.78
End time: 6373.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I'm not going to say that this is going to be a disaster.  I'm not saying it's going to be a Google buzz, but you're working against your brand.  And that never works well. You know, when when very few cases do you get a case where  Apple becomes a phone company and it works and it takes it takes a lot of elegance and  a lot of precision and a specific vision to get there.  And I don't know that Google has it to work against their brand.  Google is a search company.  And I don't go there to find out what movies Becky likes.

Transcript:  I like it in concept because it works for me the same way that Twitter works.  You know, you only see who you follow.  So it's hard to get spammed in Twitter.  Right.

Or it should be some kind of big fat warning, like warning.  You're going to get subpar performance or something where they just claim.  So how big is Twitter? Really?  This was shocking to me.  And this fundamentally changed my strategy.

Transcript:  So this is Silicon Alley Insider, their chart of the day and which you can follow on Twitter.  And link bait du jour.  Link bait du jour. Twitter claims.  What do they claim? One hundred fifty million.  No, I'm sorry. Twitter claims one hundred and seventy nine million.

Start time: 6689.28
End time: 6739.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now, you have not read this back here.  Are you looking at the article right now? Don't look at it.  I got a quiz for you.  What they did was they broke down how many, you know,  Twitter claims one hundred seventy nine million accounts.  Now we know for sure, you know, like I have schwood, but I also have misspelled schwood as CHW.  Don't don't follow that one.  Yeah. And all it does is it says, hey, are you looking for schwood as HWOD?  This is how you spell this is where you go.  And we know that there's accounts like schwood's hair, Becky's, you know, legs, Tom Merritt's beard,  you know, Leo's, Tricaster, the Tricaster.  Nice.  No, they really are. They really are.  Yeah, the exercise balls. Yeah.  And so but the question is, like, how many of these are real legitimate accounts?  So they asked how many of those one hundred seventy nine million accounts  do you think have are following at least one person?  Are following our following out of one seventy nine.

Start time: 6739.38
End time: 6746.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's a pretty low level.  Are following one person. Yeah.  One metric. You signed up. You follow one person.  You got to follow somebody.  Say one hundred and fifty million.

Start time: 6746.96
End time: 6754.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  One hundred and nineteen million.  OK, so that's 80 million. Throw them out.  OK. And then how many do you think are being followed by even one person?

Start time: 6755.38
End time: 6759.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would put that considerably lower, maybe 80 million.  Eighty five million.

Start time: 6759.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people join and nobody follows them.

Start time: 6761.42
End time: 6779.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  OK, I think it's reasonable to say that most average users of Twitter  follow at least 50 people, would you say?  Would you say is a reasonable number? Yeah.  How many do you think follow at least 50 people?  Half like 17 million.  Ten percent. Wow. 17 million.  Use Twitter the way we point.

Start time: 6780.24

End time: 6800.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There are only 12 million Twitter users following at least 64 people.  That's amazing to me. And it funded like I mean, like I had never

Start time: 6819.82
End time: 6833.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to show them how to find new people to follow.  And, you know, if you don't if you if you're not insider,  if you you follow maybe your celebrity friends and I had a little thought.  Who else would you follow if you're a normal person about Twitter the other day?

Start time: 6834.06
End time: 6904.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's a new service called Hashable that is an interesting service.  The idea is you hash.  You put a hashtag in there when, for instance, I'm going to sit down  and do a show with you guys.  I should say hash meet or hash show with and then your Twitter handles and then  it keeps then Hashable is like keeping track of it.  If you want to exchange contact information, I can put a hashtag in there  with your Twitter handle and it will it will database all of that.  So it's what it's doing is it's using Twitter as a signaling mechanism  that really isn't about being human readable.  It's about being machine readable, which and I realize.  Well, I realize a lot of the value of Twitter isn't in human readable stuff.  In fact, if you go to Twitter these days, a lot of times you go,  I don't know what I'm reading about.  Three quarters of it is just kind of hash.  R.T. at something.  Well, I understand a lot of the acronyms and stuff,  but I just think that people are less and less communicating information  pros, more and more communicating kind of machine information.  Well, and I wonder if that is really the future of Twitter is as kind of  a signaling mechanism that might have data, machine readable data,  as well as human readable data.

Start time: 6904.26
End time: 6917.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know what it is.  I think Twitter has a chance to eventually become the code  that they show in the matrix.  Yeah, get in the matrix.  You can experience it as people and programs and stuff.  Or you can sit there and just look at the green raw code  floating in front of your face.  And I think that's what Twitter is.

Start time: 6917.94
End time: 6969.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was my original idea.  We call I called it the river that I wanted to create an XMPP stream  because XMPP allows you to have human readable text,  but also buried underneath it in meta text, all sorts of additional information  like geo tagging, like this is a link.  This is opinion.  This is, you know, a reference to somebody else.  Lots of metadata.  You can have all of that going in this stream.  And I think Twitter would be much more usable if they didn't focus on human read.  Well, well, one of the reasons I say that is I, you know, I'm going to get  I've got the Y things scale. It sends my weight.  I'm going to get the Y things blood pressure that's going to send my tweet.  My blood pressure.  I can only imagine in a year or two a Y things thing that tweets my entire  all my biometrics and aggregates all your individual.  That's not very usable for a human to read that.  But imagine what that could be, how that could be used in other ways.  I'm seeing more and more stuff like that.

Start time: 6969.40
End time: 7003.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So one of the things that struck me is for somebody who wants to build his brand  and get well known as a performer and entertainer,  I have been relying very heavily on Twitter.  But what it said in the article is Facebook has a very specific answer  to the question. Six hundred million people visit Facebook each month.  Those are people who log in and use it.  Whereas, you know, Twitter says, well, we got one hundred and seventy nine million  accounts. If you want to compare deep, we'll call 50 people deep involvement.  You know, we're looking at 15 million people versus 600 million people.  I mean, that I think you're going to see a lot of people in the next few months  dramatically move their efforts towards Facebook.

Start time: 7003.02
End time: 7030.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel a huge sea change.  I know it's sort of late to the game, but I'm I'm I'm the bell curve monitor.  And I feel like Facebook has just just cleaved the bell curve  and just taken it over in the last month.  I think it's everybody aware that there's an IPO coming.  I think it's that it's just the critical mass is so there.  And those of us who are very tech savvy and very Twitter focused are realizing now,  oh, you want to talk to the masses. Right.

Start time: 7030.68
End time: 7042.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem is with Facebook, you can't do what I'm showing you on my screen.  You can't mix 30,000 people together into one stream that keeps coming in at you.  And you can't do something like Flipboard as easily.

Start time: 7043.32
End time: 7053.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Flipboard is very good.  But how usable is what you're seeing right now on your screen there, Robert?  I mean, it's just kind of a well, when you're talking about breaking news,  following the news, I mean, I'm listening to it.

Start time: 7053.18

Transcript:  Yeah. The average human.  That's just people like a car.

Start time: 7061.22
End time: 7071.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think really ultimately, that's going to end up being machine readable.  I do agree. I think it's the nervous system of the Internet.  I think that this is this is a signaling mechanism.  But ultimately, humans aren't going to be able to keep up with it.

Start time: 7071.70
End time: 7082.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It will. Or at least won't want to.  I mean, you'll still.  Yeah. Most people will still be able to use it the way we do now, but it'll it'll serve.  It'll discover its true value.  I agree. I can see that with machine.  Machines need to help us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the notion that there is a lot of value in textual information.  But, you know, if you go to our chat room where there are a thousand people,  actually, there used to be, but now they've all left.  You see immediately it's almost too hard to follow.  There's got to be some way to and Twitter, you have twenty five.  How many people you got in there?  Twenty five thousand people you're following.  It's not usable.  But there's but there's a huge amount of data in there.  There's there's got to be a way to mine that.

Start time: 7178.40
End time: 7198.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it's I've always said that Twitter is essentially when the world  started keeping a diary and how great will it be?  I mean, I wish a hundred years ago we could know what the entire world  was thinking on a very personal, personal by person basis.  We might know that because we couldn't have gone through to find the good stuff.  By the way, did you did you see the metric, the entire sum of all tweets,  less than four terabytes, is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sheen is calling his live on stage tour,  My violent torpedo of truth.  Defeat is not an option.  Apparently it was.  This is kind of a hit piece, I have to say.  It took the 44 year old star of Two and a Half Men  about 10 days to enrage the people who were paying him.  Last night, it took him less than an hour.  Progress.  And reports that Sheen hit the stage to a roaring ovation  a little after 9 p.m.  following a film montage and a kiss shared by the women  he calls his goddesses.  On stage, he burned his Two and a Half Men shirt  and demanded freedom from evil weirdos.  The rants and videos that followed covered little new ground  and had the audience acting restless.  I love the way ABC is chopping up YouTube video from Bug Day.  As the booze began to rain down,  they forgot to bring their YouTube camera.  I've already got your money, dude.  Sheen said to one disgruntled fan.  With the catcalls growing to a din, Sheen showed a parody of his 2020  interview and left the stage a little after 10,  playing a music video from Snoop Dogg entitled Winning  before the house lights came up, ending the show.  With tickets initially selling for close to 70 dollars,  some were not especially amused afterwards.

Transcript:  No, no, no, no, because because here's the thing,  like in all in Charlie Sheen's defense, like he was a genius  on those interviews on the news, and he showed a lot of creativity  and bizarre energy, and that's what people wanted more of.  But but like, for example, I, you know, I went to Kevin Smith's thing  where he did he showed Red State and then did a Q&A afterward.  I mean, that guy can capture an audience and draw them in.  And I guess just Charlie Sheen couldn't.  So it's not that they're dumb for wanting.  It's, you know, Charlie Sheen.  They thought there'd be more there.  Yeah, he didn't have you didn't.  He didn't have it. All right.
