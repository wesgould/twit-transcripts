Welcome back it's great to have you in one of the reasons I wanted you on we'll talk about the FCC's decision in just a bit before we get to that.  Of course mobile World Congress is going on right now some big announcements already this morning.  Before we get to that we should probably mention that Leonard Nimoy passed away on Friday at the age of 83 effective memorial services going on.  I think as we speak William Shatner Captain Kirk.  Was reporting that he wasn't going to be able to go he had a prior commitment a charity event that he you know really couldn't reasonably get out of.  To go to Mr Spock's funeral but the good news apparently is that Shatner was able to get on a plane and so he's going to be there I know that there was all good yeah he was memorializing Leonard Nimoy on Twitter.  There was a kind of a furor when he said he couldn't go but you know once you understand it's a charity event and I love this billboard could you zoom in on that billboard this this billboard was put out up in LA I think I'm told near Shatner's home is that right.  And it's one of these electronic billboards I saw somebody who said they saw it in Atlanta too so maybe it's all over and it's a picture of course of Leonard Nimoy as Mr Spock making the Vulcan live long and prosper sign.  Live long and prosper sign and we're all going to do that right now and think about Mr Spock and I love the epitaph he did.  He did yeah so.  About yeah yeah an amazing fellow and much beloved and deservedly so and I know we were to Jerry and I were talking because Jerry you know.

We actually have two reporters there Mike Elgin of TNT is there and he'll be reporting all week long on TNT and TNT and to from Barcelona Miriam schwar is there as well.  Things the conference itself will kick off till tomorrow, but things have already started in some ways while way announced.  It's first android wear watch the first android wear watch with a sapphire crystal the talk band be to activity tracker and the end one year but hybrid Acer announced the liquid and 220 yes a windows phone.  On a budget, which means it's not going to be a high end windows phone that everybody's waiting to hear if there'll be anything at mobile world Congress.  Like the Nokia 1520s Microsoft is there, but they've even said I think we're not going to announce any new high end windows.  phones and of course the the other two big companies that were most interested in HTC and Samsung both had events Miriam schwar was at the HTC event where they unveiled the HTC M nine she had this report.

Start time: 597.00
End time: 694.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey there it's Miriam schwar with the twit network, and this is the HTC M nine here at mobile world Congress.  2015 as you can tell it's very much an evolution of the original HTC one and seven and eight this particular device is actually an interesting.  Actually, an interesting shade combination the edges here are gold with the back being silver, which is quite a nice color combination so what's changed since last year it's a.  same beautiful display a five inch 1080p display with snapdragon a 10 this year.  And the other thing you have to keep in mind is the camera is obviously changed quite a bit there's a 20 megapixel auto focus camera now.  With instead of the four megapixel ultra pixel camera from the previous two models, however, the ultra pixel cameras now located in the front up here.  As a selfie camera so that's one of the changes and finally everything else is more or less where you'd expect it to be for this phone.  You get the same SIM trays in the same places buttons on the same places micro SD card slot expansion headphone jack and micro USB, which is hidden here by this.  This security attachment but basically that's the HTC one and nine very much an evolution last year's design three gigs of RAM 32 gigs of storage.  yep that's it here at mobile Congress 2015 in Barcelona cheers.

Start time: 711.10
End time: 718.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You like this phone yeah yeah I was just saying, I mean it's just it's an evolution, I mean they had the it was probably the best design Android phone.

Start time: 719.44
End time: 767.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  As it were, in terms of you know really slick and you know wow factor I think the thing that kept a lot of people from buying it was the camera frankly the four megapixel camera that's just not that's a non starter and a 20 minute.  Prove that considerably they also are doing what everybody's going to do, which is much better front facing cameras originally I think front facing cameras are all about Skype now it's clear selfie.  they're the selfie yeah so they're doing they're putting the ultra pixel on the front and a 20 megapixel on the back that wasn't the only thing HTC announced they also announced the vibe.  Which is very much like an oculus rift it's a steam focused VR helmet they're doing it with valve.  Is it is this going to be just for using with steam or what.

Start time: 769.16
End time: 779.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be interesting because you know this VR stuff is is I was pretty skeptical of it, you know all around, but this is really picking up steam this year.

Start time: 781.46
End time: 782.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They did pick up steam literally.

Start time: 783.94
End time: 872.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Literally picking up steam oh sorry bad fun.  I didn't even know it.  yeah.  But in terms of VR you know the platform itself as a platform it's picking up steam i'm hearing about all kinds of interesting business uses for this stuff right now.  A lot of around oculus rift clearly as a platform and so it'll be interesting you know the platform is the is the interesting play with this you know can they do that through steam maybe.  Or is there kind of going to be something else that can kind of ride on top of that, but you know there are companies that are coming out with some really interesting stuff in the months ahead.  In terms of what they're doing with business uses some of these are public some of them aren't but things like Marriott letting you go and use that to look at resorts.  For example, and actually get a full walkthrough you know of it is one Toyota has talked about doing some things.  has announced the things that they're doing with helping people you know drivers, especially teen drivers go through some scenarios.  That can help them be safer drivers i'm using using VR, so there are some really interesting practical uses, and so I think these guys jumping into this game, you know with.  With with the new product is a you know kind of justifies the fact that there's just a lot of great stuff happening in that space and it's not just games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I feel like i'm more excited about Microsoft's HoloLens and augmented reality than I am about virtual reality it doesn't have the same issue with kind of seasickness queasiness and every time I put on the oculus rift I feel like.  I need a cold compress.  Compressed compress.  And I also think it's a lot harder to create content in it for a virtual world than it is to do what Microsoft's doing with the HoloLens they will have the HoloLens they say this fall at wondering windows 10 and I wonder if that's going to maybe.  I feel like that's going to end this whole infatuation with VR to me VR is like 3D it's a gimmicky what do you think.

Start time: 915.18
End time: 982.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's depends on who you are I think that you're not as excited about the possibilities for gaming I mean for gaming and maybe for some of these things that Jason Heiner was just talking about where you need to be completely immersive and it's a completely different thing but it's hard to do immersive well these are yes it is they're not very high res screens.  There is latency which makes is what makes you seasick but I don't think it's an either or because the HoloLens you know that's that is overlay technology and that's going to be for things that.  Might be game related but are also just other real world things it's much more what people I think thought Google Glass was going to be except it wasn't where you can overlay you know Internet information on what you're seeing and the VR stuff is just totally different it's blocking out the real world entirely and.  There may be a place for that I worry that there's some we see an announcement like this HTC announcement and we think oh great it's another Oculus Rift I wonder if there's a really a disparity in terms of the technology involved that would be the danger is a consumer don't want to split.  You buy if you buy the HTC and it turns out that it's kind of lower grade tech and that Oculus is really the one that's got so much that they've invented that makes their product better you're kind of in trouble.  It can stall it we just don't know.

End time: 1040.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh well.  I point out that.  20 years is a million times better in technology at least in current trends.  Yeah.  And a million times better than what we have now basically is good enough is immersive.  Exactly I mean the holo back from.  The TV shows is likely to be reality by that time.  I'm hoping they have it soon so you and I can hang out without leaving our living rooms.  Well it's getting close to that now but even Skype is pretty good.  Isn't this what we used to have.  It's true Louis was right.

End time: 1056.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're sitting here wanting VR and here I am and you're in LA I'm we're up in Northern California and it's in Jason's in Knoxville where's where are you I never Louisville.  And I can never get that right.  One of these days and it's as if we're all sitting around a table so in a way we've got something kind of we're getting.  Leo it's like I'm actually here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  HTC also announced a feel like this is a little bit of a me too they you know well Galaxy VR Galaxy Gear VR you know Samsung's got it we got to have it.  Everybody's got a smart band so we got to have one HTC did a deal with Under Armour and they announced the first HTC wearable.  Not an Android wear smartwatch but a GPS enabled fitness tracker called the grip grips got a grip on me the verge.  Oh no we're gonna have to look at an ad.  I don't want to look at that.  The grip it kind of reminiscent a little bit of the Nike wear fuel band rather and a little bit of the maybe the Microsoft band.  It looks big it looks clunky multi-sport mode finally it says contract activities from running to cycling on these devices really are just pedometers that can work with running and walking and not much more.  But also Samsung had its Samsung unpacked 2015 this morning we got up early did a live special covering the keynote.  Very nice keynote considering Samsung's previous amazingly bad efforts.  Yeah.  In fact they even had two women do most of the presenting which was Samsung had been accused kind of a tone deaf idea of women in previous years.  This was much better Miriam Jouard took a look at the Galaxy S6 at the demo room after the keynote and she had this report.  Miriam.  Hey there it's Miriam with the Trit network and this here is the Galaxy S6 Edge here at Mobile Congress 2015.

Start time: 1167.08
End time: 1292.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it's Samsung's latest and greatest and it is a very very nice phone I have to say.  So here you can see it's shiny in the back some sort of glass or plastic finish and of course this is the edge so it has this kind of curved edge display as you can see here which is very unique it's similar to what was on the Note Edge last fall but it doesn't actually have buttons on it.  They're just using it as a way to keep this really smooth curved edge it's very very nice.  So this is a quad HD display 5.1 inches.  This is very high res same resolution as the Note 4 but on a smaller display and as you can see the chassis is made of metal on the edges here.  So that's pretty cool very nicely done and in the back is a new improved camera it has optical image stabilization and an F over 1.9 lens.  You can also still see the heart rate monitor that was present in last year's Galaxy S5 and it's also available on the Note 4.  So yeah this is a powerhouse inside you'll find Samsung's own Exynos processor it's quad core of course 3 gigs of RAM lots of storage something like 32 64.  And there's no micro SD card slot no expansion no removable battery this year, this is a very new thing for Samsung they usually.  Have removable batteries and micro SD as a selling point you see the volume rocker up here the headphone jack.  Actually no that's the infrared port and headphone jacks on the bottom where the micro USB charger data port is that's obstructed by this safety device here home button of course.  So yeah the Galaxy S6 edge here at Mobile Congress really light really nice phone.

Start time: 1294.06
End time: 1406.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Cheers that's a that's saying a lot because Miriam is a big HTC fan and has been for some time.  Got Samsung announced two versions of the Galaxy one that's got a basically a flat screen like it.  Existing Galaxy phone and the edge, which is not like the current edge the current edge is two screens one curved and one flat and they show different things this one is one looks like one super AMOLED screen.  That is curved around the front right which I like better frankly looks it looks people have seen it including Miriam say it looks gorgeous.  It does have some of the capability of the current edge you can have an edge display but not nearly the not nearly the capabilities of the current edge, which is fine I thought that was a.  Mistake Samsung did say no more removable battery, but we are going to have very high speed charging and will support both wireless standards Chi and power map, which is great news, I think.  Yeah, very cool yeah no SD card but as Miriam said 32 64 and 128 gig version so that's probably better than having an SD card in most respects.  Why would it be better well have a removable card removal cards great because you can take it out and maybe copy stuff to it and so forth you can have multiple cards.  But on most platforms this SD card isn't an equal to internal SD storage and so having internal store large capacity internal storage.  Means you don't have to worry about where i'm storing apps most apps cannot be moved to the SD card no app with a widget can be moved to the SD card so having it all internal having sufficient internal storage I think gives you most of the capability you'd want an SD card for.  And put you at the mercy of the cloud 128 gigs Jerry I don't think you're going to need much cloud storage if you get a giant one like that in fact that's as much storage is going to be able to put in I guess you can put in 128 gig SD card.

Start time: 1407.38
End time: 1418.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it does put you at the mercy of their pricing of that memory well if it were you know a separate slot you get that memory probably for a lot less than what they're going to price it they are using ems emmc memory, which is.

Start time: 1419.40
End time: 1543.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The same number uses so I think in the solid state drives is a lot faster than the flash storage in existing phones that's a big.  They looks like they've made massive improvements to the camera, including an F as Miriam said F 1 9.  And the fingerprint reader is much more like touch ID on apple the current fingerprint reader on the.  As far as five and the note for you have to swipe it's kind of like the laptop fingerprint readers are you swipe your finger along it now it's just going to be like the touch ID on apples where you just put your finger on it they also announced their own.  Payment system Samsung pay which will I suppose I don't know I'm assuming continue to support the touch to pay technologies.  That Android phones have now with Google wall but also adds loop pay accompany Samsung acquired last month that lets you use a swipe card reader.  By not swiping your phone but just putting your phone next to the swipe card reader it puts out a magnetic field which the swipe card reader misinterpreted as an actual magnetic strip.  And I know people have lose use loop page F needles in our office uses it he says it works quite well so Samsung said at their event we will be we will support more.  Pavement terminals than anybody including Apple pay because of this acquisition of loop pay and more ways to better the system.  Well you know and that's any not go raise that question and he'd like to see and I would too if it's possible to.  Maybe a snag that magnetic field on its way to the stripe reader but one good thing Samsung's doing just as Apple is doing the same kind of tokenization of there's no credit card.  Transfer is a single use token that's passed to the merchant the merchant doesn't get any information about you.  I think this is that's really good news at the Apple pays clearly move the market and that respect.  So they're certainly getting there.  I you know I'm excited I feel like Samsung has put together a very nice phone that at least design wise looks a little bit like that you point out looks a little bit like an iPhone.  I think we talked about HTC one which has been the go to sort of like.

Start time: 1547.18
End time: 1585.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really nice like an iPhone that's got that high design you want an Android phone that was the go to and I look at the Galaxy S6 I think well.  It might be the Galaxy S6 they got rid of that plastic back that was removable which meant you could swap the battery and look like a date in some cases sometimes look like a bandaid or fake leather.  And now it's this gorilla glass back and it's not removable and it looks really nice.  It looks like an iPhone 5.  Well I think the edge probably looks a little more like the six yeah it looks good it looks really good.  There's the rounded edge of both phones.  I always thought that the for the leading Android phone the Galaxy S models felt a little cheap because they had that I agree.  They still have that physical home button but so does Apple.

Start time: 1587.12
End time: 1599.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And now that it's you know it's a fingerprint reader so that gives it some justification for existence there's the only one of the few Android devices that has still has physical buttons of on the front face of the phone.  I'm going to definitely get.  Small phones but.

Start time: 1602.26
End time: 1615.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For some people and everybody's getting older the bigger the phone the better within within the phone.  I mean it gets to the point you can't carry it but.  No I agree with you Jerry.  The world seems it's funny because Apple and everybody kind of mocked these.

Start time: 1619.16
End time: 1643.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Which is smaller than the five the S6 rather.  People mocked me they said what is it a giant Hershey bar you're holding up to your ear and.  And now it's just commonplace I carry a Note Four which I really like that's five and three quarters inches.  This is five point one inches I think that's five point one inches.  I don't I this phone will not feel big in in anybody's hand I predict it's smaller than an iPhone six plus.  It's kind of stopped the momentum of these phones getting bigger and bigger right.

Start time: 1645.95
End time: 1690.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like you know with with this generation of Android devices they are now sort of evening out and they're leaving some room for the fablet.  To sort of do its thing I think that's the interesting thing couple things between things about the S6 is.  The one thing I like about the S5 and the other galaxies because I've had the last couple of my.  My work phone and I have an iPhone six is my personal phone is the the.  Galaxies bounce I swear I drop that thing all the time I don't know why maybe I'm just not as careful with it because it but the nice thing about that plastic is it bounces and it doesn't crack as much.  You don't need a case and that kind of thing I would have to say that's the best thing about the Galaxy Note One.  It's basically entirely made of glass the back and the side like the iPhone four if which everybody remembers was the you know how you toast always lands butter side down well it was both sides were buttered.

Start time: 1692.18
End time: 1709.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because of both sides of glass right and that's what the case is here Apple went away from that and went to a metal back so they could reduce the breakage on the back of their phone but the the.  S6 definitely you know there's glass on the back it's Gorilla Glass for the fourth generation Gorilla Glass which they say is the hardest glass out there but glasses glass it's not going to be as impervious as that hard plastic was.

Start time: 1713.12
End time: 1717.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Actually Sam some of some interesting cases for this including one that's somewhat translucent we saw in a demo after the event that looked like a glass.

Transcript:  Give me a lot of breaks and you know for whatever reason I know that it looks great I mean there's I think that I don't know why they ate one with an edge and without the one with the edge looks so much better and it's sort of weird it's not a feature you know.  Really buy the phone for so I think that's sort of strange they should have just made one device they want to go with this edge concept just do it and make that part of your design but.  But that's not really their style but but I think that you know it's not as practical a phone but it looks a lot better and it is an incremental upgrade again I mean it's not a phone that's going to be as practical as a phone.  And you know this does set them up to kind of reclaim some lost mojo they've got a lot of competition coming from Huawei and Xiaomi and you know they're doing a lot of great stuff with this and I think that's a great thing.  Yeah but they're still not selling in the US nobody none of the Xiaomi or Huawei that they're not selling in the US.

Transcript:  Well as a vendor as a vendor Apple's way out in front you know you compare them to all of Android you know it's it's a different story but you know if you're if you're Samsung you know you especially care about Apple head to head and you know Apple selling a lot more devices than Samsung in the US but worldwide you know Samsung is killing it.  When I go outside the US you know it's like Samsung is like what Apple is in the US like everybody's carrying Samsung you know and you know especially in Asia and in Europe.  And so I think those other brands and this will I think do well in those markets and what they're under seriously intense competition from some of those other vendors especially the Chinese manufacturers you know they they hear the footsteps coming with those guys.

Transcript:  Well and Samsung almost lost that with the S5 I think it was such a disappointment now people are saying what about the note the note was announced in September of last year.  So a note 5 would presumably be announced in September of this year so they're they're off cycle with the note and the S6 I think the S6 looks good.  I'm going to buy the edge and I just try not to drop it.

Transcript:  The last two Galaxy releases were kind of lackluster.  I was there at the S4 which was one of those embarrassing launch events too and you know you felt like they were going to not mess with the hardware and they were going to throw in a million different features and actually one of the features of the S6 is that they reduced the number of features in the operating system.  They actually are stripping out a lot of junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No mention of things like the turning pages with your eyes going up and down.  Yeah, you know I can now use the phone while my fingernails are drying and things like that.  They left all of that out and by the way announced no other products.  The only product they announced at this event today was an updated gear VR helmet that fits the note 6 and that's not much of a change.  They decided to focus laser like on the S6 and put their fortunes and I think they needed to do that frankly because the S5 was such an old fashioned.

Transcript:  I think the iPhone 6 is great.  And by the way, there may be a reason to carry an iPhone.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  I'll just quickly wrap up Mobile World Congress coverage.  There were a couple of other announcements.  Low end phones are a very big part of the market.  We don't talk about it because it doesn't have all those exciting new whizzy features.  But the low end phones are huge.  Motorola on Wednesday sent us a box with the second generation Motorola G, a very credible,  very nice phone, much like the Moto X, but one hundred fifty dollars out the door unsubsidized.  Mozilla has announced a flip phone and a slider phone.  So if you miss your old flip phone, these are using the Mozilla operating system, which I don't.  I'm not the Firefox operating system is not my favorite in the world.  But these are there's a huge market for inexpensive phones, often with dual SIMs, FM radio features  that aren't usually seen in the United States and of course supporting the wireless bands that are used around the world.  This is probably where the most of the money is going to be made.  Or I'm sorry, because I don't I doubt there's much money to be made, but most of the sales.

That's on audible.com.  Footfall Lucifer's Hammer, which if you haven't read you, I mean, you're just missing out.  Plus, a lot of others.  High Justice Janissaries.  Some of these are young adult novels, which is great.  In fact, audible is great for younger people, your kids, your teenagers.  Often and research shows this.  They get into reading by listening.  If they're not into reading yet, get them an audible book and get them to listen.  And research shows that kids who listen to books read more books as well.  It gets them.  It gets them going.  Doesn't have just to be you with with a kid in your lap reading that you can do it together, though.  And we do that actually with Michael.  We've been listening to The Lightning Thief, which is a great book for young adults.  And he is loving it.  And then, you know, that gets him gets him reading.  In fact, audible got me reading again.  I've always loved reading.  But, you know, with with work and long commutes, I didn't have time to sit down with a book very often.  And as you get older, frankly, one page, I'm asleep.  Audible is great in the car, at the gym, walking the dog, doing the dishes.  We have audible on in the house almost all the time, both fiction, nonfiction.  Let me tell you, if you if you haven't tried it yet, I've got two books for you.  And that's pretty cool.

Dot com slash twit to start with maybe a pornel Niven classic.  When I first joined, they didn't.  Yeah.  Jerry says, yeah.  When I first started listening to audible, they were a little disappointing on sci fi.  And then they started the audible frontiers program where they actually record sci fi in their studios.  There's a lot of books, Heinlein books and stuff that were never in audio are for the first time available in audio.  And it's really great.  Yes.

And so, you know, her cells were a major breakthrough.  Her cancer cells were a major breakthrough in science, led to a number of major breakthroughs.  But there's also the story itself is interesting and sad and disturbing.  There's institutionalized racism.  There's all kinds of interesting and somewhat disturbing pieces.  But the story has a life of its own because her family sued over this.  And because her cells, she didn't necessarily know what they were going to do with their cells and agreed to it.  And anyway, it's a fascinating, fascinating story.  And it's a great listen.  There's almost a performance in there at one point where there's some really amazing stuff that happens.  And the voice actor basically goes from sort of reading it to kind of exclaiming.  And there's a great interview with the author at the end that has some great stuff there, too.  So, yeah, great, great listen.

Start time: 2499.88
End time: 2554.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually sat on a podcast that I didn't think that they would do an event just devoted to the Apple Watch.  I think maybe totally wrong.  It has been six months.  They probably got a lot of details to report.  They want to get people excited about the watch again in advance.  It may be that this is when they also see the press with demo units that that could happen.  Usually, it's not unusual.  It would be unusual if they give them to them three weeks before they ship.  And if it ships in April, that would be that would sort of be the timing.  But that wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're doing, too.  And since this is a different kind of product because we already know that it exists.  So they don't have to play as coy as they would with a product that was brand new.  We all know that this exists.  And in fact, Apple employees wear them around.  And they're allowed to.  The people who work at Apple who have an Apple Watch are allowed to wear it around.  It's not a secret that they're wearing an Apple Watch.  They just won't answer any questions about it.

Start time: 2554.14
End time: 2559.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think Nick Bilton of the Times told us that there are one thousand Apple employees wearing watches now.

Start time: 2559.63
End time: 2590.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen them.  And they're happy to say, yeah, that's an Apple Watch.  They just don't want to talk to you about it.  I read an article that said they're putting it in a Samsung that makes it look like a Samsung watch.  I don't think that's true anymore.  I think that was when they were working on them to hide.  Now, everybody knows that they're making watch.  They know what it looks like.  They just won't tell you.  They're not going to give you a demo.  They won't lift up their wrist and say, here, let me show you all the apps that they're not allowed to do that.  But it's out there.  So to show that to the media and give members of the media review units and tell more of the story of the Apple Watch wouldn't surprise me.  That's what most or all of that event is.

Start time: 2592.18
End time: 2603.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has to be.  I mean, just the fact that it says spring forward.  That's such a time.  No, it's a watch.  Yeah, exactly.  Spring forward is all about setting your clock forward.  And it's your babouino.  Where they usually do these big events.

Transcript:  Apples apparently, according to supply chain, made more than five million.  Some say even a lot more than five million.

Start time: 2750.12
End time: 2816.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they were actually down.  That was downplaying it.  Honestly, one of the analysts said that they're going to sell over 20 million, which I think there's no way there's no way they will sell over 20 million.  That's either Gart.  One of the one I won't say because, you know, whatever.  But one of the analysts was saying they're going to sell over 20 million of these.  And here's here's what I'm in the first year in the first year.  In 2014 calendar year.  I know this 2015.  OK, so this year 2015 and Apple, I think, releasing that information that they've made five million.  I think that was their way of tamping down expectations and saying, you know, because obviously they I think they leaked that.  And I think that was their way of tamping down expectations for that whole 20 million business that some of the analysts were saying.  So I think, you know, when when the iPad first came out, if we just compare it to the iPad, which was a device that nobody really knew what they they needed and what they were going to do with.  And it went everybody expected it to sell five million and it sold 15 in its first year.  I think that sort of made sense because there are some things you could do with it.  And especially it was a full computer.

Start time: 2816.42
End time: 2825.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A watch is not under in any by any means a full computer.  It's a second display for your phone.  Yes. And I who needs a second display.

Start time: 2826.64
End time: 2837.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. The people who should be getting excited about this, I don't see getting excited about it.  And that's what worries me and makes me think that there's no way they're going to sell 20 million.  I kind of agree with you.

Start time: 2837.56
End time: 2849.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  On the other hand, betting against Apple has never done well for me.  Not recently. Not not in a long time.  So I, you know, these guys seem to have the glitter gold dust something.

Start time: 2849.65
End time: 2868.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're bound to slip up eventually.  Jason is totally right that when there are I would say unexpected or unrealistic expectations out in the market,  that's when you see a story that leaks.  I think that says, well, that's a little bit much.  Right. Just because you don't want you don't want unrealistic expectations if you're happy to manage that.

Start time: 2869.34
End time: 2917.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I do think that this is not the watch that Apple wanted it to be.  We saw the story in The Wall Street Journal, again, probably leaked from Apple, but no one knows that said  that they wanted to have more health sensors.  But for battery reasons, technology reasons and FDA FDA reasons, they couldn't put all those health monitors into it.  And I think Tim Cook saying Apple's watch will replace your car keys is a great example of lowering expectations.  It's like, OK.  OK.  Because, you know, first of all, I don't even I have a fob.  Is that what he's talking about?  And that wouldn't they have to make a deal with the car company before that would happen?  And how many car companies they made that deal with?  And that's just if this is the selling point, this isn't going to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I like my Android Wear watch.  I think it does. Yeah, it's not more than a second screen, but I can talk to it just as I'll be able to.  But they don't compete, at least unless you consider it sort of secondarily.

Start time: 2940.09
End time: 2972.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those watches work on Android.  The Apple watch works on Apple stuff.  Almost no watch works on both.  And if it does something like the Pebble, the APIs are so much richer on Android and Apple's never going to let Pebble have access to what the Apple watch has access to.  So really what this is about is how many iPhone users are there out there who are using the five and beyond, because that's what it's compatible with.  And how many of them want to buy this accessory feeling that it will upgrade their iPhone experience?  That's your total market. How big is that market?  It's a big market.  I mean, you've seen the volume of iPhones that Apple has sold.

So that might lend credence to having maybe a few fifteen thousand dollar items in the store in the back.  Yeah.  They also might be putting in carpet because Johnny Ive said, well, I would never buy an Apple Watch without carpeting.  That sounds like a hint that the Apple stores are going to.

I remember if I want to monitor my health, I'll buy one of these gadgets from the kids that are making them now that do take take a blood sample and not only do the sugar, but about 90 percent of the everything else that they do in in labs.  You just put your finger in it, it won't go and it connects to your computer and there it goes on the box about the size of my diabetes shooter sugar meter.  This is there.  They're not going to do that with Apple.  And I can get it for a lot less than the Apple watch.

Transcript:  Yeah, I've kind of said this before, but I'll say it again when they first announced the Apple, I would have been more I would have been more excited about this.  If it was if it was less of sort of an old school watch and more of there was some great concept art that a couple of people did on like a Nike fuel band with more of a like a longer display.  It had some interesting touch gestures and all of that kind of thing.  I think something like that that broke the mold a little bit would have been they would have sold a lot more.  They probably would have had a lower price point, you know, it would have been like one ninety nine or something like that.  Here is a watch.

Transcript:  It's a they're like out pebbling pebble with their look there.  I you know, I think that this is a lesson that is worth applying to the Apple watch, too, which is, you know, Apple's not trying to reach everybody.  They are trying to reach a portion of rich volleyball players who've already bought the iPhone.  We already know the iPhone is the hot in the high end smartphone market, which when you're going to buy and they do pretty well.  Well, I really wish that the that stainless steel model was not going to be seven hundred if it was five hundred.  I don't know. It's going to be the cheap one because I'm going to be cheap and I'm going to get there.  I think that's what I like the look of the one.  I think the Apple Watch is water resistant.  Oh, Tim Cook. This is this is how crazy Apple Kremlin ology is right now.  Tim Cook mentioned that he wears his Apple Watch in the shower and that made everybody say, oh, well, it may be more waterproof than previously understood to be OK.  Whatever. But it's I would say water resistant is the safe.  Any any get it wet, but don't go diving anymore.

Well, so Brian Chen in The New York Times, former Macworld editor, actually proud to say he reported he's got some good sources and he reported what seemed to be maybe controlled leaks about the battery life that they're they're planning a mode that is an extreme low power mode that actually displays the time because I think they were all worried about this idea that it basically the screens off unless you jiggle it.  Right. That's how most Android wear.  But to get to save battery life, to save battery life that, you know, a lot of watches do that.  So it sounds to me like they're still targeting, you know, you can use it for a whole day and you'll be able to see it.  So we'll see. But it seems to be that Apple's trying to express that they are going to hit their battery life goals.

Transcript:  OK, so this is crazy.  So you remember that the first Pebble watch was one of the very earliest Kickstarter successes, raised five million dollars.  It blew everybody away in a month.  That created the Pebble watch four days in no five days in.  They were looking for half a million.  They've got eleven point seven million.  What the hell?  This to me shows the Kickstarter is now basically a pre-ordering service because you're not you're not like investing it or fostering a new innovation.  You're saying, hey, I got to get that watch.

Start time: 3500.22
End time: 3562.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's let's put this in perspective.  It's about sixty thousand watches that they've sold, which is nice for them.  That's good for them.  Sixty thousand.  They claim a million total of the original Pebble.  So when they had been selling that for two and a half years now, I mean, I've had a Pebble for two years.  Would you want to start?  It was delayed.  You know, it's what I said before.  I like my Pebble and I've enjoyed my two years with it.  But as an iPhone user, they are really limited in what they can do because Apple all watch features Apple is putting into the iPhone are geared to the Apple watch.  And if I'm going to use an iPhone and I want a smart watch, I'm going to need the Apple watch.  If I'm using Android, I think it's really compelling because it's not one of these last for a day color screen kind of backlit LCD screen kind of deals.  They're e paper.  What is e paper?  It's not e paper.  It's e paper.  It's like it's like an LCD screen color LCD and it lasts a week and it does use some of the Android Wear APIs.  So it does have good integration with Android.  And I think it's compelling and it's cheap.  It's not you know, it's not a super expensive model.  So it's kind of compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple will sell more in one month than Pebble has sold in its whole lifetime.  And I'm a skeptic of the Apple watch, obviously.  But Apple will sell more in one month than Pebble sold the whole time.  But I sat next to Eric Mijekowski, the CEO and kind of founder of Pebble at CES at a dinner last year.  And he said something so compelling, I thought, which is we're not competing with other smartwatch makers, really.  There are people who are going to like our products.  We do certain things well.  Other products do their thing.  He said we're competing with people who don't want to wear watches anymore.  And I think that's still the case.  And it's going to be the case for Apple watch just as much as it is for Pebble and others.  It's competing with the fact that fewer and fewer people are wearing watches because it's one thing that you can get rid of.  Another thing with your smartphone that you don't have to have.  The smartphone has consolidated so many different devices, so many different things, the functions of so many different tools.  And the watch is one of them.  And so getting people to put a watch back on is probably unlikely.  But kind of like what Jason was saying, Jason Snow was saying, was that what they're really going after and where they're making a bet is that of those sort of almost 200 million people that bought an iPhone last year,  that's going to be compatible with this thing, that a pretty high percentage of them, all they need is 5% of them, 5 to 10% of them who already do wear watches and want to have a smart watch and are willing to shell out money for an accessory.  And they've got a great market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're totally right that the number one competitor for every smart watch is not wearing a watch.  That is number one.  Number two is maybe the competition.  But number one is I don't want to wear a watch.  What I will say is I totally get watch skepticism at the same time.  There was a time when people carried watches in their pockets and then they started strapping them on their wrists and pocket watches went away because people thought it was more convenient to look at something on their wrist.  That could happen again.  That could totally happen.  I'm not saying it will, but it could.  There are some advantages to glancing on your wrist instead of pulling something out of your pocket.

Start time: 3704.26
End time: 3727.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me point out that the real competition is with people like me who don't want to take the damn thing off at night.  Or when they take a shower or when they go swimming or take a bath.  They just want to put it on and leave it there and have it tattooed on if they knew how to do it and care if it keeps down.

There's something compelling about this, maybe because of years of sci-fi and Hal 9000 and all that.  But I just like the idea of a little plastic pal that's fun to be with.  I want to be able to talk to my little friend and ask him questions.  Nice reference.  We're going to take a break.  We'll come back.  There is a lot more to talk about, including a landmark decision from the FCC.  That's why Jerry is here to school us all on why this is a bad idea.  Before we do that, though, let's talk about a brand new sponsor.  We're welcoming ShipStation to the Twitter network.  I first found out about ShipStation when I used it on Squarespace.  This is so cool.  If you do fulfillment, if you ship things, shipstation.com, it could take your orders from eBay, from Amazon, from Etsy,  more than 50 popular marketplaces and shopping carts,  easily create shipping labels for all the top carriers.  You see them right there, UPS, FedEx, of course, the Postal Service.  You'll get a free U.S. Postal Service account that gives you access to deeply discounted shipping rates,  the same rates that in the past only Fortune 500 companies have been able to get.  ShipStation.com, it is the number one choice of online sellers,  and they have an incredible 98% customer satisfaction rating.  If you do fulfillment, even international shipping with DHL, you'll get the best prices, best service.  It couldn't be easier.  I mean, it's completely automated.  And right now, and I really want you to take advantage of this, you can try it for free for 30 days  and get an additional 30 days when you use the offer code TWIT.  60 days total.  Go to ShipStation.com.  Before you do anything else, click the microphone.  It's a little tiny one right at the top of the page there, a little tiny, little itty bitty microphone.  And do enter in TWIT as the offer code, and you'll turn that free 30-day trial into a 60-day trial,  and you will love it.  ShipStation.com.  We really like technology companies that make life easier, and this is one.  If you do any shipping at all, you must use ShipStation.com.  Okay.  We came in, actually was just here by chance.  Was it Wednesday morning?  Tuesday?  Thursday.  Yeah, it was my day off.  I happened to be here.  Just to, just I was doing a thing on Marketplace.  By the way, if you haven't heard of the Marketplace Tech, it was fun.  They do a number thing.  We have a little contest.  I did that on Thursday for Friday's air, and I happened to be here.  And then I noticed that the chat room was talking about the FCC.  They were streaming the hearing live for one of the most important votes,  actually two of the most important votes the FCC has ever made.  A little history on this.  The chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, who John Oliver called a dingo  because he said letting Tom Wheeler watch over the Internet  is like letting a dingo watch your baby.  Tom Wheeler, former Hall of Famer.  No, actually still a Hall of Famer for the National Cable Association,  for the Wireless Association, a lobbyist appointed by Barack Obama  to be chairman of the FCC, had attempted, as his predecessor had,  Julius Genachowski, to create open Internet rules.  Verizon sued.  The FCC was thwarted.  The judges in that case said, well, look, and this is well known,  the FCC can only do what Congress tells it.  It has the power to do.  It has to have a congressional mandate.  The FCC said, you know what, Verizon's, or the court said,  you know what, Verizon's right.  You can't promulgate open Internet rules.  You have no jurisdiction.  But the court did an interesting thing.  Sometimes they do this.  They gave them a hint.  They said, now, were you to invoke the Telecommunications Act  and declare broadband providers to be telecommunications companies  instead of information services, as you have declared them?  You would have standing.  You would have jurisdiction.  You could tell them what to do.  FCC put on its thinking cap.  Tom Wheeler asked for comments, got four million comments  swapping the FCC.gov site.  The vast majority of those comments coming partly because of  John Oliver's piece on This Week Tonight, but also EFF and Epic  and many of the other organizations.  They got a brief from many big tech companies, all of them  promoting this use of the Telecommunications Act and Title II  of the Telecom Act to declare that broadband companies were  telecommunications providers.  We had a debate.  We had two ISPs, one, Dane Jasper from Sonic.net, who said,  I, for one, welcome Title II regulation.  Another small ISP from Laramie, Wyoming, Brett Glass, who said,  oh, my God, you don't want that.  Glass has already tweeted, I'm going to sue.  AT&T has said, I'm going to sue because on Thursday, the FCC  voted along party lines three to two to adopt Title II regulation.  They declared broadband companies to be telecommunications companies.  They say, we have a 300-page document.  One of these days, we're going to show you.  We'll let you read it someday.  Someday, we'll let you read it.  That will be the rules.  They had a second vote, which I think was in some ways equally  important and maybe shows that their hearts are in the right place,  saying that they were going to restrict the abilities of state  legislatures to prevent municipal internet access.  Towns like Chattanooga have really done a great job of providing  gigabit internet access to their residents.  Twenty state legislatures at the behest and under the lobbying of  the telecom companies have made laws prohibiting that.  The FCC says, we're going to overturn.  We're going to re-regulate those out of existence.  We're going to give, because I think we all agree, Jerry, you, I'm sure agree,  the best way to solve this is with real competition.  It's just something we don't have right now.  There are only, for 86% of the Americans, two choices, your phone company  or your cable company for high-speed internet.

Transcript:  This is one of the things that Ben Thompson,  who's been on this show from Strutecary, said is,  he likes this ruling, but he says it will lead to metered access,  where you pay for more bandwidth,  which is probably the right thing to do,  but that's where this will probably lead.

Transcript:  What you don't want, though, is a cable-like situation where,  and I think this, see, my feeling is that Comcast, Verizon, AT&T,  quite rightly, are acting as a business.  They're attempting to maximize profit for their shareholders.  And of course, the best way to do that would be to charge for access  to Internet providers, people like Twit.  We are a content creator.  I can see them coming to me and saying,  you know, our customers are watching a lot of Twit.  You better start paying us if you want a decent performance.  This would prevent that.  Now, maybe we will have to change how we think about pricing.  Leo, the president of AT&T, a long time ago, said that,

Transcript:  If 86% of Americans have two choices,  both of which are big companies,  their cable company and their phone company,  who have already shown that they're predisposed  to squeeze them for as much as they can get,  I don't think that's competition.  I think we all agree that fostering competition is a good thing,  and that was the second vote.  I think that's a good thing.  Adam Smith said in Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith's first book,

Transcript:  there never was a time when two countries were competing  for the same thing.  There never was a time when two capitalists sat down to have tea,  but that the conversation turned to how to make government  restrict competition with them.  He didn't put it quite that way, but that's what he said.  Do you really believe that you, as opposed to a lobbyist for Comcast,  will have more influence over the FCC when it's all done?

Start time: 4503.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think there's evidence that we did.  I think Tom Wheeler, who is in fact, was for a long time,  a lobbyist for both wireless and cable,  probably didn't want to do this, but received four million comments.  I think those four million comments swayed the president,  who does have to get elected.  It does appoint the chairman of the FCC,  and ultimately I think the president swayed the chairman of the FCC  to listen to the people.  I do think we have a lot of power, in fact, in this regard.  Ultimately, we elect them or unelect them,  and as long as people care, the citizens of the Internet care  about Internet access, we have no sway with Comcast.  We have no sway with AT&T.  There's no question about that.  It's supposed to be a government by the people for the people,  and I think we ought to act as if it is, and we do need to...  There's also a local government.  Who would agree that some regulation is necessary?  You'd agree that antitrust laws, for instance, are necessary.

Start time: 4557.16
End time: 4596.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love antitrust laws, but now, for instance,  in the first place, you understand the Congress,  as soon as it gets past the veto power of Obama,  is going to take all this away.  The Congress has made it very clear they did not intend for Title II  to apply to the Internet.  The Internet grew by having essentially no regulation, or damn little.  So you're dealing with a temporary situation,  and in fact, by the time it can be implemented,  it probably won't have...  It will have changed the administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in one sense, this is a moot point, because by the time this stuff gets to the courts,  we'll have had another big election, and you'll find out  whether your four million comments were really comments from people  who just suddenly spontaneously sent them,  or they were kind of curried by the people who wanted that kind of content.  I think that... I just think...  I think Congress intended, for instance, for Chattanooga  not to be able to provide wireless to its people.

And that's happened in 20 states.  But I think that you're right.  If people say government sucks, regulations suck, we have nothing to do with it.  If they take the cynical route, you're right.  But I think this is a case where people are starting to realize  the citizens of the Internet care an awful lot about this stuff.  And I think we are voters, and we are going to vote this.

Transcript:  And I've noticed that more and more users kind of tune out a little bit.  And I think that one of the reasons they do is they expect, and I think they're right,  is that we're still going to be talking about this in 10 years.  We may still be talking about it in 20 years.  Because if we agree that, as it now is, that the Internet is a vehicle of public good, and it is,  and there are now services, goods and services, but especially in government services and other things,  that you cannot access unless you have a decent connection to the Internet or cannot access as well or research or...  Anyway, all of those things are true.  And the Internet is a function of public good.  And the question now is, if that vehicle of public good is in the hands of private companies in a capitalist society like ours,  there is going to be a natural tension over to what they should do and what they can do, what they can't do, and what we want them to do.  And so as long as that is the case, as long as this vehicle of the public good is in the hands of these private capitalistic companies,  then the people have an idea of this trust that they're giving them to something that is now integral to the lives of everyday people  to live their lives and to do many of the things that they need to do.  We're going to be having this debate indefinitely.  Well, I think...

Start time: 4811.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I understand the fear, I think everybody shares, of government run amok and regulating the Internet out of existence  or limiting the kinds of content or charging license fees to people like me.

Transcript:  There never were two capitalists sat down to have tea, but what they discussed, how to get government to eliminate competition.  Not between them. They'll live with that. But newcomers, oh, we don't need those.  This is really giving the government the power to decide who can compete.  Now, if that's a good idea, fine. The best way, easiest way to do it, of course, it's a licensed website.

Start time: 4897.34
End time: 4913.54

It's never going to happen. What would they prefer? What would you prefer?  I mean, you could make up all sorts of perils that might happen. It's never going to happen.

End time: 4938.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only point out that they have the power.  Yeah, but you don't think it's actually going to happen, do you?  Then for God's sakes, have a net neutrality act that specifies what they can do.  I'd love to see that.  I want it because they can do everything. And so anything you do is all right, but you really shouldn't just license websites.

Start time: 4939.64
End time: 4953.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nobody's going to license websites, Jerry. But if the Congress could write a good net neutrality act, I mean, you said Congress will overturn this. They will.  And if they overturn it with a good net neutrality rule and say, FCC, here are the rules, would you be happy with that?

Start time: 4971.02

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've worked in radio for years where the FCC has a lot of power and sometimes is not well loved because of their ability to find people for using bad words and other things.  And yet FCC regulation of radio has not really been a problem. I think it's gone quite well, frankly.  But I don't I certainly don't relish the notion they might regulate websites or regulate podcasts.

And Dick asked him, well, what happens if somebody shakes it? He said, Oh, don't worry.  We drill holes and with all the aluminum filings fall out of the Etch A Sketch so you can shake it all you want.  Nothing will happen. Just turn that one over and you could see the holes.  He did and it erased the Etch A Sketch.  There were holes, but apparently they neglected to empty the aluminum filings out.  The guy wasn't too devastated. He said, Oh, well, that was only about 10 hours of work.  I'd have been a little peep. And by the way, we're sending Chad to the doctor after drinking Petaluma River water.

Bigger every year, you know? Bigger every year.  And you get to go to Barcelona, so there's that.  Can't beat that. Love to be there right now.  Oh, man. You notice I've got snacks. When friends have a disagreement, the best solution is to break out snacks.  I wish I could send you some of these, Jerry. Do you like snacks? Yeah.  Who doesn't like? Well, what about garlic plantains or cherry vanilla granola?  How about jalapeno cashews? These are the ones we've been eating.  Sarah and I went through a whole bag of these yesterday. Strawberry Greek yogurt pretzels. Oh, they're so good.  Now, this is all from a company called Nature Box. These are nutritionist approved.  These are not. This is not the snack you get out of your snack machine at work.  These are deliciously awesome snacks made with great ingredients.  No artificial flavors, no artificial colors, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats, no artificial sweeteners.  Just good stuff that tastes great. Sweet, savory, spicy. You get to choose.  They have snacks that are vegan if you wish or gluten free. You can choose for dietary needs.  I think you're going to love Nature Box. We've set it up so you can get a free trial.  Five of their most popular snacks. Just pay two bucks in shipping when you go to naturebox.com slash twit.  Naturebox.com slash twit. Jalapeno white cheddar popcorn. Cashew power clusters.

I think you're right Jerry that the Congress will probably try to do something. We'll see what happens.  Verizon's Public Policy Blog, which emphasized as you did that these rules came from 1934,  they published their response in Morse code, the dominant technology of the era, I guess.  Has anybody translated? Oh yeah, they did.  Snarky.  That's snark. That's snark.  Let's see. What else is in the news here real quickly? Oh, security.  You saw Steve Gibson talk a little bit about the Commodia virus. This broke last week.  We talked about the fact that Lenovo had put adware on some of their laptop systems, the consumer grade laptops,  adware called Superfish. The adware was bad enough, frankly, because what it did is watch everything you did on the internet,  use the Superfish technology to match images. So if you go to Amazon and you start looking at drones,  and then put ads onto the Amazon web, additional ads for competitors onto the Amazon web pages.  Lenovo's defense was, we thought customers would like that. But worse was the fact that Superfish didn't implement this very well.  They, of course, wanted to crack into SSL streams. They couldn't see into those. So they licensed a product called Commodia, K-O-M-O-D-I-A.  Steve does a great dissection of this on Security Now on our Wednesday episode a couple of days ago.  But Commodia turns out, not only is it so badly written that it's a massive security flaw, but it's used by hundreds, literally, of other programs.  How To Geek, which had done a great piece on these download.com sites. I'm sorry, Jason, CBSinteractivesdownload.com.  Can you do anything about them?

Transcript:  Somebody, I keep giving these guys a hard time. So a couple of months ago, they did a great piece.  Here's what happens when you install the top 10 apps on download.com. These are programs, download.com, kind of as a convenience to you, offers for download.  All of them shareware, freeware from other sources. But download.com wraps this software in their own delivery mechanism.  And after, so How To Geek says, danger, do not try this at home. In fact, they used, I think they used a virtual machine.  So they went there and they looked at the 10 most popular downloads, Avast, AVG, KM Player, Yax, Ccleaner, free YouTube downloader, Driver Booster.  You know, some of it kind of junky, but most of it pretty good. They downloaded it all.  And they were, and by the way, and this is the key, agreed in every instance to accept the additional software that was wrapped around it.  It was a mess. Browser hijacking software, adware, none of it technically viruses because all of it had an uninstall feature.  In every case you had to accept it. There was nothing sneaked on your machine, although one might say that some of this was a little surreptitious.  So they've done a follow up on this. And it turns out that two of these programs have Commodia in them.  So now you're really screwed. So Commodia is everywhere. What it does is break SSL.  And by it does so in about as brain dead a way as you can do it. They do it with the same key for all machines.  And they have, I think, a very difficult to do password Commodia. K-O-M-O-D-I-A.  So download.com and others are are now bundling Superfish style HTTPS breaking adware. Now, can you do anything, Jason?  Not a word. I don't want to get you in trouble with your bosses. It's not your fault. Tech Republic does not do this.  No. Yeah. And just stop using download.com would be my best. Get the get the software from the original source.  And if you do actually, apparently somebody saying that Java, the Oracle download of Java breaks HTTPS encryption.  The LavaSoft web companion, which is supported by these offers, according to Oracle. Oh, dear.  The LavaSoft web companion. You also get results Bay Chocolate Bar and slow PC fighter. Holy cow. Just a mess.  So while I was really upset with Lenovo, I have to point out they're not the only ones.  And a lot of this stuff is all over the Internet. So stay away. The funny funny thing about LavaSoft is they're the companies that make  Ad aware the ad removal and blocking software and they use Commodia. A lot of antiviruses apparently use Commodia.

They did say, we'll see if they do this, that they're not going to put any ad where on there.  They say we don't really make that much. We're going to stop bundling Adware and trialware entirely. Good. That'd be a great thing. That'd be a great development.  Wouldn't it? Microsoft tried to do this with the signature PCs and nobody went along with it. It was there was very few companies. Vizio did. I don't know where you if you can still I don't think you can get a video.  I forgot they made me see that. Yeah, it was a very brief shining moment. So we'll see. We'll see. Google has turned an about faces kind of an interesting development on Wednesday. We talked about this on twig.  Google had announced that they would ban adult content on blogger that if you had adult content, you would have to make your blogger blog private.  They changed their porn policy. This week we announced a change to bloggers porn policy. We've had a ton of feedback, a ton of feedback, including in particular about the introduction of a retroactive change.  Some people have had accounts for 10 plus years, but also on the negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities.  Jessica plegeo social projects product support manager at Google blog owners should continue to mark any blogs containing sexual explicit content as adults so that they can be placed behind an adult content warning page.  But we're not going to shut you down.

Transcript:  The problem with this kind of thing is that who decides, you know, not like there's lots of people, you know, myself included, who don't necessarily want to, you know, look at that kind of stuff or whatever.  But the thing is, who decides and what do they ban? And that's where this is such a slippery slope and why, you know, if you believe in free speech and you believe that as part of a just society that, you know, you have to have you have to have some freedom of expression.  Then, you know, you kind of you have to question these kinds of things.  You know, the great example is Facebook.  You know, Facebook had this policy where they were taking down and banning accounts or, you know, censoring accounts of women breastfeeding.  But then they were leaving up all kinds of other, you know, sexually explicit stuff.  Right. So obviously they were making poor choices.  And the problem is, once you it's a slippery slope, once you decide, you know, that you're going to start banning because it's like then the questions of who and what is where it gets to be a serious problem.  And I don't trust Google to do it any more than I trust Facebook.  And so, yeah, I think that this is an Apple.  The same thing like Apple's trying to have it in their own way in the app store as well.  They maybe do a little bit better job that don't things that don't make news.  But there are still things I've heard, you know, behind the scenes were sort of weird things get banned for odd reasons.  So it's tough. Right.  And if you believe in a free society, you know, has to have a measure of freedom of expression and freedom to be able to publish, you know, then then you kind of have to questions these kind of things.

Transcript:  I actually got in a conversation with Jeff Jarvis tonight.  I was I was observing it with a pornographer on Twitter.  And the pornographer said, actually, we we would welcome this move from Google.  We want to keep adult stuff, you know, in an adult place, maybe dot xxx or whatever.  And we don't want people running across it.  That makes it hard for us to do business.  And frankly, a lot of the adult content on blogger and Tumblr is stolen from us in the first place.  So we would welcome kind of this decision from these companies to keep adult content off.  We wouldn't welcome anybody would say no adult content on the Internet.  But let's put it somewhere that kids aren't going to stumble on it.  And then we don't get all the heat that we get.  Huh. But I agree with you.  I think it's but what is pornography?  What is erotica? What is an expression of art?  You know, Leonard Nimoy was a great.

And in fact, she is a porn star in that movie.  Now, do you is that an art movie, which most people say it is?  Absolutely.  Or is it just a way of hiding porn?  Right.  And who decides?

One of his books was of large women, nudes.  Yeah.  And that certainly was not pornography, but might be banned under a policy like this.  So I think Google did the right thing.  They back down.

Transcript:  That reminds me of a Leonard Nimoy story that I meant to say earlier.  Oh, yeah.  Leonard Nimoy, since we're getting toward the end.  One of the great things that came out, you know, he was sort of notoriously.  I don't know, irascible, you know, not necessarily always the friendliest person to sort of be on set with and that kind of thing.  But Roddenberry called him the conscience of Star Trek.  And I thought it was really there's a really great story that came out about him.  I thought that would sort of be appropriate in sort of a week or remembering him, which was where the business before he was a big star.  When Star Trek got started and he found out, you know, somehow whatever people talk, you know, what the other stars were kind of making.  And he discovered that Nichelle Nichols, you know, African-American woman, a who?  A who?  A who?  Yes, was making considerably less than the others, even with similar credentials and all of that.  And he was outraged by it and took it to the studio and spoke up about it and stood up for her and said that, you know, that it was wrong, even though he wasn't a big star.  And basically that, you know, that he was going to, you know, he threatened them, you know, at that point in terms of and even though he's not the main star.  And it worked and got, you know, Nichelle Nichols.  She talks about it in the People magazine kind of thing.  But I just think that's a great that's a cool story to remember about somebody, you know, that passed away this week that meant a lot to a lot of people in the science and tech space.  And, you know, what a cool thing for him to do and stand up and make a difference.

Transcript:  This episode of Twitter brought to you by our great friends at Squarespace.  My daughter just started her Squarespace.  I'm really proud of her.  She had an idea for a website she wanted to create with a friend as a public service.  It was going to be a blog.  And I told her all the choices.  I said, you know, you can get it for free.  But she independently, I don't even think she knew that we love Squarespace or they're a sponsor or we use them independently came up with Squarespace.  She said, Dad, I know it's eight dollars a month, but is it okay?  And I said, yes, it is okay.  Squarespace, they wanted a site that would look great, be responsive.  They could take donations and Squarespace can do it.  I love Squarespace.  I love Squarespace.  And by the way, it's the best hosting ever.  Never goes down.  The best support ever.  Live chat and email support 24 7 from the Squarespace offices in New York.  It is affordable.  Eight dollars a month.  That's all the hosting plus the great software.  And when you register for a year, you even get the domain name.  All Squarespace sites are something really important nowadays.  Responsive.  Used to be remember you'd have a mobile site and a desktop site.  Well, now everybody's on mobile.  Screen sizes are all over the place.  Responsive is the way one site fits all.  And Squarespace sites do it.  They scale to look great on any device.  When you upload an image, nine thumbnails are made so that you automatically have the right size for the right device.  It's so great.  Every Squarespace site comes with a free online store.  And by the way, the e-commerce solution on Squarespace, 24 dollars a month and you get everything, including ShipStation, really is nice.  Cover pages, something new on Squarespace 7 lets you set up a beautiful one page online presence in minutes.  So you can create a landing page for your brand, your personal identity, to promote a product.  Squarespace has great apps on the iPhone and iPad and Android devices.  In fact, if you're a photographer, I think there's really no better place for you to go to put your portfolio.  Because not only are you going to get a great portfolio style to look like your style to fit your aesthetic,  but you also get a great portfolio app on the iPad that'll actually pull the images from your site so you can show them to clients.  That's all part of Squarespace.  I want you to try it.  One of the nicest things about Squarespace is you can go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button, and with no credit card, no information, basically an email address, a password, a name for the site,  you've got two weeks to create a site.  You can import content from your old site.  You can really play with all the templates.  And of course, the content is completely separate from the template.  So you can try them all.  See how your stuff looks?  Customize your little heart out.  Only thing I ask when you decide you want to sign up, and I wish Abby knew this, make sure you use the offer code TWIT.  You'll get 10% off your purchase.  I think she just signed up without doing that.  But that's okay, Abby. That's okay.  I'm happy you're using Squarespace.  We want to thank Squarespace for their support of this week in tech.  Squarespace, build it beautiful.  That's what Jeff Bridges did.  If you haven't visited his dream site yet, it's exactly what you'd expect from the dude.  Squarespace.com, use the offer code TWIT.  Still kind of trying to figure out the deal with Jamalto.  Jamalto, which makes two billion SIM cards a year, is used by most of the mobile companies in the world, including, I think, all the US mobile companies, was in the most recent Snowden leaks implicated.  I think it was a Snowden leak that they said Jamalto had been hacked by the NSA and had all of the encryption keys for the SIM cards.  And was able, therefore, to spy on anybody using a phone with a Jamalto SIM card.  Jamalto said, whoa, hold on there. Wait a minute.  Did an investigation.  And they did, in fact, say we detected attacks in 2010 and 2011.  Gives us reasonable grounds to believe an operation by the NSA and GCHQ, the British spy agency, probably happened.  But they reassured everybody the attacks against Jamalto only breached its office networks and could not have resulted in a massive theft of SIM encryption keys.  The operation aimed to enter except the encryption keys as they were exchanged between mobile operators and their suppliers globally.  By 2010, we had widely deployed already widely deployed a secure transfer system.  And only rare exceptions to this scheme could have led to the theft.  So basically they say none of our products were impacted.  In the case of an eventual key theft, the intelligence services would only be able to spy on communications on second generation 2G mobile networks.  3G and 4G networks are not vulnerable.  So believe what you want.  But Jamalto says didn't happen.  And if it did, don't worry.  Unless you're on a 2G network.

And I actually set up an account and started putting up stories until I realized they're deleted in 24 hours.  That's a lot of work for nothing.  But big brands got involved, including Yahoo.  Katie Kirk does a daily newscast on Snapchat.  Yes, she does.  ESPN, many channels.  And apparently these stories are generating a lot of views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's they they did that for a limited number of partners.  Big partners.  And big partners.  Big partners.  Right.  And you can tell it's funny when I look at discover, when I open that thing up, I hear the voices of a venture capitalist in the background saying, hey, what if we got some big brands and then we got them to produce these short clips about the same piece like Snapchat and we put those in their own little section on the site?  I mean, it totally reeks of that kind of thing because it's so different than the actual experience of what Snapchat is, that discover feature.  And actually some of it's kind of compelling.  I actually enjoy the Katie Kirk bit.

Like all the it's kind of like Facebook.  Like now all the adults are coming in and like sending them friend requests and stuff.  And they're like, OK, that's it.  It's over.

Transcript:  Gina Trapani did too.  She loves USC.  So that's I think this is a good use of it.  So this is an ESPN headline app.  And just like Snapchat, you swipe and you get the next story.  I'm sorry.  It's loading slowly here.  I don't know if that's our network.  I think Snapchat does a lot of caching and because I never use it, it's taking its time.  But you get that you get a sense of what this can do.  This is the ESPN channel and these are only live for 24 hours.  So what is what is Tech Republic do?

Start time: 6768.32
End time: 6808.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we do more like behind the scenes kind of stuff talking about stories that we're doing and talking about things that are going on.  You know, we kind of have some humor, do some stuff in the newsroom.  The handles just the user names just at Tech Republic.  You know, it's it's just kind of some fun stuff and we do it in stories.  And, you know, we we try to, you know, be a little bit a little bit humorous and lighthearted.  A lot of our content's pretty intense stuff about, you know, you know, keeping the world running and make good decisions about technology and all that.  So so yeah, we try to do it in the spirit of a lot of the stuff that's already on Snapchat, not really around the sort of discover stuff.

Start time: 6808.30

End time: 6845.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's a separate CMS.  They have a CMS that nobody else has because, you know, Snapchat, everything else, you have to do it live.  You take a video, it's got to be live.  You can't import photos. You can't import videos.  Everything has to be filmed or snapped from the app itself.  And that's part of the immediacy of that platform.  But yeah, these folks are obviously shooting professional videos and uploading them and building them in some kind of CMS that nobody else has access.

Yeah.  I don't have any 20 million readers, but I have enough that they buy five, six hundred books a month.  Yeah, nor do we.  But you're right.  We can make a decent living.

And there's a 12 year old girl whose father has invented a little better spaceship and the government wants it.  And it will be an interesting story as to what she does.  You know, it's funny you say they're interesting aliens in your book because Jason Hyre has some interesting aliens in his book as well.

Start time: 7070.12
End time: 7163.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The book will be released later this year.  You know, we haven't released the people that are in it is kind of the fun part.  You know, we kind of released them, you know, a few weeks before or a few days before.  Actually, we we announced them before we released the chapter.  And after that, we released the book.  And so it gives you a chance to to read it.  We we'll do it up for a few weeks until the next chapter.  And, you know, a few weeks to a month until the next chapter is available.  Nice. So, yeah, yeah, it's it's it's not just me.  I have a co-author, Lindsay Gilpin.  We're co-writing it.  And we're going to be doing it for a few weeks.  And then we'll be doing it for a few weeks.  It's not just me. I have a co-author, Lindsay Gilpin.  We're co-writing it.  And it's been it's one of the coolest, funnest things that I've ever done.  And so I'm enjoying it a lot, enjoying the idea of trying to release a book and, you know,  really take advantage of the power of the Internet.  Because one of the things that we're doing when we release these chapters is we're asking people's feedback.  You know, what did you relate to in this story?  What was the part that you thought was most significant in their story?  What were the most important insights from their life, from their story that, you know,  you think will influence the future of of tech, of society, you know, of business?  And then we're going to take the best comments, the best stuff.  And when we release the final version of the book, we're going to put the we're going to publish the best comments at the end of each chapter.  And so people have a chance to have their voice included in the book as well.

I think what a lot of people didn't realize is, you know, what a, you know, what a tumultuous story she had.  So many challenges and so much adversity she had to overcome at different parts of her life.  And that really was something that we talk a lot about in the chapter.  And she was great.  She was really open about it and, you know, just gave us some some great material from her life.  And it was a lot of fun.  She's a she's an amazing person, very inspiring person.  Same thing with Barrett Tunde.  So inspiring.  Lots of adversity he's overcome as well.  And they both came up or, you know, used those things to do very unique, very innovative things.  They were both out front of a lot of trends and setting trends.  And that's a lot of what we end up getting to in each of their stories and each of their chapters.  We adore Lisa Bettany.

Transcript:  So the idea is we want each one to kind of be, you know, special.  We want to focus all the attention on one chapter at a time and have people and also have there to be some urgency to read it for that period that it's up.  Are you sure that's wise?  No.  I would myself think that is not wise.

Transcript:  If somebody sees there's a fourth chapter they've never heard of before, but they can't get the first three chapters.  What is the incentive for reading the fourth?  Well, each of the stories, the reason, Jerry, I was kidding when I said no.

Start time: 7298.30
End time: 7351.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the idea we have thought there's still a lot.  I mean, the idea is, you know, we have to be able to read the first three chapters.  I mean, the idea is each chapter does stand alone.  Each chapter is the story of one innovator and their story, you know, in particular.  And so our hope is that you get to chapter four and you read chapter four and you say, this is amazing.  I'd like to read more of this that they'll, you know, preorder the final book and say, OK, I want to read the rest of these stories.  And but one of the things that, you know, we've done is, you know, in nonfiction, you typically take a year to research a book and then you write, you know, that book.  And so by the time you get to, you know, that your two years removed from when you, you know, originally started this thing and when the book publishes and a lot has happened and changed in their life.  And so, you know, our thought is to release these as we go.  Then, you know, the information that we have in them is very current, is very up to date.

Transcript:  I think a little urgency is not a bad thing.  You got to go read it.  I put off reading Baratunde's story and now I'm kicking myself.  So I think that's, you know, it's not a bad thing to create a little scarcity, Jerry.

Start time: 7371.66
End time: 7381.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that you can't create scarcity.  I just copy the thing off and read it when I feel like if anybody has a copy of the Baratunde chapter.

Transcript:  Well, so the interesting thing is we haven't said, you know, one of the cool things about serial publishing,  one of the interesting things about publishing that way, and we saw this with the serial podcast, is that's a cliffhanger, right?  You can't wait to see sort of what happens next.  And so what we've done is we haven't said who's actually going to be next.  And that's part of the fun is creating a little bit of that interest and urgency.  And then we don't really announce it until a couple of days before we're going to release the chapter.  And then we say, you know, next is going to be chapter three will be that that that, you know, and then we'll we'll say, how are you doing with it?  You know, the great thing is we've gotten so much.  We also did a little bit of a crowdfunding campaign to kind of get it started because we're self publishing it and to sort of cover the cost of printing.  And, you know, we're going to do an audiobook.  So, you know, cover the cost of being able to hire somebody to do the audiobook and those kinds of things.  So the crowdfunding campaign did great.  We got the money that we needed to to do those kinds of things.  And then we've gotten so much amazing feedback from people that the one thing that I didn't expect was how many people honed in on this idea of doing a book in a new way and how many people were excited about this idea of innovating on the idea of how to do a book, you know, to take advantage of the power of the Web.  Both for drawing feedback and crowdfunding and then also releasing it serially on our site to sort of generate interest and immediate give people some immediate access to the information.  So that's the stuff that people have honed in on and have really been excited about much more than I expected.  I didn't know, you know, this idea is books have been done the way they've been done, you know, since Gutenberg and to do it a little differently is kind of a foreign idea.  And I've been surprised how many people were excited about that.

Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting pattern.  We just changed the rules of the Science Fiction Writers of America to allow self-published writers to join the organization.  It took three years of debating over it because you really don't.  It's not a fan organization and we do.  You're not interested in having members of people who would like to be writers but aren't yet.  So it took a long time for them to come up with it, but they came up with something that might work.  We'll see. Now I suspect that you're going to end up with more self-published writers than you are with traditional published writers and members.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Agree.  Actually, this is not completely novel.  I didn't know this. The chairman tells me that William Gibson did a book in the early 90s called Agrippa that disappeared as you read it.  So if you read the digital version, it would encrypt each page after reading it.  If you read the physical version, the pages were treated with photosensitive chemicals.  So as you read it, the words would fade and disappear.
