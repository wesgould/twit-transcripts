Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just registering my amusement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, John's in his country home right now, enjoying the Memorial Day weekend.  Happy Memorial Day weekend, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  Same to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very nice up here today.  I bet it is.  It's nice everywhere, isn't it?  It's required.  End of May is supposed to be nice.  We used to have a regular barbecue on Memorial Day.  Also with us, I'm really pleased, I think for the first time on TWIT, Dan Bricklin, who  is a pioneer in software, the guy who created VisiCalc about 8,000 years ago.  It seems like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30, 30 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, 30 years isn't that long ago, but in computer terms, it's ages.  It's half your life.  Yeah.  Dan, I'm so glad to have you on.  Look at this great shot we've got of Dan.  If you're watching the video, this is professional.  This is how John, you put the shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, so Dan, do you have a black cloth, felt cloth behind you?  What's the deal?  I sure do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want me to zoom out.  Yeah, let's see the whole set.  Let's see the whole set.  Let me zoom out here.  We can't see all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's doing the Charlie Rose thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see.  You can see I have my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the illusion is destroyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a backlight up there, you know, and a light over there.  So do you do a lot of video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, why is it that you have this great setup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was an interesting story.  I wanted to do a video about copyright, open source, stuff like that.  And I had a choice, either pay a videographer to do it or do it myself.  So what I did is I taught a videographer how to blog and return.  He told me what to buy and set up my studio for me here in my office.  What a great idea.  So I ended up buying all this cool equipment, which ended up being my initial podcasting  equipment also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very cool.  And now, you know, you could be doing what I'm doing.  I could be doing 24-7, Brooklyn TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard work.  It is hard work.  There's only one maniac in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, well, there isn't, unfortunately.  Somebody called me on the radio show, said, Leo, I want to start the first 24-7 internet  network.  And I said, well, it may not be the first.  What is it about?  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  And I said, God bless you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in Twitter, you know, you have a little hole about this big that you can see things  through.  It's not HD.  It's very small.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I can't wait.  I want to talk to you about your new book, Brooklyn on Technology, about what you've  been up to about blogging, I mean, and so forth.  But I guess kind of traditionally on Twitter, we go through news stories, too.  So we're going to do a pro forma look at the week's news.  And then I want to grill Dan Brooklyn.  You can download VisiCalc now.  It's like 64K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Less.  Less.  It ran in less.  Yeah, it's like, what, 20, 30K?  Because it had a run in 64K with all of the data.  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  Plus the OS, plus the screen buffer.  What year was that?  Well, the original VisiCalc came out in 1979.  It was announced, though, a few weeks from now, 30 years ago.  So this is the anniversary.  This year is the anniversary.  A couple of weeks ago was the first time it was shown privately to the computer press  that was at the West Coast Computer Fair.  And then it was shown publicly in early June at the National Computer Conference in New  York and shipped in October of 79.  And the version that you can download is a little more advanced.  It was an early version of the IBM PC version that we shipped right when the IBM PC came  out.  But the first version was Apple II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  In fact, it was the original killer app.  It was the program.  There you go.  It was the program that made the Apple II succeed as a business tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it already had succeeded as a game tool and for other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, people were playing Choplifter.  And then they said, wow, you can do...  Well, we're going to get into this because nobody had ever heard of a spreadsheet before.  I mean, there were paper spreadsheets, but the idea of doing it on a computer was brand  new.  Really cool.  And yes, you can get the executable.  What am I saying?  It's on Brooklyn.com.  You have it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You offer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  I got permission from IBM Lotus to let you download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's really...  Did they buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, our company was eventually bought by Lotus, which was eventually bought by IBM  and IBM gave us permission to put that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  News stories.  And there are a couple of Twitter ones.  Just walk away from it right now.  You can. I won't blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, these particular stories interest me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's kind of interesting, too.  Lance Armstrong, who is a very active Twitterer, actually kind of pissed off the press.  He's in the tour of Italy right now and he Twitter's a lot.  And in fact, to the point now where he refuses to speak to the media after the time trials  on Thursday, he tweeted, he went right to the fans and refused to talk to the Italian  media.  Now, you don't do that to Italian media.  They had a tantrum.  They said, well, that's it.  We're not covering you.  The sections of Italian and English speaking media announced they will no longer report  on Armstrong's messages because he won't talk to them.  He says, I'll talk to you, but I like Twittering.  Remember when he broke his arm, he was or whatever it was he broke, he was probably  from Twittering.  Don't Twitter while you bike.  But I think he Twittered it before anybody knew.  And it was like a couple of hours before it made the media.  So I think that what is this disintermediation, John?  I mean, is this kind of absolutely.  Yeah, I think it's a really good example of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how far it's going to get.  But I know a lot of people that use Twitter as a source of news, breaking news in particular.  The thing you're going to see is one of these days, CBS is going to be reporting from somebody  I mean, be reporting or using Twitter or somebody doing some tweets as a source, which will  be kind of interesting, kind of like his free stringers.  The thing you have to note, which I think is slightly objectionable, is that when people  start picking up on using this as a news source, they're not going to be paying anybody.  And in the olden days, they would.  You mean the stringers would get paid?  Yeah, these guys, you know, Twitter is just going to, you know, it's going to be bragging  right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get what you pay for.  One hundred forty characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much?  I don't know.  I, you know, if you happen to be the only one there who's on the spot, I can see you  starting to you'll do an auction right on the spot and say, who am I going to direct  message to?  That's what happens with photos, isn't it?  Right.  Look what happened to the guy.  The first photos were tweeted, right?  That plane that fell that went into the river on the Hudson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  But he didn't get any money for it.  But you're saying that, in fact, this one might be a road to revenue for Twitter.  They could set up an auction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, immediately whoever is there is going to get a tweet from an agent and the  agent is going to say, hey, I'll get you a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, once it becomes that's the way that it is.  I mean, it takes a while to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they the stories going around that Twitter is finally going to figure out how  to monetize.  They're going to start charging companies to be on Twitter.  Do companies stick around if they get charged?  I guess they do.  I guess you have to be there.  I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't.  It depends on how much.  Yeah, well, it's about a dollar a month.  I mean, what?  Well, yeah, it depends on the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It depends on what it is they give you for that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they can't prevent Comcast from being on Twitter.  They have to give them something.  I'll tell you, Twitter doesn't have a lot to give right now.  Its infrastructure is terrible.  Its search isn't working again.  It's they just don't seem to be able to scale this thing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you pay them, maybe they'll let you have a secret account.  Maybe it'll work.  Pay us. We'll make it work.  You're used to having it at a low level.  They can really move it up if they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No fail wells. Five bucks a month.  Come on.  The other story from Twitter is that kind of surprising.  Maybe not. Maybe this is this is the kind of thing that companies would pay for.  United Airlines is offering deals to Twitterers, according to Mashable.  United Airlines is tweeting what they call Twares.  Oh, God. Terrible. Terrible.  Special fares. If you follow them on Twitter, hurry, it says, and get your first ever time  sensitive Tware.  Sixty three dollars one way Chicago to D.C. plus tax additional terms.  And then they give a tiny URL book soon.  Again, I think this is probably a good way not only to build followers, which is of value,  but also to, you know, build a clientele.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the ad?  I'm sorry. What's the ad thing for that?  If you wanted to sign on.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. It's just at United Airlines.  One word at United Airlines, I guess.  You could follow them.  Yeah, I will. Well, that's the thing.  Won't everybody. Right. And this is a.  Well, people who travel.  Yeah. Right.  If you sign up for a company's email deals, then you would sign up for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this can be really fast.  I mean, they could tweet to people in line or something like that.  Do you want to upgrade or whatever?  I think all sorts of cool things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also valuable for airlines.  There's nothing staler than an unsold airline seat.  This would be a great way they could do their own consolidation.  You know, we've got five seats left to the flight to Singapore.  You get down to the airport in one hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New auctions. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was it. That's the Twitter.  Unless I come up with something else. That's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. You don't have to come up with anything else.  Leo, those were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, did you see the Sunday in the Sunday?  Funniest there was on one of them, at least it was all about Twitter.  Oh, dear. Yeah.  At least in the Boston Globe, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's this is an interesting article from a guy named Jeff Chappelle,  who is a software analyst.  That's that's his name of his blog.  Jeff Chappelle, software analyst.  Only thing missing is frontier software analyst.  But he makes an interesting point.  He says that the light, you know, we've always said that, well,  if you want more than if you want four gigs or more of RAM,  you should go 64 bit OS.  Thirty two bit versions of Windows won't support more than three.  Some gigs of RAM, because some of it's reserved for video space and so forth.  He says, you know, because of PAE.  Every version of Windows will work with more than four gigs of RAM.  Microsoft just turns it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, and there's been some dissent.  I kind of posted this on FriendFeed and got some expert input.  People said, well, PAE, which is physical address, physical  address, what is it?  I can't remember what it stands for.  It's basically that segment.  Remember, this is something that's been part of Intel.  I'm sure, Dan, when you move to the Intel processor,  you you had to live with this physical address extension.  It's the idea, I guess, of segmentation.  And it does, you know, yeah, the address registers are 32 bits.  That would top out of four gigs, but you can segment,  page it effectively and see much more.  And it works just fine.  In fact, this guy removed  a some registry code  and was able to get Windows 32 to see eight gigs of RAM.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does he have the this registry fix posted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on his site.  Now, he says, I didn't do any testing for speed and stuff.  But he said it works.  He shows, you know, the picture of it.  He shows it all working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, at least that dialog box works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's, you know, I guess that's the question.  Do you have any experience with PAE, Dan?  And does this seem credible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it seems credible to be able to make parts of something  know about more memory and use different ways.  I mean, segmentation goes back to my college days and stuff.  But, you know, to test it, I mean, it may be the same code.  It might not be the same code.  And anyway, they can charge.  I mean, this goes way back.  IBM used to have a thing where if you cut one wire,  some of the machines would suddenly run faster.  This goes back 40, 50 years.  Great. And that way they could ship the one machine  and you just paid for whatever speed you wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Intel did that with a Celeron.  They disabled the L2 cache. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, that's just how much you want to pay for it.  The fact that they've already shipped it.  Is that any different than somebody sending you trialware  and then sending you a code to turn it on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I guess the thing that would upset me is that it's been widely  brooded about that.  Oh, no, it's a 32 bit operating system.  It cannot access more than four gigs.  And you have to have 64 bit if you want to do four gigs or more.  And if that's not technically true, if it's just a license issue,  then that then that's not quite honest.  I mean, if there's a technical reason it can run and,  you know, run more RAM, then they should say, well,  we don't license it for more RAM.  They're not going to do that. I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, yeah, I know it may be more complicated than that, but that's  I'm not into the kernel of and the differences of all those.  I spend much more time client side working with Ajax and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that funny now how that's changed?  I mean, yeah, hacking now is really much higher level than it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there are different places to do it.  And being able to run on all different machines has its advantages.  And you have to sort of pick where you want to spend your time. Right.  And I decided to spend my time much more in  a lot of the open source languages and client side and things like that  for a while. By the way, I found that URL.  If you go to comics dot com slash jump underscore start.  Oh, jump, jump, jump, start. Yeah.  Go to them. Today's comic is about a guy getting arrested.  And he wants his handcuffs off so he can tweet that he was arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Worked for who was it?  The guy got arrested. The student got arrested in Egypt.  The blogger got arrested in Egypt and he tweeted about it.  Worked for him. Oh, that's so funny. Oh, that's so funny.  Would you mind removing my handcuffs?  I have to tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should have thought about that at home.  Officers, I got a tweet as soon as possible.  You're just going to have to hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, tweeting involves his PDA.  He tells his pals what he's up to all during his day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds stupid and boring.  This guy looks kind of like you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, usually it is.  But today was different.  I got busted by the cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything you tweet can and will be used against you.  That's pretty funny, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've seen a full Twitter comic and a major comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It shows it's mainstream enough that people would, you know,  read comic pages, funny pages would get it.  I mean, that the general audience would get it.  I guess it is once Oprah starts talking about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's go back to something that Dan said, which is that the idea  that you can clip a wire on an IBM computer and the speed triples  or somebody to you about, sorry,  about the amount of memory you can access through pagination,  however you want to describe it, is the same as trialware,  which is something I disagree with that concept because trialware  is something you sign you sign on to.  It's just essentially to try something.  And then they give you a code to use it after you either pay for it or something.  I mean, it's a process.  It's not like somebody tricking you.  It's not as though you bought something,  product A, and it turns out to be trialware.  And after you've paid for it, you have to go through some rigamarole.  So I don't think that analogy is very good.  I'm just I was mulling it over there.  Took him a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I meant it in terms of you only have to ship it once  so you don't have to have something else come in.  You can right away get instant gratification in terms of them  being able to give you the improvement that you want.  Remember, some of the things you get are you have the the free version  and then you download a code like your door or something.  And then suddenly you get it opens up a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, Windows Windows Vista does that when you when you get that disk  with Windows Vista's got every version on it.  And if you want to, I mean, that actually was pretty smart.  Microsoft, you know, you're sitting there, you're saying, gosh,  I really need ultimate.  It's there. You got it.  All you have to do is get a code and then unlock it.  So I guess in that kind of is in that respect, although it doesn't  you can't turn it into 64 bit Windows.  You that you got to reinstall that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just find it disturbing that Microsoft, you know, essentially.  I don't understand these multiple.  I mean, is there one best Windows Vista?  And why do we need all these might, you know, these little ones that are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's what they're going to pretty much do the same thing again.  Although with Windows 7, although my buddy Paul Thurotte  and we'll talk about it on Windows Weekly this week, got a little scoop.  You know, Microsoft said there's going to be a Windows 7 starter edition  pretty much intended for developing nations that will have it'll be cheap.  But you can only run three applications at the same time.  You try to launch a fourth.  They'll say, sorry, you can't do that with this version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we've talked about that on cranky geeks, actually.  I think it's, you know, ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they back down.  You were you were right.  A parent coordinate, Paul Thurotte, Microsoft has taken that restriction out.  I know, you know, I guess I agree with you on that one.  Is it ridiculous?  I mean, really, come on.  If we want to make a cheap version for developing nations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you know, that's just another excuse to, you know, to  it's just a rationalization because, you know, Microsoft overcharges for its products  and everybody knows it by now.  I mean, when you can get you want something cheap for developing nations,  give them a copy of Ubuntu and some reference machine point.  And it's free.  And you can get use Abby soft, Abby word.  That's a good point.  It's a beautiful clone of Windows Word 2003.  And there's, you know, they've got the browsers and all the rest of it's all there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, why not just, yeah, why not use a free operating system?  Really? In fact, they shouldn't use the phrase developing nations.  It's really intended for the pirating nations.  That's who that's who it's meant for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Places where they can't charge the full price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Places where it's well, look at China.  I mean, this is where you use a dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a dollar. You go to you go to the store and it's openly sold  in most of the Southeast Asian area.  You get the disk. It's a dollar.  In fact, they have, you know, the most expensive version I've ever seen.  One time it was in I think it was in Kuala Lumpur.  I saw it was a store in a mall and they had a copy.  I thought it was really one of the more interesting bootlegs.  It was a copy of up to I think it was up to XP at the time.  Every single version of Microsoft DOS and Windows.  Oh, we should pick that up for me. I could have used that.  Thinking about it, I probably should have grabbed.  Yeah, that'd be really handy to DOS 2.3, DOS, this, you know, all of them, all of them.  And it was like the idea was, you know, it would be just handy for people  developing, you know, the ultimate compatible software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be very handy.  I would like developers get copies of everything.  I mean, if you sign up as a developer and get all their super CDs, you get  all this neat stuff and you can put it on all these different machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to get that the MSDN ultimate subscription and you get you get these big notebooks.  I mean, it's like six feet on the shelf for one year's worth of stuff.  Everything. You must get that.  I mean, you're developing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did for years, but there it takes up a lot of the space over there.  You can download it all now. I think you can get it all online.  Yeah, I sort of stopped doing that.  And now now, as I said, I'm mainly working in Ajax and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nielsen reports.  Oh, get this. I'm going to this a little quiz for you all.  Internet TV is is is growing.  It's growing fast, according to Nielsen, which monitors not only regular  television viewing, but they do monitor Internet use.  About 131 million people watch Internet video per month.  They average about three hours.  Now, that's a big increase.  It was 116 million averaging two hours a year ago.  They also say about 13 million people watch it on their mobile phone,  which is up 52 percent from last year.  And they watch even more people watching on the mobile phone watch three and a half hours.  However, those numbers pale  when you compare it to actual television watching.  Do you want to guess? Do you gentlemen wish to don't know peaking?  Guess how many hours of TV Americans watch on average every month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see. I would guess  a couple hours a day, right?  I would guess two to three hours a day.  So I think you could probably hit  three times 30, which would be, let's say, 100 hours easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One hundred fifty three hours, averaging more than five hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's too much.  That's too much.  It's too much watching TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell are they watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually do watch a number of shows religiously.  I think The Mentalist is a really good drama.  I like I still watch The Law and Orders and I watched 30 Rock and maybe one of those.  I probably watch.  You're bringing the average up, John.  I'm probably watching  10 hours a week, which is about 40,  maybe 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much are people just leaving it on sort of like while you're doing the dishes,  while you're doing other stuff, while you're talking to people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true. I think there's a lot of households.  It was just on all day.  It starts in the morning and just left on all day.  Ninety nine percent of video viewing,  98.8 percent is television, only  one point two percent is on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a growth market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there. Thank you, John.  I was looking for that spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it is. We're growing wide open.  Well, unless there's a trend where it freezes, where, in other words,  it stops growing, even though I don't see the growth rate going up that fast.  Obviously, from those figures, it's like it's but it is growing.  It's not a dead market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One hundred sixteen million, one hundred thirty one million.  That's a growth growth in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's something.  But the but are we to what do they what do they mean by video?  Are they talking about YouTube or are they talking about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not talking about. Well, I think Hulu.  Yeah, it's usually you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they talking about YouTube?  They're talking about who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not talking about me. I can tell you that.  But they are talking about Hulu.  They are talking about YouTube.  And yeah, I mean, I look at my kids.  That's what they watch from for them.  That's their TV time.  If they're going to watch the office.  Well, here's the here's I think what's telling.  It doesn't matter to them if it's on TV, if it's on TV or if it's on Hulu.  They just watch whatever is convenient. They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and used to be that the TV that they had was this big  13 or 15 inch TV that they had in their room or maybe. Right. Right.  That used to be a big TV.  And now, you know, you get a laptop and it's going to be 15 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. It's bigger than your TV, your old TV.  When we when we were kids, why you were lucky if you had black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually do. I had green and white and black for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the early color was so bad.  I remember very well when I was a kid, my dad refused to buy a color TV  because everybody's green.  We had a black and white TV,  I think, until the late 60s, maybe even the early 70s.  I remember our first color TV was a Sony Trinitron.  Boy, that was a big deal because and he was right.  You know what? The color was really awful for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wonder if the if this viewing thing would be  if the way the numbers are skewed would be affected by  by things like initiatives like Boxxy,  which essentially is Internet viewing, but on the TV.  In fact, and I was looking at it.  So I think that's the future.  I was looking at a Sony, by the way,  that David that Heron had Robert Heron had in the back at ZD  is looking at.  And this Sony was one of the  can remember the model number, but it had Internet connections on it  and had all these weird things on the side.  And you just plug it, basically just plug it into the Internet  or to an ethernet cable.  And then it had one menu item that that brought you to all this online  video stuff, including a bunch of pre, you know, packaged stuff.  They had Cranky Geeks on the menu. Really?  Yeah. So I hit the button to watch Cranky Geeks.  And I'm watching Cranky Geeks on a 50 inch  Sony. How did it look?  It looked it looked a lot better than it should.  The they did a real good job of fixing whatever, you know, kind of art.  It did have no artifacting, but it didn't have full 30 frames per second.  It seemed to be more like 24 or something.  Had just a fair, but it was but it wasn't bothersome.  And the and the mouths were synced. Wow.  And it was actually watchable as a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually very intriguing.  Basically, it's an Apple TV built into a TV, a Sony TV set kind of thing.  That's what I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you taken Hulu and go on, you know, right from your your Mac or whatever,  right to your big screen TV? Oh, yeah.  I have friends who do that and they just sit.  They'd rather watch it in HD. It looks pretty good.  And we have pilots in our town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a that's what Boxxy did.  And that's when Hulu stopped him, kept keep stopping him.  You know, Boxxy keeps fixing it.  But yeah, that's how I've watched it. It's it's fine.  I mean, it's it's not.  Because I'm watching on Wi-Fi, I have a decent cable connection, but,  you know, cable Internet connection, but the Wi-Fi, I think,  slows it down a little bit. So the frame rate is a little worse.  I think kids kids probably aren't going to have the same sensitivity  to frame rate that we will going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They might just get used to it.  Well, you know, that reminds me of my daughter who was in the room a second ago,  but now she's gone so I can talk about her behind her back.  She has like a penchant for we have this big screen TV  up here that has all the HD stuff going into one of the inputs  and then the games and all the other stuff go into another one of the inputs.  And when she flips to a game and then flips back to TV,  the TV also goes into the in other words, we have two feeds.  And and she doesn't care to to to push it over to the HD feed ever.  And she keeps saying that there's no difference.  And even though there's a huge difference, because it's for one thing,  the whole screen is filled up instead of, you know, letterboxed.  And it's crystal clear and the other one doesn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. John, maybe she's just remember the days of we work so hard on letter  quality printing, which wanted to get output that looked really, really good,  looked as good as a good typewriter.  And then people took it and stuck it in the facts.  And the fact of it made it look horrible.  And they didn't care because they got what they wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and there's a whole generation that's growing up  listening to music on crappy MP3 players.  Yep. They don't know. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't care.  They don't.  When you talk to them about getting a big speaker system,  it makes it sound like you're in the place.  Yeah, who cares?  You know, reminded, we had when I was doing Silicon Spin once,  we had Todd Rundgren on the show.  And he we got into a discussion about high  five, you know, super high five and some of the new stuff coming out.  And he made the comment that he didn't think it was important in the least.  You know, people don't care that much about the sound.  And I, you know, there's just a group of people.  Yeah, apparently, right.  People don't even, you know, they use these earbuds.  And it's just decimated the high, the old stereo high five business  where you get a receiver and a bunch of big speakers.  And, you know, a big subwoofer and you, you know, shake the house.  I know I've really forgotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How you know, you used to you used to be able to really sound  have great stereo sound and the music would move you would be incredible.  And you forget about that.  It all sounds kind of cheesy and tinny now.  And that's just what we're used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, just like what happened with the telephone,  we went from telephones wired and they're supposed to be so good and whatever.  And then we went to these cell phones that are very unreliable.  Don't get me started.  OK, then we switched from now.  But listen, we're on Skype. Listen, how good it sounds. Right.  And people, when they hear Skype, they go, oh, my God, that's incredible.  It's like I'm in the room.  So eventually it gets there.  You can tell you can tell the difference.  But most people don't know that they can tell the difference.  I mean, the same thing happens with video.  I mean, as I learn about microphones, you know, this, you know, pro,  they they listen to some of the crap that I do.  And then they go, you know, I use the right mic.  You know, one have to, you know, put pillows all around and stuff like that.  And, you know, and it does make a difference.  I remember listening to some pod, some of the early podcasts  when Dave Weiner would do his podcasts, some of them he would do,  like with the mic that's built into the PC.  Be off, be off like here. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he doesn't even sound that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I found out that if I was out there running,  you know, I was listening to a podcast while I was running.  If I went by traffic, I couldn't understand it. Right.  But if I had really good sound, it would work in those situations.  And I realized, aha, I'm doing my listeners a favor by going to all that trouble.  But they won't know it.  You know, even if it's really poor,  the content does matter.  John, I don't know if you remember or Leo a long time ago,  there was an online encyclopedia, not online, it was a CD encyclopedia like thing.  And one of the things that had was video was very early videos,  this horrible crappy little stuff, you know, you could you could barely see it.  Postage stamp. Postage stamp.  And people laughed about that.  And I said, let me show you this one video.  It's a video of a giraffe giving birth.  So they start watching.  And in this horrible little video, you see a giraffe giving birth.  And, you know, the giraffe stands up when it gives birth, it falls down.  The afterbirth comes down after and splashes all.  And they're fascinated and they forget that they're looking at that.  They get lost in the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The content trumps the presentation. Yes.  I guess that's what's happened.  It's just kind of, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  culturally, though, I mean, there's a thing like with the microphones, for example,  I mean, people do notice these, you know, Leo and I are using right now  that we're both using these very nice big diaphragm mics that make you sound  very clear, even though it's kind of bassy.  And it's people notice that it's a more relaxing sound.  It doesn't fatigue you.  I mean, there's a thing called listener fatigue, which is people just don't even  want to think about, which is that you use these crappy mics that are poorly  balanced and you you start listening to these to people on these systems.  And after a while, they actually tires because the brain has to do so much work  to piece the thing together so you can hear like you're talking about complaining  about the the noise and the traffic and then trying to hear somebody talk.  And it wears some people out.  And I think at some point it damages the the quality of the product overall  because people just stop listening to it and they don't know why.  They don't know why. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's like fonts, you know, good fonts and why they have serifs  and all these other things.  There are all these little things that were developed over many years  that we didn't realize.  But the the pros know about it.  And as you say, it does help us,  which is why I have my expensive mic sitting here.  So what mic are you using?  It's a SM7B, sure, which I have for a strange reason.  I was listening to  to what was it?  The early podcasts with Adam Curry and Adam said that's what he was using.  And I figure if it's good enough for Adam Curry, it's good enough for me.  And he sounded so good.  But I didn't realize it was his voice, too.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, that's the crystal clear voice.  Yes. So I have you know what he uses now?  What? What?  He there's a lavalier that he's fallen in love with.  That's the one that goes in your lapel.  Yeah. Oh, and he and I swear he's talked about it before.  It's not like a secret.  And he hangs it.  So it's dangling in front of him.  And it and he for some reason, he thinks he sounds so much better on this  particular and there are some good lavaliers.  I mean, you have for people out there, we don't want to go too much inside baseball.  But Leo, at least at the studio there, has a couple of these things called Countrymen.  Yeah, they're great.  Who are or which is not quite a lavalier, but they do make one.  But it's small enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The capsule it's a consensory mic.  So the difference between what you and I are using anything  and these is that we're using dynamic microphones that aren't powered.  These are powered condenser mics and they are.  It's tiny. This is what the this is what the TV preachers use.  Right. It's really small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're very small.  And the first time I used one, which was a couple of years ago,  because someone said, no, these are you got to let you won't believe what you sound.  They for some reason are astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But they have to be close mic'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have to be close mic'd.  And it's and it keeps they keep falling off your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, you know, overall, I mean, you know what they do and they use in Broadway  and they do in the Broadway shows is they'll use a flesh colored tape  and they'll tape it to your cheek.  I don't think they sound as good or that's why that's why I mean, we use them.  We stopped using them. I don't think they sound quite as good.  You know, I'll do is I'll plug it in and I'll switch over to it.  You can hear what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think that's where a lot of our processing power is going to go  in the future to sort of take all the crappy mics and stuff  and try to figure out how to make things sound better so that you can walk around  like Dave did and end up with sound that sounds like what you're getting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the about five years ago, Texas Instruments,  you know, has a digital amplifier that they like to play around with.  And it's gone into the market in different forms.  And they bought out one of the great digital amp companies.  And they've done all these different things.  And one of the demos they gave was to  using software to recreate the exact sound of various expensive speaker systems  on a pair of the cheapest little realistic dogs, you know, that they got at Radio Shack.  And they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it seems like you could, by the way, I'm now on the country.  You sound terrible. Oh, it's awful.  It's because he's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's overmodulated. Overmodulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you how's that. Is that better?  It seems like you could, with intelligent DSP technology,  probably clean it all up, right? It's just a software issue.  Yeah. I mean, where did that deep voice disappear?  I know. See, it's much hollower because you don't have that.  I'll have to talk like this.  You don't have the big diaphragm to resonate.  It doesn't sound bad, though.  No. In fact, if you hadn't heard the PR 40 before, you'd say this sounds fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And the PR 40 is a specifically  mellow microphone that it's just it's made for a lot of people.  Have the right voice for it is just a great microphone. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So actually, I like Conan O'Brien's quote.  He says television allows you to watch things just as you would on your computer  or cell phone, except while seated in a more comfortable chair.  It's really just it's really just the seating.  That's the difference. I agree.  All right. We're going to come back more.  More stories. We're talking with Dan Bricklin, the creator of Visit Calc  and blogger extraordinaire software guru  who still has his hands in just as many pies.  He's not retired.  And of course, John and a new book. Thank you.  But let's give it a big plug.  Bricklin on technology.  It's Wiley and Sons. Yes.  And it's great.  We're going to actually talk about that book in a bit.  And John C. Dvorak is also here from Channel Dvorak.  But I do want to mention our friends that go to my PC.  I know you both know Ed Yakubuchi, who created Citrix many, many moons ago  and really began a journey that  go to my PC is kind of the culmination of a journey of remote access.  He was very instrumental in the OS two team is at IBM.  Really, I think, wrote much of the NT kernel and became an expert  on the NT kernel and remote access.  And the software that Citrix has created is still used today,  licensed by Microsoft.  They do remote access better than anybody else.  Go to my PC puts that super high quality, super fast,  super secure remote access in your computer.  In fact, you can try it right now for 30 days. Absolutely free.  Avoid rush hour traffic, heading to work, avoid going in on the weekends.  Any time I hear it all the time, I just I thank my lucky stars.  I listen to the radio and I hear  the traffic reporters say, oh, yeah, the Golden Gate Bridge is tied up.  Oh, it's a three hour commute.  And I go, I don't have to do that.  I got go to my PC.  I don't have to commute anymore.  I don't have to get in the car.  I can get to my office just by going online from anywhere, not just home  and Internet Cafe, a hotel, save time, save money.  It's popping on me. Save time, save money.  I have to move it out. Yeah.  Save, save stress.  Go to my PC dot com.  You try it free right now by going to go to my PC dot com slash twit.  And you get a 30 day free trial.  Go to my PC dot com slash twit. Fire it up.  You can use any program, access any network resource, any file, check email  secure. There's never been an exploit.  Uses industry standard TLS and SSL.  The best remote access service out there.  I want you to try it free. Go to my PC dot com slash windows.  Give it a try. I know you're going to like it.  We use it all the time. In fact, I have five accounts.  Five accounts and counting.  All right, I get rid of this microphone. It's driving me crazy.  It's too. I want my base back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish you could go bing, bing, bing back and forth and back and forth with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To give you an A B comparison. Yeah.  Yeah, I need to I need a switch or something.  I could probably do that.  I would just have to see. Isn't that much better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice. Yes, because there's some there's a lower mid range  that exists in the PR 42.  Was it 42? 40. 40. Sorry. 40.  The 40 that is very noticeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know that I think that lower mid range is critical for that.  That's the pitch that you I think that you use to understand speech.  So if it's got a little bump there, it's a little I think it makes it more  intelligible. I don't know.  There's a that's where Adam Curry's voice is perfect because it's got that.  It's like it's it's not it's almost an edge, I call it.  But it's just it gives it that if it's too  you can't understand it, you need a little a little edge in there  to understand the articulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you still have to enunciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He enunciates very well.  He's also got beautiful hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you've got a good hair for a guy your age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the old guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking Dan looks pretty good. Look at that.  Thanks. Now, I'm the oldest of the three of us.  So I just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're all of the all of the same, roughly the same generation. Oh, yeah.  Other there are some actually, you know, now that I look at it,  there's some very interesting stories this week, for instance,  the OQO is gone.  Huh? That's kind of sad, but I guess inevitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From day one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, in some ways, the fact that they lasted seven years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a miracle. It's almost kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is when I read that I was running around looking for my old pocket.  You know, the old pocket. Oh, yeah.  Poquette. Yeah.  I couldn't couldn't find it.  It's it's back in the warehouse. I have it. I have mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do. Oh, yeah.  I have two interesting ones.  I got a pocket and I also have that little radio shack piece of crap  that they can model 100.  No, no, no. They came out with a pocket clone.  Oh, I didn't know that.  That was used to use the saw used above operating system called I dot or something.  It was a clone of Microsoft.  And that's floating around.  But the pocket, I think, is collectible.  There's no. Oh, maybe that's what it was.  I'm sorry. You're right.  It's what I have both of those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're in a box away in the in the warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this just proves that these little teeny weeny computers  are fetish objects for geeks.  Oh, no, no, no. Yeah, they collect them.  They can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just have two geeks that collected those two items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I think it's I think it's universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have the Tandy 100 that I would have collected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can buy those still on eBay.  I mean, those are at a premium. I might add.  Those are still beloved by journalists everywhere.  That was you know, there was a time if you went to a baseball game,  every single person in the press box was using a model 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was the last machine that Bill Gates actually did real live code for.  There was, you know, not just a little game or something.  He did basic coding. What did he do on that?  I don't know. He did something in it.  But if you talk to him about coding, I think he wrote one of the games  that was shipped with the IBM PC or something in basic one of the sample games.  But, you know, the real the last production real life code,  I think it was the 100, he says, and he waxes poet.  I mean, you can see the his eyes go.  Yeah, that was the last real code that I got to ship.  Maybe now that he's out of Microsoft, he's getting to write some real code for fun.  Oh, please.  Oh, once if you're a coder, it's so much fun.  I mean, that's why I'm doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't have enough time in the day.  I wish he would go write some code.  How about some code to fix Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called when is seven.  And I guess he's out of Microsoft.  He can write stuff in whatever he wants.  And for, you know, purposes like to help fight malaria or something  while he's flying over there.  Do you think he might do that?  I don't know. That'd be very cool.  I mean, don't you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, be brutally frank.  Don't you find that your brain just doesn't have the capacity to  focus and retain all the loose threads and stuff that it did when you were a younger guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm able to do some stuff that I'm still pretty proud of.  I look back at some old code I've written and I go, who wrote that?  It was incredible. I wrote that. How did I do that?  I look at other stuff and said, what?  What horrible person wrote that? Oh, my God, it's me.  Sometimes I mean, I if you have to be able to get into it,  I mean, it still takes sometimes, you know, the 10 hours straight  to be able to do the one little piece of code or something and do it for days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Steve Gibson, who's also our age, is working on a new project.  And he goes to Starbucks, gets there about five thirty when they open  and stays till seven or eight at night.  And he stays 12 hours nonstop assembly language programming.  And I think that's it. You have to kind of get in a zone, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you have to get into your tools.  It takes a while to get into the tools. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody said, I think it was Randall Schwartz.  The Pearl programmer said, if I don't program in Pearl three hours a day, I lose it.  That's Pearl. That's Pearl. That's Pearl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I program in Pearl, too.  And I program in Pearl that looks more like Visual Basic and not more like APL,  like a lot of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pearl is one of those tools.  If you don't use it regularly, you completely forget the syntax.  Oh, yeah. But there are some languages that aren't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's programs like that.  I mean, Adobe Illustrator is a good example.  Bezier curves. What are those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So OQO, I guess it was 2002.  I remember showing it on Regis and Kelly right around 2002.  You know why they they they they finally just.  What was it? What was it that finally put the nail in the coffin on this thing?  Back through an article on this thing.  We are sad to report that due to financial constraints, nobody wanted to buy any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they think that financial constraints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're saying we are not able to offer repair and service support at this time.  We are deeply sorry that despite our best intentions,  we are unable to provide continued support for a faithful customer.  That's sad because customer.  Is that what you said? Yeah, I forgot to put it.  I said there were two of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's I mean, you have to try.  I mean, we did all that software for these old pen computers for Go and all.  And Go Slate. Yeah, right.  And we we write this this really cool software and stuff,  but nobody bought the machines.  So we saw it sold like two copies of some of the software.  But it was just ahead of its time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always referred to them as go broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, they kept changing the spec on the software on the hardware.  So you had to change your hardware.  So first we wrote to a two eighty six.  Then you had to rewrite the whole thing for the three eighty six.  Then they changed to the the Hobbit chip.  And each time you're all so before you could ship, you had to recode everything.  So, you know, plus people really didn't want a computer  that was based upon handwriting and stuff.  They they like touch type of stuff and they couldn't do color.  The digitizers didn't do well with color. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the contrast sucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you couldn't see.  You could read it. The grid was the grid.  The same kind of.  Yeah, the grid pad, the grid, the grid convertible machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The grid convertible is a good machine.  But the thing is that they couldn't do digitizers well through except for,  I guess, the Wacom or something, which was expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But did they have to have layers and they have to have a capacitance layer  and all that stuff. And it would just get dimmer and dimmer and dimmer.  By the time you were seeing through all these layers, it was like through a cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now, isn't there an item floating around the news, a gossip item  that Apple will be doing a pad computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes. There's the rumors are strong.  Although the question is time frame.  Some think maybe they'll announce it  to June 8th at the developers conference is coming up.  That seems unlikely.  Others now have now the latest rumors. It'll be next year.  But they bought they bought, according to I think was E.E.  Times, one of the one of these Chinese electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  E.E. Times is Palo Alto Menlo Park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's not that one.  They bought a bunch of 10 and a half inch touch screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if you use a netbook a lot, you realize that  that's a it's a really good idea to make a tablet of the type  that they're talking about. Great.  Because you netbooks, the problem is they're horizontal and you like to read  and they have small screens.  So you really want to turn it sideways and the keyboard sticking out.  And for a lot of stuff, we don't need keyboard if we have touch. Right.  And so it looks like it might be the time for it.  Finally, we'll see.  But it's good that these people tried.  I mean, the fact that that old little Windows machine, you know,  they tried and tried for a few years and just turned out that  Windows wasn't right for a little machine when you could have a bigger machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It ran. I remember the first ones ran XP and then it ran Vista.  And it was so tiny.  You had a little stylus.  It was just it was like just teensy.  And you could barely I mean, I don't know what the dot pitch was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another one you're showing there is like huge by comparison of the original.  Yeah. The original had like little bitty keys and was it was super miniature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, suppose it had a user interface that was kind of like Android.  Yeah, that would have been a lot different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Intel announced this week  a mini operating system for netbooks called Moblin.  It's an open source project based on Linux.  I downloaded and installed it on my wind and immediately took it off.  Immediately, they keep trying to do this.  Yeah. And I think Android might be a little bit like that,  where it's a little stripped down and you just I could see the motivation  for the OQO. You kind of want a full operating system.  But the problems to solve, you know, are pretty significant  to get a full operating system on something that size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, at least we've learned with the iPod and the iPod Touch and all  that there's a subset and a different set of applications  that are worthwhile having in a portable environment.  And because everything's wired, you can do things that are dependent on being wired.  I mean, they're wireless.  You can be connected and you can do reading and things that you used to be able to do.  You know, the Kindle has been relatively successful.  Love it. Right.  And it's it it barely does anything, but it does at least one thing very well.  So you can see that that form factor might be OK,  because now there are enough useful things we can do with it  that you don't need to bring your laptop, your full, full set of applications with you.  You don't have to write and run Photoshop on it.  You don't have to run full word on it or things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dan, do you use a iPhone or an Android and why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not surprised. I would have I would have picked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But I have a iPod Touch that I used to learn about the interface and stuff like that.  And I'll probably get a pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm excited about the pre.  The more I see about the pre, they just and Gadget has a leaked prelaunch  manual for the pre for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think your pre excitement is premature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's going to be pretty good.  But I think I have to preorder the pre.  It's a pre preorder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an interesting thing about the pre that the programming is done  in systems that people are already used to.  Yeah, you like Ajax. This is Ajax, essentially.  A lot of people know how to program in JavaScript and CSS and stuff like that,  rather than having to learn Java or use a Java system or, you know,  Objective-C or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there support, Dan, do you know, for things like jQuery for some of the  Java JavaScript libraries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I haven't played with it yet.  So I'll find out.  Do you use jQuery for your stuff?  No. The the people I work with at social tech use it a lot.  It's it's been really helpful for them.  But for my stuff, I've written it to run on its own so that I have a pretty clean system.  And the early versions of jQuery that I had were slowed things down a little bit  and affected the recalc that I was doing with my social calc software for the  spreadsheet.  And I wanted it to run on a really small systems like the One Laptop,  which it's running on now.  Is it? Yeah.  Apparently, there are people in Nepal and in Colombia who are using my open  source spreadsheet written in JavaScript to do real work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So tell us about that. I didn't know you'd done that.  You wrote a spreadsheet in JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I did was originally I had written a spreadsheet in Perl  that used a little bit of JavaScript and ran.  It was called WikiCalc and it's open source GPO  that I released out there and it used the browser somewhat.  But it was kind of clunky.  And I started working with the guys at social techs that have a commercial  Wiki. And so.  When trying to figure out how to do it right, I realized I really had to move  the whole spreadsheet client side.  So I've re-implemented the whole thing as a JavaScript spreadsheet that lets you  you can scroll around, you can have split planes.  It does a lot of the stuff that while you're editing is like what you can do  with Google spreadsheets and came out around the same time.  But it doesn't need a back end to do the calculations and all.  And it handles very large spreadsheets compared to I mean, it'll handle a thousand  or more rows, two thousand rows of data.  And people, I think, have already incorporated into Drupal  and social text has been talking about it and they have it  in limited data to some of their customers.  And we'll see what will happen over the next few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Compare it and power to VisiCalc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's like no comparison.  It's much more powerful than VisiCalc.  It's you know, it does a lot of the display that Excel did,  let's say back in Excel 97.  You know, you can do the different colors and formats and not pivot tables,  nothing like that.  No, it doesn't have pivot tables.  I had not yet. Not yet.  That's not a table.  That's OK, because I still don't understand pivot tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it, you know, it has like a hundred different functions and,  you know, internal rate of return and all that stuff.  And it it takes advantage of the browser in many ways.  And now you can even cut and paste from Excel.  And it it feels like a spreadsheet.  And the guys in social text are working to make it fit in really well  with their commercial level wiki system so that you can use all the  you can calculate something that uses a sheet that's another page,  that's another page, that's another page and does all the right roll ups for you.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have a URL that people can go check it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yet. Wait and see what social text does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go to social text on that, you can you can actually find.  Yeah, yeah, they write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They talk about it, but you can't try it yet.  You can actually download the one laptop version.  And in fact, I think it's it's on a lot of the one laptops  and run it on your one laptop.  I think the version that I have listed under on on software garden dot com  about social cow.  I think you can download and play with it.  That's a much older version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm seeing one point one point zero at social calc dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, that's a that's a whole other thing.  That's that's not it.  Huh? That's that was a Pearl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the Pearl version. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Let's forget about that.  And you won't be able to.  I think it's not even there.  We click on it. Oh, you're right.  You can download Wickecalc and play with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's that's even older, right?  That's the predates that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wait, wait a little while.  I'll be posting some stuff.  I've just finished doing a lot of updates to it.  Now, when I do my recount, I have a little timer loop and it it will it.  It lets you have very long recalculation.  You get progress bars underneath and stuff, and it can go out and  and ask for another sheet and another sheet and another sheet as it's rolling  up in a big calculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How where do you stand on the idea of software as a service or cloud computing?  Or I don't I don't.  They're different.  They're different, but it's not clear.  OK, so first of all, tell me the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the way I see it, I mean, I've been learning about this  by listening to, you know, others talk about some of it and reading some books.  I think Amy Wall has a book about software as a service.  That's pretty good that she publishes herself on Lulu  and software as a service.  Yeah, it's like time sharing used to be.  It's we we provide applications that actually run that you get,  you know, through your browser or something of that sort.  And of course, with air and and silverlight stuff,  we're able to do some pretty incredible applications.  And JavaScript has just jumped everything up,  you know, in terms of what we've been able to do.  But then we have Adobe Air, et cetera.  So but if you have a full application, that's what I would call software  as a service when you're getting it over the browser.  Cloud computing is you go down a level.  It's where there's a lot of the parts of running  and the back end are available as a service.  So, for example, Amazon gives you  the ability to have storage as a service that you can take advantage of.  And other places, let's say like SmugMug use their  their back end that's provided in the Internet for storage.  They actually use Amazon, I think.  They actually use Amazon.  Right. They use S3.  They use the Amazon storage.  SmugMug uses that, which is using taking advantage of cloud computing.  So but cloud computing has different things that could be available  on demand in the cloud that you can just get when you need it, that it's not yours.  You're using it as a service, but it's usually a service  in service of the thing that you're doing.  So they also provide Amazon also provides you just plain CPUs  running an operating system like Linux.  So you can have web browsers and you can fire them up just by saying, give me one.  It's not yours. You're just using it as a service.  And then there are other services you could provide, like  all credit card services.  And I think Google is starting to provide a variety of services in the back end.  And would you view Google Maps taking advantage of some of the things  Google Maps does is that software as a service or is that cloud computing?  Let's provide you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where the confusion lies.  There's a line is blurred for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had I was just recently in Holland and went to a meeting  of the cloud computing folks that were they had this club, a SIG.  And they were the argument that they're using now.  I think kind of Dan kind of touches on it.  But it boils down to kind of the following is one guy told me  because there's a lot of big companies that are getting sick and tired  of their IT department. Yes. Yes.  And they just want to get them.  They just want to fire them all, but they can't quite do that.  But what they can do is move to the cloud and let these, you know,  like a professional IT department that is not so meddlesome,  run the back end of their operation.  And that's a sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a sad statement.  Or one piece of the operation is a piece.  You may not want to be the person who takes care of the storage.  You know, and you you don't want to buy racks of storage.  You don't know how much you're going to need.  And you may have where temporarily you need a lot.  And then for a while, you know, let's say around Christmas time,  you need an awful lot for some reason.  And then, you know, after the big buying season, you don't need it.  Why buy all that stuff when you can sort of rent it from Amazon or somebody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're you're bullish on cloud computing slash software as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, it's time sharing.  It's like I mean, this stuff is.  Well, I mean, that's I think that's that's John's objection to it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that it's it's time sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that might well, so is a big  is kind of a bigoted thing to say.  I think the thing is what I complain about is not so much software as a service  or or cloud computing for a large corporation that wants to outsource  its IT department because it just can't take it anymore.  I'm just complaining about the individual who starts to rely too much on  on off site mechanical, you know, off site software, off site storage  when you can buy a terabyte drive at Costco for eighty nine dollars.  And you got plenty of storage.  You don't need to put your photos online.  I mean, a lot of people have put their photos.  And I have no objection to smug mug and all these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I keep a local copy, but I put it on smug mug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people use these different systems.  And it's fine.  And it gives it one way of distributing at least thumbnails.  I mean, but nowadays, the raw files up there on it.  It's just the side.  How long does it take it?  Well, you're sitting.  OK, you're sitting on this.  Remind people you're sitting on a lot of bandwidth on a 10 megabit per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't use that, though, for the uploading.  I mean, I know this stuff.  I mean, it takes a while.  I do it at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have five, I mean, because I have files here.  I mean, we're going to have it like that.  The thing is, John, I think I agree you should keep your own copy.  It is so cheap to be able to do that.  But it's also good to be able to have it up there.  But a lot of this, if you think of from a company  viewpoint where they do have needs to change, being able to take advantage  of more than you have whenever you want extra to have that extra stuff,  being able to get it out in the cloud is a nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm not going to argue that.  Well, I'm not going to argue the fact that it's nice to have offsite storage  in case your house burns down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's but it's not relying on the cloud.  It's a it's a secondary. That's what I object to.  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right, because I mean, we see all the problems  when when these things go down, you really need a way to not have  a single point of failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you an example, because my kids high school,  I was talking to them about technology,  and it's a very expensive thing for a school to invest in hardware and software.  It gets obsolete much more quickly than they'd like it to be.  It's you know, it's it adds up, whereas they could do a lot of this stuff  instead of buying Microsoft Office, they could use Google Docs or Zoho Office.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, isn't that a better way to go for some things?  And sometimes, yeah, I mean, there are times when it's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a time for this and a time for that time for this, you know.  And John's right.  There's some times when it's wrong and sometimes it's right.  And the trick is knowing when to use the right thing.  And things change over time.  Something that used to be right may be wrong.  And I mean, that's one of the things to get into my book.  Things evolve.  And I think people have to understand how a lot of this stuff evolves over time.  Ideas that were bad ideas in the old days may be good today and vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many of us rely on Gmail these days?  That's that's cloud computing.  Yeah, I want to actually get back circle back round to the pre  with you, Dan, in just a bit and talk a little bit about that.  But I want to also take a break right now.  So, John, if you want to baste your meat, go right.  I'm going to go baste.  Well, we do this on Sunday afternoon and John often is cooking.  I guess he gets the cooking detail on Sunday.  If Dan, if you want to go baste your meat, you may as well.  But I want to mention audible.com audible is our great sponsor.  We love audible. We love audio books.  I'm a big audiobook fanatic.  I live on audible.com.  Audible is basically your online library.  You download the book comes, by the way, you know, in seconds.  It does not take long, a couple of minutes.  And you've got an entire novel or history or great sci fi novels.  And they're all available to you.  It's you browse, you pick.  I want to recommend the audible platinum account today audible.com slash twit two,  because with audible.com slash twit two, you get two books for free.  Sign up today and you get two credits towards your your your own books.  You get to keep them even if you decide not to stick around.  But let me tell you, you might have a little bit of difficulty choosing.  There's so many good ones.  Dan, I don't think your book is on audio, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not yet. But at this point, I would rather maybe be on audio  before it would be on the Kindle.  Really? Why is that?  Well, one of the things about audio is that you have all that ability  in your voice to do what you do in typography on the page.  That's true. It's expressive.  Right. And the Kindle has very limited typography initially,  especially when you move a book automatically over to it.  When they first tried moving my book over, it lost a lot and had a lot of errors.  We had a Nixit.  But if you had somebody reading it with a good voice,  who'd be able to let you know when it was a quote  and use different voices in place of typography, you have a lot more freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting. I never thought of that.  But you're absolutely right.  And the readers they use are the best.  I mean, these guys are so good.  I'm going to recommend a book that's a classic.  In fact, many have said, you know, one of the most influential books of all time.  Times Literary Supplement said it's one of the 100 most influential books  since the Second World War.  It's Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.  We know you when you you you you you twit listeners are smart people.  This is this is a great choice for somebody who wants to read a classic,  unabridged, read by Dennis Holland and just in a stunning rendition.  Let me play a little bit of this for you just to give you an idea of what you might  what it might sound like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn,  partly from scientific training itself and partly from a longstanding  avocational interest in the philosophy of science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can hear the typography, by the way.  You can hear it because he's he's he's speaking as as the writer.  This is a landmark in intellectual history, a classic.  Now, that's just one. You get another one.  So I'm sure you'll find from our many recommendations,  you're going to find a second book you want.  This is I have to say Audible is to me, it's like going back to school.  It's like being entertained. It's like watching great movies.  It's all of the above. I want you to try it out for free.  Go to audible.com slash twit to your first month's free includes two free books  and Thomas Kewn's classic, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,  would be a great one to start with.  He was from MIT professor,  really talks about these paradigm shifts that change everything.  We're in the middle of them.  I mean, we see them happening almost, you know, yearly in this business.  This book is, you know, I hope it's written. I think it was written.  I don't know. The 60s, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a very popular book amongst the kids nowadays in college.  Is it really? It's big time. My son is the one who turned me on to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That's cool. Yeah. It's really good.  I'm trying to remember where I got turned up.  Probably somebody sent it in an email. I get a lot. It's really fun now.  I get a lot of recommendations for audio books from audible, from our listeners,  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. It's big with the kids.  Thomas Kewn, 1962. Thank you.  That's when it was written. Audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them so much for their support.  You know, they've been asking me at Audible what book I want to read.  I said, we want you to read a book.  Maybe it'll be Bricklin on technology.  I'll channel you. Actually, Dan, you should read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just put up a little YouTube video this afternoon  where I read a little bit of the first chapter.  Oh, good. A little bit of another chapter. Yeah.  That's a great idea.  But I'm not a professional reader. So Neil Gaiman did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can read. Oh, yeah. You sound great.  You got the sure, Mike.  Neil Gaiman did that with his most recent book.  He he YouTube. It was actually really cool.  He videoed his book appearances.  And in each appearance, he'd read a different chapter.  So eventually he got the whole thing and he put it up on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a great idea. It's not great.  It's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't think that that's slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like to read an excerpt.  Chapter one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was it was a juvenile, so it wasn't that long.  But I mean, that doesn't reduce sales.  That just improves sales, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Neil is a there's actually a lot of studies that indicate that's the case.  Neil's a great reader, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He does. Yeah, I'm going to start reading and putting up on YouTube.  Reasonable amount of it.  We'll see if I get some good feedback on it.  I have a section I know.  Whatever people tell me in an interview or something that they like the section,  then I know maybe that's the one I should read and put up.  And that's a good. Some of those. That's a good.  So if there's anything you like, John, let me know and I'll read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I'd like is some one of the things I the book was very enjoyable,  but it didn't have to, in my opinion, enough dirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Where's the gossip, Dan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he had their stories to be told about.  And, you know, in the early day, in fact, I was chronicling it as it occurred.  And then later, I, you know, as I kind of deconstructed the whole event,  talking to Dan and Bob and also Frankston, who also Frankston and Fowlstra.  And then there's the fourth guy who I actually never managed to run into.  Peter Jennings. Yeah, Jennings. I don't think I've ever met him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might have. These are the four horsemen of Visekalek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And there was a it was an interesting it was one of the early  kind of blow ups that took place in the industry.  I mean, there's been other examples, but the industry was shaky.  And it was easy for things to blow up because  these guys were like you said, this was the first.  Killer app ever.  And it actually triggered the revolution, the desktop computing revolution.  In many ways, it would have not taken the same direction had this product not appeared.  And so these guys were on new.  They're kind of in a new space.  And it was an interesting it had an interesting effect on the various egos.  And it resulted in a very unfortunately collapse of the of the company,  the marketing group and everybody in between, because  anyway, the story's never been adequately.  Oh, yeah. It's a lawsuit city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it was now as I point out in the book, I say, hey,  there are some pretty bad times, but the book is not a business book.  It's a technology book.  And that's a business story.  And it's a story that will hopefully be told one of these days.  And I would have need help from the others involved.  And there was there was one time when a lot of us came together  for a history meeting of sorts.  And it was all recorded where we talked about some of those things.  And if you follow the links that my book points to,  you'll eventually get to what Ed Esbrer has to say and what  Fielster has to say and whatever about different things.  But we had an author publisher relationship.  And an author publisher relationship is not a good thing when you have a hit.  You know, when they hit business, that's not really a good thing.  And that's how things were structured in those days.  Others learn from that, that that's not what you should do,  which is why Ashton Tate ended up buying out  Wayne Ratliff before they could go public or I think maybe around the time, whatever.  So they didn't have that author publisher relationship,  which is an unstable relationship.  And there were there were a lot of personalities involved, a lot of things.  And my book is about, you know, technology evolving.  And the VisiCalc story I wanted to tell was about how it was developed  and how it got out there, not the part about how it fell apart,  because that would have been another 500 pages.  And I have material.  One of these days, maybe Bob and I will get together.  Maybe we get you to talk about what you saw outside,  because you were commenting around then it was there was a lot of intrigue.  We didn't we haven't even talked about half of what went on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's my understanding.  There's still a lot of and a lot of still then some ill feelings  still kind of just residual.  I don't think anybody cares anymore that much.  But it's just one of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, less so. I mean, Fielster and I actually,  we get along relatively well when we see each other.  And, you know, he you know, he wanted a copy.  I offered him a copy of the book, which he readily accepted a copy of.  And he's been very nice about that stuff.  And I would send him I sent him as a courtesy what I wrote,  whatever I would mention him in advance.  In fact, I did that for around 50 people who I quote in the book in some way.  I got permission from them whether or not I needed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's fact checking usually counts for that,  which is a good practice if you have the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it was also well, some of them I had to get written permission from  because I use a lot of other people's material in the book  because I try to be like a blog and a website  where you have this back and forth with others.  And when you're reading a book, you don't have the other side.  You can't just click on a link in the book.  So and a lot of the links don't work anymore.  I had to go to archive dot org to find a lot of the material.  So I got stuff from Evan Williams.  I got stuff from from, you know, Dave Weiner, Clay Shirky.  I mean, all these different people gave me stuff  and I got permission to put it in there.  I guess sounds exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how did you publish it?  Who published the book and what kind of you made a deal with that?  What was it again?  It's Wiley. Wiley. Wiley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they approached me and said, hey, you've got it all written, you know.  It's just take stuff on your blog and maybe write a little new  a few new things and you'll be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we'll give you five percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I I finally accepted.  I said, OK, I'll write a lot of stuff.  I have to write new stuff.  I have to put things around it.  It is actually the order of the blog.  It's basically I'm talking about different themes  that I've been talking about over the years.  And where appropriate, I brought something in from my website.  And where not appropriate, I'll write something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the chronology resets quite a bit, which is fine,  because I think it gives people that makes the book easier easier to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's one of the typography things I had to deal with is,  how do I let you know that you're reading something five or six pages long?  That's something from, you know, back in 1999  that if I talk about, oh, you know, Napster, Napster still was around  or cell phones weren't as ubiquitous as they are now, et cetera, et cetera.  So I worked on that real hard.  And actually, if you go to my website, I wrote a whole piece  about what I went through, figuring out how to do the the layout  and how to write this book and how to put it together.  It was it was a lot of work.  But for people who blog, I think they'll learn something from it  about how they can take their blog, maybe and turn it into a book if they want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it that you have in your blog a little  snippet from the business school paper you wrote that, you know,  kind of inspired VisiCalc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was about VisiCalc.  I mean, it was I was working on it and I had this paper  I was writing that wasn't going to be published.  And they said, write something on an advertising situation.  So I'll write about advertising this new product.  Well, VisiCalc was called Calculedger, right? Yeah.  Yeah. And the last line, and it's the funniest, I mean, I, you know,  I was thinking of calling an electronic spreadsheet,  but I said that most people don't know what a spreadsheet is.  More people know what a ledger is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, it's good you didn't call it Calculedger.  I just want to say that. Yeah, Calculedger is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Well, Dan Fielster made the decision to come to use the name VisiCalc.  Yeah, I know. I think that's it.  Yeah, they both think that they came up with a name and we have whole stories about that.  But Fielster said, hey, this is the name.  We had all these meetings. We get together. What name?  We have 50 different names.  And finally, he said, OK, we're going to go with VisiCalc.  That's it. And it was a good name.  So it could have been Excel or one, two.  It could have been one, you know, Lotus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what were you involved?  Were you in the decision and the and the initiative to do VisiOn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not at all. Well, that's getting into the sore points.  They decided to do the people who published VisiCalc,  the company that named it started out as personal software, renamed itself  as VisiCorp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And by the way, that's another you have to be careful.  I always tell people, you know, in fact, I hope that some people run these names by me  because any writer worth assault immediately takes.  And I think I wrote this in InfoWorld takes a name like that  and you immediately call it VisiCorp.  Yeah, right. And you know, you can't resist.  I mean, come on. It's like the premature and the pre-bankruptcy  and the, you know, the go broke and the rest of them.  I mean, you just you have to use that material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, like I don't call it a trash AD.  It was the TRS AD.  It was a machine that was really helpful for a lot of people.  But the the company VisiCorp decided that I guess maybe they had seen  the people, the people who knew what was going on at Xerox PARC.  And they decided that they wanted to do something that was mouse based  and graphics based.  And they did this whole system, which, you know, from my visual,  when I saw it, you know, it it took all the advantages,  disadvantages of character based with all the disadvantages of  of graphics based for that day.  But it was a windowing system that ran on top of DOS.  And it used a mouse and it was really cool.  And they developed some cool stuff.  Unfortunately, they decided that they wanted to find  maybe their spreadsheet they wrote themselves,  even though our contract said that they were supposed to pay us  if they had a spreadsheet, we sort of had a back and forth,  you know, tight contract between us.  So there were business problems and we ended up in a lawsuit with them.  They had unfortunately their product was underpowered  or took too much power on the PCs of the day.  And when it came out, it didn't sell very well.  I have a copy sitting back there under the eaves  that I picked up at a garage sale or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you must have.  I actually think I have the original copies.  What I think I think it's didn't they sell this to control data or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they eventually they had to raise some money at all.  After they they tried suing us and then they lost that lawsuit.  And there was all sorts of stuff.  They were bleeding money and all sorts of stuff went on,  which I'm not sure of what happened.  I wasn't there.  But I think they ended up selling some rights to control data,  but nothing much happened of it.  But it helped spur Microsoft on with Windows to get windows out there.  And but Windows, notice, took many tries a long time, many years to get going.  Visit Corp, unfortunately, didn't have the runway that Microsoft had.  And 123 was hurting them with this account.  They sued us, which cost a lot of money in terms of stuff.  And all that went away and they weren't able to survive with that.  If they had had the cash cow that Microsoft had to keep them going,  I'm sure they would have eventually made busy, busy on something really cool.  They had apparently they had some really good people working on it,  is what I was told. I never, you know, got to work much with it.  We were at that time not on such great terms talking with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This era from about 1979 to about 19, I don't know, 85 or so.  It is still somewhat foggy in a lot of kind of areas.  And it's never been really a history of the industry's kind of  beats around the bush about a lot of stuff that went on.  I mean, because there's mainly because the period was so rich with stuff.  So much going on. You couldn't keep track of that.  Some of the really probably some of the more interesting stories  that have yet to be told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope somebody does.  Yeah, I hope we get that stuff because it is really valuable  from a historic viewpoint and the software industry part  and the hardware business, the hardware, more of it's been,  I think, been documented.  But, you know, I try at least to provide whatever documents I have,  start putting them up like you'll notice in the book, I put a lot of  pictures of stuff that are in my notebook because I took notes  about when we did things.  So I know on that day, I found out about control all Dell, you know,  from that.  I found out on that day that that's what happened.  That's when IBM came to us.  And that's why I put my paper up when I saw that paper.  It said, hey, let's share this.  I have an old video I'm going to put up when I get to  get it in the right form to put up on YouTube,  where I took a home video system, you know, with those things  you carry on your shoulder and a big box on the side.  In 1983, one of my employees, Cheryl and I, walked around Condex  and for an hour and a half, we took pictures.  I have I have a demonstration of windows  pre Windows one when it's been demonstrated,  where they explain, you know, about the different panes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember that stuff? Right in the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, the clock. And you get to see it, you know.  And I had the IBM demonstrating the in a demonstration room  with many of them, the PCJr.  And they, you know, don't touch it yet.  OK, now you can turn it on, you know, push the this button.  And it's really funny to see that, how we were going gaga  over these machines that were character based.  And Apple was showing now this is 83 before the Mac.  And they were showing what looked like Mac paint  with a mouse running on the Apple to.  Oh, wow. Found that sort of buried in there.  I found Bill Gates talking with John Saks.  Now, John Saks is the guy who wrote one, two, three.  Right. And Bill Gates was talking with him.  And he's doing picture it or something.  Well, yeah. And in Triumph of the Nerds,  a few seconds of that video was used, but I didn't give them permission  to use the sound because I didn't have permission from Bill.  But I think now would be OK to put it up.  Bill talks about how they use Xenics to do all their development.  It's really funny.  He's, you know, we use, you know, basically they're using Unix  to do development at Microsoft.  And he's talking with with the guy who did one, two, three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least it was a Microsoft product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was their version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You think you'd put that on YouTube?  You put it on your blog? It'd be great to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would put it up. It's too long to put on YouTube.  I put it up on Google Video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How big is it? Because, you know, you know, they've changed their  you can put up a gigabyte now.  Oh, yeah. You might be able to talk.  You can get permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I can hook you up.  We were just talking with Kevin Marks from Google about that yesterday  because we want to start putting full length podcasts up on YouTube.  And he said, no, for somebody who's a producer,  we know you're not going to be putting copyright material up.  We can arrange that. So, yeah, this this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem was that the DVD I had with it doesn't read into my video program  without breaking up rights.  At least you had a DVD. You don't have to.  Well, no, the DVD is from the tape, which I stuck in my little machine downstairs  that converts tapes to DVDs and stuff.  I did put up a video of Go Corporation of Robert Carr demonstrating Penpoint.  That's up on Google Video.  And it's like an hour demo and he demonstrates all the stuff about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great that there's stuff like a Google video on YouTube now.  I mean, you can see, you know,  Doug Engelbart's very famous park demonstration, whatever it was, 64 or 62.  And all that video, the entire video is there and people can see it.  If somebody has the interest in this stuff, this material at least is still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good to have archives of that stuff.  And it's not showing up a lot of bandwidth because it's not like everybody.  You know, a million people want to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's historic.  You know, one of the things I really  I'm sad about with tech TV and wanted to do with tech TV is kind of document all this stuff.  I know, you know, they apparently John and I have this battle,  but apparently they have saved everything. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe one of these days.  There's no way they swear to me, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, they've been digitizing it and they're going to put it all online.  I talked to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one or two things, but I guarantee you they have everything.  They have everything.  How can they say that when I have the silicon spin tapes in my basement?  There were copies made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, why would they do that?  I don't know. They say they have everything.  We'll see. But they're digitizing it.  So, by the way, I just want to just interrupt for one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jonathan Sachs has a company called Digital Light and Color.  I think he needs a plug.  He has a product called Picture Window and it's got its Picture Window Pro 5.0  and go to DL-C.com for Digital Light and Color.  And it's a very interesting photo editor that does some things that none of the other editors do,  including some geometric stuff, which is very valuable to people  who have perspective control problems with some of their photos.  Anyway, just give them. I've always wanted to like this product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was using it for if you take pictures of the sky  and you know the aberrations in your telescope,  you could use it to make more exact versions.  I think that was one of the initial uses for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and he's a, you know, coded Lotus 123 in Assembler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that kind of wonderful.  You know, nobody was able to knock off his code in that on that machine.  It was an incredible code base what he did.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Yeah, he really is.  I actually knew him before before we did VisiCalc.  But I hired him.  In fact, I wish actually I hired the guy who worked with him.  I hired Ray Ozzy to work with him.  Oh, that's interesting.  And then Ray left to go work over with Mitch over working on Symphony.  And then he did notes, etc.  Now he's at Microsoft and he blurbed the cover of my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And architecting their cloud computing initiative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Yeah, Ray's they're real lucky to have him there.  And let's hope he's able to to do the things that he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Dan, I think we're going to have to get you back on Twitter  because we've just scratched the surface.  There's so much to talk about.  Lots of really been fun.  And what's great is that not only do you have the historic background,  but you you've got your finger on the pulse of what's going on right now.  We didn't get back to the pre, but maybe in a few weeks when the pre comes out,  I'd love to get your impressions of that as somebody who is a JavaScript programmer.  You know, Apple, you know, that was Apple's plan with the iPhone was,  oh, you don't need to write applications, which is support CSS, Apple script.  Yeah, I mean, JavaScript, that didn't work out so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it didn't do the good things in JavaScript.  You didn't get mouse down and mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. You kind of need those, don't you?  Yeah. Yeah.  You think the pre will they think that a little map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea. I have no idea.  I haven't looked at it that closely yet.  And, you know, if I get one and play with it, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it comes out a week from Saturday.  So just three days before Apple presumably will announce its iPhone  third generation.  Dan's book is Bricklin on technology.  It's on bookstores everywhere, but maybe just go to Bricklin.com for a copy.  That stands a log, which is his blog.  They call it Bricklin log.  And also your podcast is there, too.  And Dan's got some great interviews on his podcast.  Highly recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
