Transcript:  It's time for Twitter This Week in Tech.  I know you're looking at the play bar on your podcast client.  You're saying two and a half hours, but let me tell you, it's going to be the best two  and a half hours you ever spent.  Greg Farrow is here from the Packet Pushers Network.  Ian Thompson from theregister.co.uk.  The reason we went so long is we had so many great discussions about Apple and its iPhone,  about the new Amazon Echoes.  What are they up to about the new Blade Runner movie?  And ultimately, we talked about the fundamental problem Silicon Valley is having as people  start to turn their back on tech.  It's all coming up next on Twitter.  This is Twitter This Week in Tech, episode 634, recorded Sunday, October 1st, 2017.  An Apple Watch walks into a bar.

It's time for Twitter This Week in Tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.  And really, this show is going to be a remedial show for me because I've been gone for the  last two weeks.  I have no idea what happened.  Thank God we have two of the best in studio with us.  They just happened to both be from, well, the colonies.  No, we're the colonies.  You're the empire, Ian Thompson.  Such as it is at the moment.

And in the process of walking, I fractured my ankle and ended up in hospital with a plaster  cast and blah, blah, blah.  I'm sorry.  Just goes to show exercise is unhealthy.  Yes, I believe that the evidence might point to this.  Look at Douglas Adams.

Transcript:  So while I was gone, Apple shipped iPhone 8s to some lucky members of the press as well  as some actual users.  This I've been playing with for a couple of days.  I had the Note 8 right before I left.  But none of this matters one whit because on Wednesday, Google's going to announce new  pixels and someday this year, maybe next year, Apple's going to start shipping the iPhone  10, which the world resolutely calls the iPhone X.  Yes.  Is there a consensus yet on whether Apple's selling any of these iPhone 8s?  It feels to me, it was so easy to waltz into the online store at 1201 Pacific time and  buy this.  It feels like it's not selling like hotcakes.

Transcript:  I don't think it's flying off the shelves by any manner of means.  I mean, there's nothing in there that is a must have.  No, it's not a huge difference.  It's a tick or a tick, you know, you've got ticks and tocks in evolution and this is just  a slight tick.  It keeps a lot of the things that people didn't like about the last iPhone and it doesn't  really add an awful lot more.  So I'm going to be at the Pixel event on Wednesday.  I'm curious to see what they've done.  Although it does look as though they too are abandoning the 3.5mm jack, which is, unless  they can give me a damn good reason for that, I'm going to hammer them on it.

Transcript:  Here from Slice Intelligence.  So Slice, as you know, that's that app.  I use it.  It tells you when you're getting stuff on its way.  Slice has five million users.  iPhone 8 sales, not good.  This bar graph here shows sales in the first five days following lunch.  Following lunch.  I told you I'm a little punchy.  iPhone 6, wow, big.  There's no scale on this.  So I don't know how big big is.  N equals 146,556 shoppers.  I don't know what any of this means.  I can't read it.  iPhone 7 Plus, the next biggest seller, then the 7, then the 6 Plus, the 6S.  Way down at the bottom.  The iPhone 8 Plus and an even smaller wedge, the iPhone 8.  Now that's not Apple's stat.  Apple won't tell.  But that is Slice's stat.  Ming-Chi Kuo, the analyst, also said sales have been sluggish of the iPhone 8.  And the stock market seems to think so.  Apple's stock has been going down.  The question really for us is, is that because people are waiting for the iPhone 10?  I think so.

Start time: 412.87
End time: 414.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I love you.  I really think so.

Start time: 415.62
End time: 454.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that there's a bunch of early adopters where money's not a problem.  It's all about having the latest and greatest phones.  And there's people in the Android space for this as well.  And back in the days of Microsoft Windows phones, et cetera, et cetera, they wanted  the latest and greatest.  And so I think Apple's made a fundamental flaw here, introducing the iPhone 8 and the  iPhone X or 10 at the same time.  The Osborne, almost, right?  Yeah, they should have released the iPhone 8 and said, this is the best phone we've ever  made and then come around for another announcement in three or four, five, six months time and  said, here's the iPhone 10.  This is our step change.

Start time: 455.00
End time: 469.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but how annoying would that be for people who bought the iPhone 8 to find out six months  later, oh, it's already obsolete.  And that's a challenge.  And they also don't want to miss the holiday season.  Why did they even bother doing an iPhone 8?  Because they couldn't make enough Xs.

Start time: 470.28
End time: 481.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, also because there is a very limited market for people who are going to spend 12  grand on a phone.  See, I just, 12 thousand, 12 hundred.  Sorry, 12 hundred on a phone.  Even a smaller market for 12 grand.

Start time: 482.10
End time: 538.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure about that.  I think that here would be my guess.  The iPhone X is going to end up, if they can make it and that's not an insignificant if.  If they can make it, it's going to sell as well as any other iPhone.  That's the one people want and are waiting for.  And what it really, to me, points out is that the iPhone is not about technology.  This is marginally, the 8 is marginally better than the 7.  Not anything to write home about.  If you have a 7, you know, unless you absolutely have to have wireless charging or that goofy  portrait stuff that they're doing, there's no reason to upgrade this.  Yes, it's an incredible, oh, Malik wrote this P into the A11 Bionic processor and Apple's  amazing ability to do its own fabs and to do its own GPU now for the first time.  To do its own amazing chip and this chip is so fast it's comparable to a MacBook Pro,  but you don't need it.  It's like driving a Ferrari on a local city street.

Start time: 538.62
End time: 573.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Top three things people use these for are browsing the internet, navigation and making  calls and there is no significant improvement with the iPhone 8 in that.  And I've got to say also with the iPhone X, there's not a real significant, I mean, they've  got rid of the home button.  Well, that's going to be more irritating than not.  It's a negative.  A definite negative.  It's a facial recognition thing.  Unless that works flawlessly out of the box, they're going to lose a lot of goodwill on  that and by all accounts, it's a fairly fragile piece of kit as well.  And repairability is not good with Apple products to put it mildly.  So I don't know, I think they could actually be heading for fall on this one.

Start time: 573.96
End time: 600.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They may have kneecapped themselves by doing these three phones in this kind of odd strategy.  By the way, they offer still an iPhone SE at $350, an iPhone 6S at $450, an iPhone 7  at $550, an iPhone 8 at $700, an iPhone X at $1,000.  This is exactly what Steve Jobs, when he came back after leaving Apple, said was wrong with  Apple.  They had too many skews.  This is so...

Start time: 600.80
End time: 692.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a few things going on here and then some of them are economic and  some of them are market driven.  So the idea is that the iPhone X shifts the price for the premium phone up from $700 to  over $1,000.  And that's key to getting the ARPU, average revenue per user, up for Apple.  And they haven't been able to shift above because they've always had just one phone.  And when you have just one phone, it has to be a price that appeals to the widest possible  audience.  So by running multiple product lines, you're now able to ship more products to more price  brackets.  And in theory, you should be selling more and you also should be selling more at higher  values.  Now, keep in mind also that the iPhone 6S and the previous generations, the production  processes have been maximized.  They're efficient.  They've been working.  They know how to make those phones at high profit margins now and produce them in volume.  So the average profit margin on those phone, those older units is rumored to be very high,  much higher than it was, say, three or four years ago, and they can produce them en masse.  So they're increasing the average sale price per unit by jumping in with the iPhone X without  disrupting all the stacks underneath.  And I think this is the trick is...  I think Apple was trying to be greedy here.  By introducing the iPhone X in time for the holiday season, the Christmas period where  everybody says, oh, I can buy myself a new iPhone because I can buy myself a Christmas  present or I can buy one for somebody else and so forth.  They really should have taken a step back and said, well, we'll ship the iPhone 8 and  then we'll come back for the iPhone 10 in March next year or something like that.  What about...

Start time: 693.34
End time: 694.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would skip the 8 and just go straight to the 10.

Start time: 696.10
End time: 707.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it makes sense to do that.  Too many people are used to the yearly cadence and they're expecting to see an upgrade.  The iPhone 8 is a perfectly acceptable upgrade.  And no...

Start time: 708.28
End time: 715.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're coming from a 6 or earlier, yes.  Or a 7.  Yes.  And in the same way that the 6 is a 7...  I don't think it's a suitable upgrade from a 7.  It's too close to a 7.

Start time: 716.54
End time: 731.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But nobody who's...  Well, and let me restate that.  There are people who are early adopters who will buy whatever Apple ships to have the  latest phone for this year, and those people are not going to rush out and buy the 8.  They're going to go and buy the iPhone 10.  And price for them is not an option.

Start time: 731.66
End time: 805.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My real question is, isn't that what's really going on?  Is that...  Ben Thompson breaks it down.  There's two people who buy iPhones.  He actually has an excellent article on Stratecary talking about this strategy.  He does.  One of the keys...  He says that two of the markets identified are customers who want the best possible phone  and customers who want the prestige of owning the highest status phone on the market.  For those customers, the iPhone 10 is really the only option, right?  And I even think Apple's very well aware of this, that one of the controversial features  of this iPhone 10 is this bizarre notch at the top.  Samsung managed to make a screen as big, in fact, a little bit bigger with better resolution  with no notch at all.  They just made it start a little bit lower on the screen.  That seems to be the normal way.  But I think there's a reason why Apple wanted the notch.  It's not for technical reasons.  It's not because it needed to be there.  It's because it makes it so that you can have one.  And immediately it's apparent you have the newest, latest, hard to get phone.  It's fins.

Start time: 805.48
End time: 849.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, at the reg we call this the Cupertino idiot tax.  Basically, there are a bunch of people who, no matter what it costs, will buy the latest  and greatest Apple kit.  And it's not just Apple.  It goes across some other firms.  But Apple users are fanatical about this.  And they're not going to buy the 8.  They're going to wait until the 10.  People who have just bought a 7 a year ago probably aren't going to buy the 8 for another  six months.  And what is worrying is that Apple now has this long line of products.  And as we saw with Apple before Jobs actually came back, that was what was killing the company.  You had a plethora of different computers, all of them not particularly good.  And I do think Apple, this exposes a real problem with Apple.  That's my question.

Start time: 850.42
End time: 851.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't this confusing to consumers?

Start time: 851.58
End time: 879.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think you're assuming that the cost of the old phones is actually holding  old inventory or producing old inventory or having too many screws is hard.  And yet Apple's still producing the same 6s that it's already shipped 150 million units  of.  The robots that make it, the production lines that produce the screens, the chips that are  inside it don't cost them a lot of money to get a handle on.  So it's not like keeping those lines running kills them.  No, that's true.

Start time: 880.42
End time: 899.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that Apple can't do it.  Clearly, Apple has logistics down.  It's a question of whether it confuses the market.  Now, Ben does point out there's a third Apple phone buyer, customers who want to own a top  of the line iPhone but can't afford one.  And it's his position that that's what these other ones are for, particularly the 6s and  the SE.

Start time: 899.74
End time: 903.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, if you've got a MacBook and you bought into the entire Apple ecosystem then.

Start time: 903.54
End time: 960.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to be part of the group but you can't quite afford the 10 or even an 8.  So that makes sense.  He says that Apple's taking a pretty significant risk, in particular with the iPhone 8.  He says we know the company could succeed selling the best phone but he points to the  5c, the one with the plastic color back.  The example of building a less than best phone was underwhelming.  It hardly sold.  So how many, he asks, how many iPhone buyers will forgo the 8 to wait for the 10?  It's my suspicion that that's what's happening is that a great many people either are that  third category and they're going to buy or stick with their, most of them will stick  with their iPhone.  If they're buying an iPhone, they're going to get a lower end, less expensive iPhone.  And the rest are status conscious people, people who want the best phone.  Really it's the best iPhone because I would argue that the 10 isn't particularly spectacularly  technically advanced.

Start time: 961.04
End time: 973.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what kind of is worrying me about Apple's strategy at the moment in that since  Jobs died they haven't come up with a groundbreaking product.  It's just been iterations of what came before.  Well look what's happening with the watch now.

Start time: 974.64
End time: 978.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They released a watch that has massive technical issues with connectivity.

Start time: 979.68
End time: 995.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also is a really bad deal for consumers in terms of data costs because you're not  actually adding that much to your data costs but you're having to pay an extra 10 bucks  more a month.  It's just like, there's only so long you can squeeze sheep before things start going out  of hand.

Start time: 996.60
End time: 1001.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the interesting thing.  I don't think it's going to hurt Apple.  It would hurt any other company.

Start time: 1001.24
End time: 1011.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be difficult to hurt Apple but you know Apple used to be the same god mode technology  company and they lost it in the mid 90s.  They're just pivoted.

Start time: 1013.24
End time: 1049.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They used to be a god mode technology company.  Please don't tell me you use the pivot word.  No they're a fashion company.  They're a status company.  And I tell you what I see among affluent people who can afford them iPhones completely dominate.  If you can afford an iPhone you buy an iPhone for the most part.  Only a few geeks like us prefer Android phones.  And I think that they continue to own that.  They don't own it for technical reasons.  What was the whole noise about AR?  These phones are going to be the next breakthrough in AR.  I downloaded all the AR apps.  There's nothing.  This is not a breakthrough in AR.

Start time: 1050.28
End time: 1067.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you see it's the same thing with Samsung and their VR headset.  I got a unit of that.  Tried it out.  The amount of good VR stuff out there that you can realistically download, put onto  a phone and run is minimal.  We're still in the hype cycle upswing on this one.

Start time: 1067.54
End time: 1120.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The funny thing is that the hardware you need to do really good AR is actually on the iPhone  X.  It's just facing you.  It's facing the wrong way.  And it's used for two and only two things.  This is very typical of Apple.  They put NFC in but they didn't allow anybody to use it.  They put all this super duper Kinect technology with the dot painting projection lights and  the infrared sensors.  Pointed at you so you could do face ID because they decided unaccountably to remove a perfectly  good biometric authentication that everybody liked and gotten used to.  It was very effective.  And it's easy to use.  If you're in the car you can't hold it in front of you.  They removed it so they had to put this face recognition in.  So that's one reason you get this.  And the other reason is so you can do animated emojis and you're not getting any of the AR  benefit.  If they put that on the other side that would be a Tango like high quality AR engine.  But they don't.

Start time: 1121.35
End time: 1142.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't.  But then again they're putting it on the iPhone X and they're not putting it in the iPhone  They could have put it in the iPhone 8 and sold it to the mass market.  The iPhone X is intended to be a test.  There's a vision of the iPhone X as a trial.  Can we produce enough OLED screens?  Can we produce units with the Face ID capability?  Can we produce...

Start time: 1142.38
End time: 1146.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not even producing the OLED screens.  They're not producing any of these components.  They're buying them from Samsung.

Start time: 1147.70
End time: 1185.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure they are but can Samsung produce them at Apple iPhone numbers?  Can Samsung produce a million units a month and scale up to 10 million units enough?  And Apple didn't think that Samsung can do that.  And I think the challenge is that if they tried to put an OLED screen into the iPhone  8, that the fear is that Samsung wouldn't have been able to produce enough screens to  meet demand any time in the next year no matter how many robots.  I mean you've seen Apple spend like four billion dollars pre-ordering components which is giving  those companies enough money to go and buy the robots.  Some of those robots are like 250 million each to make some of these parts inside of  here.

Start time: 1186.62
End time: 1204.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should thank Apple because it's this kind of thing since 2007 that's propelled so many  other markets because Apple has made it easier and cheaper to make all sorts of these components.  That's why we have drones.  That's why we have so many amazing technologies.  Frankly it's why we have all these other good smartphones is because Apple put all the money  in up front to make the pipeline.

End time: 1223.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although if you look at how they've dealt with some of their suppliers it's been slightly  less than ethical.  But at the same time you're right.  Apple didn't invent the smartphone.  It just made it sexy.  It made it something that people actually wanted.  And they sold them in massive quantities.  Absolutely.  And they deserve credit for that.

Start time: 1223.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ben has an interesting theory about the iPhone X that it's really intended for China where  the number one, first of all Apple's been suffering in China.  They've been beaten by the Chinese, by Huawei, by ZTE, by Xiaomi.  They're doing very well in China and iPhone sales have plummeted.  But it's a very apparently very status conscious market.  And Ben's in Taiwan so I think he has some insight into this.  And he thinks, he says the iPhone X will be a massive hit in China in particular.  I wouldn't be surprised if most of the early iPhone supply, iPhone X supply, were earmarked  for China.

Start time: 1261.52
End time: 1296.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple would love to come back and get that market back.  They're not going to be able, we heard, Wall Street Journal had a story that two of the  components in the iPhone X, Romeo and Juliet, as one might expect, are a pair.  They kill each other or?  They both die at the end.  No, they're a pair of components that are needed in it and one of them is behind, I  can't remember if it's Romeo or Juliet.  And that's what's going to hold up, this was a story earlier this week.  Imbalance with modules fuels concern about widespread sales shortages.

Start time: 1298.28
End time: 1329.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, they're not going to sell.  It's part of the face.  They're going to keep, if they want to keep this as a premium product, make it fairly  difficult to buy.  Have long waiting lists.  You know, if you want to flood into China and put a bunch of stuff there, that's fine.  We could end up with a situation where you actually get people queuing up in China to  buy iPhone Xs and sending them back to the US rather than the other way around as it  was five years ago.  So I don't know, it could work in China, but it just, it's a lot of money to spend on a  phone.  A thousand dollars for the base spec model.  Pushing it.

Start time: 1330.24
End time: 1389.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But at the same time, Apple's not abandoning those other users.  It's keeping the seven, the six and the five for those customers who want it.  And it's not producing a cut down version of it.  It's still producing the same premium phone that it was producing just two or three years  ago, which, you know what, for a lot of people is actually perfectly functional.  I want to come back to the China thing.  I think there's one thing you need to realize about China, too, is that most of the  American tech companies have actually been booted out of China.  No Google, no Facebook, no Netflix, no Amazon.  Right. All of those have been chased out of China because they won't conform to what the  Chinese government wants.  And Apple is almost the last of the American tech companies that are still there.  We'll talk later on about Scott Galloway, who's talking about how the US tech giants  are starting to face a lashback.  I hope we talk about it.  Yes.  I really want to talk about that.  Yeah.  And, you know, so Apple is one of the last last US tech companies that's doing business  in China. So if it does something specific for the Chinese market, that makes absolute  perfect sense.

As long as the challenge or the requests are legitimate and formed by the duly elected  or the government in charge, Apple will always do that.  And it always has done.

Oh, yeah. I think the thing that's hard for me and I think the thing that we have to  recognize, though, is that Apple isn't really a tech company exactly anymore.  It's is it a it's a jewelry company.  It's a fashion company. It's a lifestyle company.  It's a marketing company.  And that's a perfectly fine thing for it to be.  It's a good business.

Transcript:  Well, we've seen a rash of articles this week about  people talking about how Apple's integrated supply line,  because it owns its chips and designs its own CPUs and gets them manufactured.  And because it has complete control of the iPhone assembly,  even though they outsource the assembly to Foxconn or in China,  they're still very heavily involved.  And people are saying this integrated, vertically integrated supply chain.  Last week, we saw them get into the Dishiba deal.  It's Tim Cook's greatest creation.  Yes. And now we're seeing them get into the  partnering with Bain Capital or rumored to be partnering with Bain Capital  to drop a few billion dollars into buying Dishiba  so they can get control of the DRAM supply.  And I wonder if I just wonder if Google saying, you know what?  Apple's doing this.  We have to start thinking about doing the same thing  before they get too far away from us.  If Apple gets too far away, gets this integrated supply and their leadership.  I mean, Apple's already three, four years ahead of Samsung.  If they continue to be able to do this, then where does that leave Android?

This is there is a great selling point for Apple phones on security  because Android in the Play Store, we've had, let's see, malware  outbreaks in January, March, April, July, two in September.  It's getting silly at the moment.  And Android users are disproportionately getting hit by viruses.  So they should use this as a selling point.  It's a huge opportunity.

Transcript:  So the transition here is that the integrated supply chain fires  in the face of everything we've done for the last 20 years in tech.  So if you go back to where Microsoft started, there a value was that  they disaggregated the operating system away from the computer  and the PC disaggregated the supply chain of the hardware  because it used an Intel CPU and somebody else's chips  and somebody else's bus, you know, the ice boss and the power supply  was all stock off the shelf.  The idea was is that we should be disaggregating everything into pieces  and we should be having each company bid to make the peace.  And now all of a sudden, Apple's integrating it back together.  So if you if you continue to follow Ben, he talks a lot about  the history of aggregation.  What he's saying now is you disaggregate.  And then what you do is you bang it back together in a different way.  You aggregate or you bond it back together in a different way,  making sure that you now control that some element of that,  that new aggregation. Now you own it.  And if if that theory of aggregation, excuse me, holds true,  then what you're seeing is that Apple's now stabilizing or morphing  into a solid lock on the thing that it's got.  But somebody's going to come along and disaggregate it in the future.  And this is what's happening in China.  Again, Ben Thompson from Strateger, he says in China.  The point is, is that the the aggregation happens in WeChat above it.  Like every Chinese citizen uses a software.  So the phone underneath, you know, whether it's iOS or Android or Windows  or whoever's operating system actually matters less to a large enough audience  as it does, say, in Western markets.  And so there's actually a different transition in the way  in the Chinese market to the Western markets.

So there is an incentive to stay with Android in that thing.  If you're using MacBook Pro and Mac OS all the way along the line,  there's a massive incentive to go and go with an iPhone.  I mean, my wife has just upgraded her phone  and I tried her out on a couple of Androids and she's just like,  yeah, but then when I've tried linking in and syncing up my iTunes  and getting everything else done, there's going to be an enormous amount of work  in changing ecosystems.

But the reason I bought them iPhones instead of some low cost, you know,  they they can barely use it to send an SMS message, much less surf the Internet  much less take photos or listen to music.  But the reason I bought them iPhones is just because I have to support  the blasted things and I just can't be bothered working out what Android to buy.  It was just too hard.  And, you know, all the Android phones that I wanted to buy for three hundred dollars  were all running Android 4, which was just so basically insecure that it wasn't,  you know, I was just not willing to to give it to them.

I think it was this morning  where the guy was talking about all the pundits who think they understand  why a company does what it does.  And when when pundits who are not running the company say things like,  well, I don't understand why Apple's doing this.  It's very likely they don't really understand what Apple's up to at all.  And I would say that Tim Cook probably knows a lot better what he's up to.  But it's fun to kind of try to penetrate the Kremlin wall  and and and understand a little bit better what their long term strategy is.  It's not it's becoming less and less a tech story, though.  And oh, yes. Yes. But I mean, but ironically, it's funny because  in the process of controlling.  All the components in an iPhone, they've actually put a processor  that's well ahead of anybody else's processor in here.  And I would submit unnecessarily it's it provides power to  well beyond anything that you need.  And yes, they make it themselves.  So maybe that's the benefit, not the power.  But maybe there's some gold down the road.  Maybe this phone is that's what we thought at first.  Well, that's all going to be for the A.R.

I'm not a huge Apple Watch fan.  I'm a modest user of one.  I had an Apple Watch zero and it was fine.  It wasn't bad, but I wanted something that just ran a little bit faster,  but particularly I wanted something a little bit lighter.  So the new Apple Watch 3 is quite nice.

Right on this one. I'm not sure.  That's why I want the smarter minds who are here to explain it to me.  Ian Thompson from the register.co.uk,  Greg Farrow from the Packet Pushers Network, an excellent technical podcast  network and of course, at Ethereal Mind on the Twitter.  Our show today brought to you by my my my host, actually the company that hosts  28% of all the websites in the world, WordPress.com.  Twenty. Well, is that that's not strictly fair.  Twenty eight percent of all the Internet sites in the world run on WordPress.  Some of them hosted themselves.  Some of them use WordPress hosting.  Actually, some of the biggest companies in the world run on WordPress.com  using their VIP plan, including Quartz.  Quartz, when it came out, everybody said, this is the most amazing website.  Look at the technology they're using. It was WordPress.  My blog, not anywhere close to Quartz, is using WordPress.  And your business should be using WordPress.  Every day, millions of people go online doing one thing,  trying to find out about local businesses, trying to find about your business.  Even if you're a plumber, if you're selling, you know, dishes,  if whatever your business is, it doesn't exist without a website.  And it's not enough to say, oh, we got a Facebook page or we've got a Twitter account.  That's not your page. You need to have your own website.  And I know why you don't. If you don't, it's because it's too much trouble.  It's I don't want to become a web guru. You can do it on WordPress.  It's easy. It'll make it easy for your customers to find you,  to connect with you, to hear how you can help them.  Your business must have an online home and you don't have to be a web expert to do it.  You just need WordPress.com website.  Choose from hundreds of beautiful designs.  It's got built in search engine optimization. It'll boost your visibility.  Social sharing is automatic.  So your visitors can help promote your business on their Twitter and Facebook.  You can activate other WordPress plugins for the functionality your business needs.  It's all the goodness of WordPress, but you don't have to worry about keeping it up to date.  You don't have to worry about keeping it secure. They do that for you.  And with a WordPress.com plan, you can get expert support.  You focus on your business. They'll make your website the best.  That's what you want.  WordPress.com is also a community, a community of people who can help build your traffic  because they've got a follow button on there.  I'm a huge fan. It couldn't be easier.  It's a great way to start. And because it's such a dominant platform,  if you do decide I want to hire somebody to help me with my site,  there are plenty of experts out there.  All the software out there supports the WordPress API.  It's just the king of the hill.  WordPress.com slash twit.  If you go there right now, you can get 15% off any new plan purchase.  That's WordPress.com slash twit 15% off.  And we thank WordPress so much, not only for supporting twit,  but for helping me keep my website going.  So.  Adjit Pai, chairman of the FCC, joined in on something actually I agree with.  Many phones have FM radios and in other parts of the world,  there's FM radios are on the phones.  The carriers in the United States make these companies disable the radios,  if they're in the phones, disable the radios,  because they don't want people listening to free broadcast music.  They want them to use expensive streaming services.  That's a business model for them.  And so the United States, most phones,  even if they have the hardware, don't turn on the radio.  I agree with Adjit Pai.  In fact, it's not just Adjit Pai,  the National Association of Broadcasters and others have said  there's been a whole movement to turn these radios on.  They're useful, particularly in cases of emergency.  Forget what the carriers want.  Forget their business model.  The hardware is there, turn them on.  Now,  Adjit Pai said Apple should do this,  put the safety of the American people first, step up to the plate.  Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that's resisted doing this.  I hope the company will reconsider its position,  activate those FM chips, to which Apple responded.  Apple cares a lot about our users, especially in crises.  We've got emergency services and medical  ID information on the lock screen.  We enable government emergency notifications.  But iPhone 7 and 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them.  Nor do they have antennas to support FM signals.

Start time: 2339.36
End time: 2348.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the key. It's the antenna, I think.  You might be able to job an FM radio.  Mind you, they've built them out of the design spec fairly early,  but you've got to have the antenna to make it work.

Start time: 2352.28
End time: 2378.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's an FM radio in there.  I'm not convinced  that there isn't the hardware to do it.  I understand the antenna because on all these other phones,  the antenna is the headphones and Apple, of course, has no headphone jack.  That's why notably they mentioned the iPhone 7 and 8 models.  But so you tell me, because you're in Britain,  don't all your phones have FM radios? No, no, no.

Start time: 2379.64
End time: 2532.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the way I think it works is that every FM radio is fundamentally a thing  called a DSP or digital signal software radio.  Yeah. And so what is in every iPhone is a chip.  We usually call it the baseband modem.  But a baseband modem is basically a gaggle of DSPs that receive the signal.  So that signal is normally 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, LTE plus, blah, blah, blah.  And every iteration of the iPhone includes a new version of the baseband modem chip.  And one of the things that I believe now, I'm not an expert here,  but I believe that you can often program the baseband modem to be an FM radio  because there's no difference between an FM radio signaling coded onto that chip.  You can use basically just a piece of software to decode it.  And then you can then use the DSP functionality.  So it's possible that the baseband chips that are in the iPhones have DSPs  that are capable of being used for FM radios.  It does not mean that they are necessarily enabled in the chips that Apple has purchased.  So that is they may be crippled at factory.  If indeed, I suspect that the volume that  Apple's making those chips, they've been designed out in a custom design  in the same way that the A11 Bionic chip,  an A10 and all that sort of stuff is really, really customized.  You don't want a CPU.  You don't want a DSP in your baseband modem burning electricity.  What you probably want to do is to shut it off.  So usually the way you do it is when you design the chip,  you burn the links in there so that that part of the chip just gets isolated and it  doesn't draw current.  And so it's not creating heat that you have to get rid of and it's not drawing  current so that your battery runs down.  So that's part one.  For a lot of phones, it is true, there are DSPs that can be repurposed.  There is no guarantee that those DSPs are actually enabled or even in the silicon  that Apple buys. Point one. Point two, you must have an antenna to feed the signal  into the DSP. Every antenna must be custom designed to receive the frequencies on  which you are receiving.  So that is why in your iPhone, around the top here is your 2.4 gigahertz.  The side down here is your 5 gigahertz.  And over here is your 2G3G LTE.  Every Apple iPhone for the last five years has the steel band around the outside as  the antennas. And you see these little divots around the side, the plastic bits,  which actually separates the antennas.  There is no antenna in here that will receive an FM signal.  It has to be a very precise...  Like has someone who did antenna design at university.  The physics that goes into this is just mind bogglingly arcane.

End time: 2561.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, your headphone jack has to take that signal out.  Apple uses the TRRS or the four way jack to be the headphone controller.  So you can't use it for...  You know, you need to have something that's going to pull the FM signal out of that  and then decode it. And that means, again, there must be chips  inside the phone decoding that off the headphone jack.

Transcript:  I know that Apple says seven and eight.  It doesn't mention other iPhones that it sells.  I don't know.  I'm not convinced that Apple's being...  I think Apple may be a little disingenuous.  No. And the third thing is licensing.

Start time: 2576.36
End time: 2609.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're using an FM radio inside the BMC, you'll probably have to pay a license  fee for it. And because the company whose intellectual property produces those  chips. And then the fourth and final thing is, of course, is there must be  software in the operating system to drive the FM radios.  And if it's not in the operating system, if it's...  You can't just suddenly turn it on because you would have to write that  software and then deliver it as an over the air update.  So there are four very sound reasons as to why there would be no FM radio in any  iPhone for the last five to 10 years that if ever, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, also, I think Pi is kind of being slightly disingenuous about this  because his whole argument is in the event of an emergency, an FM radio is a really  useful thing. Well, yes, if you've got a dedicated...  I mean, we've got an Arosco, Quick, a Kitter, Handcrank FM radio.  But if you're relying on your phone, whose battery life is probably not going to last  more than about a day or so and you've got no power to recharge it with,  at the end of the day, it's just a very expensive doorstop after a day or so.  And it doesn't help save people's lives.  So rather than trying to mandate that, you know, handset manufacturers have to  include this functionality, give people a tax credit for buying emergency radios.  Easiest way to solve this.

Transcript:  If you're a government and you've got a citizenry who doesn't like to pay taxes  and you've got an existing system that's built around FM radios to deliver  emergency information, what are you going to do?  Are you going to go out and start building a new emergency system to notify people  that something's gone wrong?  And then you become dependent on your carriers like the government gets screwed  over by Verizon and AT&T even more than it currently is.  So what you want to do is start saying, well, I need to use the existing stuff  that's already bought and paid for.  FM radio ultimately actually requires...  It's very good for emergency.  AM radio is actually much better.  They'd be much better off saying, let's put AM radios in because those  transmitters go for hundreds and hundreds of miles.  Yeah, you're not going to put an AM radio on the phone.

Transcript:  I mean, the thing about FM AM is also moot because the government has already  recovered most of those frequencies and then sold them off to the carriers to use  for LTE. So the 700 megahertz range that AM was using, which is around television  and stuff, has already been recovered.  And now they're flogging it off for billions to the telephone companies.  So it's a bit disinvigorating.  It's suddenly quite two faced, really.  I mean, there's a few things here.  First of all, AgitPy is obviously an ignorant nut job because this is fundamental  technology.  I was... Did you see that?  I was really polite.  Yeah.  And it's obviously kicking the Apple here in particular, any of the phone companies,  any of the handset makers, is an instant win because anything he says, they can't  exactly get on his case and make his life miserable.  So he's really, you know, taking a shot at somebody who can't shoot back.  And the fact that Apple's responded, I think, is actually quite interesting.  And normally they would have just ignored him and gone, you're an ass.  Why am I even listening to what you're saying?  And but what they've actually done is responded and just pointed out, you know,  and like I said, for technical reasons that I believe any one of those four is a  killer, but there's four quite reasons why there'll be no FM radio in any phone  unless the government sits down and mandates them and makes it a condition.  And that's not going to happen in the US with the current political climate.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. So now it actually shows you a much more detailed breakdown.  The reason that the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth  stays active is because you might be using the Bluetooth as a hotspot or you  might be using it for an Apple. Why have that button?  So if you turn off Bluetooth, you're  turning it off for connectivity or maybe for your.  But you might want to keep it running.  So if you're using Bluetooth to run your Hughes, for example, your home automation  system, you might want to keep that local network connectivity running.  So what they're really they're saying you're just too stupid to know why that

Transcript:  Or maybe I did want to say I turn off blue.  I almost never have Bluetooth off on my phone and I only have Wi-Fi on where I'm  in a trusted network situation because you know about bad guys.  You go to the if you leave Bluetooth.  I mean, I was at Darbycon last weekend in Kentucky.  I can't leave your Bluetooth.  I don't get things these guys can do with Bluetooth.  It's just really kind of you should have  that stuff off and locked down as a matter of course and only turn it on when you  need it because yeah, any kind of wireless same with Wi-Fi up to a point.  But Bluetooth, because of the complex nature of the Bluetooth stack and the  amount of code that different manufacturers and different people in the  SIG managed to cram in there, it's an incredibly unwieldy standard  riddled with security holes.  So unless you absolutely have to have it on, shut it down.  And also save the battery life.  Yeah.  Wow, that did not sound good.

Transcript:  Well, I have I have the whole suite, the  panoply of Apple stuff, just literally because the idea of futzing  with the technology just drives me not like the same.  I'm a futzer.  I don't mind futzing.  But when I've got stuff to do,  let's just say that the idea of trying to make my Android talk to my Windows  machine is just like a life shortening experience.  I just don't want to go through it anymore.  So the idea here is that it's going that the phone is going to do what most people  would think it would do. I'm disconnecting from my Wi-Fi,  but I might actually still want to talk to my watch.  I'm not expecting my watch to suddenly stop working.  So that's what they're trying to emulate.  Unfortunately, they didn't communicate it very well.  They should have done better icon design  and usability to get that transition from the old to the new.  But then again, what do you expect from Apple over the years?  Apple's done all those things consistently made decisions and you've just had to suck it up.  So why whining about something that Apple's done consistently for 10 years?

Transcript:  Apple knows best.  What's the story with the watch now?  The connectivity issue is kind of interesting on this new Series 3 watches with LTE.  It turns out that you  I understand why this happened.  I understand how this bug crept in.  What I don't understand is why no one  noticed it until they actually sold the product.  But the problem is if you have  a Wi-Fi, if you have a Wi-Fi access point  that uses a captive portal and you've already logged into it on your phone  and then you re-enter that place, let's say a Starbucks, minus your phone,  the phone has the password, your watch says, oh, I know this one.  I can join it and immediately lose all connectivity, including LTE,  because it turns off the LTE radio to save battery.  The Wi-Fi is not actually connected to anything.  So you walk into a Starbucks.  It sounds like a joke.  An Apple watch walked into a Starbucks and lost all connectivity.  Yeah, this is an easy thing to fix, obviously.

Start time: 3162.24

Transcript:  Why?  Have you guys ever built a Wi-Fi network with a portal?

Start time: 3170.36
End time: 3173.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this captive portal is a broken system anyway.  It's a terrible idea.

Start time: 3174.72
End time: 3248.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's a massive transition going on in Wi-Fi.  Up until now, we've always used HTTP portals.  That is, if you go to a web page, it's usually been HTTP,  which is clear text, which has been very easy to intercept.  You just capture it.  You divert it off to somewhere else.  And then you hit a you type in your username and password or you hit the OK button.  And away you go.  And that means that if you're in the Apple watch and you want to test,  what you used to do is send out a web request.  And then if the connectivity didn't work after that, you knew that there was a  portal there. What we're seeing is a transition to TLS 1.3, the new HTTPS.  The security standards no longer HTTPS.  It's correctly called TLS 1.3.  And if the portals are shifting, if you're trying to attach to an encrypted website  for connectivity, then there's no way for the portals to appear.  There's actually no way for a portal to be captured.  There is a bunch of work going on in the ITF to try and get captive portals coming up.  But it's not reliable to predict whether there's a captive portal in the Wi-Fi  that you've just connected to.  So you can't actually know easily or reliably whether you're connect.  All you can do is connect to the Wi-Fi.  But are you connected to the Internet?  How do you test that?  At the moment, there's not a reliable test for that.

Start time: 3249.02
End time: 3262.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting.  So my description of the bug is accurate, that that's what's going on.  Your phone knew about this access and had the connectivity associated with it.  But the watch with it minus the phone couldn't do anything with it.

Start time: 3262.80
End time: 3286.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So if you go down to your favorite fast food junk store and you log in with  your appropriate details and so forth, then your phone has a cookie in here  that's cached to say that you've signed up to a fast food portal.  And next time you turn up there, your Wi-Fi connects and away you go.  But your Apple Watch doesn't have the cookie.  Right.  So the details for the wireless for the watch come from the phone.

Start time: 3286.90
End time: 3311.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I'm thinking you could.  Isn't there something?  So the watch knows if there's a phone present or not.  So a watch walks into a bar,  sees Wi-Fi, tries to connect,  it knows, though, that at this point it doesn't have a phone next to it.  So it's a potential problem.  It can't test whether there's Internet access or not.  Shouldn't it just should it just not join that Wi-Fi?

Start time: 3312.94
End time: 3318.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pretty much.  Well, it's a legitimate Wi-Fi that your phone knows.  It got a list of Wi-Fi that you have connected to.

Start time: 3318.88
End time: 3323.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The phone knows though it was a captive portal as opposed to a standard WPA or password.

Start time: 3324.90
End time: 3329.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should be able to sync that data across so that the phone knows what reliable networks are.

Start time: 3329.66
End time: 3342.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, folks, if you're puzzled, as I am,  what we're trying to do is figure out how hard it would be to fix this problem.  We know the problem exists.  How hard Apple says it's working on a fix.  It sounds like, Greg, you're saying this is actually pretty hard to fix.

Start time: 3343.90
End time: 3392.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there are different ways for portals to work.  If you signed on to the portal,  then it might have stored the MAC address of your phone and said this MAC address is  allowed to go through, right?  It might have stored a cookie in your web browser.  It might have cached some other.  This is quite complex, so I'm going to keep it fairly similar.  There are many different ways of storing some sort of credentials to say, yes,  you've been to the junk shop, junk food restaurant, shall we call it?  And you've signed up to the Wi-Fi and passed it all.  And they're going to cache that for a month or so before they force you to really log in.  Well, your iWatch, your Apple Watch connects to the Wi-Fi preferred because it  doesn't want to use bandwidth over the LTE.  And it connects to the portal quite blindly thinking this is a perfectly  legitimate Wi-Fi network, but it doesn't have any of the validation that you would  see. So it's unusable.

Start time: 3393.38
End time: 3407.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turns in the process.  It's turned off LTE and now it has no connectivity at all.  It prefers. Does that mean your Series 3 watch,  every time you walk into somewhere with open with a captive portal Wi-Fi setup,  is going to fail and it's nothing we could do about it?

Start time: 3409.60
End time: 3416.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, actually does that work for you?  It's such a broken captive portal system is such a system.  Yeah, but it's what we live with and it's everywhere.  That's why it's a matter of concern because you leave your phone behind,  which is the promise of the Series 3 LTE watch.  You should be able to do stuff with it.  All of a sudden, it's booked.  You walk somewhere and it's not working anymore.

Start time: 3445.00
End time: 3485.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there is a working group in the ITF working on captive portals.  I did a podcast with them, I think, about it's published somewhere in the Packet Pushes.  We publish four shows a week, so there's an awful lot of them.  It's still very early days. They're working on it.  There are some answers, but they're very arcane.  And because of the way that TLS 1.3 is  built so that nobody can man in the middle of it, it's very difficult to do a captive portal.  Yeah. So you would understand the theory behind TLS 1.3.  So all of a sudden to say I've got to capture that and divert it to a captive  portal requires some really deep cryptographic changes.  And that's going to take several months, maybe years of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, on our vacation, we were using the Wi-Fi on this riverboat.  And in order to use it, it was some kind of captive portal system.  And in order to use it, you would attach to the Wi-Fi and then a page would come up  with a QR code and then you had to go to the front desk and they would scan the QR  code and it was per device, by the way.  This sounds like something the French would do.  And at that point, they said a cookie or they did a MAC address or something.  And yeah, I think it was a Swiss company.  Oh, OK.  The nice.  And then and then you would be you're OK.  And you can use that and you use that Wi-Fi.  That seemed like a good system.

Start time: 3529.12
End time: 3535.80

Start time: 3538.30
End time: 3549.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you know how there's like a hexadecimal  character, 16 hexadecimal characters.  Yeah.  Yeah. And then the front desk can just scan that.  And then the MAC address goes into a database  and says this MAC address is permitted for 24 hours.

Start time: 3549.88
End time: 3554.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I was missing the wine. I need another bottle.  Casper makes these great mattresses designed and made in the United States by a  team of 20 engineers and perfected by a community of well, now it's half a million,  nearly half a million sleepers. I love this.  I'm one of them.  Obsessive engineering makes a great mattress, not just the Casper, but the new  Casper Wave, which features a natural geometry support system and a new top layer.  I've got the Casper Wave in my house.  The box. I was so tired.  I just went to bed.  You just slept on the box.  I slept on the box.  But I will open it.  I will probably open it tonight and let you know how it is.  Casper mattresses delivered to your door.  It's a surprisingly compact box.  We got a we have a King mattress in a box.  Well, actually, we had that video.  You've seen it where we open up the box.  It just opens up.  It smells great.  There's no you don't have to air it out.  And by the way, I've had mattresses where  you couldn't really sleep on them for a couple of weeks.  You had to let them breathe.  Yeah, not the Casper.  I don't know what they do.  They do something magical.  But that's that's the Casper team.  They're a bunch of engineering nerds digging into the science of sleep  and technology to give you an amazing mattress that delivers pressure relieving,  supportive memory foam with a breathable open cell layer for all night comfort.  That's one of the things I missed.  I just love it. How cool sleeping the Casper is.  Casper was named Fast Company's most innovative brand of 2017.  Free shipping to the US, Canada and now the UK.  I also should point out that there's free returns, too.  And this is really important.  I know a lot of people are reluctant to buy a mattress without lying on it first.  But Casper is gets his prices so low because it doesn't have that,  you know, network of middle people who double, triple, quadruple the cost of the  mattress. That's how they keep the cost low.  So they don't have those showrooms.  Actually, I think they have one in New York.  They have a couple of them.  But most people don't get to lie on it.  But don't worry. You've got a hundred day trial period.  That means you can sleep on that mattress for more than three months.  And even then you could say, yeah, maybe not.  And they'll come. They'll get it.  They will they will pay you back every penny.  You will absolutely no cost to you.  Free shipping, free returns.  So there is no risk here.  I guarantee you, though, you're going to love this mattress.  Considering you spend a third of your life lying on it,  it's important that you have one you love.  That's why Casper gives you a hundred nights to try their mattress out.  And look at the reviews.  I mean, seriously, and I get email all the time for people to say thank you.  I love this mattress.  And man, is it affordable.  Want to know more? Dive deeper into the science behind the perfect mattress and  get $50 towards any mattress purchase at Casper.com slash tweet.

OK, what are we going to get here with this new Pixel?  I am actually excited.  There are a number of phones I'm very interested in.  Of course, the iPhone 8, the Essential Phone was very exciting till I got it.  Well, it's not bad, except the camera is just broken.  I literally I launched the camera app and I thought, oh, they must have fixed it by  now. They took long enough to get it out to me.  They shipped it and it immediately rebooted the phone.  The next time it just froze it.  So they're getting better.  Yeah, although I find it's on my desk, John, which the essential is not in this box.  He brought me the box and I opened it up and there's it's gone.  I think it's on my desk.

They put the they have a fingerprint sensor and they put it in a sensible spot  right in the back and the middle, like the Pixel.  Same as the Pixel, yeah.  It has a headphone jack, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4332.08
End time: 4343.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's my point.  If you can put a jack in a Note 8, which is jammed with technology,  and there's enough real estate to put a jack in there, why can't Apple?  I know, I know.

Transcript:  Two reasons.  OK.  Waterproof. You can't hit IP68.  This is IP68.  Yeah, sure.  Well...  Flush it down the...  Drop it in a bucket of water.  Let's see how it's going to go.  I mean, it already doesn't work.  You might as well drop it in a bucket of water.  It works. It reboots every night on purpose.  That's faulty as far as I'm concerned.  Right.  And the second thing is that actually the structural integrity,  because of the way these things work.  Have you ever looked at the inside of the structural integrity?  So the steel band that goes around the outside is actually the load bearer.  There's a bunch of other load bearing things inside of here.  But the actual jack where it goes through that thing actually becomes a weak point.  And the phones often fracture around that.  And getting rid of it actually simplifies the construction of the phone.

Start time: 4391.68
End time: 4396.58

Start time: 4399.46
End time: 4409.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's your of the opinion.  Do you think all connectors...  I mean, that's got to be the same problem for a Type-C charger or a Lightning charger.  You think all connectors are going to be gone.  Is that that?

Start time: 4409.32
End time: 4455.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why the Lightning charger is thin.  So that your structural integrity can be maintained.  So there's enough material around the outside of that,  around the outside of it, so that the strength can be maintained.  And the Lightning connector was designed in such a way that you can actually  waterproof what goes inside.  Now, that's not to say that you can't do it at some level, but the physical depth,  like you're asking for a three and a half millimeter jack with a TRRS.  You're actually asking for this much space inside of the phone, right?  And just it.  And when you break the outside of this thing,  like just getting the speakers in is OK because all you're doing is emptying out  the drilling small holes in the stainless steel outer rim.  But it does make a big difference to the  structure, the manufacturing and the structural integrity of the device.  Wow. That's the first compelling argument.

Start time: 4455.70
End time: 4461.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Apple has not said that because that's the first compelling argument I've heard.  They said we needed the space.  That's what they said.

Transcript:  So I think what's happening here is that Amazon's, you know, a throwing spaghetti  at the wall and seeing what sticks.  What you also need to know is that Amazon has a service called Chime,  which is a slack type functionality.  And they also have another one, which is a unified communications,  which is an IP telephony service.  So first of all, you get these boxes into people's homes.  You give them video cameras and speakers.  Then you play music on them.  Then you get them used to having video cameras wherever they are.  You get them to start using these for telephone calls to communicate over echo.  And then Amazon can come back to a smartphone and maybe round that out.  So there's a few different agendas going on here.  One, if you can get them connected to the landline, you can get them to start using  an Amazon service, IP telephony service instead of using the landline.

Start time: 4867.32

Start time: 4876.16
End time: 4907.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But only in the US where the telco rules are set up.  And because in the US, the way that it works is the caller and the receiver both  pays for the call. So that means that in the US it's possible for Amazon to make  money by calling people. What?  Yeah. So they actually can get it.  So it's a profit deal. Yeah.  Yeah. If they make a call, then they get money out of that.  So that's how all of the free conferencing services in the US work, because everybody  calls in to the conferencing service and they make money out of it by charging you  to call into their service just from the telephone call.

But by the time you get from the airport door to the plane, you will have met two  or three people who are trained to look for body language signals that you are under stress  or that there is something going on there.  And it works.  There's a reason why Israeli flights don't get hijacked because they take it seriously.  And they don't look for a tech fix.

And then there was a 15-minute anime release this week, padding out more of the storyline about what happened in the gap between the two movies.

There were reports of somebody coming into a VC's office, throwing down a copy of Snow  Crash and saying, that's our business plan, which is probably a good idea not to fund  them, but still.

Yeah.  It's much harder to create this for real than what you see in your mind.  Let's take a break.  Come back.  There's lots more to talk about, including, is it all over for Silicon Valley?

Start time: 5598.80
End time: 5625.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, back in the day, Ethereum, the idea was that there was a spiritual aspect to being  ethereal and the mind.  So it was meant to be spiritual mind.  And then it was a double play on words because there used to be a thing called ethereal,  which was a packet sniffer.  So I'm a networking computer network engineer.  I get it.  And so it was sort of meant to be a play between spiritual mind and packet, my brain.  And somewhere along the line, I've long since forgotten which one of those it is.

He is the security researcher who stopped the WannaCry in its tracks.  Somewhat suspiciously, he happened to know while I was reading the code,  I figured it out how to stop it.  Well, basically he found the.

Start time: 5682.60
End time: 5696.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, what he found was that they were using a particular domain  to host their command and control service, but they hadn't registered it.  So he just spent 10 quid, took that domain over, and it stopped it dead in his tracks.

Start time: 5696.92
End time: 5715.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a kill switch built into WannaCry, apparently,  which I think is a little suspicious that he says.  It's kind of.  I think he might have been suspicious that he knew it.  In any event, he was arrested.  He was out here for... Was he out here for DEF CON?  He came out for DEF CON Black Hat.  He was going to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of it is redacted.  So we don't know the details.  They say they have evidence and that he was behind the manufacture and sale of the Kronos  banking malware and then said that the one they arrested him,  he was held for 24 hours without access to any outside legal counsel.  And they've also said that during that time, he admitted it to them.  Well, that would be illegal.  He, of course, is denying this completely.  And he's... It's a really weird case because when he was put out on bail,  usually with stuff like this, if you're out on bail for computer crimes,  one of the key things they say is you cannot touch a computer.  And the only restrictions... I mean, he can use a computer.  He just can't access the servers that he was using for malware research.  He's got to wear a GPS cuff on his leg.  But other than that, he's fine to get on computers.  He's fine to, you know...

Transcript:  Did you read Brian Krebs' article in which he kind of implies that  Marcus Hutchins had a change of heart, that he was, in fact, a teenage hacker,  a malware creator.  And then as he aged, as many of us do, he thought better of it.  He had a change of heart.  And it's these earlier crimes when he was 15 years old.

Start time: 5798.78
End time: 5869.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I read Krebs' article and he kind of puts two and two together and makes 222.  You know, there's an awful lot of inference there, but no direct proof.  And let's face it, it wouldn't be the first time that that had happened.  You know, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak...  Yeah, they sold blue boxes.  Yeah, they sold blue boxes.  Gates dumpster dived.  There's a whole bunch.  And speaking from security researchers' perspective,  a lot of researchers got interested as teenagers by saying,  oh, this malware is really interesting.  I wonder how it works.  And then applying that to security research.  I mean, if you talk to any bunch of security researchers off the record  and after a few drinks, which always really helps, you know, they will say,  look, some of the coding I did, just noodling around, didn't release it or anything,  but that could technically be considered to be making malware.  And I think the only evidence I've seen is really of that level of involvement.  And if he had been this sort of former hardcore hacker, he wouldn't really...  15 years old, that doesn't...  But, you know, I think the government would have had a lot more evidence  that he could have thrown at him if it was that clear, that one cut and dried.  Well, we'll follow it with interest.

It makes all of your US mail more professional looking,  makes it easier for you.  You don't have to spend any time at the post office.  You could do everything.  You would do all the services of the US Postal Service  right at your desk with Stamps.com.  That means, yes, of course, buy and print official US postage.  But for any letter, any package, any class of mail,  your computer and printer, you don't need to buy a postage meter  or any special ink or anything like that.  And what's cool about this, you can print right on the envelope.  You can actually feed envelopes through your printer.  It will automatically put your return address in.  It'll put the recipient's address, it'll pull it out of your address book  and it works with a variety of different platforms.  And then it prints the postage right on the envelope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, now this is really, really important.  And I just want to highlight some of the secrets behind this that a lot of people  haven't thought about.  One of the reasons for net neutrality and the fact that the government wants to tear  it down is because the carriers want to be able to not install bandwidth.  What they say is we need to be able to shape the traffic on the Internet to  protect users because we can't create enough bandwidth.  And that's why.  Lies.  So now what we have is outright lie.  Absolutely outright lie.  So what we have now seen is that Facebook and Microsoft, AKA not AT&T or  Verizon or Tata or Level 3 or any of the telcos in the world, ran a submarine  cable across the Atlantic.  It is actually a leading example of high speed, just so much bandwidth across the  ocean here.  And they did it in less than two years and it was financed just out of the cost.  So this is literally going to be a private network just for Facebook and Microsoft.  Now, this is my argument is this whole argument about removing net neutrality so  that carriers can sustain the network for growth is literally just a way for them to  avoid investing in their networks.  And of course, if they don't have to spend money upgrading their network backbones, if  they don't have to spend money replacing routers or dense wave division multiplexers and  installing new fiber or overhauling the electronics gear at the end, then they make mega  profits and stitch up their customers for nothing.

Transcript:  Exactly right. So this isn't the if you want to look at the source, the source is on  Microsoft's blog. I'll post the link into the chat room.  But this one here talks about the fact that it uses an open design.  It's not using closed technology.  So not only has Microsoft and Facebook partnered to build a cable, they've actually taken  technology, kicked out the normal bunch of losers that exist that make this technology  again, proprietary and closed.  They're building open technology that can be.  And they're actually expecting to get this running literally within another year.  So two years to roll the cable across and then another year before it's lit up.  And it's just a huge amount of bandwidth, just so much faster than we can possibly have  imagined. You don't need net neutrality.  What we need is to kick the carriers into investing in the networks and rolling out  upgraded backbones and new access technologies to give us the bandwidth that we want.

And instead, they took it and gave it back to shareholders or spent on useless make work  projects. I think this is a great thing, too, although I was so interested that they're  not actually connecting this to the UK.  They're connecting it to Spain.  And I wondered whether GCHQ's fondness for tapping overseas cables might have led them  to think, you know what, maybe we'll just not put it into Cornwall like we usually do.  We'll take it down to Spain and see if that's any better.  Interesting.

Start time: 6270.92
End time: 6350.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, a lot of cables actually land down in Spain.  So it's a choice. You either want to run the cables up around it.  What you actually want to do is get them onto mainland Europe, because that's where the  bandwidth can be sold off and is actually where you want it to be.  Landing cables onto Lands End in the UK just means you then have to trunk the bandwidth  across the UK and then usually up to Amsterdam, because Amsterdam is the main Internet  exchange or the main exchange point.  So bringing it down south into Bilbao is not a bad idea because it gets you onto the  mainland and you can trunk it up.  That's the way the fiber networks.  If you go to a website called Telegeography, they have a graphic which will show you the  fiber runs under the ocean.  And you'll see quite clearly that a lot of cables would either go north around the UK to  Amsterdam to get right into the backbone.  And that's the super low latency ones that you want for fin trading.  And then you want the other ones.  Some of them come onto the UK, but therefore the UK market.  But the UK is not usually a place.  If you want to get up to Ireland to where Amazon and Apple and all those guys are, landing  it on the UK soil is quite popular.  And then the rest all land down in France or down in Spain, because that's the fastest way  to get onto the land and the lands where the bandwidth is.  And don't forget that Spain then takes you on into the rest of the world.  So Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, into the North African companies and then also the rest of  southern Europe.

The one about the anchor was that it broke the only cable that was running into Egypt at the  time. And it was when the revolution was on and it was originally seen as a terrorist act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So because it's so small, think about this, because it's so small, it doesn't have a lot  of weight. So there's lots of interesting things about small cables.  So as they go down, they don't have a lot of resistance.  And once they hit the bottom, they don't actually sink as hard into the into the ocean  floor, which causes lots of problems, because normally you actually want them to sink into  the floor. Anyway, there's a really good article on the telegeography website.  I posted a link into the chat room.  I love this map.  This is fabulous.

Transcript:  Increasingly, they're owned by a bunch of investment banks who've been digging and  trenching in dark fiber all around the United States.  So speculatively investing.  And what we have now is there are various.  This starts to get really arcane, so I won't go on for very much longer.  But there was a real investment trend about five years ago.  There was a bunch of tax breaks to be issued around ditching fiber into the ground.  And then and now there are companies going around buying up those fibers and  conglomerating them together and to sell them off into packages.  So in the same way that we've seen RF bandwidth or spectrum created by the government  and then sold off, we're now seeing dark fiber do the same.  So there's plenty of cable in the ground for the backhaul.  It's just not being done by AT&T and Verizon.  It's being done by other companies.

Start time: 6631.44
End time: 6654.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this was the primary reason why Google tried to get into fiber and tried to get  that to work was that they were sick of, you know, entire areas of the US having  very, very poor internet access and figured, right, we're going to see if we can do it.  And they ran into so many problems that now appears they were pretty much abandoned  large scale plans for that.  But I think the technology companies are basically getting sick of being given the  run around by the telcos.

Start time: 6656.94
End time: 6718.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's happening is, again, it comes back to what we said about open  technology. So the technologies that they're using to propagate the signals down  these cables are not owned by specific vendors.  So there's traditional companies that make these technologies.  What Microsoft and Facebook are doing is they've designed their own technology using  off the shelf components to drive this fiber.  And that's what they mean by open.  Somebody in the chat room is asking that question.  The the there are a few flip sides here.  One is Google and Facebook and Amazon are now actually substantially larger than most  of the telcos. The reason that Google's giving up on Google fiber isn't because they  found it technologically unfeasible or even legally or even legally  unfeasible. The short answer is, is that 5G will probably replace the need for cable  in the ground in the short term.  So 5G is going to give us gigabit to the house, most likely, and even at sub rate.  So if you're talking 50 to 100 megs, it's going to be much easier to put up a tower  than it is going to be to try and ditch put cable in the ground.  You see, I'm slightly skeptical about that, because that was the story we were told with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  4G originally, you know, and it was going to be super fast and the rest of it and 5G.  They're still, I mean, 4G, they bugger around with the standards so much that  Ymax was 4G and LTE was 4G and Enhanced 3G could possibly be sold as 4G.  5G was saying, you know, I like to say I'm skeptical, but that's purely based on past  experience. Maybe you're right.  So the way that they're so the difference between 3G, 4G and 5G is substantially to

Start time: 6747.88
End time: 6757.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do with the spectrum allocations.  At 5G, they're starting to talk about using 5 gigahertz and also there's a bunch of  spectrum around 40 gigahertz to 50 gigahertz will fundamentally junk spectrum.

Start time: 6760.72
End time: 6767.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't spectrum, though, a limited resource?  I mean, doesn't that get in the way?  You can't you don't have an infinite spectrum.

Start time: 6769.08
End time: 6896.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't. But what we're seeing now is, so, for example, with in Wi-Fi today in the  802.11ac standard, they're now talking about some of the numbers.  I'm getting a bit late over here, so some of my numbers are getting a bit stuck.  But we're talking now about companies being able to use 40 kilohertz channels.  There are 60 40 60 channels of 40 kilohertz in the 5 gig standard.  And some companies can do three MIMO channels over those.  So you can actually start to do multiple streams over multiple radio frequencies  simultaneously. Now, those are standards that are emerging and devices that support  those. And there are challenges around running three antennas to propagate signals at  speed, blah, blah, blah.  But we are seeing some iteration.  Now, if you think about doing that in a broadband context from a base station.  So today, 3G, 4G uses older encoding mechanisms and they are not often able to do what  they call spatial, multi spatial streams.  So use multiple pieces of bandwidth in various directions for.  So hard to explain. But anyway, the answer is that the way they're working forward with  5G is they're not building the standards to be fixed and locked.  So it's not meant to be 5G is this.  And that's it for time memoriam.  There's a group of standards that form it and there's meant to be an evolutionary thing.  So in the same way that HTTP 2.0 has now just been called HTTP, it will continue to evolve in part  for the rest of time.  But there won't be a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, because otherwise it forces this punctuated equilibrium  sequence where things we work with this protocol until it doesn't do what we want.  So then we leap forward to the next level.  What we're looking at is 5G is meant to be a group of standards to do things like mesh back  hole, mesh forward hall, use a range of different spectrums, a range of different mediums.  Some of them are designed for handsets.  Some of them are designed for Wi-Fi.  Some of them are public spectrum.  Some of them are private spectrum.  It's a far more and this is why the 5G standards haven't crystallized in some ways is because  there's so many wifty, wafty, like because we're not locking in on a specific area, it's  sort of very amorphous and it's, you know, it's those experts.

And I mean, you're talking about multiple gigabytes of data, probably hundreds of  gigabytes of data being stolen over a period of time.  They didn't detect when they were in.  They didn't take the exfiltration and then they completely fumbled the media  response afterwards.

Transcript:  The problem with the credit checking companies is that we're not actually  customers of theirs.  They just grab our data.  We're just their victims.  We are their bitches, basically.  They grab our stuff, they sell it off to everyone else.  And we don't really have a comeback on that.  So the only way I can see to solve this is if you're going to be a credit  reference agency, you're going to be holding the keys to the kingdom when it  comes to financial fraud, then you better have mandate audited, checked and  constantly checked security.  Now, you're never going to stop an intrusion.  You know, very, not even the NSA could stop their own systems being subverted.  But you've got to have a framework.  You can't just say, well, it's laissez faire.  These things will sort themselves out.  No, they won't. No, absolutely not.

Transcript:  Patience, young Greg.  Patience.  If he had a bit, he'd literally be champing at it.  Fortunately, he has no bit.  That's pretty obvious.  Our show today, Greg Farrow, Packetbushers.net, Ian Thompson,  registered.co.uk.  We intentionally booked no one else on this show.  Now you know why.  Normally we'd have a panel of four.  We decided with Greg and Ian and me jet lagged.  That's just exactly right.  Perfect, perfect harmony.  Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books, the ridiculously easy  to use cloud accounting software.  It starts really, it's not accounting software.  I hate to even use that phrase because it starts with invoices.  If you are a freelancer, if you have a small business,  the very first thing you have to do is collect your payments,  collect your, you know, your your money by invoicing.  And frankly, it was always the thing for me that was the hardest.  I just I dreaded the end of the month getting all the spreadsheets out  and all of this. And thank goodness in 2004, I found Fresh Books  was at the time just a little Toronto startup.  And they saved my life and made it easy for me to send out invoices.  And, whoa, lo and behold, if you build people, eventually they pay you.  In fact, on average, you get paid 11 days faster with Fresh Books.  But this has become a great accounting system, kind of automatically now  because, OK, you send out the invoices, you collect the money.  Do you know which invoices have been paid, which haven't?  What are your receivables?  What are you?  You know what your expenses are because it also handles expenses,  whether you build the client or not.  Pretty soon you realize that the information they have,  they're giving you on their dashboard a beautiful, crystal clear look  at how you're doing something small businesses and individuals rarely know.  Are you making a profit right now?  Usually we have to wait till tax time to figure that one out.  You'll know at every moment how you stand, how you're doing.  And there's so many nice features.  They're always adding features.  It's a web app.  So you can always, you know, I mean, there's more every week.  Sticky headers allow you to scroll through any page  while the headers shrink and remain at the top.  It's really slick.  So, you know, exactly it's easy to view which pages or columns.  You can see which invoices have been sent, which have been paid.  You can even see which invoices have been viewed.  So no more run around.  I didn't get your invoice. Yes, you did. You read it.  I can see that right here.  You can reward prompt clients  and encourage customer loyalty by adding discounts automatically  in your recurring templates.  Bill for time by client, by project,  assign services to projects and designate different rates for each service.  Press play to track your time to the minute in the app or on the website.  And all your time entries are sorted chronologically on the invoice for you.  Automatically. It's beautiful.  Your customers, your clients, look at this.  They go, oh, this guy's got it down.  This gal knows how to run a business.  They pay you fast because, well, you're professional with them.  They're going to be professional with you.  The full see receipt attachments when you view invoices in the iOS app.  Employees can log into the FreshBooks mobile app for iOS  so that they can take care of business wherever they are.  Offloading you a little bit, the full description of every line items  now visible while visiting viewing an invoice on mobile.  It's just getting better and better.  FreshBooks was included in the Forbes small giants list this year, 2017.  Rightly so. This is a great company making a great product  that's getting better all the time.  No wonder 10 million people now use FreshBooks.  You could be one of them.  Try it free for 30 days. FreshBooks.com slash twit.  FreshBooks saved my life. Let it save yours.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for making twit possible.  So what is going on?  What I actually first became acquainted with this  when our friend Mike Elgin wrote an article for a fast company.  And I think this is what you're talking about, right, Greg?  Why the public's love affair with Silicon Valley might be over.  But you're referring to somebody else.

Start time: 7605.64
End time: 7636.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this article is loosely based off something  that's been discussed by Professor Scott Galloway.  Now, he works for New York University.  He's a tenured professor.  He's a company called L2 Inc.  And he has a pretty amazing YouTube channel.  And one of the messages and he also has a history of being right  about this sort of stuff, also, by the way.  And his point is, is that the worm has turned.  So for the past 10, 20 years, we've all said that, you know,  Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, they're all doing amazing things.  They're bringing humanity forward.

Start time: 7640.56
End time: 7753.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  And but what's happening is we're now suddenly falling out of love with Facebook.  We've got the Russian hacking scandal.  We've got Uber having its license pulled in London.  We've got Google suddenly.  The Do No Evil starts to look like a bro boys club where women aren't accepted.  You know, James de Morey and that sort of stuff.  You know, this whole surveillance things look at the Equifax thing is a part of this.  These so-called technology companies, which is but we've seen the pro  zero juice debacle, all these startups that have just pointless,  you know, tech nerds who thought that, you know,  tech nerds who probably could use somebody with a liberal arts degree  to tell them that they're pretty stupid, actually, for a while.  And so what he's trying to say is that all of these companies are stupid.  And what he's doing is backing this up with some interesting evidence.  And his point is these people are destroying billions of dollars of market value.  So companies like Kroger, for example, are sunk from 28 billion to 20 billion dollars.  These are the people who employ people.  So Wal-Mart actually employs like 50,000 employees in the states.  Amazon does it with 10,000.  So if you're a government and you're looking at the 64 billion dollars  in tax paid since 2008 from Wal-Mart and the one billion paid in tax from Amazon,  who do you start legislating for?  Yeah. Right.  If you're Apple in the Europe and you're looking at the European Union  coming after you for tax revenue and you're going, oh, but we, you know,  and you've only paid a billion dollars instead of 20 billion dollars  over the last 10 years.  And then all of a sudden you say to the governments,  but you should protect us. We need to be. We need help.  The government are going like you're not paying tax.  You're not actually a citizen here.  You're not paying enough money to participate in modern society.  So here in the UK, you now have the UK government starting to get  after Facebook and Google and Netflix and saying,  if you don't start paying tax in this country,  we are going to have to create tax laws specifically to get you.  How is this different than Ludditism?

Transcript:  There is an element of this in the tech community is, as Greg has pointed out,  we're building technologies like self-driving cars, like smarter,  smarter systems,  which are going to put enormous numbers of people out of work in the next decade  or so. And there is no plan to deal with this.  And if you don't say, if you talk to the technology, I mean, I've talked to.

Start time: 7786.00
End time: 7817.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would blame politicians for that. They're the ones who are lying to people.  Who was it? The Treasury secretary? Somebody said, oh no, automation.  It's not even, we're not worried about that. They're lying.  They don't want people to know that this is coming.  They don't want to have people retrain.  They want to pretend that coal's coming back,  that there's going to be jobs for you as a minor. That's a, that's a lie.  And it's not fair to people. So I don't think the government is more to blame than technology.  Technology is going to solve these problems.

Start time: 7817.38

And as Greg points out, particularly, and this is less so in this country,  but certainly back in the UK, when it came out that Google had paid,  what was it, Greg, it was something like.  30 million.

Start time: 7890.50
End time: 7907.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way, of loopholes created by the incumbent companies  who all along haven't wanted to pay taxes and take advantage of the infrastructure.  These are tax laws that are on the books.  Google comes along. It's not Google's fault.  They're not Apple's fault.  They're taking advantage of tax laws that were created not by them,  but by their predecessors.

Start time: 7907.88
End time: 7915.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they industrialized the abuse of those systems.  So where before the systems weren't being abused at multi billion dollar scale,  they're being done at a minor scale.

Transcript:  Like everything with technology, they're just better at it.

Start time: 7918.56
End time: 7941.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But the flip side of this is that in the US,  Amazon has actually got a competitive advantage over its  by just choosing not to make a profit.  You only pay tax when you make a profit.  So if you build a business that doesn't make profit, you don't pay tax.  So now all of a sudden, Amazon can outcompete Walmart because it never has.  It doesn't have the to carry that liability on its books.

Transcript:  So the governments have a problem.  They need the revenue to sustain the internal systems.  I mean, in America, in particular, there's not enough money to fund  a police force that's going to keep society secure.  The reason that the police force has been part of militarizing  is because they're frightened because there's not enough of them.  How would you feel if you were like, you know, what is the the policing ratio  in the UK? I think it's one to one hundred thousand, something like that.  And in the US, it's even much, much smaller.  If there was any sort of significant societal upheaval in the US,

Start time: 7979.92
End time: 7983.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this simply. Oh, I'm sorry.  This autoplay gets me every time.

Start time: 7983.48
End time: 8026.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think there's a whole bunch of things here.  One is that they don't pay tax or they're pursuing strategies  which deliberately avoid paying tax and maximize growth.  And at some point, Amazon, by never, ever paying any tax,  is going to become so large and so dominant  that the governments are just going to have to say it's a monopoly and break it up.  That's the logical extension of this is if Apple continues to get any larger  as a nation state, like a corporate nation state,  the only way governments are going to be able to tax it or to control it  is if they force it to break up as a monopoly.  And what Professor Galloway is making the point is that Amazon  and all of these companies can't continue as they are because they're just not paying  enough, not contributing enough back to the societies that they take from.

Start time: 8027.20
End time: 8042.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's also says we're barreling toward regulation.  Yes, that's that's basically the message here is that governments are going to  their backbones are going to stiffen. You're going to get greater regulation.  Well, what does that mean?  Does that mean break up Amazon or just tax Amazon appropriately?

Transcript:  We're already seeing this in the European Union, where they're coming up with tax plans  and they're saying, right, we're going to tax you on revenue  that you make in our country, not on profit, because that is a better way to do it.  Because at the moment, you're licensing your technology off to people in  Ames in Holland or in Ireland.  They can bury the revenue.  Yeah, you can bury it that way.  So the European Union is saying, right.  And they've moved astonishingly quickly on this in the last month or so, saying,  we're going to go after. Yeah, we're going to go after revenue.

That's terrifying. Which do you prefer?  Which would you rather have the governments we've got out there  or the companies we've got out there?

So, for example, there's a law that's now enacted across the whole of the European  Union called the GPDR, the General Protection Data Act, which basically  it's a nightmare for Facebook because they have to delete user data.

But I mean, at the same time, they've had a free rein for so long.  And there's a certain arrogance creeping in, which is Tim Cook in Congress  last year, for example, he was talking about we had the Trump tax plan  come out this this week.  And Trump said they would be doing a once in a lifetime  one off tax break to allow the two and a half trillion dollars  being stored outside the US to be brought back in.  And they probably do, you know, they'll do a special low tax rate.  The only problem is we did this in 2004 with the Homeland  Investment Act, and all that money just went directly to shareholders  apart from Dell, who built a very small factory in Texas.

Now, I'm not going to disagree with you that the technologists are arrogant  and that these companies are running roughshod.  But I'm not convinced that any government,  even the wonderful Margaret Vistager  knows what to do with these guys in a way that's going to be responsible and work.  But you've got to have that.  I think the GDPR is going to end up being a nightmare.

Start time: 8318.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why you need that counterbalance, because if if, say, for example,  the governments have said on the Internet Explorer case, you know, well,  it's your it's your operating system.  You do what you want with it.  And that's what they did do initially.  And we ended up with Internet Explorer having 90 percent of the market.  And then Microsoft.

Start time: 8334.38
End time: 8347.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The market took care of it, not the DOJ or the EU.  Well, no, Microsoft putting sleep near on the ballot for browsers  did not fix that problem.  No. But at the same time, it was completely reasonable for Microsoft  to put a browser in its operating system.

Start time: 8348.00
End time: 8368.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But not then once it got a monopoly position in the browser market to say,  yeah, we're not going to bother developing that for a few years.  And before you know it, they got a massive security problem  which the end user was paying for.  Yeah. You know, it took Mozilla to come along and actually forced Microsoft  to do some development work and later Chrome, you know, before that,  before that change. But so what is the end game on this?

Transcript:  I think we're going to see a few things happen here.  One of them is I was listening to a podcast this week with a group of economists  arguing over what the future of capitalism looks like.  And the point that one of them was trying to make is that companies like Apple  and Amazon have actually found ways to hack capitalism in their favor.  And I don't think it's a hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

They have so much data, they have so much funding, so much capital,  just so much ability to move in any direction they want.  There's no regulations or restriction.  There's no competitive situation for them to be normal.  And so now we have a situation where they're uncontrolled.  And importantly, they're now at a position where they can move governments,  but they're not paying any taxes to governments.  So governments now in a situation where they can go and squash these organizations  because there's no tax money coming from them.  There's no penalty.  All there is is what's happening in public.  And increasingly, the public perception of companies like Uber  and Apple and Facebook is switching against them.  And once they lose public opinion, they lose everything.  There's no support behind them because they don't pay taxes.  They don't participate in society.  They're not contributing to the ordinary people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I will grant you that Uber there are, you know, there there's Theranos.  There are companies that are bad.  I'm not saying there aren't.  In fact, I'm kind of like with Greg.  I'm not a big fan of giant corporations either.  But I'm afraid we're going to throw the baby out with the bath water.  I'm afraid that we are going to overregulate technology out of existence  and we're going to create a new dark age.  I don't want I don't want the EU to be running.

Transcript:  I'm a I'm a reasonable job in carpenter, but I see.  Look, it's not good.  We have this argument every time the corporate tax rate comes up.  It's just like, well, in Britain, there was this big thing.  Vodafone was due to pay like six billion in tax and they reached a deal with the  UK tax authorities that they only pay a billion and a half.  Now, the company like Vodafone isn't going to say, well, we don't like your tax rules.  We're going to stop doing business in the UK because it hurts them more than it hurts  the authorities.  But governments are now just rolling over to these people.  I mean, look at the number of tax breaks that are being offered to host Amazon's

Transcript:  It's a complex law and there's a lot of it is consequences.  I think the idea is that I agree with is that you own your data and that these  companies should be compelled to delete your data periodically and to protect it.  And I'm not against that.  I'm really not against that.  It does. I think it does offer some technical challenges, though, because the Internet  is a fundamentally global system.  It's not in Germany or France or the company invented the Internet.

Start time: 8673.90
End time: 8686.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're talking about robot taxes.  But anyway, there was an article in The Telegraph this week about Uber, and apparently the  majority of Londoners are actually for Uber getting stripped of its license.  So Uber is losing the PR war.

Start time: 8687.16
End time: 8690.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 8690.90
End time: 8713.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they failed to comply with the the risk.  If you want to run a public taxi service in the UK, you've got to have your drivers  checked to make sure that they're not dodgy.  If they assault a driver, the passenger, they've got to that's got to be reported.  And you've got to play reasonably fair with the police and with the authorities.  Medical checks, criminal checks.  Medical. Yeah.

Start time: 8713.82
End time: 8715.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  TFL, TFL, the licensing authority for taxis said, said, we do not believe that Uber  is a trustworthy organization.  By the way, TFL might have a dog in this hunt.

Start time: 8749.36

Transcript:  I just have to say as a customer, if I'm going to go to London, I'm going to miss Uber.

Start time: 8771.78
End time: 8775.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. You can use one of the other ones.  See, it's got London's got three others.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's three other ride hailing companies in London that are just as good, if not better  than Uber when I was in Prague.  You know, I have a hard time.

Start time: 8783.92
End time: 8786.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to lead Uber.  I agree.  It's pretty convenient.

Start time: 8787.62
End time: 8803.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I flew into Prague in Czechoslovakia about six weeks ago for the IETF conference,  and they had a perfectly fine app from a company called Lyftago, and it worked exactly  like Uber and it worked fine.  And I spoke and it was a person in a black car with a nice clean card and blah, blah,  blah.  Uber exists.

Start time: 8804.82
End time: 8810.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure this is true in London, but in most places, certainly in the US, because  cabs are such a godawful experience, right?

Start time: 8810.62
End time: 8815.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Certainly in San Francisco.  In New York.  They're a godawful experience.

Start time: 8815.16
End time: 8832.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, cabs in New York are great.  I'll never forget going in Paris and it started snowing and all the cab drivers rolled up  their windows, lit their galois and opened the papers and said, no, they would not give  us a ride.  There's a reason Uber exists.  They're disintermediating a broken system.

Start time: 8833.72
End time: 8855.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only in certain locations does it actually work.  So in New York, Uber made sense.  But at the same time, Uber has deployed inexcusable practices to prevent competitors.  I agree, but I...  But literally TFL basically said, we don't trust what Uber has submitted to us.  They've consistently failed to comply.  We've taken it as far as we can.

Start time: 8855.20
End time: 8857.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Dara, the CEO, went over there.  Yeah.

Start time: 8858.42
End time: 8866.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And she admitted there was a problem.  Yeah, we're going to see if we can fix this.  But then while he was away, Travis appointed two new board directors.  What a mess.

Start time: 8867.24
End time: 8869.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could go on and on with Uber, but we can't because we're done.

Start time: 8869.92
End time: 8895.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what I'm saying here is...  We've done two and a half hours, gentlemen.  Yes.  But what I'm saying here is that they're losing the PR wall.  So as we're seeing increasingly, people are turning against Facebook.  They distrust Google.  Apple's starting to lose its privileged position.  People aren't lining up for the iPhone 8, in part because why am I continuing?  I think in a small...  There is a backlash.  I agree with you.  There is a backlash.  And the point is, how do we solve it?  I don't know, but I just want to...  I'm well aware of it.

Start time: 8896.06
End time: 8899.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, in some cases, it's been the purveyor of the backlash.

Start time: 8899.68
End time: 8925.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, listen, I mean, it's just when things get to this level at this stage, you've got  to start getting some triage in place.  Otherwise, it is going to be Luddites taking over things.  So if we're actually smart about this and the tech companies think it through, they'll  see it's in their long-term interests to actually play a level playing field.  If they don't, well, then they're thinking short-term, they're stupid, and we're all  screwed.

Start time: 8926.16
End time: 8937.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is a clarion call to these companies that maybe it's time for them to think about  what they're doing, sit down with government, and come to a compromise that benefits everybody  instead of being rapacious robber barons.

Transcript:  And that's one way to fight this, is to take over the government.  Yeah, no, I mean...  Doesn't half the science fiction stories talk about how it's a...  You could argue...  The world is run by corporations.
