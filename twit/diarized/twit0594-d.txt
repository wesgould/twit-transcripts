Transcript:  Well, happy holidays, everybody. It's time for Twit and a special holiday episode.  We had so much fun a couple of years ago during a New Year's Eve show,  bringing some of our hosts from different shows together,  as they never do appear during the year, and we thought we'd do it again.  So joining me, Denise Howell from This Week in Law, Steve Gibson from Security Now,  Renee Ritchie from Mac Break Weekly.  And what we're going to do is look back at the year 2016,  the highs, the lows, the big tech stories.  It's a very special Twit coming up next.  Netcasts you love.

It's time for Twit, a special holiday edition. Hello everybody. This is the Twit for Christmas  Day, December 25th, 2016. We are not recording this. I did not make anybody work on the holiday.  So we recorded this earlier in the month, but we're festive. I've got Santa coming out of my head.  Or is that an elf? I don't know what that is. To my right, Steve Gibson has joined us.  So what we used to do is we used to have people come in and we'd all get drunk,  and then I thought we should do what we did. Remember this? How many years ago was this?  It was 2015.  For New Year's Eve, you, Randall Schwartz, Renee, you were there. Renee Richie was also there.  Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff Jarvis was there.  Right.  And I was not.  No, I think you just-

Transcript:  So you know who is missing from that one is this person right here, Denise Howell from  This Week in Law. Nice to see you.  It was totally illegal.  So this is the beginning of a new tradition. We want to bring everybody up.  We'll rotate shows, obviously, but we'll bring hosts from other shows in because usually you  don't get to talk to each other. And it's kind of nice. You guys had breakfast together?  We did. We hung out all morning.

Start time: 180.43
End time: 187.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  What we're going to do, Tanya and Karsten, our production team, has put together a list  of some of the big stories from 2016. And I hope you will all, because each of you has  your own beat. You've got security. Denise has law and Renee has the Mac.  Come up with stories that you thought were important also this year.  What do we think was the big story? I think I know what the big story of 2016 was.  It was the election. And while that's a political story, it was very much, I think,  also a technology story. Facebook and Twitter particularly were really used to great effect  by the candidates. Actually, by one candidate.

Start time: 230.12
End time: 234.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve and I talked about that this morning. It was an amazing social engineering attack,  just from a pure technical point of view.

Start time: 236.30
End time: 339.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, Trump's use of Twitter was very effective. It continues to use it.  But also, the big story that we talked a lot about was fake news on Facebook. I've been one  of the people who's not too worried about that and doesn't think we should censor news.  Because what is fake news after all?  Who decides?  Who decides that? But more to the point, I think the dark advertising that we've been  learning about, that Trump's team, led by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, was able to use a company  called Cambridge Analytica out of the UK to profile 220 million Facebook users in the US.  In particular, using Facebook quizzes to more than just...  To engage.  Yeah. To gauge sentiment. And then could target ads, not just ads for people who would potentially  be voting for President-elect Trump, but also for people who'd be voting for Hillary Clinton  or the others. They were using it to suppress voting, like, oh, it won't matter, don't vote.  Text in your vote.  Yeah. Text in your vote. So it was really interesting.  And I think back to... I'm old enough to remember, and you might be too, Steve,  when Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968.  I do.  And everybody said this is the first time  ad men have been brought in to run a campaign.  Yeah.  And I think fast forward now to 2016.  It's a standard operating procedure.  This is more than ads now, though. This is a very effective use of social media in a way that we  will probably see from now on. So I'm going to nominate that for my biggest story. What do  you think your biggest story was, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I agree that in general in our world, this crazy election dominated a lot of our time and  thinking. And of course, to a somewhat lesser degree, this whole question of,  can a private email server be secure? Is something that we talked about.  Unfortunately, or for good or bad, it did factor heavily into forming a lot of people's opinions  about security and trustworthiness and so forth. And so that was leveraged to great effect.  And I said a number of times on our podcast that without knowing anything about the technology,  because as they say, the devil is in the details. And so to make any kind of an actual judgment  about the security of a piece of technology, you have to know everything about it.  And none of the rest of the world outside of some inner circle had any details.  But what we did here was that at one point at least, while the server was in use,  it was physically insecure. It was in a small ISP's office building where you could not  guarantee physical security. Somebody could walk in the door.  And that was my point is if you don't at least have physical security, you can't have data security.

Transcript:  So this is also the third year of the Snowden era.

Start time: 434.14
End time: 520.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And good point. Everything has changed. I mean, we're seeing  the ongoing effects of the revelations that he woke us up to. And as I've said also on the podcast,  independent of like how you feel about him, was he a traitor? Was he a patriot?  The question I've posed is, can you imagine an alternate timeline where he didn't do this,  where we didn't know today what we now know if we were as ignorant of what was really going on?  So I think knowledge is better than ignorance, independent of that. And what we've seen is we've  gone from a world where you would create a secure connection to a server only briefly to send your  credit card information or your login credentials over. Then it would drop you back to HTTP for your  regular interaction with the server. The problem is as the fire sheep hack showed,  it was trivial to hijack somebody's logon session and just to watch their traffic.  That's what we knew that the NSA was doing because at the beginning of this, most of the traffic,  only brief little pieces were encrypted and could not be easily seen.

Transcript:  Denise, what do you think the legal story of 2016 was?

Start time: 526.06
End time: 579.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was probably the dispute over whether the FBI could compel Apple.  San Bernadino.  Yeah. And I think that speaks to a larger story of 2016 being the year that people,  that not just we geeky people, but ordinary people started to realize that their data on all of these  devices is not just unique to themselves. It's very readily available to, whether it's the  government and we can wrangle over what circumstances that happens in, or advertisers or other corporate  interests who are leveraging that data, not necessarily to everybody's benefit.  We spent weeks.  I think that society's getting that data.

Transcript:  But the reason that what the court debate over fingerprint versus password is you can't be  compelled to give your password because that would be self-incriminating.  Testimony.

Start time: 600.34
End time: 602.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Testimonial.

Start time: 603.12
End time: 608.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But your fingerprint, like your hair or your DNA or an actual fingerprint, is not.

Start time: 609.04
End time: 613.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought there were some decisions recently that went the other way.

Start time: 619.76
End time: 647.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There have been. The courts have wrestled with this over the years.  We've had courts in different parts of the country say that passwords could be compelled,  that fingerprints could be compelled.  I don't think by and large, I mean, to have a takeaway for our listeners and viewers,  by and large, the password is going to be the way to go if you're trying to.

Start time: 647.10
End time: 657.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have one where they said that they couldn't make you tell them your password,  but they could give you your phone and you had to enter it and then give them back the phone.  I saw that.  Possibly.  Yeah.  I saw there have been a lot of weird decisions.

Start time: 657.66
End time: 672.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In October, there was the big story where this actually Forbes found a May filing,  the Department of Justice sought a warrant that would compel everybody in a building to give  hand over their fingerprint.

Start time: 672.96
End time: 696.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. This was down in Southern California, actually, and we don't know much about it at  all because it was all under seal. Kudos to Thomas Fox Brewster at Forbes who he and his  minions unearthed the fact that this had even happened.  Kind of an amazing story.  Yeah.

Start time: 696.46
End time: 707.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not passwords, it's still fingerprints. But to get a warrant,  and it's kind of a fishing expedition, right?  Yeah.  To walk in and say, everybody in this building and on these premises must give us their fingerprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was one of those John Doe warrants that we hate so much.

Start time: 714.84
End time: 737.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It's going to vary from judge to judge. Judges are still the people who decide whether  search warrants should issue. Unfortunately, there's no uniformity between them. Some of them  are going to grant warrants that seem desperately overbroad and some of them are going to be more  circumspect about it. So it comes down to who the judges are in our country.

Start time: 737.24
End time: 764.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I guess in the case of compelling a password, if the individual refuses, and we've  seen instances, for example, where hard drives have been encrypted and the individual makes  the decision that I'll be in worse shape if they see inside this hard drive than if I refuse.  So they're then in contempt of court and they're put in jail until they produce the evidence which

Start time: 765.02
End time: 811.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the judge is compelling them to produce. It's no question in my mind that the hackers gained  ground in 2016. But I wonder if it's safe to say that the government also gained ground in 2016.  For instance, we're recording this early in December. Early in December, Congress neglected  to stop a rule that would allow law enforcement to hack computers. Any magistrate in any  jurisdiction could give law enforcement a warrant to hack computers in any other jurisdiction  in the pursuit of a crime. And this was much battled, but it went through. So,  well, I guess what happened is they weren't able to say stop. Because otherwise it...

Start time: 812.02
End time: 814.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, while they're paralyzed, everyone else is still moving.

Start time: 815.26
End time: 823.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is really frightening that it happened this way as an administrative amendment to the  rules of criminal procedure rather than any kind of law that had to be.

Start time: 824.66
End time: 847.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might argue on the other side of it, which is that technology has outpaced this notion that  you get a warrant in the district of the crime because of, and particularly with hacking,  there is no jurisdiction. We've broken those borders.  I think you could make the argument that this rule 41 had to be changed for the 21st century.

Start time: 848.26
End time: 866.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But the other component of it where judges can issue warrants now that allow basically the  government to hack computers of unidentified people. I don't know how you show probable cause  if you're entering machines where you don't even know who the... Or you're not disclosing who the

Start time: 866.12
End time: 893.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  individual is. That may be one of the most shameful stories of 2016 that the FBI was running  more than half of all the child porn sites at one point in the United States as honey pots for  pederasts. That baffles me that the FBI was doing that and was allowed to do that.  That's a sting. I mean, I guess you catch a lot of criminals that way.

Start time: 903.16
End time: 906.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they had a major bust last week. They took down a huge ring.

Start time: 906.20
End time: 963.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the playpen bust, I think. Yeah. So government has gained ground. They gained  ground in the UK this year. The Snoopers Charter, the Investigatory Powers Act just  passed. Theresa May, who had proposed that before she was prime minister three years ago,  had been fighting to get that through. Now that she was prime minister, she was able to get the  votes. And that passed in the UK, according to Edward Snowden, the most broad powers to a  non-autocratic government ever. Extreme surveillance, Corey Doctorow called it.  V for Vendetta. And I imagine, remember, remember the 5th of November, I imagine the same thing will  happen in other Western nations, including perhaps here. We did talk a little bit though,  and I'm not clear on this, and we'll have to get back to you on how it affects encryption.  It seems that it might mandate backdoors in encryption, but I'm not sure. I don't see that

Start time: 963.46
End time: 996.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  explicitly in the Snoopers Charter. Yeah, it's not clear how this is going to get implemented. I mean,  one of the reasons that this recent presidential election was important was we know that the next  president was going to be appointing or nominating for appointment at least several Supreme Court  justices over the course of the probable tenure. And that as we're seeing now, the Supreme Court  has become more and more involved in figuring out where these lines are. And I understand,

Start time: 996.76
End time: 1002.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  times change. Technology was not envisioned by the founding fathers.

Start time: 1003.42
End time: 1014.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we're trying to interpret this constitutional document, which knows about grain and doesn't  speak of the problems that we have today. At least in the UK they're making it laws,

Start time: 1014.32
End time: 1027.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're not doing it illegally. And that's one of the justifications for this, isn't it?  It's now explicit. And at least a law you can challenge and can be overturned. But when you're  doing it illegally, then there's no reports. That's a very good point. That was why our Patriot Act

Start time: 1027.72
End time: 1061.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was so controversial is that one of the things we learned was that things were being done under  those guidelines, under that legislation, that the people who established it didn't ever intend.  It was pushed quietly and secretly. And then all of the letters which companies are receiving,  the national security letters, again, under the cloak of, you know, we're asking for this and  you can't tell anybody. So now we have warrant canaries all over the place that are dying.  We used to have them all gone now.

Start time: 1062.40
End time: 1065.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. In fact, they have all disappeared. We know now that they were...

Start time: 1065.74
End time: 1067.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sort of sad if yours are still up.

Start time: 1068.22
End time: 1113.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody wanted your data. So I agree with you, Denise, that one of the very biggest stories was  Apple versus the FBI. Now that the smoke is clear, the FBI dropped the case. They said,  oh, we found a way to get in, which was a little disturbing. Now that the smoke is clear,  what is the upshot of that case? Is the FBI just waiting for an... It appeared the FBI was waiting  for the kind of perfect conditions to pursue this. Apple took a very, an unprecedentedly strong,  and I think principled stand against it. But in the long run, if the courts rule against Apple,  Apple is going to have to do if it wants to do business in the US with the courts say.  So what is the... Now as we look back, was that just a tempest in a teapot or is this the beginning

Start time: 1113.40
End time: 1131.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of a first skirmish in a long war? I think it's a skirmish and I think that, you know,  Apple drew a line in the sand and that there's been a political shift in the country  toward helping law enforcement get... Yep. It was controversial then,

Start time: 1131.14
End time: 1137.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I think you're right. It's less controversial now. Yeah. So companies, it's going to be

Start time: 1138.22
End time: 1157.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  incumbent on customers and companies to make it really clear what sort of services they demand  and expect. And if the government says, you know, sorry, encryption is just a deal breaker for us  because we can't do law enforcement anymore, things are going to come to a head. And we have

Start time: 1157.64
End time: 1177.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this notion of things being normalized too. We're hearing the word normalized a lot in our jargon  and the idea that this was a big issue this year, it won't be such a big issue in the future. I mean,  it's going to... It's just, you know, the social side will adapt to this and... The new normal.

Start time: 1177.72
End time: 1183.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. If there's a consensus though, among the American people that we, you know, we want to

Start time: 1184.04
End time: 1198.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  err on the side of security. So I'm going to say what happens next. Let's say this goes through  and they are forced to put back doors in and then inevitably hackers discover them and suddenly  millions of people have their bank accounts. That was Tim Cook's... Yeah. But I mean, let's say that

Start time: 1198.58
End time: 1202.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  happens. That's going to be the... Is it the American people though? Or is this being... I think it's

Start time: 1202.72
End time: 1219.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the American people. I think most people... The fact we've seen this worldwide, this kind of  move towards authoritarianism. That when you get really scared, you let the strong man in and say,  protect us. And I think that that's kind of what this is. This is about people who didn't mind

Start time: 1219.70
End time: 1223.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  military government anymore were mind boggling. They thought it was not a bad idea. I just saw,

Start time: 1224.30
End time: 1240.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I'll see if I can find it, but I just saw some graphs, Nate, worldwide by age demographic of  people who thought democracy was important. And it's us old folks, you and me, Steve, that still  think democracy is important. We went down to like 35 percent, right, with millennials?

Start time: 1240.72
End time: 1245.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Millennials thought democracy was not important. And they would be fine with a military state.

Start time: 1245.34
End time: 1253.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we've also seen studies where you say to someone, here's an ice cream cone,  I'll trade you for your password. And they go, okay. You know what I mean? Like...

Start time: 1253.52
End time: 1273.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a very different sense of what your password is.  How do you get the gun from a gramophone clerk? You ask him for it.  Yeah. Right. Well, this is all a grim topic. Let's change something.  Ted, you know what I think the big story of 2016 was? Pokemon Go.  Oh, you stole mine. Was that going to be yours?  It was a phenomenal... I didn't ask you what yours was. I apologize.

Start time: 1273.88
End time: 1305.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all. So I guess it's not exactly Apple news, but I think that was part of the appeal,  was that it was both Apple and Android and it hit all at once. And it was... I remember seeing their  presentation where they showed, this is what we expected in terms of traffic. This is the maximum  we expected. This is what hit us. So you had a perfect confluence of a platform that was beyond  any specific hardware vendor. You had location services, you had gamification, and you had this  massive appeal where you could play together and people were going out to parks and families...  It was amazing.  ...discovering their neighborhoods.

Start time: 1305.70
End time: 1309.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1309.36
End time: 1329.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I remember the first day it happened in the restaurant where I was eating, one of the  servers came outside because I sit out on the patio and she said, I hate this Pokemon thing  because like all of her tables...  Nobody's paying attention.  They weren't talking to her.  And she was like, quiet, I'm catching a Sworlax.  Oh yeah, come back later. I gotta go get a Zichiku or something. She didn't know what was going on.

Start time: 1329.66
End time: 1338.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That first weekend I went to the park and there was this elderly gentleman and he said,  my daughter is out here catching Pokemon with me. She doesn't want to spend a minute with me normally.  This is the best weekend of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yet, and I didn't think this was going to be a flash in the pan. It was a flash in the pan.  Yep.  Right. It was the fastest selling game in history and five days outsold every other game. In fact,  Google Play did at the end of the year name it the top game of 2016. But it's also, I mean,  I don't see anybody playing it anymore.  There are.  You play it. I see you play it.

Start time: 1359.38
End time: 1380.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, yeah, I play it. So I think they said it's about 10% of initially, but they had a huge  problem because they couldn't scale. Scaling turned out to be non-trivial for them and that  put the brakes on new features. They had to work so hard to roll it. I think they just added China,  which is a huge market for them, and they couldn't focus on new features. So only last week did we  see the ditto creature came out and then Generation 2 is going to come out.

Even if they had been able to scale, the curve would have  probably still come down to about where it is now because there were people who were going to screw  around with it for a couple weeks and then go, okay, back to my regularly scheduled life.

They're making an  Apple Watch app and a Pokemon Go bra. So you have to go out and it's going to be a workout app on  Apple Watch. It's not going to be a game.

Transcript:  kind of little bit camel's nose under the tent of augmented reality. Getting us used to. Wait a  minute. We've got to pause for a moment because the hot butter rums are here. Oh, those look good.  Happy holidays. Hello. Enjoying our special Christmas edition of This Week in Town.  I'll tell you. All right. Since you take Pokemon Go, I have another  OK, biggest story of 2016. We'll talk about that as you get whipped cream on your nose.  First, though, a word from Rocket Mortgage, our sponsor for the show. It's nice to Rocket  Mortgage doesn't take time off for the holidays because they're always there. If you're looking  around and you say, I think I see a house in our future and you want to get a mortgage or maybe  you're ready to refi and you're watching this show, you're probably pretty geeky. I can imagine  that you don't want to go back in time to 1956, bring a bankers box full of papers to the loan  office while the loan guy goes. I remember this actually. It has a clipboard with the various  loan. Let me see what loan would be. Well, I don't know. And it's the finest print you ever saw.  Right here, it seems to be based on the Libor. Forget that. Forget that. Go to Rocket Mortgage  and you just answer a few questions. You could send them your statements, your pay stubs,  all the information they need with a push of a button. Actually, the touch of a thumb,  because you can do this on your phone or your tablet. You could even do it at the open house.  Like this couple does, they're looking at a house, they suddenly get the itch, we should buy this.  And before they leave the open house, they've got the Rocket Mortgage screen that says you're  approved and approved in minutes for not just any loan, but a loan that's tailored for you.  Rocket Mortgage comes to you from Quicken Loans, the premier mortgage lender in the country.  And of course, they've got a product for geeks and I'm so glad. Rocket Mortgage,  if you want to find out more, get ready. Put this on a Post-It note. You never know when you're going  to be at that open house and want to buy. QuickenLoans.com slash twit and the number two.  QuickenLoans.com twit two Rocket Mortgage, equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states,  and MLSConsumerOxys.org number 3030. Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans. We thank them so  much for their support for our holiday special. We've got hosts from various shows here. This  is a lot of fun. We asked a bunch of hosts. You guys were the first to respond. Lucky you.  Smart us. Smart you. Yeah, it's fantastic. Well, it's perfect because the twit  holiday party is tonight. So you're all here. Did they know there was going to be a holiday?  How come I got the big mug? Here's a chief twit. And by the way, that's the other big story of the  year. Anthony Nielsen, who is one of our great creative editors, also happens to be an amazing  mixologist. I'm convinced. Thursday, it's one of the nights of the week, Wednesday night,

Thank you,  Anthony. Thank you. The show will be getting more interesting progressively as it goes by.  Nice job. Oh my. Brian Burnett, you dressed up for the show. Nice to see you as well.  That was another story for us. This is a brand new studio. We moved out of the Brickhouse studio.  You're seeing it for the first time, all three of you. It's the right size.  Renee Richie from iMore, Denise Howell from Twill. This week in law, Steve Gibson from  Security Now. I should introduce you once again. Nice to have you here. This is our first holiday  in the new studio. It looks fantastic. Parking's better. Yes. That's for sure. It was hard to park  in my old place. Yeah. It's cozy. It's a little smaller, but you know what? Doesn't this look  kind of the same, really? Yeah. What do you need? And if Lisa and I are yelling outside,  it doesn't bother you in here. That's a big improvement. And I think really, the real reason  we moved was because the rest of the staff hated that they couldn't say anything. They had to  whisper all the time while we were doing shows. Now they're drinking. The librarian lost her

You've been  back. You've been back. Quiet, everybody. Okay. I think one of the big stories, and it's much like  there's some relationship to the Pokemon Go story, is virtual reality. Yeah. Because it was kind of  a flash in the pan this year. This was the year that the Oculus Rift finally was sold to the public.  Then HTC followed shortly thereafter with the HTC Vive. Sony, towards the end of the year, released  its PlayStation VR. So for the first time, people were able to, in their homes, play VR. Everybody

Start time: 1758.98
End time: 1795.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got excited about it. I can be Batman, Leo. I can be Batman. Can you jump off a building and swoop down?  So I started off with the Vive, was the first one I tried. And then Georgia stole, no, she stole my  Oculus. Okay. But I started off with the Vive. And it's great because it's got the different cameras  and different areas, and you can actually move through the room. And it does feel like a holodeck.  You put it on and there's like, if you have to walk a plank, my brain will not let me do it. It's  just, it feels too real. You were talking about that planking. Yeah. It's called Richie's Plank,  ironically. And Georgia put it out there and I was supposed to walk on it and my entire body system  shut down. Said there's no way I'm walking out on this. You know, as an old timer, there's a pattern

Start time: 1797.16
End time: 1888.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I've seen often. There was a first round of home computers that were too soon and too early  and they died. Yeah, Altair. There was also something called a Newton. There was a Newton  once that was that was it was ambitious. It was too soon. And, and even laptops, I remember,  we know luggables as they were nicknamed compact. It just, you know, it's like, well, it kind of  works, but would you have an extension cord? And so, so now we just take them for granted. And,  and I think, you know, because what generally happens is that visionaries are out in front  and they're often right about what, but they're, they're normally wrong about when they're,  they see it too soon. And so oftentimes they get arrows in their backs that are fatal. And so,  so I'm, I'm interested in this. I think that, you know, Renee was talking about how if you put  goggles on that shows you a narrow plank over a gorge, you're scared. You can't walk across it.  And so the point is that, you know, we're creatures that, that take the environment that our senses  deliver to us literally. And, and so I think essentially this means that this kind of  technology that can, can create an artificial environment will be incredibly powerful. I just  think I'm not in a hurry, you know, we got a lot of time left. Which is like the most mainstream

Transcript:  It's the holodeck. My take on it is opposite of yours. And I'm not sure. And we have them all.  And I played with them all. And I played with them to the point where I go, okay, I get it. I have  several. No, and I think you could make an excellent point. It could just be too early,  early days, but it could also be like 3d. Yes. Okay. So there is precedent for it. And what we're  here, there's two, there's two trends happening here. There's the one trend which we're trying to  make a computer reality more immersive, more real. And of course the end game is the, you know,  from Neuromancer, the, or snow crash, the implant or the metaverse where we, we are,  it's almost indistinguishable from reality. And certainly I would love to get there. And if we  get there, the holodeck, you'll be so happy. And if you just had something that was appeared in your visual

Start time: 1961.98
End time: 1970.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we might get there. But I think VR certainly is, I mean, 3d, it starts with 3d was supposed  to be, right? It's more immersive movie and it's just annoying at least to me. Well, so. It's

Start time: 1970.26
End time: 1974.08

End time: 1989.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  PC. I think at some point we will get to their, get to some sort of immersive technology. I personally  don't think it'll be screens, uh, three inches from your eyes, but I don't know what else is out  there. So, I mean, I don't think we'll be jacking in anytime in my lifetime. When you say it's like

Start time: 1989.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  3d, do you mean how in the fifties people went to 3d movies and they were kind of hokey? Two years ago.  Oh yeah, sure. Right? Remember everybody got 3d TVs now. Nobody makes 3d TVs. None of the companies

End time: 2011.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 2011.64
End time: 2022.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I prefer 2d movies. It's funny because I have two very good friends. They feel exactly opposite.  I don't care. Jenny absolutely will not see a movie not in 3d. It's dimmer. And another friend of mine

Start time: 2022.96
End time: 2103.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doesn't care at all. It's dimmer. We went to see Fantastic Creatures and how to train them.  The world's largest, longest title. Anyway, uh, and there was a choice of 3d or 2d and I,  I wanted to go to 2d, but Lisa preferred 3d. I was told to see Dr. Strange in 3d because of the building.  Dr. Strange in 3d was very cool. Very cool. So, um, I, anyway, I think the jury's still out on  VR that it could be the 3d or it could be the metaverse. But what the other trend that's  right alongside it is this trend towards new user interfaces for computing. And I do think there's  something there. I think AR for instance, augmented reality. Um, well, look what I'm playing with here.  This is, this is my newest computer. I got this earlier this month. This is the, uh, surface, uh,  studio from Microsoft. And if you'd asked me a couple of, you know, years ago, you think you'll  ever have a giant screen computer. I mean, this would have been science fiction and it really works  quite well. It's really, it's kind of, it's kind of an amazing thing. So I think you, new user interfaces  are very possibly, uh, and voices come a long way this year too. And voice is the other thing. And  so that's, so VR would be one of my votes for a story that may or may not be a flash in the pan,  AR related, but voice technology. Look at the Amazon Echo and now the Google home, which,

Start time: 2104.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  voice. And that to me is if you, if I had to pick, and these are all huge story and we're talking  about massive trends here, but I think this is the year that we're going to look back and say,  machine learning finally became an important goal for these. We have connectivity, cloud,

Start time: 2160.84
End time: 2170.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we were using Google now and Siri and Cortana for the, and they never talked about AI.  They never talked about machine learning, never talked about computer vision, but they start  Google, put it on stage. And then after that, everyone had to talk about it.

Start time: 2171.46
End time: 2251.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was October 4th when Google had its event and, uh, and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google  talked about, and I think very cogently, the various stages of computing, whether it's  personal computing, uh, and that what were they, there was personal computing,  then there was mobile computing. I must've left something cloud, then there was cloud computing,  but now there's artificial intelligence. And I remember, uh, uh, talking, uh, with, um, uh,  now we did it on triangulation, um, Kevin Kelly, who wrote a new book about the future. And one of  the things he said is what happens with these technologies? And you could talk about computing  as being an example of big data being another example, uh, is that you take something you  already had and then you add a layer of this new technology. He uses an example of when  electrification became big at the turn of the last century, a farmer would look at, well, what have  I got? Oh, I've got this pump that get water. I have to pump it. I wonder what an electric  motor would do to change that. And whole new industries were born. He said that happens every  time when the industrial era, the electrical era, cars are driving themselves. Now he says  what you're going to see and the opportunity that lies and people will look back and say,  Oh, you were alive in 2016. You were, you were around when the information age turned into the

Start time: 2251.46
End time: 2259.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  machine learning age and the artificial intelligence. Like if your AI accepts an invitation for you or  makes a car decision for you and there's a bad result, is it your fault? Is it the company who

Start time: 2259.92
End time: 2270.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  made the eyes full? Is it the AI's fault? Well, that was another big story this year is the self  driving cars and wasn't the decision. This was the year that the first Tesla driver was killed in

Start time: 2270.94
End time: 2275.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 2275.98
End time: 2295.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it was as it turns out, neither he nor the Tesla saw the truck across the road. Yep. Yep. And he  was speeding and he plowed into it and passed away. Sad to say, nevertheless, it right. It brought up  this whole fear of self driving cars. And they weren't driving themselves last year. It's like,

Start time: 2295.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AI was a big story with assistance, but you saw like Tim Cook started talking about how Apple uses  AI in their devices for battery life because they can intelligently figure out maybe what you're  going to do next and then start to pre-cash things for you. So this technology has been,  they've been doing this for years, but now they're sort of talking about it. And it's become not just  a thing that helps you make an appointment, but something that preserves your battery life, adjusts  your phone performance and does all these things before you totally behind the scenes. We don't

No, I think the, the national highway safety and NHTSA decided that the  driver of a self driving car is still responsible is no, is, is the, whatever system is driving the  car. Oh, the driver is the software. Yes. That's right. So, but that, I mean, that's so weird. How

Start time: 2374.40
End time: 2383.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  does that all lay out like, Oh, there's a grandmother in that car, but there's two kids in this one. So  the cars are going to talk and say, sorry, granny, the two kids. Yeah. Well, that's what they're

Start time: 2383.18
End time: 2427.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  trying to figure out is they build out the AI ethical dilemma. Yeah. MIT has this really  interesting project called the moral machine that we've talked about on Twill a couple of times  where you go and you help them answer scenarios. They're trying to get human intelligence to help  answer those hard questions. You know, how would the average person resolve these conflicts? And  it's, it's a fascinating exercise to make yourself go through. It's a, it's a strange exercise. Like  they, they bring some moral judgments into it where some of the scenarios tell you that the person,  the car is about to hit. If you don't swerve and hit something else is a criminal. So, you know,  they try and bring some moral values into your decision making. Sure. Start judging. Let's see.

Transcript:  Okay. What should the self-driving car do? So here's the choice. Oh, this is terrible.  Yeah. So you could either plow into four pedestrians and kill them, or you could swerve  and plow into a barricade and kill the passengers. Here's another one. I guess it depends upon your  point of view. Oh, and there's, I see. So if you swerve into the, it's a Kobayashi Maru. It is. And

Start time: 2454.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the self-driving car with sudden brake failure will continue ahead and drive through the pedestrian  crossing ahead. One male athlete will die. One man, one homeless person, one girl, one criminal.  Now here's what I think about this. The car doesn't freaking know that the car is going to do what you  would do and I would do, which is do the best it can. It's not going to make a calculus that says,  well, this guy should survive. This guy shouldn't. It will attempt to, it will attempt to avoid the  accident as best it can, just as you would do without doing the calculus of, well, that guy's  an athlete and that's a grandmother. Let's kill the grandmother. That's a stupid question. That's

I actually think we're in a situation where, you know, we all think  it's weird because we're not used to self-driving cars, but as this all gets worked out, I think  you're right, Leo, that people are going to look back and say- Well, were you worried about that?  Exactly. Those human drivers were far more dangerous. That's the real point, isn't it?  The most interesting wrinkle I've seen on this thus far was something that caught my eye just  this week. A study out of UC Santa Cruz that wonders how pedestrians are going to react  to knowing that self-driving cars are programmed to avoid them. The article you pulled up said

Well, having just visited New York for  the first time in a long time last summer, I can totally see this playing out where you get some  pretty gutsy pedestrians just saying- You can drive there. Talking about a traffic jam.  Just come on and get me. The cars would just never move. You know, this actually already did

Transcript:  happen. This was the year, remember, that the Google car got in an accident. It plowed into a bus.  Remember, the car was driving, autonomous vehicle driving down Mountain View in city traffic,  which is notoriously difficult for these cars. It would normally be in the lane to turn right,  but it turned out there was construction going on. It got to the end of that lane. There were  barriers. It couldn't, and it needed to merge back into traffic to go around the barrier.  It saw the bus and it plowed into the bus because it assumed, the software assumed,  the software's program assumed, the bus will see me and let me in. It was a very slow speed accident.  Nobody was hurt, I should point out. But what Google said is, yay, that's good because now we're  going to tune our software because we realize that what a human would do is look at the bus driver,  see if the bus driver sees me and understands I'm going to get in and maybe even get a little tacit  or explicit permission to merge in. The software didn't do that. The software just assumed. So the  software's going to improve because of that. This study says pedestrians know that drivers  don't want to run them over. So why not just step out into the street and assert the right of way?  Well, because there's always a small probability the driver's an attentive, drunk,  associate path, or can't stop in time. On the other hand, if it's an autonomous vehicle, well,  I know it's going to stop. So crosswalk chicken, from now on, pedestrians go, I'm walking in the

Actually, last year was the  year that fatalities in the highway went up after many years of decline because of distracted  driving. Oh, which is such a problem. So the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  and HTSA, suggested that it would be a good idea if Apple and Google, then we're not going to make  you, but it would be a good idea if you had software in your operating system that would  prevent the driver from using the phone. Yes, not the passengers. The equivalent of a car mode.

It says I'm a passenger and you have to, and supposedly, I guess, if you  get in an accident and you hit that I'm a passenger button and you weren't, then you lied. It's  definitely your fault. But I used to commute to work and there were people reading newspapers on  their steering wheels, putting on makeup, turning around and yelling at the kids and while they're

Yeah, talking about old timers. Old timers. We're not celebrating  the 40th anniversary of Commodore. No. Atari. Yeah. Radio Shack. No. Even IBM is a completely  different company than it was 40 years ago. Yeah. And I guess after 40 years, Apple decided  you don't need a headphone jack. Compaq. You don't need to. You don't. This year. USB-A ports.  Come on. You don't need a headphone jack. So this was the year, in fact, at the beginning of the year,  I think it was the first story we covered in 2016, was a consumer petition because of the rumor  that Apple would be dumping the headphone jack. 200,000 people, this was from the first twit  of the year, 200,000 people petitioned Apple to not ditch the headphone jack.  So here we are. They did. They shipped the iPhone 7, headphone jackless iPhone 7 in September.  You've got one? I've got one. I don't have one. Nothing but Speaker Girls. They promised AirPods.  Yes. You have some, but they're not the official ones. I have a round hole.  Wow. Did you drill that in your iPhone? It doesn't work as well now.  So here we are a year later.

Well, I mean, so it turns out it's not an issue  for people who never used headphones or who always use them because people always use them,  just put the adapter on and forgot about it. But if you were an occasional user, like you just used  that for the airplane. That's where the inconvenience comes from.  Because you wouldn't remember that you didn't have it and you get on the plane. And by then it's  too late. There's just no hope for you. So it's the in-flight entertainment system or nothing.

No, they wrote to Tim Cook saying,  Tim, I want to be able to charge my iPhone and listen to music. When are you coming out with  the AirPods? Just tweak your ear and let me know. Because if it's not going to be for a while,  I'll go out getting somebody else's Bluetooth headphones. And Tim supposedly, again, this  hasn't been able to verify it, said in the next few weeks.

They have just this month,  they opened an API that will allow a more complete, for instance, weather will allow a more  complete interaction in the kind of native mode. They've added some new words. There is a rumor  they're going to do a kitchen Echo that has a screen. I think that Jeff Bezos has indicated  that the Echo... I think we have the story here.

Transcript:  Steve, no, no, no. Okay. We got the guy. Yeah. Let's get Steve to explain. Please explain.  Here's my thinking on this. There are three words the Echo can respond to. I won't say what they are  because we don't want to wake any Echos up that people would... Oh, do it. But in the Echo, they  have waveforms for those three words. Templates. Templates. The Echo is always on, but all it's  really doing is gathering every waveform that goes on and comparing to that template. And at that,  it's not sending anything back to Amazon until it matches that template. Right. So think of it like

Transcript:  a time-occupying buffer. So audio is coming in, filling... It fills this buffer and then it falls  off the end. And that the size, the depth of that buffer is the period of time that the local  processor looks at what it has heard and can figure out what it wants to do. It's not a

Start time: 3279.10
End time: 3283.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3283.90
End time: 3300.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3327.20
End time: 3379.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of course, if they were sending back all that traffic, you'd see it. You got a fire up wire  shock and you would see a significant amount of traffic constantly going back to the servers.  I am sure, and I haven't fired it up, although I was just searching and there are some people who  have done this, I am sure that some material is always being sent to Amazon, some small amount.  Metadata. Well, I would also bet it's encrypted, so we don't know what it is. And so the one...  If you really wanted a conspiracy theory, the one thing that could be provably possible,  not provably true, but provably possible, is that the Echo may have other words it's looking for.  Let's say product categories like suitcases or baby strollers. And if it does hear those words,  it sends a ping back saying, hey, they're interested in baby strollers. I find that hard to believe.

Start time: 3380.00
End time: 3389.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just where I was going. To your point, it's not open source. We don't know everything it does.  And we don't know that exactly as Denise says, that Amazon couldn't be compelled to turn  an individual, a specific home's Echoes into microphones that then start streaming everything  up. So again, we don't have any control over that. We just assume it would be so damaging to Amazon  that they would resist with every ability that they have and hopefully design it so that it does  not have that ability, that they cannot be compelled to switch it on and just stream.

At this point, I don't see any evidence in here. And I think if  they were, there would be howls of protest. There's plenty of people out there who can use wire  shark, who can watch Amazon's traffic. If that kind of volume of traffic were to set back,  we'd know that by now. What we don't, what I think we can say safely, we don't know,  is if an individual cases, a law enforcement agency hasn't said to Amazon, well, turn on Denise,

So  if you don't have a static IP address, you want to have a server, you'll register with DynDNS  at any time your IP address is... They're a major DNS provider.

So it makes sense that that is something that major cloud providers would outsource because  it's just sort of like, oh, somebody else can do our DNS. There's no value to be added to it.  And so they got attacked and created a massive outage that surprised people in its size.  Attacked by, it turned out DVRs?

And it was a whole string of  articles and turns out security is important even on your IoT device. Well, and this was something

Start time: 4286.46
End time: 4384.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we spent a lot of time on security now this year is I mean, this adds a whole new wrinkle.  The idea, the problem is the manufacturers of the devices have demonstrated it doesn't matter to the  consumer. The consumers have demonstrated they're oblivious. They want to be able to look at their  driveway when they're 100 miles away from home. So they plug these little miracles in and, oh, look,  I can do that now. So and we also know that convenience and security are at odds. And  so the manufacturers want to make them easy to use, sacrificing security, which, unfortunately,  it's only market pressure. I mean, for example, we were talking about Apple and Apple's demonstrated  commitment to security. That's and this was one of the FBI's major points in attacking Apple,  saying Apple has created this in strong encryption as a marketing benefit. They're selling security.  Well, so so what we've seen is that Apple has worked hard to minimize the the impact to the  consumer of offering the security. It's much easier just not to worry about it. And the problem is  when people screw electronic light bulbs and webcams in, they just I mean, you know,  people who listen to Twitter network understand that there's more to it than that. But the consumer  just buys them from Wal-Mart and hooks them up and oh, look, right. And what they don't realize is all

But we saw in Canada, Bell fiber now is IP based, you get an Apple TV in the  US direct TV now is IP based, you get an Apple TV or another product to use it. Netflix started  allowing downloads this week for the first time. And it really is what you say like we took this.  They were saying for years that we can't negotiate Microsoft and Apple and Google.  They were fighting Google TV. They were fighting Xbox. They were fighting Apple. We said,  we'll just wait. Time is on our side. Yeah. And finally, the end of 2016, the dominoes are falling.

Transcript:  AT&T announced in December. It's a direct TV now which is an over the top streaming service  that is zero rated. It doesn't count against your AT&T bandwidth limits. Okay, so here's what's  going to happen. The FCC has decided to stop all work until January 20th and President Trump comes  in and points to US FCC commissioners. So immediately net neutrality is under assault.  AT&T is effectively saying, I mean, it's very clear, we're not worried about zero rating anymore,  which was considered by many to be against it. Controversial. Very controversial. T-Mobile's  been doing it like crazy. AT&T is blatantly, they're not even burying it. Zero rating appeals to

End time: 4547.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people because it sounds like they're not going to pay anymore. Customers love it. But the opposite  side of that is promoted content. So like they zero rate their network and then they say Netflix,  you've got to pay us. And at the end, we're paying. You don't want AT&T and T-Mobile to

Transcript:  Another blow a new FCC will probably cause to this category is it looked like we were getting  very close to the FCC mandating opening up the set-top boxes that cable companies would be  required to let Apple and Google and other companies make set-top boxes that, in other words,  could break that monopoly. And the FCC was moving in that direction but now that's stopped completely.  Was it Pasadena who wanted to start taxing? Yes, it was Pasadena.  It's not just Pasadena.

Transcript:  You live in these areas. The city councils are looking for money and they have decided that they  already have the right to tax Netflix because it's a utility. So they're proposing a not  insignificant tax on your Netflix bill. It would go from $10 to $12 and $2 will go in the...  It's not just Pasadena. Is the logic that it's a cable company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, when we were earlier this year, there was the fights or maybe it was late last year,  but we've covered the peering agreement fights where there were problems with Netflix because  so much bandwidth was going in one direction. And what we learned was that three quarters  of the internet traffic at night is Netflix. That's insane. Not YouTube, not HBO.  Three quarters of the entire traffic on the globe is like one service. It's like people,  this is how people are consuming their video entertainment now.

Start time: 4723.46
End time: 4760.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it's not just Netflix. Pasadena wants to charge a 9.4% tax on Netflix,  but they also want to charge it on other streaming services. So your cable bill,  how many streaming services do you get? Your cable bill could go up a significant amount.  And we're already seeing people complaining. Whatever that might be.  I guess you're building Netflix. But if you have Netflix and Showtime  anywhere and HBO Now and pretty soon, you know, you're talking 10, 15, 20 bucks going to the city.  I suspect that's not going to be upheld. I need to look more at the underpinnings of it,

Start time: 4763.10

Start time: 4768.08

Start time: 4773.36
End time: 4789.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  States. Right. Before we leave the issue of AT&T and zero rating and all that, it occurred to me  just to mention that part of the solution to the problem is for more cellular carriers to do what  AT&T is doing and offer unlimited. Well, T-Hub already does.

Start time: 4789.68
End time: 4797.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unlimited? Yeah. Right. So once you have unlimited data that's capped at a high level, maybe it's.

Start time: 4798.24
End time: 4801.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they want to zero rate their services and meter you on everyone else's.

Start time: 4801.90
End time: 4823.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, AT&T does not offer unlimited service. But T-Mobile, which does, says they'll  throttle you, I think, at 28 gigabytes. So it probably is something that people are going to  pay attention to. If I start watching Netflix full time and it's kind of cost me and my bandwidth,  Bill, I better watch AT&T. You can watch our stuff for free. And that's what their message,

Start time: 4824.08
End time: 4827.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like they're asking why are you trying to take something? Consumers want this. Why would you

Start time: 4827.32
End time: 4836.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  punish them? It starts to become an antitrust issue because the way you get your unlimited data  with AT&T is your direct TV. However, T-Mobile doesn't own Spotify or Apple Music or any of

Start time: 4841.54
End time: 4849.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

The new iPhone. The new Google phone. And the new  Surface Studio. And actually I think we could wrap things up by just asking you guys what you think  next year is going to bring. What do you think the stories will be covering on security now?

Start time: 4919.72
End time: 4953.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, I think we're going to see an increase of IoT issues. My theory is that we're going to see a  separation in the market. I think Apple and Google are going to expand their focus and  they'll be the higher priced security focused solution. And then people who don't want to pay  for security will still be able to buy Xiaomi or cheap Android phones. Yeah, exactly. And we're

Start time: 4954.70
End time: 4959.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seeing that, aren't we? That the cheap Android phones are a huge security risk and not being

Start time: 4959.14
End time: 5016.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  patched. Right. And so for example, if you want Android and you can afford a Pixel, that's going  to be a phone that Google will fix immediately. In fact, we just covered a couple of weeks ago  at one of the hacking contests, it took 90 seconds to take over a brand new Pixel. But it only took  24 hours for that to get patched. And so what we're learning is security is porous and so it's  impossible, arguably, with the complexity that we have today, with the complexity that users want,  to actually create bulletproof security. Given that, what then matters is that the companies  understand that and arrange, as Google just demonstrated, that when a problem is found  and they will exist, that they get fixed quickly. That's the best we can ask for.  So I think we're on a continuum and it's going to be a great ride in 2017.

Transcript:  like? I hope that we're going to see the fake news problem solved by a number of means. Watching  this all unfold has reminded me that back in the early 2000s, the bloggers had sort of dubbed  themselves the truth police. And you were an early blogger. Yeah, they were going to fact check your  A double. They were the future of journalism. Well, I don't know if they were the future of  journalism, but what you sort of saw was a dissatisfaction with the completeness and context  that mainstream news sources were providing for people, which I think has led to things like the  Twitter network. We're all context all the time. Right, exactly. Which is great. So I think that  we saw this progression from there's not enough to now everyone can have a voice and we can have  lots of really good voices, but there is this problem where there is a bunch of trash out there  too. And how are we going to take out the trash? I hope that it will be attacked in the same way  that people jumped into it in the early 2000s and say, we're just not going to let this slide.

Start time: 5095.44
End time: 5117.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This shall not pass. That saddens me a little bit too, because we had such hopes for the democratizing  effects of the internet that everybody would get a voice, but it turns out that yeah, everybody got  a voice and some small percentage of humans are so horrific that giving them a voice was turned out  to be a very bad idea. The problem is we can't agree on what percentage is the bad percentage.

Start time: 5117.98
End time: 5121.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 5194.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I also think we talked about this on a twig a couple of weeks ago. The other thing that  happened, we saw this coming, I saw this coming, but I didn't realize what the impact would be  is facts were at a much higher value pre-internet. If you wanted to know something, you had to work  to get it. If you were lucky, you had an encyclopedia. If you weren't, you had to go to the library.  But the possession of a fact was a valuable thing. The internet commoditized facts. It made facts  so commonplace, it eliminated their value. And as a result, it devalued the word fact.  So what is a fact and what isn't a fact is no longer meaningless. And I didn't expect that.  I thought that with the plentitude of facts, we would all have the opportunity to be smarter,  to make better decisions. A perfect kind of microcosm of this is the internet review.  I thought, well, with everybody reviewing stuff on Amazon and Yelp, we'll all have perfect  information, we'll always get the best price and the best product, but it got junked up so quickly  that we can no longer trust internet reviews. I think the same things happen with truth.

Now you can screw up every day and nobody's good.  The Tylenol recall. I mean, Tylenol had to go to extraordinary lengths to save their brand.

Transcript:  lot of time on that this year. And we've also seen in terms of what the internet has become,  it is unfortunately also a big marketing machine. And I think it was earlier this year that ad  blockers were a big deal. Thanks to Apple. This was the year that Apple turned on ad blocking.  Yes. iOS allowed that to happen and suddenly it went mainstream.  Very good point. And so this is consumers with technology pushing back  against the fact that websites were just jumping around and they were comic books.  Punch the monkey, see? Punch the monkey.

Transcript:  I think so. And I think the more people look at things like onerous terms of service too.  I mean, this comes up all the time on this week in law. Reviews aren't completely worthwhile  or not worthwhile. You still can get a good feel for it.  You have to learn how to use them.  Yeah, you have to learn how to use them. You have to learn how to use terms of service.  You have to learn how to use news, I guess.

Transcript:  And that's what I've been saying all along is that, well, once facts are plentiful, now  critical thinking becomes the coin of the realm. Except that it's kind of hard when you're inundated  with so many facts and it's so difficult to find out whether one is.

Transcript:  I think this is, according to rumors, this is the year Apple starts deleting bezels.  It'll be a bezel-less year.  I don't think that's the only thing, but I think the ratio of screen to device.

Transcript:  It's got a handle on the back, right?  Towards the end of the year, there really started to be this feeling that Apple has lost its way.  You think Apple hasn't lost its way? In fact, in 2017, we'll see a reinvigorated Apple innovate as

Transcript:  they used to. I think we have way more access to information than we used to. For example,  if we'd had what we have now when they were making the iPhone, Apple is working on a secret tablet  project. Tablet project canceled. Apple now working on a phone. Employees stuck in pizza-smelling  office building, not allowed vacation time. It would have been a mess, but now we see all  that unfolding in real time in front of us. The perception is skewed.

Transcript:  We literally could have done that with the Purple Project, which became the iPhone.  And it would have been, they were going to use Safari's interface. No, they're not anymore.  They're not using WebKit. They're creating UI. What is this UIKit thing?  Kind of back to that fact story. We know too much now. We're inundated with this.  One of the biggest questions we have going into next year is that Apple has been hugely constrained  on the Mac side by Intel and to some degree AMD. Because as much as people want Kaby Lake, those  chips still haven't shipped. So Apple can't use them. The desktop chips, they don't make them for  the smaller iMac anymore. And Apple controls their own destiny on iOS. What's going to happen  with the Mac and their increased dependency on companies? And Steve and I were talking about  this earlier. The chips aren't evolving as fast anymore. So what's that going to be?  But I think spring we'll start to see the iPads and the Mac desktops and we'll be happier.

I thought,  okay, I have a little story that very few people have heard before and we have a lot of new listeners  to the podcast since the last time we shared that. We do. And so I thought, for some people,  no one has ever heard you laugh as hard. I mean, I don't know if you were on your ball then  or how you didn't manage to fall off. You didn't know where I was going with this because you didn't  know the story either. So it was a lot of fun. And so that's what we're going to do for this season's
