Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But FrogPants.com is the home of all of the above. If you want to know more.  Hey, sad, a sad note. We should mention Roger Ebert passed away this week at a very young age, only 70 years old.  As I get older, 70 seems younger. And of course, the great film critic, the guy who became famous with Gene Siskel for at the movies and the thumbs up and all of that.  And a guy who really became a friend of Geeks because when he about six years ago suffered the loss of his jaw due to cancer, he couldn't speak anymore and ended up taking to Twitter and social media like nobody's business.  Somebody said, really, he invented social media long before this because everything was a conversation with him.  But he's he's sure fit in with our crowd. Great. And he will be much missed.

Start time: 469.00
End time: 521.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he always did this thing, which I mean, it hit me a little hard, actually, because when I was a kid in 1984, I was watching him and Gene Siskel on PBS with sneak previews and thinking, man, there's nothing else like this where I get to hear about a movie before it comes out.  This is before the Internet before any any way of finding out if anything was good or bad. And it was kind of this this really unique source.  But as time has gone on, it became pretty obvious that he was more than just a film critic who got lucky with a TV show.  He was a guy that knew when a new technology would come his way.  He knew how to tackle it and how to take it on and how to integrate it into what he already did.  And he did that with with film and TV. He did that with Twitter and did it with social media.  He has one of the most amazing Ted talks I've ever heard.  Just a just a fantastic dude. And I'm I was real sad to hear about his passing.  It's hard to read a guy's tweet like his last tweet the day before, you know, that he passed away.  That always kind of gives me the willies. And I did this time, too.

Start time: 522.46
End time: 560.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it was also hard to read his final blog post at the Chicago Sun-Times because it was so hopeful.  I think it was about a day and a half before he passed away.  And he said he was, you know, relinquishing his duties there on his daily writing and reviews.  He was going to focus on the reviews that he most cared about the movies that he longed to see.  But he had to do so many other film reviews all the time.  He was going to hand the reins over to other people.  And it was weird to see that just about a day and a half later than he passed away.  So full of hope. You know, he said he was going to continue on.  He was going to do some great things over at Roger Ebert dot com and continue to put out content on a regular basis.  And then maybe it was just the hope speaking, I suppose.

Start time: 562.48
End time: 582.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, he'll definitely be missed. So we just thought we'd mention that.  Andy Anakko, of course, one of the writers of Chicago Sun-Times, knew Roger.  And we've asked him to come on. He didn't really want to talk on the air that day.  So it was too intense. But he did write a nice blog post at his website, Celestial Waste of Bandwidth, CWOB dot com.

Start time: 583.04
End time: 606.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, his book is also really good, by the way. It is. It is fantastic.  And what I think I like about it the most is it's post his cancer treatment or when all of that was sort of happening in 2011.  And he is one of the most optimistic voices.  There's nothing in that book that says, woe is me or poor me.  It's just a lot of really sort of positive reinforcement about the kind of life he's led and why he loves film so much.  And it's it's really, really good. Yeah. Roger Ebert dot com. Go ahead.

Start time: 607.98
End time: 653.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry. And I have to say this, I tweeted out because everyone was focusing on some of the some of the last things he'd written.  But one of my favorite, one of my favorite reviews ever that he did was of Star Transformers Revenge of the Fall.  Was it Revenge of the Fall? To me, the worst movie ever made, even worse than like Plan 9 from outer space, which are sort of laughable movies.  He tweeted he wrote this great piece and he said, you know, one of the worst movies he's ever seen.  If you want if you want to if you want to see something better, go in and have a children's choir scream at you banging pots and pans together.  I mean, it is an epic, epic takedown of the Transformers movie.  If you hate that movie as much as I do, you will enjoy that.

Start time: 654.04
End time: 697.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  His pants really good. His pants were so good.  He said once of a movie, however much patrons paid to get into this movie, they'll pay twice as much to get out.  This was the best. I think the best tribute to Roger Ebert, though, was the onions obituary of Roger Ebert, which they got up within minutes.  Roger Ebert hails human existence as a triumph, calling the overall human experience poignant, thought provoking and a complete tour de force.  Film critic Roger Ebert praised existence Thursday as an audacious and thrilling triumph.  I just this really kind of summed it up.  And, you know, you don't usually think of the onion as doing, you know, heartfelt pieces.  And this was, of course, a humor piece, but it was also very heartfelt.  It's interesting, too.

Start time: 698.12
End time: 727.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You had a love-hate relationship with gamers because he was very famously sort of out in the open about how he felt like video games could never truly be art or they couldn't express art in the way that film or books or, you know, illustration or something else could.  And a lot of us, myself included, took real issue with that.  I think he argued it really well and he had very interesting points.  But I think even they would admit even these gamers are a little bit jaded by that idea are, you know, sad to see a guy like that pass.  He was still a pretty interesting voice in that way.

Start time: 728.02
End time: 742.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's a shame he didn't get to play Bioshock Infinite because I think he would have started to see the potential anyway for for gaming, really telling a story in a way that's as deep, perhaps as as a real movie.

Start time: 743.73
End time: 776.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an affecting piece of software.  Isn't that amazing?  It's amazing. Absolutely incredible.  And it's not it's the whole package, which I think is what he admired in film, which was this illusion from top to bottom.  It's this world you're never going to see.  And it's done in a way that's so polished and so well thought out and so detailed.  And there's good acting and there's good pacing and there's incredible cinematography.  The gameplay is still there, but really it takes a backseat to these other things.  And it is a weird irony that he that he died just as something you could quantify as possibly and a piece of art and video games happen to come out right around the same time.

Start time: 777.02
End time: 812.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. We're going to take a break because we should have a little buffer as we think about Roger Ebert.  But we'll come back. I do want to talk about Facebook Home.  Tim is going up and down because of his 4G issues.  If we can get him back, I'd love to.  But if not, we'll talk about Facebook Home with our guests.  Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends, Scott Johnson, Frogpants.com.  Lots to talk about this week and we'll get to it in just a moment.  But first, a word from our friends at Citrix, the makers of GoToMeeting.  Meetings are unfortunately kind of a must at work.  I've hated meetings.  Clayton, do you hate? Do you have to go to meetings?

Start time: 813.54
End time: 828.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had an executive producer once. Yeah, I had an executive producer in Los Angeles.  I had a good day.  L.A. once said to me when I was 18 years old, he said, or no, 21 years old, he said, meetings are if a meeting lasts longer than five minutes, it's worthless.  I kind of agree.

Start time: 829.64
End time: 949.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We used to do it standing up because we figured if you could stay standing up to the meeting, then it wasn't too long of a meeting.  But as you know, you got to, you know, for if you're on a TV show, you got to play on the TV show.  You got to. It's a great way to be creative, to share ideas, to solve problems.  But how do we make meetings more effective?  How do we, especially with teams spread out all over the place now, how do we make them fast, effective?  But you got to have them.  And that's where GoToMeeting is so cool.  First of all, of course, for years, they've done the screen sharing, which means we're all on the same page, even if we're in different places on a Mac, on a PC, on smartphones, on tablets.  You can join these meetings.  You can see the same screen.  And now with HD faces, you can see the people too lined up on the screen on the side or on the top.  You're interacting with them.  You're getting body language.  It's great for sales presentations.  You know what the client's thinking because you're seeing them watch your presentation.  I just I think it's a really good way to make the best use of the time that you have to spend in meetings.  And I want you to try it.  If you if you have meetings, by the way, you can now present from an iPad.  The using GoToMeeting on iPad is kind of amazing because here you are in a relaxed environment.  Maybe you're out in the garden or you're at a hotel.  You just relax.  You feed up.  You got the iPad.  You get the sound from the iPad.  You get the they're seeing you from the iPad screen and you're presenting.  It doesn't even feel like work.  It's just fun.  GoToMeeting.com.  Use the promo code.  You can try this for 30 days free.  GoToMeeting.com.  Use the promo code.  Meeting is believing.  GoToMeeting.com.  So Thursday, we talked a little bit about it before the show.  I wasn't sure.  Should we cover this Facebook event live?  Facebook set out an invitation saying, come see our new home on Android, which turned out to be literally what they were showing.  It's called Facebook Home, right?  Yeah, Facebook Home.  And it's essentially a launcher.  I mean, as far as I could tell, it's an Android launcher.

Start time: 951.47
End time: 991.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And it's as Mark Zuckerberg so I made such a point of saying it's it's revolving around people and not applications.  And just a short time ago, I guess just about an hour ago, and perhaps Tim could speak more to this.  They just launched and I was just watching it now.  Actually, Facebook just launched their television ad campaign for it, which makes you show.  May. Oh, my God.  You want to show us the airplane?  Yeah, is the airplane one where the guy sitting on an airplane?  And I think they must have like hired the Microsoft marketing team.  Oh, my God.  It's terrible. I cannot figure out.  I mean, it's a muddled mess.  I mean, to me, it doesn't tell me anything about that.  That's actually not it.

Start time: 992.91
End time: 998.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that's another one we could watch.  But there's one where the guys here has it.  Yeah, the guys get on an airplane.  Let me let me.

Transcript:  So, you know, I wonder if they pulled it down because I've just tried to launch it and shows you the chat feature.  Here we go. Play the play the audio to.  So the guy's getting on a plane.  He's holding his phone.  That's creepy.  What's up, man?  He opens the luggage bin.  There's people in them.  But, you know, nothing could be wrong with a tuba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

End time: 1126.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it has led to believe like he's relaxed now as a result of all of these weirdos jumping out at him.  I would be paranoid about all of these connections.  I've got to like this person's photo before my flight takes off.  And I don't know that, you know, I don't want to be that connected.  And I think that that's part of this.  That's part of the larger issue with this Facebook home is, you know, how connected do we need to be?  How often are we going to be connected globally?  So someone write a smart piece about, you know, while you might not be connected to your location services,  you may not be giving them authorization to know exactly where you are at every moment.  But while you're sleeping from 10 p.m.  until 6 a.m., your phone Facebook will know that you haven't left a particular location.

Start time: 1128.08
End time: 1146.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We know you're not dating.  So perhaps you'd like to see these young people.  This is a Facebook mobile page.  If you thought the ad was scary.

Start time: 1146.68
End time: 1157.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this literally like a stepping stone toward an actual phone, which has been rumored forever?  Or is this them just saying, throwing their arms up and going, you know what, that is a business we don't want to be in.  So instead, we're just going to give you a weird layer and call it good.

Start time: 1157.68
End time: 1197.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They've just well, first of all, they've denied the phone rumor forever.  And I think it's clear now that it's only a phone in the I mean, there is the HTC first,  which will be available in AT&T next week.  It's a cheap, you know, kind of ninety nine dollar mid range Android phone.  Not a great device.  And by the way, HTC mentioned and if you don't like Facebook home, you could you could just use the regular launcher.  You don't have to leave it on there.  That's the closest they got to a phone.  I think it's a good idea.  It'll be something that's very easy to install.  You just download it.  When you install the Facebook app, it will say on Android, I believe, would you like to use us as your home page?  And if you say yes, it will modify your launcher.

Start time: 1197.00

Transcript:  You'd have to launch the Facebook app.  Right. Because you can't take over the springboard.  You can't take over the homepage.  Right. And so maybe the Facebook app will look that way.  By the way, there's no buttons. There's no controls. It's a lot of swiping.  When you want to chat with somebody, you tap their head or whatever their image is, which is going to make some fun Facebook icons.

End time: 1298.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought that was interesting, too.  They made a big point about how Zuckerberg talked about how chat is broken.  And in many ways, perhaps he's right that if you're doing other things, they get in the way of the chat that you're currently having.  That it will be a persistent chat.  So you've got this little chat head that stays on the screen wherever you go above any other application that you're currently in.  So you can still see Instagram while you're in Instagram and you can move the little chat head.  It'll stick to the sides of the screen.  It'll sort of snap to the sides, which I thought was interesting.  I mean, the design is beautiful.  I have to say, I mean, I was blown away.

He, over at Macworld a few weeks ago, he had abandoned his iPhone for a while to go strictly Windows Phone.  It was pretty funny.  He said, you know, at the end of the whole journey, he wanted to create like a Frankenphone, right?  Bringing in like the best parts of all three experiences, Windows, Android, and iOS.  And I think in many ways, you're seeing some of that here.  The notifications are clean and nice.  You're getting to see that persistent information on the front screen.  Like some of the tile features that you're talking about from Windows.  That's a, we're just seeing an iPhone.

Transcript:  One thing I think is interesting that's going on with...  I don't know if you recall, there was a great Wired magazine piece maybe almost five years ago now  talking about sort of the Cold War between Google and Facebook  and Google being open, having access to all the searchable information,  but sort of the white whale of data was what was being held behind the wall of Facebook.  And now you have Facebook sharing this experience on Android.  How much of that information is available to Google, if any?

Transcript:  Right.  I mean, it struck me this week that Google has long wanted the information that Facebook had  and Facebook kept closed.  You couldn't...  You know, when you do a Google search up until, what about, two years ago,  you couldn't get any of the information that was behind that wall.  I mean, valuable data.  Think about the stuff that people are sharing on Facebook that they're not sharing on Google.  I mean, that's why we have Google+, right?  So what information...

Transcript:  I would...  True.  I think there's a lot of...  There's a lot of...  I mean, there's a lot of answering on Android.  Even if you set up a new Android phone,  I just...  I was doing something with the Galaxy Note 2 the other day.  You know, when you're setting up different apps  or you're launching different things within the Google services,  you're constantly being asked to send data back to Google, of course,  like you would in iOS 2, you know, when you first launch it.  So I wonder, you know, if...  How much of this information, if you're using Facebook information,  you're liking this cat picture.  And then, of course, we know that ads are coming, right?  Zuckerberg was very forthcoming, that ads, yes, they are coming,  which also brings up this whole Minority Report-style idea  of using Facebook...  Facebook Home in this geolocation era,  when all of these ads are sort of popping up, contextually.  How much information does Google have?  Is this a...  You know, I thought it was sort of a Trojan horse for Facebook, right?  They don't have to build their own phone.  They get to use an open platform in Android,  and they get to do this entire experience  that doesn't look anything like the Android experience,  much like the Amazon...

Transcript:  I'm glad you brought up the Minority Report connection,  because this keeps coming up lately.  There was an article, and I wish I could point to it now,  and I wish I could tell Chad where it is,  but there's an article that I just read recently  that talked a whole bunch about how the design aesthetic of that movie  was so powerful in driving designers to try to reach that,  oh, we all want this pinch and zoom and separate  and this invisible screen stuff,  that we've actually gotten to a point now  where we're implementing those design essentials,  and that it's a mistake, that it's not good design,  that it causes us all kinds of problems down the road,  and some would point to Windows 8 issues  with some of the interface stuff, with the way they've done it,  the way the Xbox 360 tries to integrate this stuff,  the way it's in other tablets, too.

Transcript:  Well, we've all tried to connect on the Xbox,  and that doesn't work very well to this and this and all this,  and it's not intuitive.  And then, of course, Leap Motion is coming out,  and those are basically Minority Report,  and Samsung, remember that bizarre launch event  that I'm sure you were at, Clayton,  where they showed that you don't have to touch the screen,  you have Minority Report-style gestures you can do in front of the screen.  So it's here, and I agree.  I don't think it's exactly what we want to be doing.

Start time: 1625.06
End time: 1668.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a question of who will suss out  and get to the point where it is the way we want to use it.  I mean, you could look at every single platform and say,  well, they've all taken pieces of those ideas and tried to integrate them,  and some are a little more flashy than others,  but one of the big kicks against Apple right now in iOS's current state  is that that really hasn't changed since 2007,  and we're all using the interface in essentially the same way all these years later.  It's a conservative road.  While everybody else is saying,  look, I can make stuff move with my hand without even touching the thing,  and that seems flashy or more interesting and more sort of cutting edge,  but the argument of this article wasn't even in favor of Apple.  It was just saying, we may not really want to go down this road,  because when we get to the end of it, we're going to go,  none of this is practical in the end.

Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. Remember what we were influenced before,  the Minority Report we were influenced by 2001,  a space odyssey, we wanted to converse with our computers,  and that didn't happen because it's hard to do,  and you look like a moron going, computer, you know, give me the...  So I don't know if Minority Report invented this  or they knew a little bit about what was already kind of coming.  I'm not sure what the genesis of it is,  but it's clearly an attempt by designers to come up with a new user interface,  the mouse, the keyboard, this is all kind of dated.  The keyboard is 150 years old, for crying out loud, wouldn't it?  And everybody thinks, well, there's got to be a better way.  If it's not voice, maybe it's gestures, maybe it's a combination thereof.  Yeah, maybe it's touch.  I have to say, when using Windows 8, which I'm doing in front of me,  of course, Microsoft had to add new ideas to gestures  to accommodate the broad variety of controls,  and the idea of everything is sweeping in from the edge,  and you close applications by sweeping down and over,  and there's just all sorts of new counterintuitive  or at least not discoverable gestures.  A lot of these are not going to make the cut.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think, I mean, there's something maybe to be said for skewmorphism in this, right?  I mean, we don't know how to...  I mean, certainly when someone's sitting down for the first time  or they go to a Best Buy and they're going to use one of these Windows 8 machines,  that's my biggest gripe against it.  Exactly your point, right?  To close an application within Windows 8,  you have to swipe down from the top of the screen,  but you don't know that because there's no trash can there  to let you know that you're swiping this away,  and it only appears...  Does it even appear when you swipe it down?  It only disappears.  Here's what happens.

Transcript:  So I've got OneNote open, I'm going to swipe down from the top,  and it's going to make OneNote get small.  Now, I can do different things.  If I sweep over to the left, OneNote now occupies a gutter,  and now I'm really confused.  If I sweep down and to the off, there it goes away.  Right.  So these are not discoverable.  I don't think people know.

You don't know that those are going to exist.

Transcript:  And Scott brings up a great point about iOS.  I wonder how many people, I mean, I'm sure, I'm positive.  No one in my family knows about gesture controls.  I mean, my wife's a tech nerd,  used to work for CNET for crying out loud.  She never uses all of the, like, five finger swipe to get between apps.  I occasionally do it, or the five pinch down,  like you're grabbing an apple out of the midair to close an application.  I don't think anyone uses those.  I'd be really curious to see the stats.  I use them constantly, but you're totally right.

Transcript:  You had to learn them.  Yeah, I read an article and said, hey, guess what?  Gestures are now on the iPad suite.  I was waiting for these.  But nobody else really cares.  I think that, honestly, I believe Apple's attempt to go more  skeuomorphic in the past to say, hey, the calendar app looks like paper,  or the app looks like real pages.  They've stuck to that motif.  I don't think because they are married to it or anything,  but I think that they believe fundamentally,  and I could be wrong about this,  but fundamentally the idea of having a trash can on the desktop  makes sense to people.  Having a folder to put other documents in  seems like a thing you could do in real life.  And they think there's some value in that from a kind of how people's  brains are trained standpoint.  That being said, I think Google's the guys that have it the right way.  This new sort of approach they have, even with their iOS apps,  this kind of flat, let's try not to make everything look like a 3D button  sort of approach, is one I think people can get their heads around  without all this trouble.  So, I mean, we're making strides, but we're going to always...

Transcript:  And to be fair to Microsoft, that's Metro too.  It's flat, no gradients, no shadows, no rounded bubbles.  Yeah, right.  And I think that that's modern.  In fact, according to some, Johnny Ive, who is a big proponent of flat  and really doesn't like skeuomorphism,  I added some syllables there, skeuomorphism is going flat in the next version of iOS.  But design is funny, design is all trendy, right?  So fins are in, fins are out, it's so...  Gradients are in, gradients are out, flat is in.  And in three years we'll go, oh, that flat was so boring.  I want chins, chins everywhere.  The real bad example is like the old station wagons with wood paneling on the side.

Transcript:  Now, you've got to give Apple credit because the first few gestures were pretty intuitive.  The idea of tapping, pinching, zooming, all of those, I think people got them right away.  In fact, you just mentioned that Miles, your two-year-old, uses the iPad fluently, right?

Start time: 2001.75
End time: 2064.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely, and this was astonishing.  He was about 12 months old, also known as one year.  And he was within a few months, maybe six, seven months old, he was already swiping between apps on the iPad,  could launch the videos app to watch, they might be Giants music videos we had on there, the kids' albums,  and could launch the videos app.  Then I handed him the first iteration of the Kindle Fire, and he handed it back to me and didn't know what to do with it.  He wanted Pad Pad back again.  He couldn't figure it out.  There's something to be said for those types of gestures you're talking about, though, which seem intuitive.  You're touching a screen, you can swipe between them,  and that's really the only time when I'm using the Chromebook Pixel where I feel like, okay, scrolling.  That makes sense for me to have a touchscreen.  I just don't feel like using the trackpad at this moment.  I'm just going to swipe up and touch here.  It does not make sense for me to do certain other gestures on the Chromebook Pixel,  but touching, pinching, zooming into a picture makes a lot of sense.

Transcript:  The problem is we need more...  If you're going to get rid of the command line, or you're going to get rid of menus and mice,  then we need more capabilities, and that's when you start having, well, you'll sweep in from the side to get the charms bar,  and suddenly it's gone from intuitive, obvious, to you've got to know where to go and what to do,  and that's back to the old days.  To me, it's as counterintuitive as the command line.  You can learn the command line.  Now, what do you think about leap motion? Have either of you guys played with that?  I haven't, no.  So the idea is it's a little square thing you put in front of your keyboard,  and you're doing some of the same gestures, but much more minority report, like you're doing it in front of the screen.

Obviously, there are some gaming applications, but mostly it's about manipulating objects.  I guess somebody using it to do 3D work in AutoCADs, like one of their MUD programs.  You can extrude.  They're actually sculpting in 3D. That's kind of awesome, actually.  It's going to be out. It's coming out May 13th.  So, this reminds me of those...  Well, here's one of those. This addresses a very specific thing for me.  As an artist and an illustrator, I have been trapped in the whole Wacom, Photoshop, high-powered MacPro Tower world for a long time,  and we're all now being told as artists and professionals, guess what? Touchscreens are the future.  Better get used to it.  But none of the touchscreen solutions are addressing the kind of meta work I have to do.  It doesn't, like you said, Leo, you don't have the control.  You got to come up with weird ways of doing old things.  And I just throw my hands up and go, look, I just need a mouse. I need a keyboard. I need shortcuts.  And I need a Wacom tablet, and I'll get your big 20 by 30 poster by midnight tonight.  Do you use a Cintiq?  I do. I have back behind me here a Cintiq 21-inch. I'm real tempted by those 24s.

Transcript:  Correct. Correct. They're 24-inch. They have two versions. One that uses a pen only for input, and the other uses both touch and pen.  And the beauty of these is they have many, many thousands of pressure points, so you can really recreate whatever sort of media you're working in.  And it's what professional artists use. It is just flat the standard, and that is how it is.  So, when, you know, as excited about tablets as I am, and I own five open this house or whatever it is,  nobody's shown me anything yet, including Adobe, including any other professional graphics packages that said,  here is a thing that could potentially replace how you work, how you really get work done.  It's what movie editors say. Everybody who works in a professional way needs some big honking machine on their desk, or at least a notebook with similar capabilities.  And that hasn't been answered yet. I don't know what the transition point for that is. I don't know what the drop-off is, but it scares some of us, like old men telling people to get off our lawn.

So, you said, Clayton, when you're reading, it's natural to scroll, and it is natural to scroll. So, to be able to sometimes touch and scroll, and sometimes use the mouse.  It's nice to have all of these, those available. You wouldn't want to always be doing that.  Right.  But once in a while, you go, oh, yeah, it just feels natural. And I think partly that's because we've all lived down at a university where we use tablets a lot.  And I guarantee you, every one of you has come to the situation where you've touched the screen on your laptop and it didn't respond. You go, oh, yeah, right, I forgot.  Right.  It's not a touch.

Transcript:  This is the Fitbit Flex. This is a demo unit version of it. It looks like Knight Rider.  You saw this at CES, of course, the demo unit's there.  This is not the final version. It doesn't close very succinctly.  They're trying to work on making it just snap very nicely.  You tap the front of it and it has a Knight Rider interface that pops up there.  You look like a Cylon.  Yeah, it has a Cylon interface. It does not have the altimeter like the other Fitbit does.  It can count how many steps you're going up.  They did some amazing technology with this and they did some really cool things.  I asked them, I've got a walking desk at home. Now I've got the treadmill.  How is it going to know that my hands, I'm walking, but my hands are just here on the keyboard?  They spent a lot of time studying and perfecting it so that even if you're just typing and you're walking,  it'll know that you're walking.  That's good.  If you're pushing a stroller, it'll know your hands are on a stroller,  but you're also getting points because it knows that you're actually walking.  It knows the difference if you're driving. It knows you're not walking.  They did a really remarkable job with that.

It's all tied to the kind of food that I'm counting using the Lose It app.  It's all in work together because Fitbit works with Lose It, so they have the partnerships there.  I like Lose It.

So their whole new dashboard is overhauled as well.  I got a sneak peek at that this week as well.  So some really nice stuff between those guys.  And I love, I really do love, I mean, on an Android device using NFC,  if you just want to check your stats for the day, you don't even need to sync it with your computer.  Just tap it.  Just tap it right on the back end. It launches the Fitbit app right there.  It shows you where you are with your steps for the day. Pretty cool.

Yeah, people were not buying the comic books.  People were not buying the Golden Age Flash.  People didn't care.  And he created that modern red and yellow Flash costume.  When DC came to him, basically, he said, we need to revive this.  Because the horror books and the crime novels were being clamped down on by the authorities.  They thought they were too lewd.  Right.  People couldn't read them.  So he revived Batman, gave them that Silver Age look, the Flash and Batman,  and really gave them that whole 20-year design aesthetic.  So we owe Carmine...  We can thank him for really saving Batman and saving The Flash.

And a lot of people don't like the Silver Age,  I think it was a crucial stepping stone.  And we talked about him on Comic Dorks the other night,  and there's a lot of reverence in the comic industry.  And most people don't even know who he is.  So, yeah, go to Wikipedia, look him up.

Neil Gaiman is doing a whole series for audible where he finds unique and unusual books and kind of they record them.

And Gaiman, who found it, said this really reminds me of early Douglas Adams.  This could have been Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  So Robert Sheckley wrote it.  It's about a guy who kind of gets well, he he's traveling through the universe.  He wins a contest, a galactic lottery.  But the problem is that he's not eligible and he's and he's going to different time periods.  And it's just wild.  They got John Hodgman to narrate it, which is wonderful.

And yeah, you plug in what you're looking for.  And it'll show you on what services it's available.  You want it on Amazon Prime.  Is it free on Amazon Prime?  Oh, that's cool.  You know, the other day I was about to buy some Justice League Unlimited episodes that I had already started investing in for my son.  And then someone tweeted me.  I wouldn't have known about it otherwise and said, Hey, by the way, there's the Justice League Unlimited, the original Justice League series, Batman, Brave and the Bold are all now available streaming on Netflix for free.

They're trying to get it here.  I'm fascinated by this because I think we're on the verge of a major, major shift in the next few years and the way in which we consume content.  So to me, very few topics are as interesting as the living room, right?  It's the it's the hours you spend with your family at night watching television.  You gather around this particular place and I think it's a mess.  It's a muddled mess right now.  And I think we're on the verge.  We're on a tipping point.  We're approaching that tipping point when how we're going to be able to consume all of this.  I know like people like to think that somehow the Apple TV is going to ride in on the white horse and save everyone.  I want the way in which we're going to be able to consume content.

Transcript:  It's nice to think that it comes from a startup.  Right.  It's nice to think that that happens.  But Apple very often, you know, takes technology a few years down the line once it's been tried out in the marketplace and gives it a shot.  But Apple has all of these suppliers tied up.  You know, Apple has these partnerships.  And so it's very difficult for some sort of startup to come in with a Pebble watch and shake things up.  Playing with the Pebble watch last week, I was woefully disappointed.  Yeah.  I could have told you that.  Yeah.

Finally, we have confirmation that VR can work and that it's cool and that we've got other technologies in place that have killed things like lag and other issues that we're going to always have to deal with.  And it's finally this viable, affordable idea.  I think it comes in forms of things like that.  Those are the things that will come along.  Oh, the way we've been doing things like tablets are good example.  That's going to change the way I compute or consume or whatever.  And I don't know who the next guy is, but Oculus Rift is just a dude who got a lot of good backing and a big Kickstarter success.  And but it doesn't change the fact that it came from a dude.  There's no reason Sony or a million other companies shouldn't have had that thing on the market first.  And they all have garbage for VR.

What's reality and what's fake?  And you kind of feel like that.  You're like, oh, my God, this is really what it's like.

That's that's what they're saying at first till you get used to it because it will cause kind of some of this disorientation.  But the other problem is there are ways to play it where the head tracking is your movement depends on the game.  Right.  But there are other games where the mouse or the controller are what are controlling your left or right or your up or down.  And when you're moving on those axes with the controller, yet you're so immersed and it isn't your head that's doing it.  They're having people get like violently ill from that.  That experience.

And then they kind of then they kind of fizzled a little bit and then they came back with the rubber soul and those in those songs, you know, top 10 number one hits number one hits.  And then everyone read them run them off.  They thought the Beatles are done.  And the press was writing about they're all done.  They're gone. They're gone.  But they were all the entire time they were in the studio recording Sergeant Peppers and everyone's like Beatles are done.  They're not touring anymore.  They stopped touring. They're gone.

So it is in a way it's iterative, but it's also kind of innovative and those sorts of things really excite me.  And they usually they're easily usually around gaming.  It's usually where these big innovations seem to pop for me.  The big question is, will the Oculus Rift become a standard display type for a lot of things that we do?  That's really an untold story yet.  And usually it's the porn industry that has to determine that anyway.  So let's see how that goes.  Wow, that'll be interesting.  Oh, will it though?

I said, no, no, you are the target audience for this.  But it's a mistake that you're the target audience for this, right?  Because he does, you know, he's like, I want to be doing Photoshop.  He's like, so I'm not the target audience for this.  But he is precisely the target audience for this.  And so am I. I need to be, you know, doing Photoshop.  So I'm going to spend $1,300 for a laptop with a beautiful screen.  I want to be able to do some things with it.  And, you know, that's why you buy a MacBook Pro with a retina display.  So you can actually do Photoshop. You actually do Lightroom.  You can actually do Aperture and you can actually do some things with it.  You're right. It's way too expensive for...  It's pretty...  To have all these hacks and workarounds for things that are just like,  just normal, just commonplace things that you come to rely on is absurd.

Transcript:  So what? A Maps program that works?  Well, I mean, like, I mean, I think you hit, I hit, you hit one of the nails  in the head, which is, well, Google and Google Voice Search in Google Now.  I mean, it's blazing fast how amazing Google Voice Search is on iOS.  And then I have to wait and sometimes, you know, not get any sort of responses.  I'm getting little purple dots that appear when I, you know, I've just transcribed  an entire paragraph of an email.  Oh, it's so frustrating.  And then it disappears.  I thought, God, why don't I just, I spent, now I'm wasting more time by hoping  that it would have responded to me than typing.  When it works, it works great.  I mean, it dictates stuff all the time and it works great.  However, the times when it doesn't, it's really frustrating.  But Google Voice Search, I mean, just how quickly you can launch,  here I have the S3.  And see, no, man, turn the volume down.  I need a pizza.  Who doesn't, by the way?  And boom, you know, all sorts of results pop up.  I need a pizza.  It's so much faster.  It's so much faster than Siri.  I mean, so software based.  I mean, that's, but that's where a lot of the iterations have come from Apple in the past.  Software, yes, they're going to update the camera.  They're going to make the processor faster.  And the overall sleekness of the device is going to be there.

Transcript:  In my opinion, Apple's problem is they set a pace for iteration of one year per phone that at the time was great  and it made consumers reassured the phone's not going to progress too fast.  Apple even made hay saying, look at all the different, you know, fragmentation in the Android market.  But what happened is they got way behind and now they cannot iterate fast enough.  And Samsung's iterating every few months.  Scott, are you an iPhone user?

Transcript:  I am.  The bump moving Ives over to essentially, you know, kind of take over the reins of iOS and all of that front end stuff,  I think is probably a good move for them.  But it also speaks to what you just said.  They're behind and they're behind because of this, their particular schedule for iteration.  Some people think iPhones come out too fast.  I would argue that it's a combination.  They're coming out too fast.  And part of the reason they're coming out too fast is because they're just making small incremental changes.  What they ought to do is give us a year between them and really go crazy.  I know stockholders won't love that and everything else, but it'd be really great to see them say, no, we've gone to the wire here on the six or whatever the next one is.  5S. Like you say, what do we expect from 5S?  I expect hardly anything.  Nothing. Nothing.  Really. There's nothing to expect.

Transcript:  Well, I don't know that NFC is the way to go.  They don't even have a wallet in there.  Last year, I was surprised we didn't see more with low powered Bluetooth.  And I know that Apple is all in on low powered Bluetooth.  And I would be really surprised if Apple puts NFC in the next iPhone.  I think they are all in with low powered Bluetooth.  I think they think they see this as a future technology.  But my fear was how are you going to get businesses, small businesses that struggle as it is, the little coffee shop,  the little bakery down the street to start getting some sort of other device that they need to then pay for  and have on their counter where they're going to have to pay a percentage of it.  They're not going to do it.  So low powered Bluetooth perhaps is the best way to do that and integrate with the things that already exist.  So I think Apple, whether or not these rumors are true about having to pull their passbook team and shake things up as we've been hearing,  they've not been happy with the results so far.  And I think it's been frustrating.  And I know that Apple PR has been trying to do some things to get the word out of a passbook.  Certainly see it with MLB.  They're trying to sort of front and center with the PR behind the MLB app.

Or when I go to that particular small airport, oh, the reason that I can use it in San Francisco at this United terminal,  but I can't use it in Knoxville is because this Knoxville terminal isn't outfitted with the scanner.  That's not an Apple's fault.  And you never know.  In Apple's credit.  Right. But you remember when you first launched Passbook?  You couldn't figure out how you were supposed to get passes into it.  You didn't realize.  You have to download all these apps.  Right. They did a terrible job of explaining.  Apple did a terrible job of explaining that you had to download the Starbucks app also.  Yeah.  And then force it to send it to Passbook.

Transcript:  I like what NG Card in the chat room says.  It says it's sad, but Apple feels like the Volvo of smartphones these days, the safe choice.  And I think there's quite a bit to that.  It's the thing. I know when I get it, I'm going to have all my apps work and any new apps are going to work.  And I'm not going to have the fragmentation the Android devices enjoy or hate, whichever, however you stand on it.  But it's getting to the point where safe is not exciting.  And when you're not doing something exciting, you start to lose market share.  And that's what's happening now.  So I think they need to shake things up with something radically different.  Maybe that means opening the phone more.  I don't know what it means, but I'm not complaining about the hardware.  Freaking love it.  I wish iOS just did more for me.

I mean, they're doing just fine.  They're making lots of money.  They're number one.  What's wrong with them?  That's fine.  But in this business, you got to stay ahead because what happens if you lose mind share, you lost it.  And so I think that they really have trouble with this 5S.  I think what's going to happen with a 5S is there's not much they can do given the way they work to make it stand out in the way they have in the past with the iPhone.  The iPhone 4 was a revelation.  Right.

You had a lot of techies jumping online to watch the live stream.  But when you had the New York Post front cover the next day saying iPhone EYE and that's the first time I've ever seen a non-Apple product on the front page of the New York Post.  Samsung Galaxy S4 that you can control with your eyes.  But these are all gimmicky things.  No one gives it.  I mean, really, does anyone care that the Samsung Galaxy S4 can be partially controlled with your eyes that when I glance away from a video, it's going to stop?

It looks like it makes it look like people are going after stuff and it makes it seem like Samsung's way ahead of this curve, even though that curve may be filled with dumb gimmicks that we don't care about ultimately, or never use more than once.  But they've got that weird energy behind it that Apple had in 2007, 2008.  You felt it.  You could feel this palpable like, oh, man, look what they have changed phones.  And they did.  They changed it.  Now they're just kind of doing the safe.  I like the Volvo comparison still.  It's a good thing you can count on.  Yeah.

Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  But he makes a really important point, which is some of these seem to me gimmicky features are really about having a story you could tell in marketing.  It's very hard to tell a story about a phone.  So it may be just one feature that you realize this is the story.  He says in this case that these what they call them Zoe's that they have they automatically makes kind of these shareable movies plus still things when you take pictures with the HTC One.  He said this you may think this is a gimmicky thing, but this is the kind of thing you can build an ad campaign around.  And that may be more important than whether it's really valuable or whether you even use it once you get the phone.

And everyone refers to not everyone, but a lot of people refer to voice voice technology and talking to your phone is Siri.  Right.  Whether or not you're actually using Google Google search or not.  Right.  You're kind of talking to Siri.  Even casual people refer to it as Siri now.  So it was a smart move.  And you're absolutely right.  And then non tech is absolutely right about that.  Being able to tell a narrative around particular feature.  If as long as it's not gimmicky, though, that's the problem.  And I think is I don't know.

Letterman called my house one time and it...  He called your house?  Yeah, because I had written him and I wanted advice in broadcasting.  I know how much of an affinity he has for broadcasting.  So I was in high school getting ready to go off to college.  I just was seeking his advice about broadcasting as it related to getting into late night, you  know, into television and so forth.  And then it was...  I knew his history so well.

If you ever walk into a Best Buy and God help you if you do, when you go into a Best Buy,  you'll notice that it's like kind of a bit of like a ghost town, right?  If you need help, you'll just see a tumbleweed roll by.  I know.  It's true.  And a cowboy will come up by in, you know, once you're going to get.  But you go over to that Apple section, and it is a beautiful section, right?  It's got that like, you know, it looks like a little mini Apple store.  It's got the hardwood tables and it's well lit.  And then you look at like the Asus tablets laying there on the table and they look like...  I don't know, it looks like a dead carp on a beach, right?  I mean, it just looks like sad.

You don't even know where the power button is on half that crap.  But Samsung, though, is doing something smart.  They're going to have their own Samsung representatives and a help desk there.  And this is smart because very often if you're asking for help on some of the Apple products,  you get some Best Buy guy who's used to dealing with Windows 8 PCs and doesn't know any of the Apple products  and how to help you with them.  So to have a Samsung sort of help desk representative standing there to help you along to make your Samsung purchase,  I think is a smart move.  Good idea.

The irony is I think this is where Microsoft is going with Windows 8.  I think RT is closer to what they wanted Windows 8 to be than Windows 8 Pro is.  They want to go touch.  Did you see the picture of Bill Gates and Paul Allen at the Computer Museum?  Recreating their famous picture from the earliest days of Microsoft.  This is from 1981, a baby faced Bill Gates, who I think is 26 in this image.  He looks like he's 15.  And Paul Allen. And these were late model Commodore Pets and Apple IIs and late model computers.  At the Living Computer Museum, they got Bill and Paul back together with the same computers.  This is kind of cute.  And there they are.  I think that's sweet.  Gates still weighs 130 pounds.  Same haircut.  Yeah, actually the haircut is the same, isn't it?  Paul at least shaved the beard.  I like that. There's something about that.  It's because I'm a grumpy old man and now they are too.

Transcript:  I wonder what Fox thinks about this.  The Areo legal victory.  Barry Diller created this company, Areo, which kind of...  It seems like an interim company.  The idea was you could get local television  because you bought a dime-sized antenna and an array of dime-sized antennas  that would then connect to the Internet and you could watch TV via this antenna.  Of course, local stations that didn't get any money for this said,  hey, wait a minute, that's copyright violation.  Well, now the courts have said, no, it's not.  CBS, Comcast, News Corp, PBS, Walt Disney Company, you're out of luck.  Areo is legal,  which means now that I think we're going to see Areo all over the country.  It's a weird technology, but I've used it.  You must have used it, Clayton, because you're in the New York area.  It works.  Yeah, and it works very, very well, by the way.

Start time: 7119.10
End time: 7149.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so cool.  And it's remarkable how well it works.  You can even use the web apps.  You can launch mobile Safari on your iPad, navigate right to the app.  And in the New York area, of course, you can get access to, I think, 20 different channels.  So you get some weird Pakistani channel, you get some weird Taiwanese channel, you get some all you get all kinds of weird.  It's all the over the air stuff, right?  But then you get great live sports.  Of course, you get all the broadcast channels, PBS, high definition.  It looks beautiful.  And you can leave town.

Start time: 7149.24
End time: 7152.54

Transcript:  You can you could come here and you could still watch your New York sports.

Start time: 7153.04
End time: 7227.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And so here's the deal.  I'm up a Tinky Wiggy and I can just I can just stream it over Airplay right to an Apple TV at a different location.  I could come over to your house and Petaluma and I could stream the New York stuff based on my subscription to on Airplay.  And it looks crystal clear.  So you could watch local news.  You can travel with it and go wherever you go.  Yes, you can watch it on the app that's coming.  You can watch it on the web and you can watch it on your TV.  And there's no restriction as far as Airplay goes.  It's yours.  You're paying 12 bucks a month.  And of course, the argument was that why is this any different than the antenna that I could put on my roof?  Of course, the broadcast companies were saying, well, wait a second, we're creating this content.  Now this now this this intermediary company is coming along and they're going to make money off of our content by selling you a twelve dollar subscription.  So I don't think it'll be very long until CBS has a little den of antennas set up in Brooklyn somewhere.  Right.  Why wouldn't they?  Well, why wouldn't they charge 12 bucks?  Right.  Why wouldn't be us two in New York City decide to set up their own version of this or maybe a CBS corporate decides to do the same thing?  I don't know.  The same thing with apps.

Transcript:  It's so smart that Barry Diller thought, you know, if everybody has an antenna, then it's not a cable service.  It's one person and you're just renting an antenna.  That's all we're charging you for.  Really.

Start time: 7265.04
End time: 7287.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's cool.  You can DVR the content to write.  So you're renting an antenna and we will record your favorite shows up to 40, I think it's 40 hours of content.  So if you want to watch the PBS NewsHour and you're just not home to watch it on time, and I love that, I don't want to wait for the podcast version of it.  Just DVR it on my aerial account.  I can come home.  I can watch it anytime I want on my iPad.  I'm not home.

Start time: 7299.92
End time: 7360.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think this is one of those transitional steps right now that we were talking about earlier.  And this forces the broadcasters' hands.  Absolutely.  Because if I want to, let's say, and I'm curious how this will work, right, because we only have the New York market.  And I'm fascinated by how this is going to unfold with Aereo because I love the Philadelphia Phillies, as you know.  So right now I pay for whatever it is, $150 a year for the MLB.TV app on my iPad and on Apple TV.  Well, what if I got an Aereo account in Philadelphia?  Could I do that?  And I'm sure people will.  Right?  Of course you can.  So I get an Aereo account.  But if I got an Aereo account in Philadelphia and then I'm able to watch the Phillies for $12, not $140 a year.  Of course, it's the whole season.  So maybe it comes shakes out.  I don't know.  But you know what I mean?  I don't know how this is all going to shake out.  But I could be getting creative with where I'm getting my content from.  Do I want to get Phoenix News?  Because I used to be from Phoenix and I live in New York City now.  Can I do that?  Yeah.

But AMC, when Breaking Bad airs, I can get the latest episodes of Breaking Bad and The  Walking Dead.  But I can't get on demand justified.  I have to pay for it.

Transcript:  Well, and I think companies like Aereo are temporarily going to do fine.  And what it's going to do, it breaks the model so thoroughly that they tried to fight it  in court.  If they can't fight it in court, then they just have to change the model.  Game of Thrones was on BitTorrent within a few hours of its airing last week, the premiere.  160,000 simultaneous peers.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You either criminalize it and freak out and threaten everybody.  You like us.  You really like us.  Because the truth is that is that is a sign of tooth.  One that everyone really likes Game of Thrones and two, it's really hard to get HBO without  having a huge cable package you don't want to pay for.  Torrent Freak estimated that a million downloads of Game of Thrones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Why not?  And it's just ridiculous that HBO doesn't do that.  I'm curious, Scott, your setup, because again, I'm fascinated by this and I know that I was,  I had that sort of aha moment.  I know that Andy and I was talked about this on Mac break weekly trying to arrive at that  100 point and we're not there yet.  Right.  We want live sports.  We want all of this content.  One spot.  We're not there yet where we have one device that can do it all for us.  But I have to tell you, when I got that little live dongle that stuck on the back of the  boxy box, I think it was boxy live or whatever it was.  And you just plug it in the back.  You plug it right into your cable and you get live television.  HD looks beautiful.  And you're getting those 20 channels you would get for for $12 a month from Aereo, but you're  getting them for free.  But then you have on the boxy box, you have the ability to launch MLB, launch Netflix,  launch YouTube, hundreds of apps, that sort of thing.  And it's a little clunky and so forth.  You know, it's like a year old, whatever, a couple of years old.  But that I had that sort of jaw dropping moment where I thought, well, yeah, this could be  really cool.  I can flip between live television.  Then if I want to jump over and use the sling box app, I can use that to watch some cable  programs.  So I don't know.  That was my sort of, wow, this could actually happen.  What is your setup like?

Transcript:  Well, it's a little I call it Mad Max, the Mad Max approach.  I mean, I'm definitely it's goofy.  So I'm getting justified date next day on iTunes.  That's how I get justified.  I get other shows day of if they'll let me on different apps or different whatever.  I've got a Roku running a whole bunch of stuff.  We get a lot of Netflix content in the house.  That's really what my kids subsist on is Netflix content.  But it's this combination of all right, well, Hulu has that one.  Amazon Prime has that one.  I'll get this other one off iTunes and I'll put it on Apple TV and this other one to watch  in bed on my iPad anyway.  So I'll just subscribe to that through whatever app.  And it is a hodgepodge and it's not ideal.  But I have never once regretted the move.  The only regret I have is no live sports and I have an antenna for that.  So I do get that when I need live stuff or local news stuff or the Oscars or something  like that where it's a big deal and I need to cover it for show or whatever.  So I can get it those ways.  I just hate that it's so fragmented.  It's all over the place where I get my stuff.  That's the problem right now.  And I'm not even saying that one day we need to have one solution fits all.  I just need, you know, I think I need all the companies to have the same philosophy  that I'm willing to buy your content the way I want to buy it.  Please give me avenues to do that.  And then I think we're almost to the 100, like you mentioned.  But I don't regret it. It's great.  I get everything I want.  Some of it I have to wait for.  Some of it I don't.  But I get what I want.  I get it when I want it.  And, you know, I can I can subsist and it's not a problem.

You're not supposed to do that.  The point of it is to get beyond the point of verbalizing it.  Just absorbing the information.  You absorb the information.  Your comprehension will go up.  We've had professors writing us, telling us that they have their entire class downloading it,  and they're reading Jane Eyre.  And I'm like, how are you doing that?  We don't have books available yet.  They're literally importing it chapter by chapter,  and they're blazing through these like 500-page books as a result of it.

How are you?  What are you using?  I used actually an independent dude who built it on top of my WordPress install.  Oh, interesting.  And he's amazing.  His name is John Funk.  And he just did incredible work to make it just easy breezy.  Great new design.  I'm really happy with that.  That's at my extra life dot com, which will link all the fog pants dot com.  But more importantly, the thing that's going on right now, that's the big deal.  We just finished a successful Kickstarter for the big nerd event.  I throw for frog pants listeners and fans and followers every year.  And many Twitter favorites are always there.  We got Veronica Belmont, Tom Merritt will be there.  Brushwood will be there.
