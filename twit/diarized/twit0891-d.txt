There's like an overarching plot that's developing slowly  So I think you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of the individual volumes  As it goes along without worrying too much about like, oh no, will the series ever be finished?

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm starting the show with some light material because we're gonna get pretty heavy  right off the bat  we talked about this on Wednesday with  our wonderful Mike Manzik from tech dirt who has really kind of burst a socket on this  Children's online safety bill that was just passed in California. We're waiting  For the governor to sign it into law  It seems like a good idea who wouldn't want to protect children online  And of course if you're not in California you're probably thinking you can take the rod pile lower third  There is no  Oh  He's lost control of the lower third

Transcript:  They'll be coming later  None of you are in California, right Dan? Are you in Cal? I can't remember you are Dan, Massachusetts, Massachusetts  That's why your window is open if you were in California  I'm down now. It's about a hundred and nine degrees outside  Yeah, and you guys don't believe in air conditioning, right? Yeah, that's that's the funny thing is people in California say well  we have natural air conditioning until it gets hot and then  So this is maybe not on your radar but it sure is for us in California Mike Manzik was also  California the New York Times story about this you would never you know think there was a problem the  California age-appropriate design code act  Requires any webs unlike COPPA  Where it only affects websites that are aimed at children?  This is a website any website that might have somebody under 18 visited  Which I think is any website certainly ours certainly Mike Manzik's  So if you have the potential that somebody under 18 might visit your website then you are required to  First of all know the age of everybody who visits your website  problem number one  That's pretty intrusive. We don't know the age of anybody who listens to our shows or visits our website  I don't want to know their age, but in order to  Enforce this law. I need to in fact Mike's concern was oh  Am I gonna have to do age verification and  If I do how am I gonna do that?  He says it may be face ID  You may have to start because you've got to know  You've got to know how old these people are then you have to look at every single feature of your site and do  What they call it a DPI a  Kind of like an environmental impact  Kind of like an environmental impact report on each feature of your site and how it might infect people under 18  And that has to be of you have to do it because it has to be available should the Attorney General of California ask  You have 72 hours to produce that

Start time: 1021.32
End time: 1090.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This surely feels like the kinds of rules that go into effect in countries that are trying to prohibit speech or  Use workarounds like you know India has imposed laws, and you know Russia's opposed more more draconian ones and even India  ostensibly a democracy has imposed laws that that restrict freedom in the name of safety or  Freedom from libel or other things and they're meant to chill speech and this isn't per se designed that way  But it has all the hallmarks of one. It's expensive  Or impossible to implement. It's probably I'm not a lawyer  It's probably unconstitutional based on what I'm reading does not seem to fit within the permissibility of  You know how this could possibly be enforced so the the bar the burden is undo and it's chilling of speech  And so you're kind of like well. How did it get this far?  I think Mike pointed out in his articles like well nobody wants to you know you were saying oh  No, I'm opposed to protecting children online. Yeah clip that out what I just said. Yeah, glad relation was opposed  I'm not I'm not but no one's gonna vote no politicians gonna say I'm voting against the protecting children from terrible things online bill  Exactly, you know which is why it passed in the Senate 30 to nothing

Start time: 1092.36
End time: 1136.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't we don't we do this every few decades  I mean I'm remembering when I was a teenager the Communications Decency Act was a big sort of hot-button issue at the time  Which you know that was the the heady days of?  1996 or so right where the internet was not at all what it is today  But there was still the sort of the same idea like oh, we've got to figure out a way to flag  stuff that might be  objectionable so that people aren't exposed to it and  Ultimately, I think it ended up being sort of impossible to deal with because how do you do that right?  How do you do that on the internet?  How do you control for that kind of information if you can't even control for it in you know other public sphere spaces?  It seems I agree with Glenn it seems like an unduly onerous task for people who are you know otherwise trying to be law abiding

Transcript:  Actually the CDA ended up having a positive impact Ron Wyden said you know what we're gonna have to  Make an exemption here for social media and other sites in the section 230 was written and thank goodness go ahead

Start time: 1149.78
End time: 1210.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry Paris. I was saying I think the thing that sticks out to me is I mean how  Are we expecting all of these different sites or service providers to be able to identify with certainty?  Whether or not the person accessing your website as a child  I mean obviously we have currently kind of a tracking tools you can look at website analytics and see the demographics of your users  but a lot of social media sites and  providers generally are kind of making their tools in a way that  purposefully ignores anybody who could be under 18 because you don't want to deal with that sort of data and  Let's say even if you somehow devised a perfect way to  Send a flag up when any cell phone owned and operated by someone under 18 access to your website  That still wouldn't cover situations where like most kids are probably using their parents iPad or parents phone for these sort of things  it just seems like a very technical question that is  Being answered by like kind of a very vague Blake blanket order

Start time: 1212.12
End time: 1220.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's designed to impose enforcement right it's designed to be violated  Unintentionally and easily and thus allow government to intervene

Start time: 1221.24
End time: 1251.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and Mike raises that issue in fact he was told I think by the sponsors of the bill well don't worry that  You know the California Attorney General decides who's prosecuted  And one would don't worry and one would hope that the AG would say well  You know twit or tech dirt or the information yeah 18 year olds read it  But it's not they're not a threat to 18 year olds the AG would get to decide but as Mike points out  Well what if I write an article that's critical of the California Attorney General which he does a lot apparently

Start time: 1252.58
End time: 1257.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then then what happens is it what if this law goes to effect in Texas, and you write something critical of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  General yeah, I mean a lot of times cases like this too. I feel like on duly target. You know people in  Community like such as the LGBTQ communities to write where it's like well what is considered objectionable content right?  This is the kind of thing we're running into with the book bannings that are popping up all across the country  Is that you know you have governments and local like you know city and municipality governments that are like well  I don't want my kid exposed to this so I'm gonna you know  Try to enforce the local school library to get rid of these books because I just don't agree with them  So who gets to decide you know?  Certainly what falls under objectionable content and how exactly that gets protected the other weird thing about this bill

Yeah, we really want to follow their lead because they know what's they know  It's right is this Cory Doctor was written so effectively about the failures of the UK

Start time: 1348.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he lived there for a long time  Is this ignorance on the part of lawmakers like they're meaning they want to do the right thing and they you know they they just don't  Understand the impact of what they're doing or is it some sort of malevolence?  Certainly the Baroness seems to have some sort of malevolence against the open internet  Do you think there is a trend it feels like politicians these days?  It's not merely to protect the children. They want to take down big tech. They don't like it

Start time: 1378.56
End time: 1436.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean something that I think about a lot is as part of my job and all of our jobs  We end up watching these big tech hearings that we had a free couple of months  Over the last couple of years and as I remember the first couple that I watched I was like oh  This is gonna be interesting, you know an actual like political discussion about what's going on was not that it is mostly just politicians  giving a  one minute stump speech  totally unhinged or  Unrelated to the thing they're actually discussing and I think that's what we're seeing here in some ways is it is partially ignorance  but partially a lot of like modern-day politicians have realized that  The way to get attention from your base or these sort of people that you want to bring into your base is by making big bold  statements like bringing down tech, you know making all the children safe  regardless of whether or not that  Actually has any teeth in it and it will the end result of that is sometimes you get policies like this that

Transcript:  Can have disastrous unintended consequences. There's a there's both a carrot and a stick  There's the the threat the fear that sound bite will be used against you. Oh, he's against protecting children online  But there's also the carrot that it makes a great sound bite that might get you some votes if you say yeah  She's she's really she voted to protect the kids online. So  It's the promise sound bites. It's just posturing

Start time: 1465.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think a lot of the there is ignorance at the base of it too because I think it also  Presupposes this fallacy that there is somehow a switch in flip that will protect  You know make it per the system perfectly functional in a way that protects children, right?  Like we entertain this idea that like oh well technology can solve this issue for us, right?  And that we just you know, technology is very black and white one and zero and it's like well, you know  It can obviously predict and tell you whether or not you're able to consume this information  But that's you know, I think it's Paris point out. It's very difficult to know who is consuming this information  I think also about things like libraries that have you know computers available for people to access the internet  Who don't might otherwise not have you know ways to do that?  How do you tell who's using that right?  Like how do you tell who's on the other end of that?  So I think it people think tech is very clear-cut when they don't know anything about it  But they you know anybody who spends time with it realizes like now this is extremely nuanced and there's a lot of gray area

Transcript:  This brings me back to the whole well  There's two things one is the overarching issue is that I think we probably all agree  I won't speak for other people  But I think it's likely that we know that the big social media companies and other companies in most cases are  Failing to protect children online. They're doing things that are actively bad for children  They don't seem to have any compunction about it and no one has an idea of precisely how to stop it except through public disclosure  whistleblowing  threats by legislators  There's no compulsion particularly in countries with expansive free speech laws and commercial speech laws  People feel impotent to solve that problem  So we know there are problems Instagram used to promote eating disorders there and they've made great strides in that but you know  There's just all of this all this negative content aimed at children  Algorithm fed often that has some kind of beneficial effect  But it also reminds me damn what you were just saying of when they kept talking about I think it was the Clinton administration  Later keep trying to bring this up like well  What if we had a special key that only law enforcement could access only in very particular cases  Otherwise the encryption would be perfect and protected, you know, they're talking about end-to-end encryption  It's like well, there's no way to build an algorithm like that and every encryption expert in the world agrees  But nobody on the political side wants to accept that they don't want to accept the technological problem  That you can't have a system with a key that only legitimate parties can use same thing here is how do you prevent?  Harm to children which is active and underway without also chilling speech  I was terrified for my children as they grew up in this environment and fortunately  I think we managed to avoid, you know any significant problems  But I'm sure we all have stories or know people have stories of children being you know  Harassed online or singled out or groomed or so forth. It's just a  Massive problem made worse by many of these companies

Start time: 1633.08

Transcript:  also people don't want to hear that the the  Hard solutions to this problem are awful often ones that require like societal change and work rather than just technology which can solve it  At the you know, snappier fingers, right? Like you're like, oh, there's a shortcut. We just make the technology do that, right?  And yeah, nobody wants to think about the fact is like no that's that's a band-aid and it's not a particularly good one  It's a band-aid on a gushing, you know the amputated arm or something. It's not gonna fix your problem

I think they would bridle at those kinds of restrictions as they should  We don't want to design the world for people under 18

Even right like, you know  First of all kids at different ages have different levels of maturity and different levels of appropriateness at 13 year old and a 17 year old  They're gonna have very different levels of what they think is appropriate  I mean, I definitely went to you know rated-r movies as a 17 year old and probably with my parents  You know went to rated-r movies younger if it was like a serious  Topic or something like that. But yeah, how do you how do you deem what is appropriate?

Here's the content not to censor the content  So I'm not sure the rating I think the ratings I think kind of worked  I don't know. Would you want to rate every website on the internet and say this website rated are I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know if that's appropriate either. Yeah, who would do it? I mean the motion picture right?  Association of America had  Reason to do it. I mean a lot of organizations a lot of trade groups grew up specifically to address  Preventing regulation from going into effect by voluntarily adhering to standards right enforcing the code and yeah, yeah, right  And so who wants a law but but in this case, I think you know, how do you protect?  children  Even from there's some very coarse things like how do you protect predators or you know, I have this discussion a lot  It's not that there are so many predators in the world  I want to believe that the number of people who are pedophiles and active predators against other people is a relatively small percentage of a  Humanity a very small percentage. I want to believe that too. I'm not sure that that's the case, but I want to I don't know either  Well, let's pretend let's pretend is the case briefly but say that the Internet is an amplification force  So it doesn't matter if it's one in a hundred thousand people or one in a million is out after children if they can access  Ten million children and winnow it down and find one near them or that they can reach out to it's a it's a  Yield issue and so online services need to impose their own protections that reduce that yield potential  And that's where I think things are failing is I don't think they have a motivation to do it. There's no financial benefit  There's no regulatory framework and they haven't yet suffered significantly  From it. So when there's backlash like there was a lot of backlash against Facebook for all the revelations from oh, I forgot the  group in England  Yes, thank you right so they had backlash it seemed like it affected their market price  There was the threat of a lot of regulation there were open hearings, right?  But I don't think we've seen the same concerted effort that's gone  into  the sort of diffuse  Choices that have led to children being endangered occasionally something will leap up and Facebook will say oh, okay  We're gonna disable all contents on our comments on videos uploaded by people under 18  Or didn't they just say they're going to make all uploaded videos private by default on YouTube  If you're under 17, yeah, right so these band-aids, but they do it only in response to the most  Outrageous stuff so it's possible this law being passed. Maybe it gets signed  It's held up instantly in the courts. Obviously you can imagine every giant tech company files for an injunction  And it takes years to resolve conceivably. I also by then can imagine every every state legislature. Well at least Texas

Transcript:  Vague way this brings up something and you added this link to the rundown  Glenn I wasn't going to talk about it, but I think it's appropriate to talk about it, which is  The the battle between cloud flare and kiwi farms, which is a horrendous  Horrific website. I don't even want to mention the name of because it's really been used to dox people to target people to swat people  By the way, both political persuasions. It's just a nasty nasty site cloud flare was protecting it  with their DDoS services  and  Or as early as recently as a couple of days ago Matthew Prince said we are not gonna stop protecting him  That's what we do. We don't judge  We just protect these, you know websites and everybody has a right to speak  They changed his mind I think under incredible pressure, but he says also because we see so many  dangerous

That's well known  they're already they already commit or are victims of domestic partner or  Familial violence and so you keep seeing these things writ large  So it's like they're they find the weakest target which right now is trans people remain a vulnerable target worldwide and  They attack them because they feel like they will get the most support from even people who otherwise would be negative  But then you know it's always about violence  So they go after Marjorie Taylor Greene for who knows what reason totally unacceptable that they would do this  But her family at risk whatever you think about her obviously, but they don't have any discrimination  So you think I always go back to that like they came for you know  They come for one group first, but they're always gonna come for another another another and you're always gonna be in one of those groups

Transcript:  It's a means that's the issue more than anything right? It's not it's how they're going about it, right?  I mean I think about this too when I see stuff in the politics realm where people are like oh if this happens  There'll be violence in the street and again to Glenn's point  You never hear the people who are about inclusiveness and diversity being like ah there'll be violence in the street if there's not  Inclusion and diversity no that's not how it works  So yeah, it's about the means of how you're going about I have a I have a friend who has actually been targeting by these kinds  Of people and it is truly horrific the kind of things that they have done  You know in order to try and basically just shut these people up and harass them into silence like or for often for very little  Provocation at all other than they just feel like doing it so yeah, I don't know I'm glad that cloud for flair make this decision  It's a shame  It took them so long, and it's you know not gonna solve the problem, but it's a step in the right direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the thing I've seen said which I think is is worth repeating is that  freedom of speech freedom of expression is  Can be suppressed by people who are also engaging in freedom of expression so when cloud flair says we're about you know  maximalist free speech  We don't want to suppress anybody because then governments come to us and tell us to take human rights groups off the internet  Which to me seems like a spacious argument to begin with there's a bright light difference  This is  Yeah, like if your groups are advocating violence and doxing people and said in involved in the coordination of harassment and abuse  That's quite different than a group saying this government's committing you know human rights violations  but the fact is these groups that are commit harassment are  Decreasing the amount of freedom of speech of other people and I think there has to be a balance when you're dealing with extremists  you can say like  People some people are never going to like trans people. They're never like the concept that  Jewish people exist or whatever and I I mean I can live with that I can't I don't try to live with that  but it's like I I accept that people may have bigoted ideas or  Terrible ideas that affect me and my family and my community my country whatever I can accept that but facilitating them to  coordinate activities that are intended to suppress speech and  Harm lives that is a very bright line  And I just it suppresses my ability expresses everyone around me's ability to to be able to have their own version of free speech

Transcript:  The cord violence is certainly one of the lines. I think that it also shouldn't be a  Terrible thing if you have a group of people where they are actively coordinating to harass others and  Do you want to actively coordinate a group of people to say hey business that's making money from this group  Protecting them. We think that's a bad business relationship. You should be allowed to do that  I think that's not a big deal and if cloudflare is  Deeply annoyed and frustrated by it.

Yeah  So Twitter has built a machine that creates main characters the day sometimes multiple ones and the issue is a right wing  Accounts typically but sources accounts that want to encourage  Harassment up to the point of violence and real harm. They have figured out how to leverage the Twitter main figure of the day  algorithmic  Feeds so that they can cause harm by fluttering butterfly wings, right?  So they can say something that isn't directly doesn't meet any kind of First Amendment test even of imminent harm  It doesn't meet Twitter's direct tests about incitement to violence or commitment of hatred of speech, but they are hate speech, but they  They surface up these accounts like libs of tic-tac-tac  surface up people who are absolutely innocuous and make them the the  Is that the five-minute hate figure? What's it?  Yeah, actually for and everybody in the world who is of that ilk gets that amplified out to them through the mechanism of Twitter  and then other subsidiary mechanisms and  That person becomes a subject of this for no there's no reason it should happen.

It's been tough tough few years  From supply chain issues increased demand business owners have to manage  The businesses that are thriving right now are the ones who are forward-thinking, and that's why I love podium  Po I you know there are a number of businesses in our area that use podium and when I love it  I'll leave the my dentist and they as I'm leaving I get a text message saying you don't forget your appointment is  coming up in six weeks or whatever and  or maybe would you like to leave a review on Yelp or  You know that kind of thing podium helps your small business stay ahead of the curve with modern messaging tools  That make it easy for your customers to connect with your business  And we have this one thing we learned during the pandemic no one wants to make a phone call  Texting is it a lot of people hate calling a business? I don't care if it's a plumber a landscaper  I hate playing phone tag if if I could just send a quick tech text message and get a text message back  I know that's that's the way to do it well  That's what podium does if you're running a business and the only way to get in touch with you is a phone number attached to  An answering machine or a service you're probably losing customers podium gives businesses the tools to compete  With the convenience that you know big businesses have known about for a long time  From healthcare providers to plumbers over a hundred thousand businesses are texting with customers through  podium and and by the way  Not only do customers love it you will love the results one car dealer sold a truck  It is for text messages a jeweler sold a ring and coordinated curbside pickup did it all through texts and the customers?  Love it a dentist had a bunch of outstanding payments. He'd been sending a mail  You know trying to he sent out payment requests through text got 70% of the outstanding collections in just two weeks  Because it works. I don't remember, but the open rate. I think on text is well over 90%  It's though it's the number one way to reach people because it's effective with podiums all in one inbox your employees will love it, too  It all goes into the inbox and you could do more than just chat you can get online reviews by sending an easy-to-use link  You can collect payments send marketing campaigns I get and I'm ashamed to say it really works  I get our local ice cream parlor every few weeks.

We thank him so much for supporting  this week in tech  He I loved this story, but it's actually kind of a deeper question  He won a fine arts competition  But was it cheating this is a?  Colorado State Fair digital digital category the the digitally manipulated photography category  Jason Allen won beating 20 other artists blue ribbon $300 prize  With an artwork he created through mid-journey, which is one of the new  Generative art tools that are just taking off somebody said it's a Cambrian explosion of AI art, and I think that may be  May be accurate  The portrait beautiful portrait  Looked like Renaissance art although if I when I look at it I can tell that that's that's that's AI generated  I mean, that's not that's clear  To me, but maybe the judges didn't have as much experience with this stuff is it fair  To I mean he says well, I wrote the prompt  And then he imported in Photoshop and fixed it up a little bit so

I don't know  It's hard to I find it hard to ding them on that even as someone who you know  Writes creatively and I feel like if an AI wrote a book and that book won a competition  Be a little miffed, but I also don't know that that would just probably make me a hypocrite that like you gotta hand it to it

Transcript:  I have a degree in art doesn't make me  Better informed on this but I had studied a lot of art history as part of that degree and one of the courses  Looked at the concept of connoisseurship, which is how?  Art is evaluated for its quality, right?  So both by like, you know price but also how do you evaluate pieces of art and say this is better or worse?  or this is a master work and so forth and  I think that this actually gets into that, you know  Very abstruse little thing like connoisseurship is that there are you know, this whole thing about kitsch, right?  kitsch was a concept developed developed by a Clinton Greenberg like I don't know thinks 80 years ago to describe art that was  Predigested you looked at it and it required no interpretation  He was talking about a Soviet art and other art that was super pedagogical and designed to just be the kind of you know  Pabulum to the masses you looked at it's like this is the message right and that the opposite of kitsch is something that requires  You know this interpretation you look at it and there's a perception and it was you know, Jackson Pollock and all the people doing  abstract impressionism data isn't before it surrealism and then  Pop art and later movements they all rely on this impression that art is something beyond  Just looking at a thing and saying that's a picture of a cake, right?  So I'm sorry to get so deep in our history stuff here  But it applies because you're like on what basis of the judges evaluate this are the components that they evaluated as being winning work  Ones where they were mistaken things that they should have actually been looking at more carefully or is it justified?  Does this work actually because of the sources in which it derives and how the algorithm has recombined it?  Does it make it justifiably something that you can compare and use that kind of stewardship today?  This is actually equivalent to other work of this caliber

Transcript:  Or is it just prettier is it pretty I will say we do need to see what the other  Art works competing work because maybe they all really sucked. We're not considering that  To if we're if we're looking at this from an art history  perspective, I think  AI-generated art would be a very futurist  Like peace like this is kind of what the early futurist movement like around impressionism  Was talking about which is that you know art is not precious art can be fast art is like movement and technology  And if in this case art is typing in a couple words in a screen

Transcript:  That's art, baby. I actually go beyond that. I think that the  Skill involved in typing the prompt because it isn't usually just a few words  It's usually elaborate and you often refine it is a form of computer programming  And I think maybe the future of computer programming as we interact with machines with AI  You know computer programming up to this point at you very specific the computer is going to do exactly what you said no more no less  But this is now the new the new way of communicating with a computer. It's more of a conversation  I think that that's actually the new form of programming and I think we're gonna see in a lot of areas

It's really interesting guy great  yeah  and very funny guy and I think  Interesting user of technology and he is constantly publishing instead of writing probably his mid-journey queries onto Instagram  You're like it's so beautiful  Sometimes it's hard for me to believe this could be any kind of amalgamation that it's not directly from a source  Here's some this is not that image.

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know  There's always something very tempting in this to me to as somebody who has very little like visual arts skills whatsoever  And has done some work with like, you know stock photos making some book covers for stuff  Self-published I mean the idea that you could generate art  That would be not just a stock photo that you've sort of manipulated or work with like I don't know  it's it's an attractive option because  there's no way in a million years that I would get the skills and  Develop them and have time to like sort of spend all the time it required to get to this point  Does it mean it's taking jobs away from like people I could be paying to do that? I don't know. That's an interesting question  Questions I think work it's complicated. I

Start time: 3890.64
End time: 3938.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was saying I think where it gets complicated is I've seen a lot of major media publications as of late come under fire for  Using like lead images and stories that are generated by mid-journey or Dali or something like that  When it's like this is the sort of illustration that typically these publications are paying a couple dozen different  Freelance artists any given week or month to create I think the Atlantic's  Charlie Warzell had recently gotten some hot water because he had he has a small budget for his newsletter  So he's already just using stock images  Illustrations, but he had used the most horrifying photo of Alex Jones at a newsstand generated. I think by mid-journey  and it was I  Mean people were quite upset about it

Start time: 3939.60
End time: 3945.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3945.52
End time: 3982.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that people  Seeing it without context saw it and they were like  Oh the Atlantic a publication that has a lot of money and typically is going to be paying and working with illustrators is using an  artificial intelligence powered system to create their lead artists like if the Atlantic is doing it  What is stopping any other publication I mean  I think this is a little bit of a different case because he had a follow-up newsletter  We explained I just run my small newsletter and have a very limited budget  But I do think that it begs some question when you're talking about larger publications  Does it devalue?

Start time: 3982.74
End time: 3992.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it devalue the work to write because if you know if you write a freelance illustrator and you're like, well  Here's my rate and they're like, well, we could just go to an AI and plug in a few words. Oh get the by the way

Transcript:  As a musician I know told me the most horrifying thing  Horrifying phrase I've ever heard about creativity a few years ago. She said I'm competing against all  Music ever published now and I think that might be what terrifies artists and rightly so as a writer. I'm slightly terrified  Because I don't it's funny. I don't it's not like it's easier to do art  But it's harder to get a corpus to produce say a news article or analysis of a contemporary thing or even a description of something  Because that you have to have a deep corpus but with art the corpus is all art ever created  And so every time a rabbit appears in anything that could be fodder for an AI to use so it's it's really the sheer amount  Right. It's the training set. So I don't think someone's can write an article about  I don't think an AI could write a  feasibly credible article now or in the next few years about an  person entering an AI generated piece of art

There were those ones  I can't remember what the library was but what was there was a thing recently where it would generate a story if you in the  Same sort of way you'd tell write a story in this way  I know because our pal Lex Friedman did it like oh write a description of this podcast and it was  You know surprisingly good again, and I think the biggest you might have featured that yeah  I don't know. I think not now maybe but I wouldn't discount it for the future and I think  This is is this argument  Is this argument are you ultimately moot because it's like well the the genies out of the bottle like once it's out there

Transcript:  Can't stop it. It's done. So yeah comes down to right like the source material the training set to me becomes the issue  We were talking about that on this very podcast with Christina Warren  and who couldn't talk about it because she works for Microsoft and  the copilot product some weeks ago because that's the same thing is like who if if they're a public  You know this art isn't even public right some of it is art that's copyrighted, but it was

Transcript:  So Andy bio did a very interesting study  He this is a waxy org he stable to unlike Dali to  Open AI does not release the training set so we can't see where that came from because stable diffusion is open source  You know where it came from where the training set came from he says we indexed the 12 million images in a sample by the way  There are many many more images. They you know they didn't want to go through  2.3 billion images, so they took a subset 12 million images, and they indexed them  By domain half the images were sourced from only a hundred domains domains and the largest number of images came from Pinterest  hmm  8.5 percent of the total data set  scraped from Pinterest  so completely  Disregarding you know copyright or ownership  a fine art America second biggest domain which sells art prints and posters  244,000 from Shopify then wicks and Squarespace redbubble, so it's scraped images all over the net  Number one artist of  The top 25 artists not data said only three are still living Phil coke Aaron Hansen and Steve Henderson the most frequent artist  Who would you guess Thomas Kinkade?  That the these planes like trademark

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And depends to a certain degree like how does this I you know again?  I don't know enough about the technology of this one to know how that works in terms of ingesting that material  I mean one argues that if you are an artist you have gone and looked at a lot of art  And you have art is it done the same thing yeah good point  so  But you know are you as long as you're not?  Storing those if you're just sort of exposing the AI to that and it's deriving its own conclusions  I don't know that seems legit to me, but maybe I'm not taking everything into consideration here.

You know this is a story of Harrison Bergeron right the Kurt Vonnegut story about someone who is  You know the society in which everyone has to be equal  But they define equal by disabling people who are too good instead of raising up everybody to the same  Level and so Harrison Bergeron is the most beautiful capable  intelligent agile person so he has to walk around wearing like 300 pounds of weights and disfiguring masks and so forth and  That is it does get you to those fields.

We have so much robotics now. We have a eyes engaged in a lot of aspects of daily life, you know  I think Dan I think you use this Paris you may as well AI  Based transcription for interviews and things like that at least as a first pass if not the verbatim one. I use this Trent

Transcript:  Otter is integrated with others. Yeah integrated with zoom and it made a huge difference in my reporting  It would sometimes take hours out of the work I was doing to have a searchable thing  So it was this was substantial augmentation my you know word rate or my hourly rate for articles  I wrote essentially went up by playing paying a relatively low yearly fee to have this AI  Assistant so augmentation my question is and I think a lot of artists are thinking about this now  I mean people like web cartoonists and folks who do commercial art the field had shrunk and it's a very complicated one already  So the question is does this become an augmentation where they can use this as a tool as a visualization tool  Is it something that helps them get to where they're going faster for commercial work or you know as a writer?  Do I wind up there's another science fiction story which you know some writers like us are sitting there typing away  And you have to control the AI for moving too fast ahead of you  But it's a partnership and it allows someone to produce more work  That's more accurate and more quickly maybe less creative or you're providing the creative component  so there is a future in which augmentation reduces less of the scut work and  Produces a better impact, but again. You know we have so much so much  So many professions and fields have been roboticized  Or have had even tiny robots or other kinds of automation added in the last 50 years and yet employment right we're not  Employing 50% fewer people we're at all-time high employment

Transcript:  There's too many jobs for too few people more robot  Hamburger flippers right I think I think you nailed it though. I mean honestly the best self-driving  cars are  Not driving entirely on their own. They're not level four or five. It's level two where a human it's human augmentation  And that's why it's a mistake to call it autopilot, but but that those kinds of you know self-driving vehicles are great  They're not self-driving the their assist their computer assist, and I think that works well  By the way Trent is do you have you tried otter? Which is better?

Transcript:  Paris you like I have been a Trent fan for many years. I find that otter for me  I don't know I know a lot of people who swear by otter. I found that it doesn't  Often transcribe with the same level of accuracy and most importantly for me. I think that trints  That's tr. I and T not my friend Trent  Trints editor editing service is really perfect for the sort of things that I use transcription for  but once you load up your transcription you kind of have a  time-coded like live transcription of it that scrolls with the audio and you can whenever let's say if there's a word that  It got wrong you go into edit it and it pauses and then once you're done editing it restarts at the word right after  So I think it's like really good for the sort of workflow that I do, but you know I know a lot of other

Transcript:  I should point out there's another reason I discovered otter was for live captioning  And I should point out this is an incredible area in which it was almost  Impossible to get and now is widely available is you needed live people typing to do real-time transcription of?  Conversations now there are a billion conversations a day that can be transcribed or sorry can have live captioning  You're so built an amazing job with Android 12 and 13 and Skype is incredible apples adding it in iOS  Yeah apples so in that that is a I mean so  99.999 percent of all phone conversations video conferences and whatever did not have live captions and now you have the potential and I suspect  It is a more than 10% number where people enable that and that is oh my god the amount of cognitive  Energy that saves and the improvement in conversation so not like I want to be a like yeah  I only has positive impacts, but I'm like my wife has hearing issues  She can't drive at night like I see always I look at AI and improvements in all these kinds of automations and robotics as  Tools for people you know directly near me where it's going to improve captions already improve her life and  Augmentation that would allow like night vision or other tools  It'll have to be full automated driving could allow her to drive at night again safely

Transcript:  My thought is I I mean obviously this is incredibly speculative  But I feel like there's always been people talking about how Apple could at one point buy Peloton  And I think that would be the thing that would really jumpstart their watch business if they kind of sold it as a tie-in  to some sort of  Exercise based platform in a way that kind of broadened all the aspects of their fitness ecosystem as well as Apple music  It could I think really kind of bring about an interesting flywheel effect  Probably they won't do it because peloton is a big flaming trash fire

They had to replace each piece the bike  Fully from the ground up then another person moved it once when they were replacing one other part of it  They had to do it all over again  I mean if you have an average Amazon delivery person somehow now trucking in your peloton bike, it's going to blow apart

Transcript:  Let's take a break more to come our fabulous panel our show today brought to you by  Zapier I use Zapier all the time. In fact, it's how we produce the shows  Zapier is automation done, right? If you're trying to grow a business, you know, your time is precious  And what if you could streamline the boring stuff the routine operations that eat up your time?  Things like lead management employee onboarding customer support. That's what Zapier does. This was awesome about Zapier  It makes it easy to connect all the apps you use to automate routine tasks to streamline your processes  So you got more time to do the stuff you're good at  Customer client needs that kind of thing. It's the power of automation made possible for everyone for instance  When I when I am going through my news feeds my RSS feeds  I have a Zapier script if I click a link or a star of newsfeed  It automatically zaps it it puts it up on my Twitter social feed. I have a newsfeed there  It puts it onto pin board and it even adds it to a spreadsheet  Called Leo's links that can easily be moved into our rundown spreadsheets. It all does that  I don't have to think about it  I set this app up years ago and we've been using it ever since as a big part of our  Production and it saves me so much time. I don't even it's kind of if I thought about it  I figure it's probably saving me hours every week  hundreds of hours every year  That's kind of mind-boggling and it was so easy to set up I use Zapier for all kinds of automation  And if you're in business, what a great way to get started with business automation. This is this is not low code  This is no code zero coding. There are four thousand apps that Zapier connects with  the most popular businesses business apps out there Google Sheets, I mentioned that we use that QuickBooks Facebook you have Google Ads  Any RSS feed you can automate almost any workflow imaginable with easy to use templates  Thousands of them right on the site  You don't even have to write your own a lot of the times and once you get good at it the sky's the limit  The average user saves over ten thousand dollars in recovered time every year  I guess that's that's accurate if it's a hundred if it's 200 hours a week a month  For me, that's that that's a thousand hours a year or more. Yeah  Yeah, I get paid more than ten bucks an hour  no wonder over one point eight million people and  Businesses use a Zapier to streamline their work and find more time for what matters most  I've been a Zapier subscriber  For I think as long as they've been around for years and years  See for yourself why teams at air table and Dropbox and HubSpot and Zendesk thousands of other companies including twit use Zapier  Every day to automate their businesses try Zapier free today  Z a P I E R Zapier I love the name they call the program Zaps  Zapier comm slash  Twit thank you Zapier for supporting the show and I mean literally  Streamlining my workflow let them streamline yours.

Yeah  Yeah, SSD is the most the fastest modern SSDs can actually perform at rates where you're starting to hit above a limit of 20  Gigabits per second which was kind of the earlier high point for USB and Thunderbolt  2 in some forms Thunderbolt 3 so all the current specs are like, okay  We do 40 if you're all up to date everything does 40 and then the fastest SSD you can buy can perform  And it's highest internal bus rate and that's kind of the that's the bottom line  So they're doing 80 because there's a new generation of SSDs  That will be out at some point and you'll want to be able to use those also for video and whatever people will use

We're never gonna know what the naked mole rat said. It's a

Transcript:  There it is. That's that's the two rats talking the greeting call, which I thought was going to be pretty basic turns out to be incredibly  Complicated said dr. Barker machine learning transformed my research. They're feeding  animal sounds to machine learning systems  to help them understand  What the animals are doing and saying and in fact, they've been able to see that there are multiple patterns  For instance, not only does each mole rat have its own vocal signature  They don't have any clothes, but they have each their own vocal signature. Each colony has its own distinct dialect  Which is passed down  culturally over  Generations and this is the most interesting during times of social instability  Such as in the weeks after a colony's Queen is violently deposed the diet  Full circle back to Game of Thrones Wow, the cohesive dialects fell apart  Then when the new Queen begins her reign a new dialect appears to take hold. I  Think that's fascinating. It's all this blockchain  Let's throw some blockchain at it

There was an article recently also about  The systems that you've got for dog and cat communication Mary Robinette Cowell  the science fiction writer on her Instagram, she's been posting updates of  talking with her cat Elsie with one of those  button based systems and it's really I haven't seen anybody else use it as  Or documented as publicly or elaborately and it is extraordinary to see what else he will say  And else he will just walk across this thing  It's full of buttons and not touch one  But like literally just walking like casually across it and then go to the right one and hit the thing Wow or several to express  Your thoughts you like there is intent. This is not trained. It's more sophisticated than that. How much is it real communication?  It seems like it's fairly substantial actually  But you know, we always lay things on top of this is a little cleaner because you're not training the rats

Transcript:  It's a flong was a mold using metal type days from they've been printing was all say poured lead into that mold  Exactly they'd make the flong under high pressure from like a laid-out page of disparate elements like pieces of type and illustrations  Then they put that in a press to create a single sheet that they could then cast into a hemispherical or half circular  Metal plate that could go on a high-speed rotary press and spin really fast and print you know vast numbers of newspapers every hour  So in every newspaper in the country they had dozens of people like making like laying out pages making flongs  Making these plates putting on presses. It was this incredibly wild amount of lead  Pouring and just like it's a crazy industrial operation that every newspaper had to do until about the 70s or 80s  And then it was utterly thrown out in favor of like a simpler photographic process that everyone uses now.
