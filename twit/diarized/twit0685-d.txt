Ian Thompson. Thank you guys for doing the show. How many shows did I miss, Karsten?  Three. Did anything happen at all while I was gone?  Nothing. That's what I thought. I got back. It's exactly the same.  Joining us from the future, Amy Webb. She's written the book called The Signals Are Talking.  She's at the Future Now Institute and is just fantastic. We always love having Amy on the show.  Hey everybody. She actually introduced me not only to the future but to Japan.  Which is a little bit of the future. A little bit. Thank you for being here.  Amy got a little cold. Did I say the future now? It's the Future Today Institute. I'm sorry.  It's today. It's now. It's with it. It's futuretodayinstitute.com.  I apologize. I always say now. Also with us, Mr. Michael Elgin who is a world traveler and so understands when I say I'm a little jet lagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jet lagged. Yeah. I'm from the present, not the future. I'm from way back.  Welcome back to reality. We missed you. No you didn't. But anyway, I'm glad to be here.

Start time: 182.20
End time: 209.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would say I missed you guys. And I did a little bit. Lukewarm.  You know it was great not having, we were on a boat so there's very little internet.  T-Mobile and Google Fi work pretty well to give you internet when you're in port.  But I wasn't actually anxious to find out what was going on. I hear there was an Apple event.  It's two years in a row now that I've managed to be out of town during an Apple event. I'm going to keep that up.

Start time: 210.57
End time: 213.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Long story short, they're the best phones Apple has ever made.

Start time: 213.20
End time: 256.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have the new watch. I'm wearing the new watch and I'm pairing it right now. We'll look at that new face.  And then I also have an XS. I'm going to call it the XS. I'm sorry. The XS Max coming tomorrow.  But I was a little perturbed because I saw the XS Max. First of all, it looks a little stretched out. Like a little tall, right?  Kind of like the iPhone 6 did when it first came out.  But then I was a little perturbed because I still noticed six lines of icons. Six rows of icons.  I thought, well they just made the icons bigger. There is a little more screen real estate.  We have a demonstration. This is the iPhone XS and this is the iPhone XS Max.

Start time: 258.51
End time: 261.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. That's amazing. It's an extra quarter inch.

Start time: 262.34
End time: 282.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  According to somebody in our audience, Jim, who is a developer, he said it's about 13% more.  But this isn't Safari. You're seeing a little more of the page. Mike likes this because you see the Arthur's byline.  But for a lot of things, it would be my guess that it won't give you more screen real estate. You just get bigger icons.

Start time: 282.36
End time: 293.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. To a large extent it will be up to the developers and how they want to use it, whether they want different versions and so on.  But I also think part of this is just keeping a certain level of consistency among their different phones.

Start time: 294.00
End time: 301.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now they have a relatively small one. Why do a bigger phone if somebody can't take advantage of it? Is this just the phone for old eyes?

Start time: 301.12
End time: 308.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  China. China loves the big phones. They love gold. They love gold and they love status symbols like iPhones.

Start time: 310.38
End time: 329.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's one big reason. And the other big reason is the aging population in the United States.  So those phones were not built for. Well, I mean, it is.  They were not built for Donald Trump because they are enormous, hard to hold in one hand, and they were not built for for younger people.

Start time: 329.74
End time: 333.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These are phones for people. Is that kind of his little hands? Is that is that the eye?

Start time: 334.66
End time: 337.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also has bad eyesight. I'm not sure. I have quantitative data on this.

Start time: 338.36
End time: 342.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The president, as I remember, unless he's updated, uses a fairly old phone still.

Start time: 343.81
End time: 345.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lately, he's been tweeting with an iPhone for a member for a long time.

Start time: 346.06
End time: 350.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Samsung. Yeah, Samsung. Now he's on an iPhone. But I don't think it's the latest iPhone.

Start time: 351.62
End time: 360.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just hope whatever it is has actually been locked down in some way.  But this bigger phone, I think is like it's right. It's for China and it's for a certain demographic in the US.

Start time: 361.10
End time: 371.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I actually was impressed by the XR, which we don't have yet. It won't be out till next month.  But the XR, which is an LCD based on OLED base, looks actually like the phone, like the iPhone that was for many years.

Start time: 372.55
End time: 409.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other thing is that Apple slowly.  Now that we're definitely in the post Steve Jobs world, they're slouching toward becoming an ordinary company under Steve Jobs.  They're like, you know, Steve Jobs is like, this is the phone.  There's only one phone. We make it and this is it. And you have to buy it.  Now they're becoming like a regular company.  Samsung would be an extreme version of that where it's like, well, we have a phone for kids and we have a phone for people with big hands.  And we have a phone for people with horrible eyes. And we have this phone, that phone.  So, you know, 10 years from now, Apple probably have 15 phones.  Big, big lineup because they'll be more of an ordinary company.

Start time: 409.10
End time: 420.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it now is my understanding. But again, I was I was in a distant land where where no news penetrated.  But that they kept the seven and the eight as well as the iPhone X as well as the XS.

Start time: 421.66
End time: 476.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, one of the most interesting things about the announcement was that they had someone come on stage and talk about their environmental  initiatives and they looked pretty serious and they announced some pretty serious things like getting away from rare metals and things like that.  But one of the things they emphasized was they made the point, which I've made in a column lots of people have made in the past.  The most the only phone that is that is environmentally friendly as a phone that's never manufactured.  And the way you don't manufacture phones is you get a lot more use out of them. They say they're planning to do that.  They want their phones to last for years and years and years.  So I think they're working on some plan to have their lower end phones actually be older phones that are refurbished and so on, even more than they do today.  They do that. I think it's great. I think it's great news.  And let's hope that that is, in fact, the case that they make these indestructible phones that are in use for 12 years.  And that's their low end phone. And Apple's a hardware company.

Start time: 476.18
End time: 480.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that they're going to have like what's the business model in a charge three thousand dollars a phone.

Start time: 481.00
End time: 495.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the heading there clearly. Part of the model is expand the universe of people buying phones.  Right. Instead of saying you got to buy a new one, find people who haven't bought an iPhone yet.  There's there's still plenty of room for expansion, isn't there, in India for about 10 years?

Start time: 496.04
End time: 506.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  China. Yeah. I mean, there is overseas and I mean, we're at the beginning of the end.  So this is this is the beginning of the end of smartphones.  And, you know, so I know that they had agreed.

Start time: 507.02
End time: 515.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know you want to talk about the beginning of the end and what the what is next after smartphones, because Amy has.  She's already tired of them. But that's not that I'm tired.

Start time: 516.10
End time: 584.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like, you know, but but so everybody's very, very excited about the Apple launch.  And again, like what what what are the significant changes between the current phones and the previous phones?  What is the measurable, discernible difference that would cause somebody who is not a hardcore, you know, tech aficionado to go out and purchase a more expensive phone?  Right. I mean, there's there's very, very little difference between what came out and what already existed.  So we're seeing negligible new developments.  And at the same time, there are all kinds of peripheral. So, Leo, you've got a brand new I watch.  Mike's got an I watch. If you have a certain amount of disposable income, you're probably not going to go and continue on that two year brand new phone cycle.  You're probably going to buy a peripheral and there's more and more smart peripherals that are coming to market.  And so, you know, we're only seeing incremental differences in these phones.  We're going to probably see less. Well, we know we're going to see less phones and more other kinds of devices.

Start time: 584.06
End time: 599.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And less differentiation between the phones that come out. Right. That's right.  It's hard to find a differentiator these days. Yeah.  You know, that's why Apple's probably doubling down on things like security and privacy, because that's one thing Apple can say is a differentiator in Apple's products.

Start time: 600.94
End time: 616.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple is either going to plateau as a company and start declining or they're going to launch into entirely new businesses that are only tangentially related to phones and computers.

Start time: 616.12
End time: 623.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't this the classic though, the innovators dilemma? This is the classic problem for a successful company, especially a company with a big hit like the iPhone.

Start time: 625.18
End time: 634.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a big problem for the most successful company because how much, what are they going to become a three billion, three trillion dollar company?  I mean, what are they going to do to continue the growth? New markets. They'll try. Right.

Start time: 635.66
End time: 698.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think I'm still a believer in the Apple car. I'll tell you where the iPhone is a big hit. Thieves. Oh, they love them.  Our Santa Rosa Apple store was hit at the end of the month last month and Megan Maroney was in there this afternoon picking up her iPhone.  She just tweeted, I was mining my own business waiting for my Apple watch when some dudes robbed the Santa Rosa Apple store. Same store that was robbed a week ago.  Wow. Last time they took $35,000 in stuff. So great that they did that and Megan did that. Isn't everything locked down? How did they do that?  Well, I think, I don't know, and I certainly don't want to spread the word, but I suspect they're locked down with cuttable cables would be my guess.  And thieves must know this. And what it actually what it shows also is the success of the kill switch because Apple was concerned about how many iPhones were being stolen out of people's hands out of their pockets and put it made it impossible for a thief to take your phone and reuse it.  Right. So now they're stealing them brand new from the Apple store. Imagine off trucks anywhere you can get a phone before it's activated. Yeah.

Start time: 699.24
End time: 720.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there's a lot of this. This is this this one store has been hit twice. In this area in the greater sort of Northern California area, I think there's been something like 10 or 12 in the last six months or something like that.  It's really become a big deal. And you know freaks out the customers. Apple's got to do something with those phones that are on display. Doesn't seem like that hard of a problem.

Start time: 721.64
End time: 730.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't heard about this happening on the East. I'm on the East Coast. I haven't heard about Apple stores getting hit like in New York or the East Coast is always behind on technology. You'll catch up to the Apple store thing.

Start time: 733.74
End time: 755.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sizzle. Well, already, I just my watch just woke up. I already see one difference in the that extra two millimeters. The text at the bottom of the screen is now curved around the watch face instead of straight.  Definitely worth $500. I am so this is this is part of the frustration I have with the Apple watch too is you don't think of a watch as something you're going to buy a new one of every year or do you? I don't know.

Start time: 755.82
End time: 787.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do now. Well, I mean, we're habituated to waiting for this is the problem. Quite frankly that I have with America versus China in America. We become habituated to the idea that everything must perfectly must work perfectly out of the box regardless of how new the technology is.  And if a company isn't on some kind of annual product launch cycle, then they've somehow failed. I would rather you know, like apples now everybody's releasing a new you know, apples releasing a new set of products basically now annually.

Start time: 787.34
End time: 804.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I mean, this is the Silicon Valley story. If you don't double every year in growth, if you don't find you know, this is this is what and the Silicon Valley brought this upon itself by by such success that the market the stock market and consumers and we in the tech press demand this now.

Start time: 806.04
End time: 811.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you stop and apply like logic, right, which I know the market doesn't love it's unsustainable start doing that.

Start time: 812.62
End time: 838.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, so listen, I'm like the new app that the new iPhones are such a non that to me that was the least interesting news. I agree. I agree 100%. In fact, I didn't even mean to get into the subject. I thought I'd leave it to our Apple shows. We have Mac break weekly iOS today.  But I mean, you can't not talk about it. You want that the phones are arriving, we're starting people started getting their phones yesterday or Friday rather and watches same thing.

Start time: 839.20
End time: 861.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The biggest news I thought around the iPhone was that reviewers are saying that the camera in the iPhone excess.  I love that. I'm going to use that. They should have a special Johnny I've the excess I've anyway. So the camera is better than the 10, but not as good as the pixel to last year's.

Start time: 862.00
End time: 905.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. And in about a week, a month, there's not even that long October 9. Yeah, there's gonna be a pixel three. How did Google make a better phone than Apple a year ago?  In general, the I know I haven't personally this is not my experience because I haven't tried it yet. But I love the pixel to camera took a lot of my trip photos with that.  But you saw Vlad Savov of the verge and many others Neil I could tell also the verge. Many agreed that it's good. It's an improvement. It's a big improvement.  I can see I've seen some pictures that blow me away from the new excess. But the tennis but pixel they're doing something that the pixel did last year, which is take multiple images stack up.

Start time: 905.04
End time: 915.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep. And create HDR is out of them. And I'm really excited for the upcoming pixel phones because maybe they'll have a really amazing camera and Google has shown that you'd only need one lens.

Start time: 915.00
End time: 924.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Apples you know part of their selling point is multiple lenses. I don't know what the apparently everything about the pixel three is already leaked out. Does it have more than one lens? I think it still has one lens. Right.

Start time: 924.20
End time: 929.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't remember. So yeah, I think so. You live in the future. You probably have one. What is it going to be next year?

Start time: 931.88
End time: 1011.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, can I just talk for me the biggest news from the Apple announcement was the double SIM card in China. And here's why I thought that was important because you know that is a significant form factor change.  That's a different kind of engineering that you know they've they've basically created a phone specifically for China's market, which tells us two things.  One, it tells us that China is a big enough economic force that it can compel a company like Apple now to create an entirely different phone, which is sort of antithetical to Apple's culture and what it's done all of these years.  But the other thing is that set in the context of the trade war and all of the different tariffs that are being thrown around.  What's so interesting to me is that Apple essentially is large enough now that it can operate. It's got enough power and capital.  It effectively operates like its own nation state. And so Apple has managed to keep itself in China and outside of the skirmishes that are happening between Beijing and Washington, D.C.  With a phone that's been created specifically for that market. So that tells us a bunch of things about what Apple sees as its growth potential for the future.  It tells us something about China's influence and Apple's influence. To me, that was like the big story that didn't get enough attention.

Start time: 1012.04
End time: 1021.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course, you're doing it in an interesting way, unlike other dual SIM phones. Is it only the Chinese model or is it all models that have this?

Start time: 1021.00
End time: 1034.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's just the China. Yeah. And so I lived in China. Mike, did you live in China? I feel like you've lived everywhere.  I've been there but haven't.  So there's a lot of people who have two different phone numbers and two different phones for many different reasons.

Start time: 1035.42
End time: 1041.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And dual SIM phones are very popular. And a lot of times it's because that's their only computer. That phone is their whole business.

Start time: 1041.46
End time: 1047.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But also their regions, not just in China, but in India and other places where it's not uncommon to go from one carrier to another even in a short trip.

Start time: 1048.08
End time: 1057.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So having multiple SIMs is practical. I would love one because I would love to have Google Fi in one of the SIM cards and then the regular Apple SIM thing and the other.

Start time: 1058.20
End time: 1069.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That'd be great. I love that. Yeah. The chance of Google Fi supporting an iPhone seems small.  I just want to say. Well, you can put a card into... It becomes a T-Mobile phone. Basically.

Start time: 1069.04
End time: 1077.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can experience it. Right. But if you're abroad, I believe it's the same. You don't get the multiple carrier thing in the US if you put Google Fi SIM into an Apple device.

Start time: 1078.56
End time: 1125.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if you're abroad, I think you get most of the benefits. That is something I can report back on, by the way, from my travels. You've probably already experienced this.  But it's really different what's happened with Internet access. For instance, Europe now has a law that makes roaming universal throughout the EU.  So one SIM does it all. In fact, I was talking to somebody from the UK, which is, I think, Brexit-ing at the moment.  But even then, they could buy a SIM from three or somebody in the UK that works everywhere in Europe without roaming, in effect.  And that's what our Google Fi SIM does. It acts as if it's just local.  And I used so much Google Fi as I was traveling that I got to that gigabit limit where they say, OK, we're going to stop billing you now, which is great.  I mean, I used a lot of data. I don't know if it was super fast, but it was fast enough.

Start time: 1125.02
End time: 1130.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't you love that message they give you? They're like, you know what? You've used up all the things, so the rest of it is on us.

Start time: 1130.00
End time: 1342.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's on us. So we're going to pay for all of it. So it never goes more than 60 bucks a month for unlimited data. Plus 20 for the monthly accounts. That's 80 bucks.  Yeah. I also used T-Mobile and I paid for T-Mobile has an international plan, which gives you 256 kilobits per second instead of 128 kilobits per second.  But actually, it's still it's a difference. And it is it's enough that it's pretty usable.  And even this was a fairly cruise ship that had been built in the last two years. And it had pretty much better than I'd experienced on older ships.  So it's getting as you travel, ubiquitous Internet is becoming more and more the thing at a reasonable price. That's a that's a nice improvement.  I want to take a little break. We come back. I I've been gone a long time. I don't know what the hell happened.  So I have charged both Amy and Mike to tell me the big stories of the last three weeks. Amy's got two. Mike's got one.  What were the stories that I missed? And then Carsten's pulled a few stories and I even found a few, including one from a heart doctor that says, if you trust your life to the Apple Watch, you're nuts.  We'll get to that in just a second. I have a little problem because I'm going to go home after the show and I know my family's gonna say, what's for dinner?  So I haven't gone three weeks.

Transcript:  Okay. I'll just mention this. I'm a heart doctor and wary of the new Apple watch because I mentioned it going in and we're going to get your stories that I may have missed.  This is actually an interesting point. We talk a lot about Apple and their reality distortion field. They're amazing marketing and I, you know, I celebrate that every company has to market. We have to market. That's fine.  Where it gets problematic is where Apple starts to market to the detriment of people's health.  Now, I think it's very interesting that one of the things Apple's doing in these new watches is you can do the AFib style EKG that Cardia and other companies are doing. It's FDA approved, but it's two terminals, right?  One terminal is your wrist. One terminal is the knob as opposed to a 12 terminal full EKG that you would get in the hospital. That means it is not as accurate, but more importantly, this physician, he's writing on Medium, Dr. Joe Mandrola says, even with the 12 sensor EKGs, we get about 10% false positives.  And that's an issue because that means 10% of the time in irregular rhythm, which is normal, everybody has, you know, people have irregular rhythms are falsely labelled as AFib, which means medication, means treatment, means serious.  He has an issue and I think a lot of physicians do with testing a healthy population, just just testing everybody. If without indication that something should be tested.  He's wrong. He's wrong. He's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's wrong, but that also cuts into a lot of so he says when you endeavor to make healthy people healthier, you always risk making them worse.  Here's the thing, though, you cannot in the United States.  Request diagnostics on your own. So I'm married to an eye doctor. So, you know, one of the ways that every doctor, because of how our billing system is set up in the US, the way that they earn a living is through some of those diagnostics.  Now at the moment, you could make an argument that way too much data is not a good thing because there's no way to interpret it. On the other hand, if we don't continue, you know, the more like those diagnostics are important to do when you're healthy, not just when you're having a crisis, because it helps you set baselines.  You can track trends over time, you know, and we don't have a system set up in the United States to do that without going into your doctor.  So the thing is that it's a huge opening.

Start time: 1522.70
End time: 1535.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But there is a difference here because now a consumer device is is is pretending or even accurately saying we're going to do some diagnostics here. That means many millions more people will now get these tests.

Start time: 1535.22
End time: 1605.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that there's no harm in it. And the reason is that well, that's the question is there isn't because basically, first of all, the you know, my heart doesn't belong to my doctor.  That's a good point.  And and if I want to, if I want some help, because I'm a geek to make the decision about whether I go to the doctor and say, you know, I'm concerned about my heart.  This is what this is for. Nobody's going to prescribe medication or treatment based on the Apple Watch.  Nobody. You still get hooked up to the big EKG.  Right.  So that's why there's no harm. It's simply a decision making tool for people to decide whether to choose to go to the doctor or not go to the doctor or in some cases choose to go to the emergency room or not.  And I think that that's I don't see the harm that it seems to be saying in a way this is the medical industry saying we want to protect our monopoly.  That's what I'm saying.  They suffer a lot.  Doctors, the medical profession suffers a lot from people self diagnosing going on to WebMD and saying, you know what, I think I have, you know, a wooden leg or something, you know, whatever it is that the people decide that they have.  And then then they are on the Internet.

Start time: 1605.14
End time: 1606.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1607.63
End time: 1608.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.

Start time: 1609.90
End time: 1675.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are legitimate reasons to not to not want all of that testing because, again, our system in the United States is not really set up to deal with all that data.  On the other hand, we really only work on diagnostics in this country when people are sick.  Yeah.  And then we're really only dealing with, you know, like it's a very small percentage of the population.  So the bigger picture that I think everybody's missing is what this portends.  I mean, Apple is, you know, launching a clinic somewhere in all of the big nine.  It's all of the the, you know, Apple, Amazon, Google.  You know, they are all getting into the health space.  They are all launching different products.  I mean, it's very, very likely that we are moving into a future in which we have a sort of single record that's probably owned by one of these companies that includes our health data, which has a lot of promise and will improve our lives in a lot of ways.  But it also means that there's going to be cataclysmic change in the health and medical and pharmaceutical industries.

Start time: 1676.00
End time: 1724.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a certainty that consumer devices will actually be connected in various ways to the medical system in a more reliable way that's super, you know, and we're going to apply AI to that.  That's going to be the biggest step forward for health where AI will be able to say, you know what, this ECG passes all the tests.  But you know what, based on this, you know, AI analysis, we determined that 45% of people who have this exact same pattern end up doing X, Y, Z.  It's going to be really fantastic.  So this is basically just a baby step toward that inevitable future when we are going to be wired all the time.  And this data will be available to our doctors and there'll be, you know, we'll be relying on it a lot more.  It might be five years, might be 25 years, but we're going to get there.

Start time: 1724.72
End time: 1759.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be closer than that.  It's you know, we already like all of the big companies have flooded the USP, the Patent and Trademark Office with many, many different patents that describe earable device, you know, hearing devices that also collect biometrics, thin films that you would wear that also transmit information.  You know, we're quickly on our on our path in that direction.  The real challenge is that LabCorp quest like, you know, we're not really set up for the innovations that are coming.

Start time: 1759.04
End time: 1783.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The future is not evenly distributed.  It's you know, only the only a tiny percentage can afford or are aware of these devices.  You mentioned what is it? It's a it's a Vic and Dottra's company, right?  What is it?  Cardia. Yeah, Cardia.  K-A-R-D-I-A.  You could you could go out in Petaluma and and and accost people on the street and ask them if they've ever heard of that product.  I guarantee that 99 percent of them have never heard of it.

Transcript:  You know, who uses one is somebody who has been diagnosed with a fib, which is Jeff Jarvis.  And he went out and bought it from a live core, a live core dot com, went out and bought it.  It basically works the same way the Apple Watch does, except that you have a separate set of pads that can work with an Android device as well.  And he's from his point of view, it's a lifesaver because if he feels an irregularity or he wants to just make sure he's OK, if he's feeling poorly, he can get at least get a quick diagnosis that allows him then to send that to the doctor.  And and I have to say, if you've already been diagnosed, I can see the real value of that.  But I also see the point that this heart doctor is making that now millions of people, it's a hypochondriac stream.

Start time: 1824.28
End time: 1835.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, or also the cure.  I mean, a lot of people think, well, I think I either had a heart attack or it's the In-N-Out burger I just ate.  I'm not sure. And then, you know, if I could just ask Siri.  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  By the way, I am pissed off and I don't know if this is true or not, but the NFL, I was watching the Niners game this morning and the NFL ran an ad that said, hey, slow mo.  What's what are the scores in the NFL today?  And my home hub pod went off and talked for five minutes about the scores and I was miffed.  That should be illegal. Yeah.

End time: 1880.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. I thought that that what they weren't doing.  I thought that was an FCC. It should be.  Yeah. We we have diagnostic devices in our homes that at one point were just as controversial as the Apple watch thermometers.  That's a good problem.  First came out, you know, like, I bet you're right.

Start time: 1881.00
End time: 1888.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But when the thermometer first came out, doctors said people should not be able to find out what their temperature is.  It's just going to cause more calls.

Start time: 1889.34
End time: 1932.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it was the same.  I mean, obviously not at that point, but it was the same sentiment.  So so what we're butting up here against is change that puts that empowers the masses and, you know, takes away some of the purview of a small group of people, you know, previously who were the only ones allowed to get and gather that information.  So it's just we're in another period of transition.  But but every like like we can certainly talk about the watch and about a fib and everything else.  But this is a tiny sliver.  I mean, every like every company now is working on a suite of products, including Apple.  The watch is just a tiny piece of it.  Yeah. As a journalist, I want a device that measures the caffeine content in my bloodstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't talk about it yet, but I think soon I'll be able to talk about this ring, which I were in the whole trip that does do a lot of diagnostic stuff.  You used a word. I like this word. Did you coin the word earable?

Start time: 1947.08
End time: 1950.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the ones that I've got right now respond.  So I've got a very awesome set of wireless Bluetooth headphones that respond to gesture, touch and speech.  So I can, you know, but but the all everything that I've seen that's coming also collects your biometric data for transmission to something like a health kit or, you know, Google's Calico.  This goes to health kit.

Start time: 1982.12
End time: 2001.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But also, this is interesting.  I haven't seen this before as a two way street.  It takes from health kit as well.  So I can't talk about it yet because the guy who's selling these created this said we're not ready yet, but I'll be doing a review.  I'll be doing a review, but it gives you your it says my readiness is low.  Thank you.  The show?  Ready for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's going to bring a bunch of artists which, you know, into space, which, you know, I guess  they're pleasant enough people artists.  But what was funny about during the press conference is that Elon Musk is like, he knows  it's dangerous.  He knows he's probably going to die.  We told him he came to us.  We didn't go to him.  He came to us.  So if we wait, probably going to die.  I didn't hear that.  No, I'm exaggerating.  Okay.  Comic effect.  Basically, Elon Musk says he knows this is a very dangerous thing.  He could die.  Right.  Yeah.  We'll still cash his check, but he could die.  He could take all the artists with him.  But but to me, the the idea that the ambition for a private company, you know, we've crept  up to this moment because this guy's got a lot of money.

Because it can't be in only some cases.  It can't be as far as the SEC is concerned.  Certain tweets are held to a higher level of scrutiny.

So the quick thing is a really wonderful show called The First, which is just  launched on Hulu by Bo Willimon, who was the showrunner for House of Cards the  first couple of seasons.  It's about it's set in the year 2031 and it's about the first group of people  ever to try to get to Mars.  So it's not space tourism, but it is 100 percent space related.

It takes place in the year 2031 and it's the all everything that leads up to  everybody trying to get to Mars for the first time.

But anyhow, so Mike's excellent point about what it means to go to space for  different reasons than we've gone before.  You know, and what that implies.  It's really interesting stuff.  So the choice.  But my actual, my actual most important story of the week was Amazon.  Amazon launched a whole bunch of different products and services.  Everybody is very fixated on this microwave and somehow everybody has lost  the sight of the bigger picture.  The clock.  And if you look at all of the, well,  if you look at all the other things that Amazon is engaged in,  which has to do with, you know,  AWS and securing larger government contracts for various things, you know,  it is crystal clear that we are quickly moving into a near future scenario  where we are living in an Amazon home, a Google home or an Apple home.  And the Amazon home because you can't mix.

Start time: 2564.55
End time: 2584.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cause they're not interoperable.  And from my vantage point,  the Amazon home is likely to be most closely connected with government  services.  And so for people who can't afford certain things, absolutely.  Why do you say that?  And I don't, this is not a bad thing,  but I think it's highly likely that.  Why would government pick a winner?

Start time: 2586.00

Transcript:  Pardon me?  Why would government pick a winner in this race?

Start time: 2591.29
End time: 2604.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the government at the moment can't manage.  I mean, literally cannot manage.  Have you heard all the nuts.  So stories about housing or human services?  No, as I said, I've been off the grid for three weeks.

Start time: 2610.60
End time: 2648.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very clear to me that the three companies are vying,  not just to own our living room,  but to power our lives and our lives as they, you know, if you,  if you treat the home as a sort of gigantic spatial computing environment,  you know, and we are a part of that,  the road ahead to me is very, very clear.  And so the microwave is sort of silly, but cool.  The clocks on the walls are silly, but interesting or whatever.  And everybody needs to,  it's fine to acknowledge these individual developments,  but if we take, if we'd like look from a 40,000 foot perspective,  you know, like the pieces are coming, starting to come together now.  Now, when I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they announced a couple of days ago.  Lots and lots of products and services.  So there's a device now that you can turn any car into a,  a light powered, you know,  Well, I've had that row av from,

Start time: 2670.55
End time: 2690.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but this is one that's officially,  what I find interesting is that Amazon has decided to make their own as  opposed to a license,  because it looked like for a while their strategy was going to be,  we're just going to put out echo everywhere.  I won't say the a word,  but echo everywhere by licensing it and making it very easy for somebody to  build something.

Start time: 2690.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've also, they're also doing that, but they're, they're producing.  I mean, it is to me,  I think everybody's, when we,  when we think about the future and who's really building the future and who's  really thinking,  Elon Musk has certainly done some interesting and, and, you know,  wonderful things, right?  But we, but for my money,  Jeff or not Jeff Jeff,  Jeff Bezos.  Jeff Bezos. Yeah.  For my money.  If I think of like who are, who, you know,  who alive today is the most visionary is thinking the most long-term,  not 10 years into the future, but 80 years into the future.  Bezos is, is at the very, very top of my list.

Start time: 2729.70

Transcript:  Just everybody with their own space program. So that's Musk.  That's Bezos.  Right.  And they've got a space program.  You're thinking about the future, by the way,  I saw a really horrible movie last night that had an interesting point to it.  It was Fahrenheit 451, the new one.  Yeah.  And it was an awful movie.  Wonderful Ray Bradbury book.  The original movie was good too.  The original movie was pretty good.  This movie, not so much, but what was interesting about it is they modernized it  in part by saying that the whole world as constructed,  which is that everybody's happy because we burn all the books and get rid of all  this hard drives.

So essentially what you're talking about, Amy,  is where we're going to be living in this Amazon world,  this Apple world or this Google world.  This is the world of Fahrenheit 451.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's good and it's bad.  Right. There's a way to look at this in an optimistic framing.  And there's a way to look at this as a catastrophic framing.  You know, if we do not do something in the United States sometime very soon to  bridge the divide, the wealth divide that,  that our technology has is creating.  We're going to wind up in a really bad spot.  So, you know, the government itself is not going to subsidize the technology or  the development of it in a lot of ways.  So if you live in an Amazon home or a Google home and some of those devices are,  you know,  and the services are being subsidized,  subsidized through the collection of your data and the mining and refining of your data,  you know, that's a trade off.  And for some people that may not be a big deal and for other people that may be,  you know, too much.

Transcript:  Are you familiar with this book by Anandjari,  Jared Haradas, Winner Take All?  It's his thesis.  I haven't read it yet because it came out just before I left.  But his thesis is that this is exactly what's we've kind of done,  which is say, look, governments failed us.  Let's turn to the elite and especially the big tech companies and let them solve all the problems  of the world.  And I think we already have enough evidence that that's not going to work.  But he says that's kind of what's happening.  He even says this is the election of President Trump is actually manifestation of that  because it's the idea of, well, a business leader could probably solve our problems, right?  Yeah.  Because government can.  But he's doing a great job proving that it's true.  This has happened before?

Start time: 2882.80
End time: 2896.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  I mean, in the 1910s to 1930s, we had big tech companies partnering with the government  to develop, you know, computers and weapons.  Well, this is the opposite, though.

Transcript:  He says all around us, the winners in our highly inequitable status quo,  he's talking about the gulf between haves and have nots,  declare themselves partisans of change.  They know the problem and they want to be part of the solution.  Actually, they want to lead the search for solutions.  And they believe their solutions deserve to be at the forefront of social change.  You could say that with Mark Zuckerberg, right?  You could say that with Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google.  You could say it with Jeff Bezos.  I think Bezos is the least political of all of them.  Oh, I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's extraordinarily disciplined about what he does in public.  So we don't really know what he's up to.  It seems to me that a great number of societies have collapsed  because of huge and growing inequality between the haves and have nots.  I could be wrong about that, but I think most of the major civilizations that have existed.

Transcript:  If you look at even ancient Sparta, which the Spartan system that we know was essentially found,  now we're really off the rails,  was essentially a revolution that made everyone equal who was a citizen.  And then over the next 700, 800, 900 years,  they evolved to the point where there was more and more inequality.  And then the system fell apart because there was inequality.  It was a direct result.  They couldn't raise an army because you had to be wealthy to be in the army.  And there was only like 30 wealthy people left.  It's a small army.  And they were really wealthy.  But that's a small army and they just kind of fizzled out.  So getting back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my upcoming book is called The Big Nine.  But there's nine companies that control the future of AI.  Six are in the United States, three are in China.  China's three, the Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are very closely aligned with the government.  And part of what's happening in China and why we see these tectonic shifts happening  is because China is about to go through social mobility  at a scale that's never been seen before in the existence of humanity.  Yeah.  The number of people in the middle class is going to balloon over the next decade.  And they're going to move up.  And so part of the reason that China is in Africa is because China doesn't have enough wood  to make the fancy, like this red-colored wood that is very popular there.  They don't have enough wood to build the furniture that the newly wealthy people want to buy.  So you get problems on both ends.  You have problems when there's massive inequality,  and then you also have problems when there's massive shifts in social mobility  that all happen at the same time.  And all of this involves the big tech companies.  All of it does.

Transcript:  To me, the connection with technology is that the Bezos' and other billionaires like him,  although he's currently the world's richest person,  it's the use of technology and algorithms and AI and stuff to sort of take over everything.  If you look at the rise of Amazon, he's used AI or something that could be considered precursor to AI,  essentially crushes competition.  Famous diaper.com thing where he was underpricing their diapers in real time  until they had no valuation and then he bought them for pennies on the dollar.  That's an example of how that's a direct link between somebody who's worth $130 billion or whatever it is now  and technology.  He's using technology to create this gap, this wealth gap.

New Echo Dot, which sounds better, I guess, and is covered with fabric.  Fabric was a big deal.  It's got that going for it.  There's also New Echo Plus.  Again, better sound.  Fabric.  They're finally doing a 10-inch Echo Show.  I really like the Echo Show. Everybody hated it.  Said it was ugly.  You mentioned the microwave.

They've got new technology in their house.  And I can't even...  The microwave's way over complicated.  It's too many questions.

You'll never have to worry.  The motor will automatically change, said some guy named Limp.  I guess he was at the event. I don't know.

Now, you appreciate this because of what you went through before the show with your Apple Watch, the setup.  But now, basically, it sounds like a great system where you bring in a new device, your device number 21, into your home that supports the A-word.  And it just sort of like authenticates it and puts it online very quickly and easily.  I think that's going to be kind of a major thing from Amazon that everyone's going to copy.

It does seem like that, doesn't it?  Absolutely. Absolutely.  And I very, very, that's why with all of these sort of seemingly disparate devices, it may seem like, oh, the Echo Show was a hit.

Transcript:  It seemed pretty ambitious actually. It's got sort of Google Now style preemption where it'll say, hey, you really need to call these customers because they're being neglected.  That's actually a good idea.  It's basically, Salesforce is essentially a spreadsheet or a database.  And they focused on taking natural language communication and parsing it into the correct fields and then having preemption and communication.  So you can say, hey, you know, tell the group, blah, blah, blah, and it'll go and send them the resources they need.  From what they've promised, it sounds significantly more visionary, I think, in terms of how the world will work in the future than the Amazon stuff.  The Amazon stuff is like, oh, you can talk to the A word and you find out the weather and get a set of timer.  This is like, OK, I'm partnering now with AI.

And the percentage of the artificial intelligence will only increase.  He was talking about his whole anxiety about AI and all that kind of stuff.  But anyway, it was an interesting perspective.  And he said the only thing that's preventing us from being much more closely aligned and partnered with this growing AI is the interface and voice is a major interface.  And so this for Salesforce, this is like an example of corporations eventually turning into these cybernetic organisms with this great interface.  It's a great interface. Yes, that's all.

Transcript:  We built models showing that most of our conversation, 50 percent in the industrialized world of conversations that we have with machines, 50 percent of the interactions that we have with machines by the year 2022 will be with our voices.  So Salesforce is just like the next company to jump on this. It's not really a bandwagon. It's a transition.  I just want to go back to the Elon Musk thing with with AI for a moment.  So artificial intelligence is the third era of computing. It's not some other thing.  And I think that Elon Musk is an incredibly smart person. And I think he's probably a very good engineer.  I also don't think he fully understands AI, given what I've heard from like when he's talked about it.  So and his, you know, abject alarmist interpretations of AI, I think are not good for us all.  So I just want to. And you're writing the book, The Big Nine.  I wrote the book. It's in. It comes out in a couple of months.

Transcript:  It's Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. I personally think the most interesting company in AI is Apple  because they they use AI for the most trivial things.  I mean, they the way that AirPods work. Yeah.  They use an AI to sync up the and so that the AirPods know if they're being held in your hand or they're in your ear  or whether there's one in them or two. And so they have stereo.  It's like they use AI for the most minuscule little things.  And I think that's so interesting. That's not that remarkable.

Transcript:  What is this is the yeah.  So so Leo just said something really, really smart, which is what?  Wait a minute. Let me write. I know. Right. It's crazy.  One point for natural intelligence. I blame my wife.  So so since we had, you know, AI has been in some form of development for 400 years and in the modern era.  Wait a minute. 400. Wait a minute. Before. Wait a minute.

Transcript:  Because if you go all the way back, there is a and you could even go further back than that.  There's always been a connection between mine and machine and the notion of making decisions and performing tasks and all of you know, you can sort of draw a squiggly.  But but pretty consistent line between Descartes and Hobbes and Yan LeCun, right?  And the work that that that he's he's working on it on a I at Facebook.  But but here's the thing. So throughout this entire process, every time something that is within the umbrella of artificial narrow intelligence becomes so routine and part of our everyday lives, we no longer think of it as intelligent.  Right. At the heart of it, all AI really is is a series of, you know, a system using data to make decisions.  I mean, that's like the most basic explanation.  And so the obviously the world of AI is far more sophisticated than that.  But but that's what we're really talking about.  And it's the ways in which that data is used, the types of data and the kinds of decisions that are being made and the actions that result.  So, OK. And so for that reason, again, I think Amazon is the company if you're looking if you're watching AI Apple for me, Amazon is the company to watch probably followed by Google.  And then there's a drop off.

Transcript:  There is an audio version that I did not read. No, it's good.  Get it on Audible. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by WordPress.  So I think I mentioned this. I certainly blogged it.  I have discontinued my use of the evil trio Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, preferring instead to mail postcards.  I think that's so cool. Oh, it was so much fun. I really do.  Bill Atkinson's photo card app. And I mailed it to family and friends.  But what I realized is that this also makes it an excellent blog piece.  So I'm putting my stuff on my WordPress blog. I love WordPress.com.  It's made it very easy for me as easy to post to WordPress as it would be to put up a picture on Instagram or even a tweet.  It made it very easy for me to share my life and my travels.  These are some pictures from Barcelona. There's my beautiful wife.  We had so much fun. There's my pants.  And I'm putting the postcards up too.  And WordPress is a great place not only to host them, but to post them.  And I really like the idea of, you know, you can keep your social media.  I'm not saying get rid of your social media, but you ought to have a place on the Internet that's your home.

End time: 4601.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I did not reply, but there is a subscription link somewhere on there.  Fantastic.  That's one of the things I like about WordPress. I was able to post this with very limited bandwidth from the ship.  From a boat.  Probably using cell phone. And get it out there. Publish it.  And that was really, really a lot of fun. I am such a fan.  WordPress.com. If you're a business, if you're an individual, you really need to have your place.  The place on the web that is you.  And yeah, it's good to have a Facebook page or a Twitter account or an Instagram.  You should probably do all of that. But it should all link back to your domain.  That's what Google is going to show when somebody searches for your name, your business name.  And it's so easy. WordPress takes care of the hosting, the security, the software updates.  You focus on the content.  And I was using, I use the WordPress apps on my phone or my iPad, which made it even easier.  They have a great app. It was so simple to post this.  It's just fantastic. Upload images, video, audio.  And by the way, of course you can link to YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.  But when you put the images on your site, you own them. They're yours.  You're never going to lose them.  If Twitter closes down or closes your account, this lives on.  And by the way, very easy to get data into and out of WordPress.  I really like that.  You can grow your audience and reach new customers with built-in search engine optimization, social media features.  For instance, people can share my pictures on their Instagram or their Twitter or their Facebook.  It's very easy with a simple button push.  That way the world is helping you promote yourself.  And you're going to get help from WordPress.  I have 24-7 support. The best support team in the world.  WordPress plans start at $4 a month.  And there's a good reason. 31% of all websites, including mine, run on WordPress.  31%. It's the best.  Right now get 15% off any new plan purchase.  Go to WordPress.com slash twit to create your website.  WordPress.com slash twit.  WordPress.com slash twit.  It's funny because these postcards are being mailed, right?  And so there's four, I think, still to come.  Let me see one of those.  They haven't arrived yet.  So at first I was putting them up on the WordPress blog.  Then I realized, well, that's not fair to the people I'm mailing them to.  So I have to wait till they arrive.  And then I will post the remaining postcards on the blog.  What service did you use?  So this is Bill Atkinson, the guy who created HyperCard and most of the Macintosh software.  He has, and I don't, I worry because I think nobody's, people aren't using this.  Bill said, yeah, it's a lot of work.  It's just not generating the traffic I thought, but it's called PhotoCard.  It's an iOS app.  And it makes these laminated, large laminated cards.  It mails them too.  So I'm in Europe and I got mailed from the U.S.  It costs about a buck fifty.  That includes the postage.  These are really good quality.  Yeah, super high quality.  So, you know, you could frame them or whatever.  And I just, you know, I sent it to my mom, my kids, Lisa's parents, Lisa's sister.  I sent one to work.  It just is a way to kind of say, you know, in the past I've put it on Instagram and I don't, I think this is actually better.

But the Sony software, it's really weird software, but it will import from the camera via Wi-Fi.  So every night I'd get home, I'd copy everything over to the iPad.  So I had all the access to all that stuff.  But even though I had Lightroom, I didn't bother editing these yet.  Yeah.  But yeah, you know what?  A good lens makes a lot, all the difference in the world.  This is a really superb lens on a 42 megapixel full frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what I find as I have all.  Oh, you mean the physical lenses you're talking about?  Yeah, I'm talking about the physical.  Yeah, those are great.  I've had all of them.  What's the point?  Yeah, there are some more expensive ones that are good.  Yeah, what's the point?  Yeah.  And but but I have to say none of these were iPhone pictures.  There are a few iPhone pictures on here, but almost all of these are with a good camera.  And it's funny because I only brought one lens.  So if I needed something a little more panoramic, I would actually whip out the pixel or the iPhone.  But anyway, it's a lot of fun, a lot of fun.  And I I don't miss Instagram.  Lisa posted Instagram.  But so I put in these postcards.  It's nice that his program lets you save an image of the postcard.  So I saved the image and then post that as a blog post post as a blog post.  But when I now it's not editable text or anything.  So that's the next thing I'm going to do is make it more accessible by putting the text as the you know, you hover over to get the stamp and everything.  Yeah.  You know, the other thing he does is he lets you do custom stamps.  So I use the like that's this is I'll zoom in on a little bit here.  That's Columbus.  So the the city fathers of this is in the Seville Cathedral, the city fathers of Seville were really terrified of Columbus, especially the king, because he was became so powerful after he came back to Spain and rich Spain and made it one of the great world powers.  He was so powerful.  They were terrified of him.  So when they when he died, they shipped his body back to the new world.  He was for a long time.  He was in the in the Caribbean.  And they finally brought him back a couple of hundred years ago.  They have a they have his coffin.  And but people were worried.  Is it really Columbus?  I mean, is the corpse has been the bones have been rattled around all over the world.  So a couple of years ago, they did a DNA analysis and it is there's a couple of people still alive that are descendants of his and they were able to verify that those are actually Christopher Columbus's bones.

I don't understand the lack of a headphone jack.  I think that that's insane.  But I have to live with it.  And everybody seems to be doing it.  Apparently, according to Kass von Dinter,  there is a fourth color in the source code.  There's a line you only hear on geek shows.  There's a fourth color in the source code, pink.  Pink.  For the Google Pixel 3, it'll also be available in pink.

Well, that's exciting.  Let's see.  Oh, Google has suppressed a memo.  This is according to The Intercept.  Revealing plans to closely track search users in China.

Start time: 5102.62
End time: 5111.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Specifically, the search tool would be associated with the phone number so that the Chinese government can know exactly who's searching for what.  Yeah, this isn't Google.

Start time: 5112.00
End time: 5115.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google doesn't care.  They're doing this for the Chinese.  Yes.

Start time: 5116.52
End time: 5158.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But apparently, and this is part of the controversy which caused some...  Which tore not only their number, but their movements.  Exactly.  So this is a great tool for China's alarmingly growing surveillance state.  China's really on the forefront of using advanced technology to surveil and monitor the population and control them and stuff like that.  And this would be another example of that.  And everyone is disappointed in this because Google is the one company you could point to that said, look, they left China on principle because they were hacked by the Chinese government because the Chinese government wanted them censored, et cetera.  And they left.  And so everybody's like, oh, wow, Google's a little bit better than other companies.  But this report seems to indicate that maybe they've changed their tune and they don't want to be better than other companies.

End time: 5178.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 5178.72
End time: 5248.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But Google has had a presence in China for a very long time, as have Apple and Microsoft.  And, you know, I mean, and the challenge is that, again, from my vantage point, a lot of this work in technology and the partnerships that we're trying to see and, you know, skirting around the government in different ways.  All of this plays very neatly into Xi Jinping's New World Order, plans for a new world order in which China and China's special brand of communism has spread.  And so all of these technologies and all of these devices and search and the problem is that China is too lucrative.  There's 780 million people who are wired and that population is growing and their social mobility is growing and their economics are growing.  I mean, it's too big for companies to ignore.  So if you're a big tech titan, you want to capture part of that, you know, part of that, you know, economy.

Start time: 5249.42
End time: 5263.96

Transcript:  And so I guess it's completely.  Pollyanna ish of me to say, well, gosh, I wish American companies would stand up to authoritarian companies and say we just aren't going to do business there because we believe in freedom.

Start time: 5265.07
End time: 5296.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that too much to ask?  It's not too much. And the problem is that there isn't it's not a black and white issue.  There's a line somewhere. There is a line.  So if if the Chinese government said to Apple, OK, in order for you to sell iPhones here, you have to like execute prisoners for us in a line we're not going to cross.  That's a line. So and then there's there are other things like, you know, Apple's willing to eliminate certain apps from the app store that the Chinese government that that's on the other end of the spectrum.  A little bit more innocent. And then where is the line that's acceptable?  There's a line there somewhere that's acceptable.  That's acceptable.

Start time: 5297.12
End time: 5315.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, here's the problem. As soon as you say, well, we're going to do business in this country, then you are saying and whatever the laws are of that country, we're going to adhere to them.  Otherwise, we can't do business.  That's why we celebrated Google's decision some years ago to essentially leave China.

Start time: 5316.20

Transcript:  But, you know, we all we also ought not to be so Pollyanna issue about our own government.  I mean, listen, it's most people aren't aren't plugged into what all the governments of the world are doing, you know, and we're heading into UN week.  There's a lot that's happening right now.  And, you know, in order for the geopolitical balance to remain as as it is right now, which has Americans feeling comfortable, you know, we need we need certain kinds of technology.  There have to be certain partnerships.  The thing for me that's concerning about China specifically is is that the surveillance is a piece of this.  But but the surveillance in in in effort for what?  Like, what is the surveillance for?  And the surveillance is not just to keep people in line.  It's to help usher in this, you know, this bigger idea of China's brand of communism in the year 2049.  That's the 100 year anniversary.  And there's a lot of plans and strategic initiatives that are leading up to that.  And there are all kinds of allies that they're building all around the world.  And I think that that data collection has a lot to do with seeing that new world order come to fruition.  And like we may like this or not like it, but, you know, the big nine are all part of this.

Transcript:  Just to be clear, though, this isn't the they're the word communism is a loaded term historically.  And it's really the Chinese Communist Party that enables this social control.  They're not actually that communist and they're also not exporting their brand of communism in the way that the Soviet Union used to do.  Oh, I totally disagree.  It's kind of a different thing.  Yeah, they are.  They're dominating, exploiting economically, economically.  But they're not they're not trying to get countries to like have a Chinese style of of for the most part.

Transcript:  It's interesting. This is something the United States has done for years.  This is kind of there was a book John Dvorak used to love to talk about the confessions of an economic hit man that talked about U.S.  companies and U.S.  government with the help of the U.S.  government going into nations and essentially destroying them, particularly in South America, by exporting America.  American capitalism to these countries.  And I that's exactly what China is doing.  But there are reasons China is doing it beyond ideology.  It's not an ideological.

Start time: 5499.62
End time: 5534.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think part of it is I think they are they you know, they very much see and this hasn't changed since I lived there.  They you know, in Beijing, the CCP sees the United States and our democracy is counter to their interests.  They see us as a viable economic partner.  So we need each other.  But this is about China spreading its political geopolitical influence.  I mean, they are mucking around in the oceans that separate the mainland and Japan and slowly carving out territory, et cetera.

Start time: 5535.90
End time: 5553.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but back to this, you know, back to the technology, though, I think I think one of the interesting things about it is that in many cases,  the tech companies who sell their souls to do business in China because there are so many consumers, et cetera, are ultimately disappointed.  There's a few companies, American companies who've done very well.  KFC, for example, is doing very well.

Start time: 5571.06
End time: 5582.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Google doesn't need to do super well in China.  Google doesn't need to beat Baidu in order.  You know, a small gain in market share in China translates to a windfall of profit.  So they don't they don't have to dominate.

Start time: 5583.06
End time: 5604.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And after all, if Google, I mean, look, if this intercept story is true and Google is building in this kind of tracking capability for the Chinese government into search,  are they not in effect doing exactly where you said we should draw the line?  Are they not helping the Chinese government, for instance, detect, follow, arrest and eventually perhaps execute dissidents?  And if that's the case, well, yes, mostly.

Start time: 5605.10
End time: 5629.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We saw that happen with Yahoo.  But there are lots of Cisco is doing that.  Lots of companies are doing that in China.  Well, should we be doing that?  Personally, I think not.  And back to the point of like whether it's worth it.  I think it's I think the thing that Google should be more concerned about is losing business in the US and Europe and Japan and other places that are going to be really horrified by them doing this kind of thing.

Start time: 5630.06
End time: 5675.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think it's going to I don't think it's going to move the needle at all.  I don't think we are to we are maybe individual consumers will temporarily protest.  I'm telling you, we are too tethered at the moment to Amazon, Apple and Google for for big companies, you know, for we're too tethered to them.  They control too much of the ecosystem that we all plug into.  So it would be very, very difficult for some for a big company on principle to decide that they no longer want to work with Google as a result of Google's, you know, building something maybe or maybe not for China.  And quite frankly, I don't think people care that much in here in the United States.  I just I don't I mean, it's not a knock on Americans.  I just think we are focused on other things right now.

Start time: 5694.18
End time: 5713.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yes, let me preface this by saying I have for a very long time been talking about this is the end.  This is the beginning of the end of smartphones this year, and we're transitioning into what comes next.  I believe what's next are smart glasses.  Totally agree.  And everybody who says I was a glass hole before anybody else.

Start time: 5714.12

Start time: 5716.44
End time: 5776.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So for everybody, you know, so anyhow, for people who say I would never wear glasses, all of the data, there's all these studies out showing how quickly we are all becoming nearsighted because of the screens.  And so with that being said, that's by the way, I'm going to introduce the iPhone XS Max.  That's part of the reason why.  So so this headset, I've experimented with lots of different wearable devices and, you know, I had glass.  I've had lots of different smart glasses.  I've tried how the lens the only other experience that I can compare to the first time that I put on Magic Leap, which is what I'm about to do, was when I was living in Japan and I was in Akihabara.  And I saw a prototype phone that was connected to the Internet.  And I mean, see, it was not that exciting.  But but like from the interface, you saw what it meant.  Yeah, I mean, it changed everything.  And so when I put this is remarkable.  Yeah.

Start time: 5777.30
End time: 5789.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  No. So this is the other thing.  The founders, I think, have done some stupid things like promising to speak at a TED event, and they probably just didn't have something ready to show or talk about.  So instead, they showed up in spacesuits and dance around for like seven minutes to freaky sounding music.

Start time: 5820.26

Start time: 5843.08
End time: 5865.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is yes. OK.  The difference is that this is Microsoft version of this.  Right. This turns any space that you're in in seconds into a spatial computing environment.  So you do have to put the glasses on.  They are not going to look like this forever.  You are not going to have to carry a heavy pack around forever.  So that works completely untethered.

Start time: 5866.00

End time: 5891.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you're tethered here, but the suit is happening in the cloud.  Or some of it.  So but I map, for example, the room that I'm in and the entire room then is turned into a spatial computing environment where for the moment.  So I can see everybody just fine.  I can connect to people in other cities and I can see them in the space where I'm in.

Start time: 5896.77
End time: 5926.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because AR is more of a two dimensional.  It's overlaying somebody else's images onto an existing space.  This is interactive.  So if I because it responds to gesture, it responds to other elements.  So if I you can have little creatures and fish like I turn my office into an aquarium for fun and you can sort of push the fish out of the way and you're moving around and you can bring other.  You can touch them.

I put these on my husband who we put a hole in the ground, a virtual hole.  And he, you know, he knew that it was not real, but it looks real.  Yeah.  And he had a hard time walking toward it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what I would say.  It is abundantly clear to me that, you know, this is quickly progressing.  This headset, which is big and clunky right now, is the form factor is going to look more like glasses.  Yeah.  At some point.

Start time: 5983.58
End time: 5987.00

Start time: 6001.20
End time: 6072.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, no, no, no. Well, it's they were actually talking about retinal projection at some point.  So this is right.  So here's here's what I would say.  Nobody.  Nobody. We have to give these guys time.  And I have no horse in this race at all.  I'm not an investor.  I don't know them personally.  I'm just telling you that what I have currently seen absolutely blew me away.  And I very rarely get blown away by new technology.  And my concern is that if they don't suddenly have a bunch of apps and products and market and they don't have a consumer product ready right away, everybody's going to call them a failure.  This technology is still a decade for it to really hit the mainstream and do things that are more than just playing games like what you're seeing right now.  I hate these things like import your grandmother into your living room and have a conversation with her or see real time data.  Like here's a great implementation.  During the next debate or congressional hearing, I've got my glasses on and every single time somebody speaks, I can see what packs they've donated to.  I can see who they have financial ties to.  I mean, all of that stuff is on our near horizon, but we've got to give these guys times to some time to work.

Start time: 6073.42
End time: 6108.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's actually an augmented reality feature.  But overall, it's not it's not it's just one of the things you can do.  But one of the things that for skeptics out there.  I'm a skeptic. OK, first, get skeptics.  So you like regular look at look at this screen here.  You have this big screen is beautiful. It's physical.  It's there. OK, the most banal usage for Magic Leap is one that we can all relate to.  Imagine a world where screens of any size were free.  How many would you have? Where would you put them?  Well, look at my office. I have about 20 of them.  They weren't free. They're expensive.

Start time: 6108.44

End time: 6135.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 6135.04
End time: 6142.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The difference is if you put it on the wall and then you leave the room, it stays in the room behind you just like a physical screen.  It's there when you come back in the room.  It just gives me a headache.

Start time: 6144.78
End time: 6196.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  VR should give you a headache because the technology has not progressed enough so that we've solved for lag.  And VR has very, very, very limited use cases.  So VR works for games and it works for certain types of storytelling like a movie.  It does not work for most other things.  It's got a therapeutic use, but it came to market first.  And so the problem is that we've conflated and we've had the first AR apps came out immediately after the first iPhone launched.  So there was something called Retour, which was an early days AR app to help you get around the city of Paris.  So, you know, and then Google Glass came out and it should never have been marketed as a consumer device.  And they, you know, they had all kinds of PR problems.  The underlying technology was interesting.  So, but they're different things.

Start time: 6197.18
End time: 6223.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things that this technology will do is it will bring us back to a world of superstition and ghosts and things like that, because there's already a company.  Oh, great.  There's already a company in Japan where you can have a virtual version of the people at the grave site or potentially at the place where they were killed in a highway or something, where we put on the goggles, you see them standing there waving.  The difference psychologically between that and a ghost is zero.  That's essentially what a ghost is.  But in Japan, there's a different company.

Start time: 6224.96
End time: 6292.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't heard of what you're talking about, but there is another company that has built an interactive horror experience.  So if you're really into like haunted houses and scary movies, it turns wherever you're wherever you are into a spatial computing environment with their sensory and haptic.  I feel like the Sony CSL is a piece of this, but it puts the horror all around you.  So there are some entertainment purposes.  Kind of like this show.  These, I'm telling you, these, I can see these being a productivity element.  If you're a manager in an office and being able to sort of create a visual map very clearly of whatever it is that you're trying to track.  I cannot say enough.  This headset is hard to wear.  It kind of sort of comes in and out.  I've got pretty bad vision, so sometimes it autocorrects me, sometimes it doesn't.  And at the moment, there's not a ton that you can do.  But what I can do, I can clearly see the future.  And if everybody would just give these guys a break and let them work, stop expecting a product.

Transcript:  Five years from now, this technology will mainstream.  There'll be two or three basic kinds.  There'll be the Magic Leap HoloLens types, which will be for work or for high end entertainment or for serious uses.  Kind of like how we use high end PCs now.  We can use them for high end gaming, high end business, whatever.  There will be the glasses that will look just like the glasses that Amy's wearing right now, which won't be detectable as AR glasses.  But they'll be AR.  We'll walk around.  We'll see little screens.  They'll be 2D.  We won't have mapping to the walls right away.  And then the third type, which is already available, which is I think kind of cool, is bone conduction audio where you talk to the A word or you talk to Siri or whatever.  And you but you do that all day.  The benefit of that is two, three, four day battery life.  And also you don't have things in your ears all the time.  But but this is happening imminently.  I think that I think the glasses are going to be super mainstream.  I think that's a little aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The glasses are definitely a decade out just for a variety of reasons.  But you can actually see that they play a big role in the first.  So if you watch that show, you'll see everybody wearing the glasses that we're talking about and some kind of earbud or bone conducting device so that they can talk.  I could see.  You should try them.  You should try.  Have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're not going to use them.  There's no reason to buy them right now.  It really is.  They're more than two thousand.  Twenty five hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And unless you're built like I'm building stuff and trying to you need things out.  You need them.  But nobody else should buy them at the moment because you can't do very much.

Start time: 6388.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you should at least put a set on and just I mean, I'm willing to stipulate that somebody was I can't remember who maybe any of that cost.  Look, remember when you first got the Atari video console system and how primitive those games are.  You know, we're at that stage and I'm willing to stipulate that that we're we're at a very, very, very early stage.  And what you see today is primitive.  I think that there's a more fun maybe maybe and I've and I've in the past said, oh, it'd be really great to have reputation scores over people's heads or.  I'm not convinced.  I mean, you could have said, well, before the Echo came out, well, you're never going to talk.  Would you ever talk to your house?  No, that's silly.  But I can I found some use cases for that.  Eventually get hooked on it.  You have to have it.  I guess that that's the case with this.  But it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where this would be a must have technology.  But you better imagine that to be addictive.  Yeah, I could see it being addictive.  But I mean, being able to have my talk to my grandma, I mean, I can do that with a couple of accelerants.

Start time: 6454.12
End time: 6480.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a couple of accelerants that are that are first of all, over the next couple of decades, everybody in an industrialized nation is going to need glasses much sooner and at a greater scale than we've ever needed before.  Your husband is happy.  Of course, he's happy.  Where is he?  But but but but so if we are all so like that's an accelerant that will cause the adoption rate to spike because we've already got something.  I already wear spectacles all the time.  So that's not a big deal for me.

Start time: 6482.00
End time: 6489.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, that's not that was in a disadvantage.  You wear spectacles.  But but so I'm willing to say, yeah, people get used to that.

Start time: 6491.02
End time: 6583.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So now if you go back to, let's say, 10 years ago, you know, I know a ton of people who would have said, I don't want to I don't want to see somebody when I talk to the phone when I talk to them on the phone.  I don't want to see them.  That's you know, just just just voice is fine.  I feel weird talking, you know, seeing video.  And our adoption rate, you know, changed.  It took a while for that.  But yeah, it took a little while.  But there is what I think that, you know, one of the things that's fundamental to human nature, regardless of where in the world we live or what nationality we are, culture, gender, anything else is a is a need for intimacy.  And part of why we adopt certain technologies faster has to do with fulfilling that that need for intimacy that we have and that that feeling of closeness.  So just as an example, when when VR and we've been hearing about social isolationism for a very long time and how all this new technology VR, AR, AI is going to spread us all apart.  We're actually seeing the opposite happening in lots of different places.  So video game arcades are back.  They are popping up all over the place because they're mixed reality and VR arcades where you can go in and wire into stuff that you couldn't afford on your own.  We're seeing silent discos.  Have you gotten you guys?  Yeah, yeah, they're hilarious.  So so you you have headphones on and there's four different DJs all playing at the same time.  And you can be with other people in the same place having an experience that's good for you, but you still have that level of intimacy.

Start time: 6583.10
End time: 6607.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So funny because the two headsets, everything you just described to me is a faux intimacy.  And I think some of the backlash against social media is we thought that that was going to be intimacy and that was going to satisfy that.  And it's a faux intimacy that is actually like fake sugar poisoning our systems.  Or is it is it different sugars?  Well, that's a good question.  Maybe my kids will consider it real intimacy.

Start time: 6607.90
End time: 6657.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, because like just for the going back to the club thing for a minute, like I don't like I used to go out when I lived in like I used to when I was younger in my youth, I used to go out to clubs and go dancing.  I usually hated the music that was being played and I sort of forced myself because I wanted to hang out with my friends.  What are you hanging out with your friends when you got headphones on?  Everybody's got headphones on and the cool thing is that a lot of people are interacting with your friends.  Well, if you're dancing with people, you can't and you can't hear them anyways, but you can see they're color banded.  So depending on which DJ you're tuned to, you can find your tribe.  Yeah, I think it's intimacy expressed in a different way.  I think there's plenty of to your excellent point.  There are like plenty of ways this goes bad and it's faux intimacy.  But I think some of this is just change.

Start time: 6659.60
End time: 6687.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I understand that and what we consider, you know, old people like me consider intimacy is different than you young people.  But I think when you talk about biological needs, those things are hardwired.  Those aren't going to change. And that real intimacy is hardwired.  I don't think you can say technology is going to create a new form of intimacy.  It's either intimacy or it's not.  Yeah, so we don't know. And I and I acknowledge it could be different.

Transcript:  This this this is a subtle driver.  I mean, if you look at just podcasting, why is podcasting better than television or radio?  No offense, because I know you also do radio, but it is radio.

Start time: 6699.12
End time: 6709.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the funny thing. Yeah, this is radio.  But but in general, podcasting actually a medium that started in the 20s.  But but in general, podcasting is different.  It's different. It's it's more intimate.

End time: 6792.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I may have a different viewpoint on this because I lived by myself overseas for many, many, many years.  And, you know, if I you missed your grandma, you missed your grandma.  It'd been great to have everybody. I mean, I was you know, it's like I missed a lot of things.  And if I had the opportunity to be in my house and have on a pair of something like a Magic Leap  and have and have a conversation with two or three of my friends  and be able to see them moving around versus just squares on a two dimensional screen.  I think for me, that gives me a better like when I've played a multiplayer game with leap, you do have this.  I mean, it's it's Mike, you kind of nailed it talking about ghosts, but it's a ghost in a different way.  And you do feel more I felt more connected because I don't know.  There's there's an additional element of movement.

Start time: 6792.66
End time: 6807.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's the real question is I think ultimately is going to be is that satisfying?  Is it real intimacy or is it is it tricking our mind into thinking we're not alone when we really are alone?  And that'll be interesting to watch that play out.

Start time: 6807.18
End time: 6834.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. That word alone is a good word because you kind of like you you don't feel as alone.  Right. Even though you were the only person in that space and you can see it, you know, you see everything.  You just also see, you know, because you're in a spatial computing environment, you see other stuff.  Yeah, it's it's really it's a keep bumping into the microphone.  I'm so excited. It's really interesting.  And Leo, you should at least try them on.

Transcript:  I see stuff and I'm like, like this iPhone.  I found like, yeah, yeah.  Again, like I'm this this headset.  Is you're not going to buy and do anything with it, but this is not what I'm excited about.  What I'm excited is, you know, and that's why I want everybody to just leave them alone and let them like like let's curb our expectations here for an annual product launch.  Just let them do their work. It's really hard stuff.

Start time: 6868.66
End time: 6892.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the only people you have to convince that of is their investors.  And I think that their investors, it's actually been a fascinating story because the journalists like Kevin Kelly and the investors who have seen this before anybody else has are completely sold on it.  Yeah. And the rest of the world, like me, is saying, well, really?  And and but all but but the magically as much time as investors want to give it right.

Start time: 6893.00
End time: 6942.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but they're colored by this.  But this is true of any technology that the tech journalists and part of being a social media is, I think, forced some of this.  But there's an awful lot of snark.  Like, I know very few tech journalists who can talk about Magic Leap in any way without also feeling an obligation to be snarky about it.  And, you know, we they are they are they are building something that we have not seen before.  You know, again, I just and and there's plenty of magic also happening at at Google and at Amazon and at Salesforce, lots of different places.  We just have to somehow extract ourselves from this idea that there must be a product that conforms to a 12 month calendar.  Otherwise, they have failed.  There is a very American thing to do.

Start time: 6943.36
End time: 6951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a distinction between snark and skepticism.  Sure.  And I would hope that I'm not snarky, but I'm skeptical about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A lot of tech journalists get confused about what they're covering, whether they're covering the stock market or whether they're covering the actual hardware and software.  And the thing that Amy and I both if we have one thing in common is that we are obsessed with the cultural effects of technology, which is everything.  And the technology itself is really not that important, at least to me.  And so when you're snarky about Magic Leap, essentially you're getting confused about what's happening.  What you should be focused on is how is this going to change human life?  Not like, oh, this isn't that much better than the HoloLens thing I saw a year ago.  That doesn't matter how much better it is than it was.  Right.  It doesn't matter. That's an inconsequential observation.

Start time: 6999.04
End time: 7021.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an interesting problem also because companies have to decide what they're going to work on.  Individuals, people, entrepreneurs have to decide what they're going to work on.  And they're, of course, very much influenced.  They can't help it. But the environment around them, the snarky tech press, the science fiction that they read is no accident.  Almost everything new and exciting is basically science fiction.  People are making.

Start time: 7022.00
End time: 7084.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, like that's why.  If you guys honestly, some of the best sci fi that I've ever read was not sci fi.  And hopefully it's not fi at all.  It's the patents. There are several Magic Leap patents that that describe in a William Gibson ask sort of way what this technology ultimately becomes.  They are fascinating.  Anybody that wants to can go on to the USPTO dot gov website, just type in keyword Magic Leap and just start looking.  I mean, a lot of the patents are very long and obviously they're technical in nature.  But but there are in many of them, there are chunks where it reads like a science fiction novel.  And, you know, it doesn't just because they've described it doesn't mean that it necessarily happens or it happens on a time frame that you agree with.  But it is totally worth your time.  It's like it's like worth an hour of your time to just go through the USPTO.

Start time: 7084.46
End time: 7096.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and also it would be it would behoove me to point out that there are reasons, many reasons people make patent applications.  And one of them is preemptively the hope that they could have had something that somebody someday is going to invent so they can sue them.

Transcript:  Anybody who's interested in the future, honestly, like you can you can put a couple of keyword searches in the USPTO.  Yeah. And they'll send you emails of like any new patent that's been filed that mentions whatever it is.  Just a good way to stay on top of things.

I'm going to give you a few of those.  But first, I would like to tell you about a new show that we're not a new show, but a new edition of a show we've been doing for a long time called Know How.  When Father Robert left, we decided we were going to kind of take turns doing know how.  Megan Moroney did a whole series with Florence Ion on IOT.  We've got a new series coming up with Jason Howell, but I'll let him tell you all about it.

You already know Megan Moroney and Florence Ion are wrapping up their excellent season on the Internet of Things.  And now it's going to be my turn to spend a few months focused on an entirely different facet of technology.  And I figured if given the choice, why not choose something really fun?  And that's exactly what we've done with Know How gaming.  The always awesome Samiskovich from Ars Technica will join me each week as we dive into a number of important gaming topics, including console tips and tricks, virtual reality, live broadcasting gameplay, mobile gaming, classic gaming, console hacking, and even a holiday gift guide.  We're covering it all leading up to the new year, and we hope you'll be along for the ride.

Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Let's talk about the future.  The future is interest rates are going up, aren't they?  And that means when you go out to buy that new home, you're going to be paying a little bit more, maybe not right up front, but over time.  In fact, a quarter point in interest rates going up thousands of dollars, maybe tens of thousands of dollars over the 30 year loan.  That's why Rocket Mortgage has decided to do something special to take some of the anxiety out of home shopping.  They call it the power buying process.  Three steps that will make home buying a pleasure.  First of all, go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2. That's twit the number two.  And answer a few questions. You can do this, by the way, it's so easy to do.  You could do this not only in your home computer, but on your phone while you're in an open house.  Or just do it now. Set up the account. Answer a few simple questions.  They'll check your credit for pre-qualified approval. They'll do that within just a few minutes.  That's enough to get you started.  Within 24 hours, though, they will then verify your income, your assets, and your credit.  All of this without any effort on your part. No 20 page application.  No going to the attic to find paperwork.  They'll do it all for you and give you a verified approval within 24 hours.  That means you have the strength of a cash buyer.  When you're buying that house, you're good for it. You're good for the money.  The seller loves that. They say, oh, good. They got the loan approved.  In fact, you can even get a nice little approval letter.  You can print out if you want to show them. It makes a big difference.  But here's the best part. Once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  And this is one of the things that really takes the anxiety out.  With rate shield approval, they'll lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  If the rates go up, nope, your rate stays the same. If rates go down, your rate will drop.  But either way, you win.  It's exactly what you'd expect from a company that's focused on its customers.  Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row, according to JD Power.  It's Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage.  To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit to take, you know, it's enough.  You're writing a big check. You're buying a house. It's a big deal as it is.  Let's not make it any more anxiety ridden.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit to for rate shield approval.  Only valid in certain 30 year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 3030.  It's rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number two rocketmortgage.com slash twit to.  And we thank Rocket Mortgage for being such a great supporter throughout the year.  And they're coming back next year. We're glad to hear that too.  We're going to get back to the tech news in a minute.  Of course, while I was away, the shows go on thanks to our great hosts.

Start time: 7538.00
End time: 7668.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I didn't really publicize that as much as I should have.  It's audio only.  I think it started because we interviewed the author of the book Valley of Genius and on triangulation.  I'm sitting, I'm talking to him. It's a great book.  Adam Fisher talks to hundreds of people who made Silicon Valley what it is.  And I mean hundreds.  And at the end of the conversation, triangulation, he said, yeah, I got many, many hundreds of hours of tape.  I said, what? You have audio of all this? Yeah.  I said, you know, a book was a good idea, but I think a podcast might be better.  So what we've done is we've just in there.  They're not long. I think they're 15 minutes, half an hour.  That's really smart. Yeah, we've got was we've got the third founder of Google.  You know, everybody talks about Sergey Brin and Larry Page.  But there was a guy was his name, Adam Hassan, who did all the code.  He was the third. He was the fifth. He did all the coding for Google.

And is that at some point insurance companies would start to say, well, did you work out yesterday?  Right. Now they are. Another one.  A coding error sent several hundred Subaru Ascent's to the car crusher.  They now we've heard before of coding errors in the firmware of the car and that you just fix the firmware.  This coding error was in the robot arm that did the spot welds.  And they spot weld when they put the thing together, they weld the metal together, right?  The robot arms that are doing that, they need to hit all the spots.  Apparently, the software was buggy and missed some critical spot welds, making it unsafe to drive those cars because they could just fall apart.  No physical remedy was available.  Therefore, Subaru is destroying the vehicles because of bad code.  And finally, we were talking about Salesforce, but I didn't know this Mark Benny off of Salesforce.

Transcript:  Finally, we've said over and over that Equifax never paid for the breach, that they got away  with murder.  Remember, 140 million records, everybody's social, everything leaked to the bad guys.  And Equifax executives never suffered for that.  There was no fine.  There was no punishment.  Well, there is now.  I'm very happy to say.  Public floggings.  Almost public floggings.  A new federal law that was passed on Friday now allows you to freeze and unfreeze your  credit in every state of the union for free.  The price of this has varied.  In some states it was free, but in many states it was as much as $12 per bureau per freeze.  Yes, that's ridiculous.  It was ridiculous.  I didn't know that.  So the federal law now says that you can freeze and unfreeze your credit without being charged.  They also increased the length of a fraud alert.  So credit freeze is the most draconian thing you can do.  You say, don't give anybody any credit information.  This is the thing the credit bureaus, this is why it's a punishment.  Hate because they can't make any money off of you because they're basically told no,  no one can ask for my credit report.  That's a credit freeze.  A fraud alert is a little bit less severe.  It tells lenders that your personal data might have been compromised and you should really  verify identity.  It was before approving credit.  But those only lasted three days.  Now they last a year thanks to this new law.  So this is really good news if you don't like these credit reporting agencies and you want  to stick it to them or if you're concerned you should investigate both fraud alerts and  credit freezes.  Where did this law come from?  That's a really good question.  I want to give...

Transcript:  There were some states where the state law said, no, you can't do, that's ridiculous.  But there were states like California, it was a very expensive process that kept people  essentially from doing it because if you wanted to buy a house or buy a car, you had to unfreeze  it.  They would charge you to do that and then freeze it again.  They would charge you to do that.  Now it's free.  And you know what?  I don't know who passed that law.  I don't even know what the law is.

Transcript:  Well, except for the fact that the only reason that Experian, Equifax and TransUnity exist  is to sell that data.  That's how they make a living.  So, you know, the credit freezes.  The credit freezes.  That's why I call this a punishment.  And it's not just a punishment to Equifax.  It's a punishment to all the credit bureaus because really this is saying, no, you can't...  Something had to be done.  You can't profit off my data.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, you should learn the differences if you're going to take advantage of this, folks,  between a freeze and a fraud alert.  It may not be appropriate for everybody in every situation.  If you're a young person and you're applying for credit cards and buying cars and buying  houses, a credit freeze is a bad idea.  Somebody like me who no longer does any of that.
