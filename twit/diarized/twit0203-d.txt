Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Welcome to This Week in Tech.  I am Tom Merritt sitting in for Leo Laporte, who is vacationing in China.  Thank you, Leo, for letting me do this.  It's really fun.  We've got an all-star panel for today's Revenge of the Screen Savers.  I mean, This Week in Tech.  On my right, Ryan Block, editor of Gadgets, spell G-D-G-T.  Welcome, Ryan.  Thank you.  Thank you for being here.  Thank you, honorary Leo.  You can insert plug here.  That's what Dvorak did last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm cool.  I'm good.  That's all I needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, cool.  On my left, Veronica Belmont, host of Sword and Laser at SwordandLaser.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you do anything else?  Yes, yes.  Tekzilla on Revision 3 with Patrick Norton.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And also Core.  And also Core.  Up in the belt free, Roger Chang, who was just on the live stream doing East Meets West  with me.  Hey, Roger.  Hello.  Welcome to the show.  Roger's senior producer at Revision 3.  That means he's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's my boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's my boss.  I sign her checks.  Actually, no, I OK her checks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And saving the best for last, very happy to have Robert Llewellyn.  You might know him as Crichton from Red Dwarf, but he's the host of a fantastic podcast called  Carpool.  Welcome, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you very much for having me.  It's great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And where can people find Carpool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can find Carpool on iTunes.  At the moment, it's the pick of the week in the UK.  It's doing very well on iTunes.  Or you can find it on Lootube, which is the same as YouTube, only with my name at the  beginning, double L-E-W-T-U-B-E dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fantastic.  We are going to try to talk about some tech news on This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm OK with that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody good with that?  I don't know.  I think tech news is kind of overrated, but I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Personally.  The pick of the week was the Chrome operating system coming out.  This is an operating system that is targeted at small laptops, so netbook type situation.  And it's not even out yet.  It's only been announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a twinkle in Google's eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  They say they've got some some versions running in-house, but they haven't really showed much  off.  There have been some leaked pictures out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the leaked pictures turned out to be fake.  So what are you going to do about that?  Or are they?  But it's going to look a lot like.  No, they're pretty fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's going to look like Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just going to be basically boot into a browser.  That's kind of the assumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The idea for this is that you're living on the web, probably through Google services like  Google Docs and Gmail.  Is that something that we want, Robert?  Is that going to help your life out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I can't see.  I'm a bit stuck with not being that bothered about operating systems.  And I know I should be.  I mean, I use a Mac and I've used a Mac for 20 something years.  I really want to see it.  And what I know is you'll all be talking about it for years in the United States before I  even see it, unless I come over and actually have a look.  So I know it's going to be a long time before I get to see something like that.  I'm very interested in it because I would love it.  Certainly a thing I want is a little foldy little laptop that's small, you know, because  I use my iPhone instead of a laptop now.  And it would be great to have a laptop that was small and ran on something that wasn't  Windows.  That would be a huge advantage to me.  I would be very interested in seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no shortage of machines out there right now that are non-Windows and that are  netbook based.  There's a lot of Ubuntu, a lot of Linux based networks out there.  Very lightweight builds, yeah.  And so this isn't anything groundbreaking in that regard.  I think the unusual thing here is that Google is throwing out the X windowing system, which  is what Linux has run on for years and years.  I think by most people kind of considered to be a little bit antiquated at this point.  And they're doing their own new windowing system, which at least in my opinion, that's  kind of been the one thing that Linux has needed to kind of make itself really viable  for mass end user consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're building it around the Linux kernel, but they're building everything else  from the ground up as far as we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so most of your Linux apps that you normally think of like, I don't know, Pidgin  or Firefox probably will not work.  They would have to be rewritten for this because it's a different visual, different windowing  system.  And that's assuming that Google even opens it up to native apps.  They're right now just kind of talking about the web app aspect, which this is really kind  of smacking of Apple back in 2007 with the original iPhone.  How that was originally, they said no native apps, all of your apps are going to be web  apps.  And of course nobody bought that.  Right now I don't think that's going to work for Google here either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, the difference is though, they didn't have a good offline strategy for your web apps  on the iPhone.  Because Google does have Google gears and there's Adobe Air.  So there is a way to get those apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not so much about offline.  It's about hardware access.  It's about actually being able to take advantage of the fact that this is a computer.  I mean, if you're going to buy a computer, if you're going to spend the money and you're  going to have audio outputs and you're going to have, you know, 3G potentially, things  like that, it needs to be able to support that.  You can't do everything in a browser.  You just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thanks for a long time has needed somebody big to come in and popularize it, standardize  it, make it easier to use.  Everyone has been thinking Ubuntu is that.  And now some of the Ubuntu crowds a little upset.  Roger, do you think Google is actually going to make things worse or better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It kind of depends on what path they take.  If they go into a vertically integrated kind of Apple-esque where we control, you know,  by either strictly controlling the SDK or not making an open source.  You know, it could just be another, you know, another kind of Apple-like product where,  you know, it's in the minority, but it's not going to necessarily take over everything  where people, hey, that's kind of cool.  But you know, I'm going to stick with Windows because Windows lets me do A, B and C so much  better.  I'm going to stick with some Linux distro because it lets me do A, B, C or roll my own  application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's already said, though, it's going to be open source.  They've been really upfront about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they have to be, right?  Because they're using the kernel.  So they have to open source a lot of it anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The low level has to be open source by GPL.  But everything they build on top of the kernel can be closed source.  But they've already said everything that they're doing with this project is going to be open  source.  They've put out a call to action to the open source community to help them out and help  make Chrome OS great.  Chrome itself is already open source.  I don't think there's anything really that's closed source about Chrome.  So it seems like they want to do this thing.  They want to build the operating system.  But they don't want to take it the Apple or the Microsoft route closed sourcing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now a rumored announcement for tomorrow is Microsoft's Gazelle browser.  I think Scobel has been leading the charge on thinking, well, maybe this is why Google  announced the Chrome OS is to upstage Gazelle.  But what do we know about Gazelle, Veronica?  It seems like it's a browser project from everything I've read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's not too much information out there from what I've read so far.  But it seems as though it's going to be something that maybe will be integrated into IE in the  future.  I don't know if it's going to be a whole separate browser.  Is it going to be something that a technology that they build into IE later on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting because it's confusing for people that they have a kernel.  They talk about building on a kernel within the browser Gazelle.  The way Chrome actually has a process for every tab.  They are extending that to processes for every element.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Are they building images perhaps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or running ads.  Any kind of frame or iframe.  That would make it more secure.  Yeah, I don't mean, it's a good concept.  I think it's something that Microsoft certainly is going to benefit by doing.  But I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one knows IE could use the help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, they're also, you know, the word right now is that it's going to be  based still on Windows.  I think we all kind of know that at this point Windows needs a pretty bold reboot and that  it's not going to come from the browser.  So I'm not sure that this is really kind of the answer to it.  I think this is this is a an answer to a next generation browser.  But I don't know if this is how Microsoft is going to fend off Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Have you seen the ads for the new IE for IE 8?  The ones with Dean Cain as the host?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I haven't seen those yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are.  They're pretty funny, but they actually had one that was pulled.  Because it was so disgustingly awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Robert, did you see that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen this.  No, I've heard a lot about it, but I don't know.  I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to give you a brief rundown, it starts with a guy leaving his laptop on the kitchen  table and his wife asking if she can use it.  And then she goes and clicks on the browser and he must have something horrible, like  two girls, one cup style up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what everyone that's what everyone thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So she starts.  Don't search for that, everyone.  Sorry. Well, that's not a swear word.  So she starts projectile vomiting on him, like repeatedly over and over and over.  And that's just kind of the commercial.  That's all that happens.  It's like, keep this from happening.  Use secure browsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Roger's just smoking away over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen it, but I'm seeing it now.  It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was pretty clever.  I like it that they're at least trying something new, innovative with their advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's certainly attention getting, but then they went and they pulled it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, too much complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once it goes viral, they yank it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's an even better way to get attention.  I know.  That's good strategy.  I mean, that's that's probably actually how they really got to stay viral,  was by yanking it.  That might have actually been in the entire plan.  That was probably on the plan, like step five after it's out, yank it a day later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And come on, Dean Cain. So awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, I love him.  Come on.  I love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scott Johnson loves him, too.  That's fine.  See?  I'm not alone in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dean Cain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a good looking guy.  Back me up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the guy who presented it at the end?  No, probably no.  Cain in the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a guy from Lose and Clark, the New Adventures of Superman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes, I've seen him.  Yes. All right.  Yes, he's gorgeous.  I love him.  I love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm the only one in Bivalent.  Ryan's the only one who doesn't like him.  I don't know.  I don't I don't not like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just, you know, I like you're at Bivalent.  I mean, you know, I feel threatened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I've derailed us slightly.  Yeah, we need to get his back online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do we have Dvorak on a soundboard or something?  Let's talk about some tech news.  A interesting posting on Techblog at blogs.cron.com  says that you'll be able to upgrade your Windows 7 release  candidate, that you won't actually,  as long as it's activated, you won't actually  have to reinstall Vista or XP.  You can go straight from the release candidate  to your legally purchased version of Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is fantastic, except for the fact that, I mean,  wasn't, I don't know, isn't this kind of the expectation already?  He'd be able to do, I mean, you know.  There was all the upgrade on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You couldn't do it with the beta.  And there were a lot of people saying,  oh, they're not going to allow it from the release candidate.  If you've downloaded the release candidate,  you're going to have to show your Vista or XP license  by putting it in.  And what this is saying is you don't even have to do that.  You can just upgrade right off the release candidate.  That's good.  You can buy the upgrade version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it typically better to do a clean install anyway?  Or does it not really matter?  Because it does make you do a clean install.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the difference?  I mean, it just means you don't.  At the end of the day, it's just an activation.  And an activation takes 20 seconds anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could conceivably not have Vista or XP  and be able to upgrade off the free release candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is like this is kind of getting to the point of,  you know, like it's so pedantic, you know,  to worry about some of these details with Windows.  I mean, I think that the larger problem here  is the way that Windows upgrading and installation works  in general.  And, you know, I mean, one of the things I really like about Snow Leopard  is that when it does get released this year and when you install it,  it's not only going to just go ahead and install over what you've got now, Leopard,  or Tiger, or what have you.  It's actually going to take some of that other junk off there  and free up some space during the installation process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did that a couple of days ago with the developer's version.  And I think I gained back like six gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's like a crazy concept coming from the Windows world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly, because we're used to with all operating systems,  when you upgrade, it takes away space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, so it's not controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we agree with you.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My question is, is it then conceivable for someone  to upgrade from the release candidate without necessarily having  owned either Vista or XP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Correct.  If you need to reinstall the finished version of Windows 7 later,  you're going to have to have XP or Vista.  But as long as you never reinstall it, you can actually  take your release candidate from what this guy is saying  and upgrade it directly.  So it's a money saver for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if that's just pushing people to get the release candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As Patrick would have said right now, I like that thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  He will be joining us later to say that, one would hope.  Yeah, we are hoping to get Patrick Gordon on the show.  His car may have fallen on him, or he may have a baby emergency.  We don't want him to have to.  Oh, wait, wait.  I just saw him pop up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, see?  It's like Beetlejuice.  You say his name three times.  He heard me talking about him.  He shows up.  Well, he would appreciate this using electrical outlets  and cheap lasers to steal data story.  We'll see if we can entice him in with this.  Did you guys take a look at this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Veronica and I were joking about this on the web.  This actually reminds me of that theoretical hack.  I don't know.  I don't remember the name of it.  But it was that hack where if you get near enough  with a truck-sized Gaussian scanner that you could theoretically  pick up a monitor signal from outside of a building, which I've always  thought was a really hilarious concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And I remember when we did that story on the screensavers,  there was a story along with it.  And I can't remember if it was the same people  about just this thing.  This story is saying you can plug into an electrical outlet  and be able to read the electrical feedback from a keyboard  and tell what the different keystrokes are  and find out what people are typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's this laser thing where the lasers can pick up  vibrations and then blah, blah, blah.  Here's what it basically assumes at the end of the day.  Because the electrical one is, I think, like 15 meters,  is as far as you're going to be able to get to get  a clean signal or a clean enough signal to use it.  And then you've got the lasers where  it's got to be line of sight.  It can't be, obviously, too powerful.  And you have to get the reflector set up in the room  so you can start collecting it.  Basically, it assumes you have access to the machine.  If you have access to the machine, all bets are off anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's probably so many other ways  to get into the computer in the first place  if you're in the general area.  Like, why can't you just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So like, you're in the next hotel room  and you plug into the outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then you're probably on the hotel's network anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you don't have physical access to the machine.  What if they're off the network and typing  their secret emails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess.  Yeah.  I guess if they're offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a person who's next door to you off the network.  And what are you going to do with any of that data anyway  if they're off the network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This wouldn't work with a laptop anyway either.  So if someone's in a hotel, the laser won't work with a laptop.  But the keyboard one is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It assumes that you need some level of connectivity  to actually do something with this anyway.  I mean, if they're just typing into a box  and they're not connected to anything.  I don't know.  It's just like, it's fine.  I mean, it's really clever.  But it's so impractical.  And at that point, it's a lot easier, I think,  for most people to just either break in or wait  till they have physical access or wait  till that person connects to the Wi-Fi network  and sniff their packets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just like the idea of lasers.  Of course.  Laser beams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's lasers.  You have a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is sort of a-  I know I do like lasers.  Yeah.  You're more, but you're the sword side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm typically on the sword end of things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This story is fun for that reason,  for the laser and the weirdness aspect.  But Robert, does this scare you at all?  Are you at all worried about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not in the slightest bit worried.  In what?  Anyway, whatever.  I mean, for a start, my office is in a very remote, rural  location.  If someone can shine a laser beam through my window,  they're welcome to read whatever they can.  I mean, it just seems dark, because all the intrusion  that you may get on your computer  is coming through the little wire that's plugged in the back,  not as in the internet, as in people hacking into it,  as in all that.  Recording keystroke.  There's so much software that does exactly this already.  That's much more worrying than somebody coming in my room  and I'm not here and putting a laser beam that's pointing  at something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's so many other ways to be worried already.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's plenty of other ways to be absolutely freaked out  with paranoia.  I don't really need this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just an extra.  We can throw it on the stack, but it doesn't change much.  No, and this actually reminds me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and is probably a good segue into that other story  that we have from this week, which is about insecure Wi-Fi  networks that are cropping up all over at airports.  I mean, that to me seems like a much more likely scenario  for people to get passwords, sniffed, your packets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how many times have you been in an airport  and seen those peer-to-peer networks come up?  Free airport wireless.  Right.  It's like, oh, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Has anyone ever connected to one of those here?  No, because I tried to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I have.  Really?  And it worked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but a long time ago.  Yes, it did.  I got a signal and I got emails.  And then I switched it off.  But it certainly worked.  This is probably five to six years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And probably change your passwords, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably change my passwords.  It was in LAX.  It was in your neck of the woods.  I wasn't even looking for a signal.  Suddenly I saw it.  I go, oh, I got a signal.  Get me email.  And then I went, oh, where did that come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a second.  Not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It used to be really easier to identify.  At least in Windows, you could see that it was a laptop card.  But now, a lot of times, they look  like their actual access points.  So I don't know what these guys are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can see that it's a peer-to-peer network  on the dropdown on Macs.  It's pretty apparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I've seen some that don't appear as peer-to-peer networks.  Really?  Where they show up as if it's a router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never seen that personally.  But I can see why that would be feasible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw that in your neck of the woods at LHR, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, LHR, because I keep forgetting what that was.  That was his setup, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was his.  Yeah, that was me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was there with my laser beam and my laptop and my special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought I kept seeing a little red thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a nice little setup over there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually, no, I think I did use the one at LAX.  But I only did it so I was just surfing news stories.  Not sure.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only logged into my email.  Yeah, I'm going to set up a Wi-Fi honeypot here  at the split office so all of you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See how many people we could sucker into using it.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  That'd make a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We actually have Leo here to do his commercials.  It's a smaller version of him.  But take it away, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, guys.  Hope you're having a good time doing Twitter without me.  I'm in China right now, but I had to just stop by and say,  go to meeting.  I'm using it more and more.  In fact, we just asked for a few accounts for some of our hosts  who are using it actually during the show to show screens,  which is very cool.  Everybody's moving to go to meeting.  Go to meeting from Citrix.  They're the company that does Go to My PC as well.  They really know the ins and outs of Windows  and how to do remote access in Windows.  I don't think there's anybody better, frankly,  at remote access than the Citrix folks.  Go to meeting, basically, here's the problem.  You're on a conference call.  You're talking to somebody, and you're  showing them something visual, or you're  talking about something visual, a PowerPoint or a keynote  presentation or a drawing or a slide.  And you're describing it, and it's just frustrating as heck.  What you can do if you've got Go to Meeting installed,  is say, hey, well, let me show you.  This is kind of wild.  And you say, go to go to meeting.com.  It takes you about a click of the mouse to get it started.  And then you tell them, go to go to meeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  And it's kind of cool, because they go, wow.  And they're looking at your computer on their screen,  no matter where they are.  They see the presentation.  It's great for sales, great for product demos,  for training, for collaboration, too.  You can both work on a document together.  Very affordable.

And I've always thought the world of them and their technology.  It's secure.  It's affordable.  It's effective.  Go to meeting.com slash twit.  I invite you to give it a try.  We now return you to This Week in Tech, already in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo Laporte.  And you can safely assume that Dvorak was out  basting his meat during that commercial,  and will the next time.  Whoa.  Let's, uh.  Excuse me.  What?  It's a twit joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's always basting his meat.  I've heard him bast his meat.  He goes off and bastes.  Thanks for backing me up on that, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk about the success of Blu-ray.  Has it finally arrived?  Gizmodo reporting that Walmart is selling the Blu-ray player  only at its brick and mortar stores.  The Magnavox NB530MGX for $98.  We finally have a Blu-ray player with 1080p support  below $100.  Everybody's been saying that, myself included,  that once we get Blu-ray for under $100,  then that's when people will start to flock to it.  So is the flocking about to commence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm kind of worried that maybe the price is dropping so low  because no one's buying them.  And that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's part of it.  And it's also Magnavox, so it's not exactly a high-end brand.  Yeah, it's not exactly a high-end brand.  Not on the top of the line, necessarily.  And then it's Walmart, known for its loss leaders,  trying to get people into the store.  So that's part of it as well.  And also, it's getting to be that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The technology's been out for a few years now.  So eventually, it has to drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does seem like it took a little long to get down $100.  Are you a Blu-ray fan at all, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's really interesting.  I've talked about this a lot because I work  in the television industry in this country.  And so all the people I know who are successful  have huge, high-definition televisions  just the size of a pool table stuck on their walls.  And then only one person I know who's House I've been to  has a Blu-ray player.  And we watched a movie on it, and I went,  yeah, that's really good.  But it isn't really good.  I mean, yes, it was very clear, and it was very crisp,  and the sound was fantastic.  And they had a very expensive setup.  But it isn't like the difference between a VHS.  I've heard this before.  It's not new.  But the difference between a VHS tape and a DVD  was phenomenal.  It was game-changing.  It was extraordinary.  The difference between a DVD,  which I've just been watching with my daughter.  We've got a little home cinema here next door,  watching a movie on a DVD, sort of medium quality,  medium definition.  It wasn't that good, but it was perfectly good enough.  The sound is very important.  We've got a really good sound system.  The jump from a DVD to a Blu-ray is just,  it doesn't make me excited.  What makes me excited is the chance to download films  in high definition that I can then play through a projector.  That is much better,  because then I don't have to get a piece of plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think what you just mentioned  is exactly the reason why Blu-ray needs  to come down in price so much.  Because I think for most people,  it's not as big of a jump as they would feel necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not an all caps jump when you say really good.  It's just rest.  It's not the kind of thing that people need

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to go rush out to the store to buy.  It's certainly not the kind of thing  that I ever really felt the need to go out and get.  I wound up having a Blu-ray player because I had a PS3,  but it's not like I would have bought a standalone  if the PS3 hadn't existed.  And I think that is the case for most people,  especially those who don't already own a PS3.  So having it at a sub hundred dollar level  is definitely gonna make it a lot more viable.  But I mean, look, you can get a Roku Netflix box,  or if you have an Xbox 360, you can stream Netflix.  And Netflix is available on a lot of other devices.  And there's a lot of other streaming solutions.  You have a TiVo, you can do Amazon Unbox on TiVo.  There's just so many ways to get content into your home now  that don't require a piece of plastic shaped like a circle  that you put into a drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the key though, really,  if Blu-ray is gonna take off is that the cost per movie  needs to come down.  I mean, if you can get a DVD movie,  say of a first run movie for like eight bucks,  and then the Blu-ray equivalent's like $25,  people are gonna opt for the eight dollars.  For what you pay, you can get three normal movies  instead of just getting one Blu-ray movie.  And as has already been said, the quality is there,  but it's not so different  that people are gonna spend the extra money.  I think it's one of those things  where when it becomes a commodity priced item  where you can get movies for like eight, 10 bucks,  and you players are around like $100,  I think that's where you start to see movement.  But for right now, it still seems kind of one of those  things where it's like,  yeah, that's kind of cool if I ever get one, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not just the price of the hardware,  it's the price of the individual movies,  and those aren't necessarily coming down.  Do you think that it would be smart for them  to come out with an exclusive Blu-ray  to kind of force people that direction  now that the players are getting more affordable?  I mean, studios can't afford to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think part of the issue was that Blu-ray  was still a growing or changing spec when it first came out.  So unlike HDVD where you had all this functionality  straight out of the gate, it took Blu-ray  until like, what's it at now, 2.0?  To do a lot of the things that HDVD could do  where you get picture in picture,  you could have a lot of the extras superimposed  on top of the Moody while both were still running.  And I thought that was pretty compelling,  but it wasn't something that all the Blu-ray publishers  did out of the gate because they knew the players  out there didn't support it.  So they came for the lowest common denominator.  So basically what you had were really nice looking movies  that weren't really no different than your standard DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and to be fair, Sony has attempted to respond,  I think, to the demand for online video  by building in a decent movie download store into the PS3.  But then Microsoft just went up them.  And then at E3, they announced that they were gonna do  1080p downloads, which nobody's ever done that before.  Nobody's ever done 1080p in any way, shape, or form  over the internet on any kind of a large scale.  So clearly at this point,  Microsoft is doing a really good job  at chipping away at the viability of Blu-ray.  I mean, it's hard to see Blu-ray as being that necessary  if you can get a large amount of content on an Xbox  downloadable in 1080p,  which is the same as you're gonna get on Blu-ray.  Yeah, we've talked about this time and time again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick Norton, is that your voice coming in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, hey.  In theory, I was trying to talk before,  but nothing was happening, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick is joining us, host of Tekzilla,  and the new HD Nation show on Revision 3,  which makes it appropriate for you to jump in on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have one thing.  I don't think anybody other than Microsoft  can afford to distribute 1080p video online right now.  And I think saying that the Roku and the Netflix solutions,  I mean, they're certainly near HD quality,  especially if you're watching on a 1080p screen.  I think it's still, I think HD for the most part  is still on the early adopter side of things.  I think this Christmas is gonna be interesting to watch,  but the whole Magnavox thing, it's, you know,  Ryan nailed it.  It's a loss leader, it's a bogus brand,  it's not a viable player.  Most of them are gonna be dead inside of two years.  And, you know, the $100 players aren't gonna be around  probably till next spring.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you look at the market,  I mean, what it really comes down to,  I think most people would prefer the convenience  over that bump in quality.  Most people would rather have a super convenient way  to get something that is DVD quality,  not really anything that's worse,  but that is at least DVD quality,  then they would really care about going out of their way  and paying an extra amount of money on top of that  to get something that's 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most people don't buy DVDs though.  Most people rent DVDs.  Yeah, exactly, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, for all of these downloading and streaming  and, you know, various Netflix like solutions  that are just way more convenient,  I mean, that seems to be like where things are going.  Yeah, but don't you think there's still,  I think there's still a population of people out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that don't have access to, you know,  high quality broadband connections  and who probably don't play video games.  I mean, there's still half the population  that isn't online all the time  and doesn't even know what Roku is,  doesn't even know that there's Netflix on the Xbox  and still wanna go to Blockbuster and get a DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But those are the kind of people.  If you remember those $85 DVDs that came out in like 99,  those were horrible.  But the perception of being able to get one for cheaper  drove people into the marketplace more,  even if they didn't buy that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean, the kind of people that you're describing  while they certainly do exist,  they're not the kind of people who have a $20,000 HD rig  that is really going to do justice  to a nicely mastered Blu-ray.  So you know what a $20,000 HD rig,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a $2,000 television right now is phenomenal.  The 240 hertz television's coming out from Sony and Samsung.  Like you can get them under $2,000 delivered from Amazon,  no shipping, $250 Blu-ray player,  and they look amazing.  If you have the right content, if the content's not included.  And also I have a question for Bob.  What were you watching the DVD on  when you say that you don't need Blu-ray  and you can't see the quality difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I can't, no.  Yes, I knew that I would get called out on that.  I could see the quality difference.  There's no question of that.  But for me, the experience of the jump  in technological manipulation, the change from a VHS,  which is what I grew up with,  VHSs were really cool.  And you could watch a film at home on a VHS tape.  That was a major breakthrough.  And then everybody got them.  When they first came out, because I'm very old,  I can remember when VHSs first came out.  And it was very exciting.  I remember when there were no VHSs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then the jump from that to a disc that you put in  that you could jump forward, you could jump to any point,  you didn't have to rewind tape.  It was basically the disadvantage of tape.  And that jump was phenomenal, was extraordinary,  and really made it different,  made the whole experience different.  And when they got cheaper, then they, you know,  that's what I'm saying, is that the,  if there was something that was like a bit of gel  that you threw at a screen and it became the picture,  that's going to jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm talking to you, I mean, it's an improvement in quality.  It's not a shift in paradigm.  And the shift from VHS to DVD, that was a change,  that was a paradigm shift.  Should they have made Blu-ray smaller?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like physically smaller?  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that's the kind of thing we're talking about.  I mean, that was one of the things with DVD is like,  oh, it takes up less room on my shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's, I mean, that's-  No, but I don't think it's the size of the disc  that matters.  The alternative is no disc at all.  It's the size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, no, I think Ryan and Bob both hit it.  It's that, I mean, I don't remember  if any of you used audio cassettes,  but I remember back when, you know, we all had Walkmans,  you know, to rewind it to save battery,  you'd stick it on a pencil and you'd kind of  run it backwards on your pencil to rewind it.  Being able to jump from track to track on a CD  in any order that you wanted without actually having  to wait for something to, you know, to rewind 10 minutes,  nine minutes, or whatever to get to where you were  was amazing, and that's what DVD did for video.  I mean, hey, now I can pause it and the picture  doesn't look like it's shaking or jittering in the middle.  I can move backwards, I can move forwards,  and I don't hear my tape, you know, get chewed up in my VCR.  It's amazing.  The tape doesn't wear out?  The thing with Blu-ray is that it doesn't bring anything  currently that I find compelling enough to migrate to,  even though I did buy a Blu-ray player this weekend,  but that's just because of work.  How much did you pay?  I paid $2.40 at Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you totally mad now that there's a $100 version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because I actually like the one I got.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, I mean, just all the feature sets that they're on it  don't really seem compelling.  It's like, oh, cool, I can download clips from the web.  How amazing is that versus being able to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So nobody here other than me  really enjoys the quality improvement.  I enjoy the quality improvement.  I pay extra on Netflix for Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I can get it on Blu-ray, I will watch it,  but that's if I can.  I'm not going to pay a lot of extra money  to buy something on Blu-ray.  But you don't buy DVDs anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen your house, dude, you own like two DVDs  and like 400 games.  Yeah, no, but I'm talking about when I rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will pay that premium to Netflix to get the Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does anybody remember Quadraphonic?  Yes. Quadraphonic Records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My friend had it in his van.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is Blu-ray, that is exactly right.  Where Quadraphonic would be found  in its heyday in the 70s.  It was supposed to be the next best thing about stereo,  right, is we'd have four channels of sound.  They actually mastered whole albums  specifically for Quadraphonic,  sold them on high quality LPs.  It was similar to Blu-ray in that you didn't have to,  you had the same form factor, although it was different  because you could play them on a regular LP player,  although you didn't get the Quadraphonics  unless you bought the new one.  Is Blu-ray going to be like that where it's like,  it only appeals to the people who are really into video,  the way Quadraphonic only really appeals to the people  if it was the new SACD,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where it's taken like 15 years for SACD to come up to speed  and it's fine to the point where even the audiophile community,  that's really freaking me out when you guys do that.  The SACD is phenomenal audio quality,  but the adoption curve has been minor at best.  I think Blu-ray is already more successful than SACD,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wouldn't you say?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the thing though with Pat though  is that it's not that I don't enjoy the quality improvements,  it's only with certain movies  that I actually care to see the improvement.  If it's like a Will Ferrell comedy,  I could care less if it was on UHF,  like 12 a.m. in the morning,  because I'm not going to be nit-picky about the image quality.  But if it's something like Spartacus  or some really grand movie that I'd be busy...  Spartacus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sentence is just so full of good stuff.  Roger, you watch UHF at 2.30 in the morning?  How do you even do that? They scrap those bands.  Well, okay, I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is there's certain movies  that I'm willing to fork out the extra money to see that.  For example, Watchmen.  When Watchmen comes out with the special edition Blu-ray,  I'm going to buy that because I want to see it that way.  I bought The Dark Knight the same way.  I didn't opt for the DVD because it was a movie  that I was interested in enough  and to get the high quality version.  But if it's something that it's, again,  if it's like a throwaway movie  that is going to kill like an hour or two on a plane,  I could care less what format it's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it's a throwaway movie you're going to watch on the plane,  you're going to steal it online anyway, Roger.  You're not going to pay any money for it  and you're not going to care what format it's in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's, yeah.  But I mean, that said, you know,  when I run by like an aisle that has $3 DVDs,  you know what, it's three bucks.  I bought like five $3 movies.  If I didn't like it, big deal, three bucks.  I can't say the same thing for a $25 Blu-ray movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but you couldn't say the same thing  about a $15 DVD five years ago either  or a $25 DVD.  And I didn't buy a lot of those either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bought like, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You rented first, you rented at the same rate  everything else costs, and then if you really liked it,  you bought the DVD.  Yeah, and that's the same...  Everybody's so hyped about,  do Blu-rays cost more than DVDs?  And it's, yeah, well, yeah,  an HD cable or HD satellite service  costs more than standard death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someone made a comment that Roger's cheap.  It is, it's true.  Roger is cheap.  We gotta rate it in here.  The thing is, like now I have so many more options  to watch stuff.  I can watch it on Hulu, I can watch it, you know,  somewhere else, I can watch it on my Xbox.  I'm no longer limited to just VHS, TV, cable TV,  and my DVD player.  I have so many other sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Robert, you made the point earlier  that you like to download and stream things,  is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I would do, yes, I do do that.  And I mean, and I also do it legally,  but I mean, so I get quite a few...  I actually rent movies off.  I rent a lot of iTunes,  because that seems to make the most sense to me,  because then I don't want to keep it.  You know, if I do want to keep it,  if it's the most brilliant film ever,  then I would buy the DVD.  I don't have a Blu-ray player,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no way of playing it.  I'm like the perfect customer.  I just spent like 20 bucks this weekend  buying a movie that I watched once and then deleted.  Yes.  I know, I'm crazy, right?  Why didn't you rent it?  Because it wasn't available for renting yet.  You have Netflix.  No, but I want to watch it on the plane now.  You don't understand.  I had like a 10 hour plane ride.  I had to get up.  So I rented Confessions of a Shopaholic.  I shake my head at you.  I bought it.  Still have it, I'll make you watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so we have a few things going on here.  One is we don't need to own things as much anymore.  Maybe it's a collector's edition  or something you're really a fan of.  There's also what you just said, Veronica,  which is the immediacy of it matters.  I can't rent a Blu-ray DVD or even a regular DVD immediately.  I at least, you know, at the fastest,  I can run down the street and get it,  but I can press a button on my computer  and get it right away,  sometimes streaming instantly  before it's even finished downloading.  It's just a matter of access.  And we haven't caught the model of access  up to what people want yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is that?  Since we seem to have multiple models of access, Tom,  I mean, basically you're saying, you know,  Roger wants it on any format available.  Veronica wants instant availability.  Ryan's got enough, excuse me,  Ryan's got enough patience to wait for Netflix  to throw it up in his box.  None of us go to video stores anymore if we can avoid it.  Do any of us actually own more than a hundred,  you know, DVDs other than me?  You know, most people, I mean, most people,  that would make sense.  The, but I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that, again, I waited for everything to drop in price  before I bought it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, it's actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does everyone on the, does everyone talking right now,  oh, and I actually know everybody.  Bob's the only one I know that,  Bob, do you own an HDTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't know, no.  I've got a very run of the mill flat panel TV.  I don't watch that much TV.  We have a flat panel-  I've got a 24 inch iMac,  which is what I watch a lot of movies on,  and we've got a projector, so we watch some stuff on that.  So we watch DVDs on the projector.  The projector's probably HD, no?  What, sorry?  Your projector's probably HD.  The projector is HD, the DVD player going into it,  which cost, I think, 19 pounds from Amazon.  It was cheaper than the DVD I bought.  That's like $180 US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's about $19 at the current rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's about, it would be about $25,  and very, very cheap.  And it was cheaper than the DVD I bought,  so I thought, oh, I may as well have that too.  So it's not a flashy DVD player, it's really bad.  But it works, you know, it's never failed.  It just, you put a DVD in and it plays it.  So it's very, I'm working on very low tech.  This is really, it was really for the kids,  for my children to watch films on.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're just not that interested  in having to upgrade, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think, I can't imagine  that I would ever buy a Blu-ray player.  I mean, the Xbox root is the most likely,  I think we probably do, you know,  I've got a 15 year old son.  But then, you know, he is a classic example  of the next generation that he doesn't even bother  to illegally download films because his friends  give him little thumb drives, little USB thumb drives  with them on.  Sneak in a piracy.  And that's how they spot them around.  Yeah.  There's no, you know, I mean, someone in the local area  is illegally downloading movies,  but I don't know, we don't know who it is.  But I mean, I have seen pre-release Hollywood films  at DVD quality on my son's computer from a thumb driver.  And I mean-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on the air.  No, I know.  Well, it's not me, it's him, he can get arrested.  Just throw it under the bus.  Arrest my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just my son taking it.  Nice.  You represent the new norm though, according to NPD group,  they forecast that flat panel display sales  are only going to rise 1% annually from 2008 until 2016.  This is over an eight year period.  They think it's only going to rise 1%.  People just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that flat panel TVs or is that flat panels,  the glass itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flat panel displays in general.  And so in that they lump together phones and notebooks,  at least according to some of this report.  But the thing that I think that these reports  tend to get a lot of attention for is, you know,  oh, like what does this mean for the industry?  And oh, you know, the industry is failing.  No, it just means growth is slowing  because saturation has gotten so great at this point.  Have we read the saturation-  And money's not-  It doesn't mean that people are not buying TVs.  It just means that the rate at which the industry  is growing, I mean, look, you can have a humongous,  you know, a $20 billion a year industry.  If it's only growing 1% a year,  it's still a $20 billion a year industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's nothing too new  about any of the technology that's forcing people  to have to upgrade.  So if they have a flat panel that, you know,  obviously HD and working perfectly,  they don't really need to buy a new TV.  So until the next step in major technological upgrades  happen, I don't think we're gonna see much growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So HD, unlike what we talked about earlier with DVD,  people threw out perfectly good working VHS to get a DVD.  They're not doing that with their television.  They're waiting until the television breaks down  or gets old or just doesn't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but television's changed so much in the last 20 years.  I mean, I can remember when having one television  was a norm in a house when I was in grade school  and then people started adding bigger televisions  and then all of a sudden cable came out  and suddenly there was a television  in three or four rooms in the house.  Right, but I mean, within the past five years,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there haven't been too many significant changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but again, this is growth.  This is not negative growth.  Except the price has dropped so much.  This doesn't mean that people aren't buying these things.  This just means that it's people  who are either not buying second units  or people who have not bought yet are starting to buy now,  or then there's also, of course, the turnover rate  of people who have bought in the past  and are buying a new one and getting rid of their old one.  So, I mean, again, this is not a bad thing.  If anything else, this is a good thing.  It means that the industry is doing really well.  It's not declining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, despite the fact that the home sales have collapsed,  durable good purchases have collapsed,  the availability of credit has collapsed,  people are paranoid about loading up credit cards.  Did he say herbal goods?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Durable goods.  Oh, durable goods, okay.  Although herbal goods probably are doing pretty well  in this market. No, yeah.  LCD TVs, which make up the largest chunk  of the flat panel market, are expected to see  almost no revenue growth over the next eight years.  Doesn't that make business people panic, though?  Yeah, but this is an analyst report, Tom.  Because everything we're talking about is sensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what are businesses going to do?  Tom, this is like clicking on a dig headline.  These guys are basically trying to get people  to pay a lot of money for their reports.  They don't do that by going,  everything's the same as last year.  He's saying I'm picking a bad story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he said.  No, it's not a bad story.  I think that's what he's insinuating, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think a lot of the economic analysis  that comes out of, you know, that are like,  I mean, you read these things and it's like,  I've read ones where it was obvious  the person writing the analysis never owned  or worked with any of the products.  Or you look at it and they're the, you know,  it's a classic case of the headline  being better than the report.  You know, or they ignore things like major changes  in the market.  I mean, you know, it'll be fun to, you know,  it'll be fun to see what this report looks like,  you know, five years from now,  if any of us can even remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's move on, shall we?  Yeah, the chat room apparently really wants you to move on.  Yeah, the chat room's done with this,  which I'm assuming everyone else is.  So actually, we probably wanna take another break  because we have another sponsor  that Leo needs to take care of  so he can continue to have his show after we've ruined it.  So bear with us a little bit  and we'll be back in just a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, back at the Twit Cottage,  Leo Laporte sneaks in and takes over Twit.  I know I'm in China right now, I'm gonna be back soon,  but I had to mention audible.com slash twit2.  You know how much I love Audible?  It's not just Jason, oh no, I love Audible too,  let me tell you something.  I've been an Audible member longer than he has.  Since 2001, 323 books, something like that.  No, it must be more than that now.  So let me look at my library, I'm curious,  see how many books I've purchased on audible.com.  I have the platinum account,  which gives me two books a month.  Actually, I've had it for so long,  I have the old name, it's called Light Listener.  No, no, I'm a heavy listener, twice,  let me see how many books.  All, let's see, program types, past, all time books,  total number of all time books that I have listened to.  I download new books all the time.  In fact, I just bought some extras  because I wanted books on China,  but Audible is such a wonderful resource,  whether you're at work, at the gym,  commuting, flying in the plane.  And I just use Audible to prevent boredom.  Audible.com slash twit two for the platinum account,  two books a month, and the first two books are free.  First two credits are free.  So a lot of wonderful choices on Audible.  An amazing array of books.  Go right now and browse.  By the way, the new Audible enhanced audio file format,  amazing, full quality, CD quality,  it's as good as it gets,  but they have smaller file formats  for depending on the player,  plays on hundreds of different devices.  Most of the MP3 players, your Zoom, your iPod,  your iPhone, your Kindle, Audible.com slash twit two.  If you go there right now, sign up for the platinum account.  Your first two books are free.  You're gonna love Audible.  I've been a member, now it says since 1997,  and they celebrated their 10th anniversary last year,  but I don't think that they really were on the map  until around 2000, 2001, that's when I joined.  I was a long time audiobook listener,  and when I found Audible, I just flipped my lid.  Yeah, 400 books now I've listened to.  400, that's pretty good.  Start right now, start your collection.  You'll get to 400 in no time.  Audible.com slash twit two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the Leo bot that Colleen's been working very hard on.  I have to say, it's very convincing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Likeness is uncanny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now Patrick, MPD group came out with a story  saying the world is round.  I think this is probably overhyped,  no, I'm just kidding.  Usually you're better at mocking me, Tom.  I stole that one from the chat room.  UK's National Portrait Gallery  is threatening to sue Wikipedia.  Now this is interesting because  there are 3,000 images of paintings,  all from the 19th century or earlier,  and firmly in the public domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's the big caveat here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The photos are a product of painstaking exercise  on the part of the photographer, says  the National Portrait Gallery of London.  So their suit isn't against the images,  it's against those particular images.  In other words, it's not against the paintings,  it's against the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the publicly paid for photos that were made available  on a public website shouldn't be made available

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to the public. Better in the public domain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even though the public, even though  the National Portrait Gallery has been mandated  to make its paintings more available to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They called downloading them an unlawful  circumvention of technical measures,  although as Patrick should have hinted at,  the taxpayer funded mission of the MPG  is to promote the appreciation  and understanding of portraiture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's baloney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking at Robert over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just catching up on the story of the Londonist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I could talk about it with enormous artistic merit,  the wonderful National Portrait Gallery,  which is extraordinary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no doubt about it.  It is really confusing.  I think the whole, I mean, it brings up the whole question  of ownership on who owns what and how you own it  and what is, you know, because that whole thing  has been thrown out.  I mean, it used to be very obvious.  You go into an art gallery and you took a picture  of a painting, they tell you off.  That was wrong, you're not allowed to do it.  But now you don't need to go into,  you don't need to do that, you can just.  Yeah, but that was for the flash, usually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not for the actual copyright at the port.  I mean, in a lot of cases.  Well, it may have stated that way,  but I think it's become that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you, if you went in the National Portrait Gallery  with a camera with no flash, even today,  they get a bit sniffy.  Those men in the forms wouldn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty much any gallery will do that to you.  I was in the Picasso Museum in Barcelona with the iPhone out  and they're like, nope, you cannot do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got yelled at so many times  trying to walk around the Louvre and take pictures.  They didn't like that.  They don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, then who does, you know,  that is, it certainly affected, you know,  the thing I was mentioning earlier on with my son.  I mean, those things have affected directly my income.  With so many people illegally,  or whatever you like to call it,  download Red Dwarf, for instance,  whereas five years ago they used to buy the DVDs.  Well, that is, you know, I've felt that personally.  You know, we've all seen the very large drop in sales,  you know, which is, you know, I think is fair enough.  It's part of the way the world's changing.  But it is, you know, how can they possibly say that?  It's ridiculous.  If we can see the pictures anywhere, then, okay,  they're on Wikipedia as well.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's what's really unusual about this,  is that it's not even a fair use argument.  Fair use being, it's copyrighted,  but this is an exception to that copyright  that is defensible.  These are public domain paintings.  So we get into this culture where the copyright  becomes such a bugaboo.  We're so afraid of losing the rights  that you're talking about with, you know,  Red Dwarf and losing the money,  that I feel like there's a lot of overcompensation  that's happening, and this is a definite example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe they're worried about losing traffic  at, you know, the nationalportraitgallery.com.uk,  and they need the banner ads to pay for things.  Yeah, I agree, yeah.  Because they're very, the legal letter,  the legal threat's very like,  these images are taken on behalf of our client,  the client holds the copyright on the images,  even though they're public domain images,  you took them, they're watermarked,  you took them from our database,  and it's kind of sad, though,  when you get right down to it.  Yeah.  Isn't the whole point of public, you know,  isn't the whole point of this museum to spread the work.  I'm wondering, like, what the internal argument  was about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's, you know, it smacks of lawyers to me,  which is, you know, someone saying,  well, if we let them do this,  then that could set a precedent for this,  and to cover everything, we should, you know,  make a complaint and get these things taken down  so we have total control.  Now, I'm interested with something Robert said  about how you felt the effect of piracy on Red Dwarf.  Do you think, though, that people are exaggerating  how much damage has been done?  Because a lot of times, the industry comes out  with these billions and billions of dollars.  Or do you think that that's dead on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think it has had an effect,  there's no doubt about it.  I mean, I know the people who, for instance,  particularly with Red Dwarf,  I know the people very well who distribute that DVD,  a big company in the UK,  and their overall sales across the board are down 20%.  Now, that isn't, in some ways,  isn't as much as I would have expected.  I would have thought it was more.  One of the interesting things that we've found out recently,  and it'll take time before we know for sure,  but for instance, we did this new series  of Red Dwarf this year, which was shown on the UK TV.  Now, I was getting Twitter messages  within 20 minutes of it being broadcast in the UK  from the US, people who'd seen it in the US,  and were making comments on it,  because someone had copied it, put it onto a BitTorrent,  and someone in America had seen it.  I mean, it was breathtaking how quickly it happened.  And there was something like 2.5 million BitTorrent  that was being tracked.  But what's interesting is, from what I've heard,  it hasn't affected DVD sales.  I.e., people who downloaded it and watched it went,  oh, that's really good, I wanna see it,  and have now bought the DVD.  So it's a really difficult thing.  The producer of Red Dwarf was thrilled  when he heard about how many BitTorrents there were,  because he thought it was a very good sign.  So it's very mixed.  It's very enlightened.  Well, he is very enlightened.  The people from the TV company were less thrilled.  Yes.  Yes.  Strangely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we are moving towards a situation  where you have to accept,  and I've said this a million times,  so anybody who's listened to anything I've done  on Buzz Out Loud or anything will roll their eyes,  but we have to accept  that the internet is infinitely copyable,  that digital content is infinitely copyable,  and we have to adjust our business models to that.  And it's gonna be painful while we do that.  But that's a great example  of how you can turn it to your advantage,  which is, even though you didn't do it  on purpose necessarily,  having Red Dwarf out there was a publicity stunt,  if you will, which helped out.  And which cost the producers nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You imagine to get your product  to two and a half million eyeballs  would be incredibly expensive in the old media format,  and it didn't cost them anything.  They didn't have to do anything.  They just had to broadcast it,  and a few people recorded it, and off it went.  All right, the Apple iPhone MMS

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  has been delayed here in the United States.  Are you an iPhone user, Robert?  I am, yes, I am, and it's been delayed.  Are you an iPhone user, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am, yes, I am, and I think it works here already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say, we all hate you now,  because you haven't.  We have to wait until September.  Also, according to appmoto.com,  it's gonna be 55 bucks for the tethering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  You don't, yeah?  I mean, you basically have to take their word on it  right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not an official announcement, so.  So 55. No, no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know about you guys,  but I've never really heard about Moto before the story, so.  I mean, if you look at how that price kind of plays  to the rest of the market, I mean,  it's in the $40 range, tethering on other networks.  Wouldn't surprise me if AT&T went that high.  And it also doesn't surprise me that AT&T  is not going to be doing the MMS on the iPhone  for a little while, but I mean, again,  even if that was the case, it's almost not news, right?  You almost expect to be abused by AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  In fact, it's almost news that it's not $65.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm unfamiliar with pricing on other tethering plans.  Is that around typical, or is that high?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you just get 3G service, flat 3G service,  it's usually between 55 and $65.  So the tethering, they kind of knock off a little bit on that  to kind of make it a little value  for users of the service already,  especially because you're already paying for data,  technically, which is why I think a lot of people  just use the tethering anyway, unauthorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the app Moto is claiming it's going to be 55  on top of your $35 data plan, which is,  I mean, 55, that's what I'm paying per month  for my Sprint modem, and it's like, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You only pay 55 for your Sprint modem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I've had it for a couple of years.  As your grandfathered in, yeah.  I mean, I've had it for a couple of years,  plus I'm also frustrated because Sprint finally gave up  the five gigabyte cap that they basically were unlimited  up until last November, then they finally stepped in line  with Verizon and AT&T.  Oh, come on, Patrick, like you ever hit that five gig cap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know Patrick very well, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, mister, I download all my movies online,  download three movies, you've blown through  a five gigabyte cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You download your movies over EVDO?  You really expect me to believe that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have downloaded movies over EVDO,  I didn't say I do it all the time,  but I've also driven 900 miles in 36 hours  so I can attend a race on the other side of Nevada.  I don't cocoon as well.  You have to download movies for that trip,  that's a long trip.  You have to be reasonable, Patrick,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is not typical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't sign with Sprint because I wanted to be reasonable,  I signed with Sprint because at the time,  they had the best speed and they had no data cap  and now they've removed one of my two motivations.  I mean, I'm not surprised AT&T's pushing MMS  because their network's a mess.  I've got a couple friends of mine who are like,  dude, I haven't been able to call you in like a month  and it's like, yeah, my phone's basically stopped  working in my neighborhood while they're messing around  with the neighborhood, my wife's got connectivity problems.  AT&T is sucking even worse than it did last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like AT&T's network, at least here in the Bay Area,  which is all I can speak to,  has gotten worse over the past month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's getting progressively worse.  The more iPhones get out there, the worse it gets.  Yeah, they're desperate.  It's beyond pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a reason why they aren't doing anything  to up the bandwidth or to make it absolutely make it true?  Who says they're not doing anything?  Because they hate me personally, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're moving to 850 megahertz  both in New York and San Francisco and elsewhere.  They've purchased bandwidth, they've purchased bandwidth  at a better frequency, but it's just gonna take them.  I think they're desperately trying to get it rolled out  before Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it like the Bay Bridge where they refuse to fix  the potholes on the East Bay side  because they're building the new bridge?  So they're just letting the old network go to crap  while they build the new ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think based on the conversations I've had  with people like Sasha Sagan from PCMag  and some people I've met over the years in the industry,  as they say, is that their networks are just absolutely  hammered in San Francisco and...  Yeah, it figures, but then you've got the whole echo chamber

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that we are a significant part of sometimes.  Whining about it to the rest of the country,  you'd think that maybe they'd help it out a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but the bottom line for the Bay area  is actually that they just don't have enough spectrum here.  They just simply do not have enough wireless spectrum.  In this area, I'm sure that they're doing their best.  There was a good PC World article

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that tested it out in a lot of places,  and AT&T wasn't really great in a whole lot of places.  No, AT&T does not have a great reputation,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but I'm saying specifically,  we're talking about the Bay area.  Specifically this area, they have a great dearth of spectrum  and they need to take care of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's stop talking about the Bay area and the iPhone  and talk about the Palm Pre, actually,  which according to Engadget,  Cleanser from the PreCentral Forum  has managed to unlock the CDMA radio  so you can use the Palm Pre to get voice and SMS on Verizon.  And they're working on data.  Wait.  It is still a no-go right now,  but they are working on it, yeah.  Does that change the game for anybody?  If you could, I know Robert's gonna have to just  fall asleep on this because no CDMA where you are,  but does that change anyone's mind, do you think, out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Verizon already announced  that they're doing the Pre next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they did and then AT&T said they weren't  and then they said, oh, well, maybe we said too much,  but they didn't deny it and it's kind of unclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Pre is coming or a Palm device is coming,  likely the Pre, to Verizon early-ish next year.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So don't worry about it, just wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, the other thing is you're not gonna be able  to get a Pre at a reasonable price,  just unlock it to use it on Verizon and it's hacked,  so maybe it's gonna get that firm.  I mean, this is kind of like back in the day,  buying an iPhone at full price  to unlock it to use it on T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  T-Mobile's awesome.  I love T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just, you know, it's not the kind of thing  I think that a lot of people would do.  True.  And especially knowing, and unlike the iPhone at the time,  the Pre is coming to Verizon and nobody's disputing that.  It's just a matter of when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, so Roger, any disagreement there?  It's a CDMA phone, don't care.  Yeah, that's it.  I think we're all where Robert already is by geography,  which is get off a CDMA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it were a GSM phone, I'd show a lot more interest,  but it's not, so it's kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, CDMA does work great in rural Nevada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All the places where I don't spend a lot of my time.  Do you download movies over it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but I've downloaded audio over it in the past  when I was my short stint as a Verizon customer.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A few other stories to get to here.  I'd like to mention the Mario marathon that's been going on.  It'll probably be done by the time  a lot of people listen to this show,  but ustream.tv slash channel slash Mario dash marathon.  These folks have been at it all weekend long  playing Mario to raise money for kids' toys for hospitals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for child's play.  Cool.  Which is a great charity.  I've actually done some fundraising for them  as well in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tuned in right before we left to drive up here.  Those guys look so cracked out.  Do they?  They look, they were like in a rough shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long did they play for?  The full weekend or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to check and see,  I'm trying to load it right now  and see if they're still going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I got in there,  it was at like 50 hours or something like that.  They were at 60 some hours.  And they were all like incoherent.  It was great.  It was actually really entertaining.  I didn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can imagine they're gonna be seeing some Mario  jumping around behind their eyelids  for a few days after this.  You know how when you play video games for a long time,  you just close your eyes and it's only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The music is still going through them.  So where are they at right now?  Money wise at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that accurate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's what it looks like.  Wow, that is some dedication.  So anyway, shout out to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, good on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good on you for just being able to be awake.  I know.  And do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could have done it this weekend after being so jet lagged.  You could have?  I actually probably could have pulled that off, yeah.  I stayed up until like four reading that book last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe the next time you go on a long distance trip,  that should be your way of recovering is to do a marathon.  Yeah.  For charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would maybe do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And also, finally, the Memristors story,  this is on newscientist.com.  Who had a chance to read this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not get this far.  All the way through to the end.  And understand every last bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, lots of shaking up here.  I'm sorry.  Memristors are, it's the missing piece of what?  Resistors, capacitors, and transistors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're asking me, what do I look like?  I have a degree in electrical engineering or something?  You kind of do.  Is it my Unix hippie beard?  Yeah, the beard is getting to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  electrical engineering status there.  Memristors, if you want to know the effect,  if you're like, you know what?  I don't care about all this.  What are they going to do for me?  Well, first of all, they'll make faster RAM possible.  They'll make faster hard drives possible,  a la flash memory.  But also, they think they work the way our neurons work.  So it could be a way to make artificial brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ooh, we were just watching Caprica this weekend.  And I don't want to give anything away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they use Memristors to make the silos.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, if it's going to enable the pending robot apocalypse,  I am both excited and terrified.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What if it could actually be able to accept  a brain image from you into a new brain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't really buy that.  Not the concept.  The concept seems, I guess, crazy but feasible.  But I don't really buy that that's actually  a valid transfer of consciousness.  Just because it's a copy of you doesn't mean that it's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's a philosophical question for you, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think we're also kind of getting off the topic.  I mean, this is some crazy technology, Roger.  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ryan.  So is Hyperdrive, but don't have one of those any time soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to replicate it.  But this is real, Roger.  We haven't discovered Hyperdrive.  This is something where we actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we've discovered Hyperdrive, Tom.  That's what Area 51 is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now we're into no agenda territory.  Robert, you've played robots.  Do you have any extra insight into this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I've been playing robots for years.  I'm very excited by it.  I mean, I didn't see it on the list.  If it was on my list, I'd missed it, the story.  So I want to read it now.  I mean, I'm fascinated by it.  I wrote a play 25 years ago about a...  Which is how I ended up in Red Dwarf,  which is about a machine, a thinking machine.  And that whole concept of...  I mean, there's a lot of...  Well, all those, yeah.  But all those theories about the number of computers  on the internet, replicating the number of neurons  in the brain, fascinating.  And there is some other new step.  I mean, I'm equally terrified and fascinated by it.  So it is a real...  I'm conflicted about the whole area, you know,  because I think it is...  I think something along those lines  is inevitably going to happen  if we don't run out of water and air.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do have to survive to get so far,  to use this as a survival mechanism.  Oh, but don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we don't run out of water and air  and we do make this happen,  I'm sure that the robots will cut off our water and air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, terraforming is the next step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Terraforming Mars?  Yeah, or the moon.  Or the moon.  Most likely Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we can just give the robots the moon.  They can have it.  No, I would like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We don't need it.  Then they'll get mad and come back and wipe us out  for exiling them to the moon.  You don't want to anger them, Ryan.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To end on a high note, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the most fascinating part of this article for me,  and it is a pretty thick article,  is the fact that memoristers, they think,  may actually work the way neurons work,  meaning that instead of having to have an analog of,  oh, well, this many computers,  this many processes working would emulate,  that they could actually build the memoristers system  to work the way the neurons work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we'll have Alzheimer's and questionable memory  and weird sociological...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Robots without Alzheimer's, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That could be our salvation right there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I did a...  Starting to sound like a classic of sci-fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes me think of the 23andMe stuff,  which I did. Oh, right, yeah.  Which I'm really excited about.  That's another topic I've been talking about all weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think that's irresponsible?  What?  To have a web company tell you  what your genetic profile is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  I don't know, it is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're a web company?  They're not a genetics company?  They're a genetics company.  Yeah. They happen to be on the web.  Right, okay. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, I mean, you have to answer a lot of questions,  and you feel a little bit like,  ooh, do I really want this information out there  in the world, just floating around?  And your name is tied to it, so it's out there,  but I'm more curious about my ancestry  more than the genetic issues, I guess,  because they look for a lot of genetic disorders,  but I also think it's important  that we can study all this data  and kind of learn more from it  and put it out there on the web  and have people contribute to the study of the genetics.  You fill out a survey, swab your cheek,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  send it into them, and they do a genetic profile?  Essentially, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought they took a blood sample.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, there's a test tube  that you have to spit into for like five minutes.  For five minutes?  You have to get a lot of spit, yeah.  Wow.  It's really gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, well, we've descended into all of us dying  and spitting into test tubes.  So let's, any final thoughts before we wrap it up here  with a very fine and long-standing show  that we've been able to wreck in Leo's absence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're sorry, Leo.  We tried, we really, really tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think it's been fantastic.  I really enjoyed talking to y'all.  And thanks to Leo for giving me the opportunity to sit in.  And thanks to Colleen and Dane  for doing such a great job cooperating  and making it happen.  Robert, thank you for staying up late  and chatting with us crazy people about all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been great.  I've been 90% of the time completely out of my depth,  but the 10% I was with you, I really enjoyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you couldn't tell by looking.  It was fantastic to hear your insights and talk with you.  And if people want to find out more about you,  where should they go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think I would love them to go to watch Carpool,  which is my weekly podcast  where I talk to interesting people,  including interestingly coming up soon, Leo Laporte.  He drove me, I drove him around Petaluma.  We saw the wonderful sights of Petaluma.  It's a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the cool thing about Carpool.  You actually get people to jump in the car with you.  There's a show called Drive Time.  Have you ever heard of it out of Connecticut or out of Boston?  No, I haven't.  It's like an American show.  I've been looking around for similar shows, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But I've watched a couple episodes  and I'm sorry to hear about your Prius, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it did get rather bent.  It's in sort of two pieces, but luckily I'm in one piece.  I was very lucky.  Yeah, I think the official term is called T-boning.  I was driven into the side,  a guy drove into the side of my car at 50 miles an hour.  He didn't see the very large stop sign.  So it wasn't my fault.  So, you know, I don't have a lot of guilt  and I was knocked out when it happened,  so I don't remember anything about it.  So strangely, strangely, even though I was knocked out  and taken to hospital and ambulance,  I feel very lucky.  Well, we're just glad that you're okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we're absolutely glad.  I'm glad you made it through  and can keep making more carpools.  There's a few more with the Prius in them, correct?  They were pre-taped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a few pre-taped ones  and I was actually in the new model Prius with Leo  when I came up to the Twitt Cottage in May.  So, you know, it was great fun.  We had a great day there and I know for a fact  that all the people who work there are lovely.  That's absolutely true.  That's a fantastic image.  Fantastic image of a mashed Prius.  Mine is much worse than that.  It was seriously smashed to bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And once again, what's that URL  where people can go for carpool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's luteube, double L-E-W-T-U-B-E dot com  and it's on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The ghostly voice of Patrick Norton.  Thanks for getting in with us.  We're so glad to have you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, my apologies for running late.  I tried to do something new and exciting  on an old XP system.  Or actually, it's XP on a new mini  and the netbook was just evil.  Oh, now it's finally logged in.  That's really insane.  No, I just tried relaunching into Skype one more time  and after eight and a half minutes this time,  it actually was able to log in.  Skype hates me.  Thanks for letting me come out, guys.  It was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it was good and you hopped in right at the right time.  It was great having you on as usual, my friend.  Roger Chang, it's good to have you on too.  It is.  Sounds enthusiastic.  I didn't give Patrick a chance to plug,  but you're plugging the same thing.  Roger produces Tekzilla, which Patrick co-hosts  with Veronica and where can folks find that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can find it at revision3.com slash Tekzilla  or tekzilla.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or iTunes.  Patrick, do you have anything else you wanna plug to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tekzilla with a K.  Actually, HDNation.tv, HDNation starts with Robert Heron  and I on Tuesday of this week,  which is all high def content,  including quite a bit of Blu-ray,  which apparently no one watches or will watch,  but we also talk about things like over the air  and online delivery of high def video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fantastic.  Ryan Block of Gadget, gdgt.com, pleasure as always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  And I actually forgot to plug at the top of the show  that Veronica has done a little bit for us as well.  She did our intro video.  She'll appear on the site again in another video,  probably in a couple of weeks.  I know, I hear she's kinda popular on the intro webs.  I heard that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And of course, Veronica, my friend,  thank you for being here as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.  I'm so glad I got to come to the cottage.  I'm sadly, I wasn't here,  but it was fun hanging out with you guys too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We will be having a new Sword and Laser  within the next couple of months.  We're reading a Game of Thrones right now,  if you're into that sort of thing, swordandlaser.com,  but of course they can watch you on Tekzilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, tekzilla.com and Cora on the PlayStation Network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And veronicabellmont.com to keep up with you.  Correct.  All right.  I'm Tom Aaron, I haven't done nearly enough plugging,  see that's gonna be mad at me.  Buzz Out Loud is the show that I do every day at CNET,  bol.cnet.com.  I do the Sword and Laser, I do East Meets West,  I do a lot of other things.  You can keep up with me at tommerritt.com.  And you can follow me on Twitter,  but it's really a pain in the ass sort of username.  So just go to at Tom Merritt  and then you can find my actual username there.  Thanks again, Leo.  Thanks again, Colleen and Dane.  And thanks everybody for being on the show.  Another Twitter is in the can.
