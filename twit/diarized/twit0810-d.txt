End time: 290.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, I you know every time I open my  Bitcoin core wallet and have to sync it. It's more than 100 gigabytes of data that you have to yeah  It takes a while crazy that blockchain is crazy big. Oh good. I'm glad you have a little left. How much did you say?

End time: 308.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About so in this particular wallet probably between  150 to 250 000 I haven't had a total I mined a total of 2 million  But I traded some of that in to get some bitcoin  So i'm not exactly sure how much I have left there are like four outstanding wallets. I have to find that's awesome

Start time: 309.92
End time: 377.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least you know the password to yours  Probably bitcoin is almost 50 000. Let me see what it is right now. It's going up all the time  And while i'm doing that let's say hello. Yeah, forty nine thousand one hundred ninety one dollars as we record  Let's say hello to wesley faulkner who is a developer advocate for the daily.co. Hi  Good to see you. I am always down for a bromance  Bromance, that's it. This is the bromance episode valentine's day bromance  It's good to have you all  I don't know where to begin. This is sometimes  The tech stories have a kind of coherent  Thread to them. Sometimes it's just a tossed salad  This is a tossed salad edition  So I don't know. I don't I mean any point I begin  It will  Fear wildly. I guess as we're talking about bitcoin  We should mention and maybe you can explain that elon musk's tesla bought one and a half billion dollars worth of bitcoin. What?  Why?  And they say they're going to let you pay for your next tesla in bitcoin, which makes me want to find my wallet

Start time: 379.87
End time: 403.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, I mean they had to cash in on what happened to the market the fact that they said that they were going to accept bitcoin  It kicked up bitcoin from running in the 36 to  47,000 range to the 36  46 to  47,000 wow  So I mean it was a major kick up so them buying all that bitcoin already earned them quite a bit of money

Start time: 404.08
End time: 408.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also the fact so wait a minute did they time it so they bought the bitcoin then made the announcement

Start time: 409.28
End time: 416.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think they understood that once they started doing these block purchases of bitcoin the market was going to explode

Start time: 417.22
End time: 421.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an essay was an sdc filing leo. They had to they had to announce that they did it

Start time: 421.60
End time: 424.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're a publicly held company. You can't spend a billion and a half on anything

Start time: 425.80
End time: 434.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because their cash on hand is I can't remember what it was. Let's call it 10 million dollars  So whatever 10 billion dollars so whatever it was that was a meaningful amount of their cash on hand. They had to report that

Start time: 435.06
End time: 441.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  he also  For reasons we don't fully understand has been tweeting like crazy about your doge coin there

Start time: 442.26
End time: 467.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has that I think is just him being a troll  A good troll. It's a fantastic for you  It's but I mean he did the same thing when when the kids were going after gamestop  We're going after the the hedge fund managers  So I think this is the malicious side of elon coming out and saying sure with a tweet  I can I can create he just flexes billions of dollars of value in a meme currency

Start time: 468.20
End time: 477.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's what dogecoin is right? It was a joke. Oh, yeah  Although is the is the math the the for it legit? I mean, it's it's a legit blockchain, right?

Start time: 477.72
End time: 528.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a actually it's a far more legit blockchain than some of the altcoins that are currently running  But when it was created it was created because a bunch of people said look it's too hard to mine bitcoin  This was five years ago, right four or five years. Whatever. Yeah. Yeah  You couldn't make anything on it unless you had a specialized rig  So it was created for and by people like me who wanted to do something fun  We used it on twitter to teach people how the blockchain worked  Yeah, and the difference was whereas there was a super limited number of bitcoin  There was an almost infinite number of dogecoin that you could mine  And we never expected it to be worth anything  It was it was purely bragging rights brian and I were running the miners on our systems  Just so we could compete with each other of who had more dogecoin and now  I mean, I think brian stash he just cashed it in and made like 20 000 dollars

Start time: 530.12
End time: 595.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Holy cow  Yeah, so what steve gibson did his security now on bitcoin?  Which was something like episode 287. I mean it was  It was  You know probably when it yeah episode 287. He explained  How cryptocurrency worked and he just as for fun?  Had set up a bitcoin miner and the next morning it plopped out 50 bitcoin  This is back when you know, no one was doing it, right?  So the whole idea of these currencies is it gets harder and harder to mine until you mine a maximum amount  And then you've got all the coin you're going to create  Uh so that there is so that it if you keep creating it, it's inflationary  So you want to have a static amount but you don't want to dump it on the market all at once so  It's all you know part of the theory satoshi nakamoto published in his original bitcoin paper  So he was able to mine it very easily initially. It's now of course very costly to mine. It takes a lot of  The math problems are harder and harder and harder  Uh, he he erased the hard drive with the wallet on it. So  He's at this point he's going that's 2.5 million dollars

Start time: 596.62
End time: 615.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are actually a a huge amount of bitcoin that are no longer viable. They're dark. They're forever lost  Yeah, and remember there's there's only a maximum of 21 million bitcoin that will ever be mined ever now  You can do fractions of that compare that to dogecoin to which coin has  100 billion dogecoin

Start time: 616.48
End time: 621.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 643.30
End time: 701.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that a corgi?  It's a shiba inu. Oh  The reason that I know that is and I know the exact timing because it was it was february. It was as cold as it is  Right now it was 2014  so dogecoin had just come out and I went to  Some sort of crypto party down on wall street  They had rented out a thing at the end of wall street and people brought those dogs and people at the end of the night  they all um,  Put a shiba whatever that dog's head is the doge head on the bull the running bull behind wall street  And I reached out to some of those people that I met that night because it was like  Dogecoin was all the rage and like a lot of them had sold out and stuff  It was it was 50 50 i'd say to the people I reached out to they're like, yeah  I I sold out of that a long time ago  One guy was like I sold out of that a month ago when it reached, you know  A quarter of a penny or something and it surged all the way to a quarter of a penny  And then half of them were like, yeah, I don't know what i'm gonna do now, but maybe i'll cash out now

Start time: 701.78
End time: 704.92

Start time: 705.82
End time: 728.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put it put it this way leo  When I was still at twit and I stopped mining the entirety of all of my wallets together, which was  One to two million range  Uh was worth about a dollar forty  If if I had actually had it and been able to cash it out at the top  It would have been worth somewhere in the vicinity of 140 000. Holy moly

Start time: 731.84
End time: 737.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so  Is this all just a pyramid scheme and a scam or is this legit?

Start time: 739.44
End time: 740.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not legit

Start time: 742.00
End time: 764.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not talking about dogecoin. I'm just cryptocurrency in general. I know if you say it's not  The next big thing you're gonna get flamed like crazy by the by the bitcoin bros  And there are people who've made a ton of money i'm gonna tell you somebody who's a bitcoin billionaire in a second  but  It's a fiat currency tied to nothing, right?

Start time: 765.74
End time: 770.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, and if you say that all of the bitcoin stands are going to point out the fact that

Start time: 771.28
End time: 777.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dollar is a fiat currency. It's a fiat currency tied to the full faith and credit of the united states government slightly

Start time: 777.38
End time: 788.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precisely precisely is slightly different. But here's here's what I always say  It's not a scam in the sense that you actually can make a lot of money if you watch the market if you convert it into actual money

Start time: 788.82
End time: 793.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dollars, yes, you could do something. You actually can. Yeah, here's the problem. It's a financial instrument

Start time: 793.66
End time: 807.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like investing in a in a jock a junk bond, right?  Where you can get a lot of money and you can lose a lot of money. It is great as a financial instrument  It is terrible as a currency. You don't want your currency to fuck that's a very good point

Start time: 808.46
End time: 893.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of problems with at least with bitcoin  Of course subsequent  Cryptocurrencies have attempted to solve them one is the speed of transactions  As the as the blockchain gets bigger and bigger has really become slow  You could pay more to get the transaction app and faster to get the miners to process it faster  But that's that's problematic and then the volatility of the actual value is very problematic because if I buy a pizza  For 50 bitcoin and it turns out later that that was worth two and a half million dollars  I'm gonna be unhappy about that. So those are real issues with a currency not so much with I see what you're saying though  Not so much with a financial instrument that might well happen if you had a share of that us steel stock on brian's wall  That that fluctuates  I actually had a very long discussion on twig a couple of weeks ago, which we actually cut out  Of the shipping version because it really was fruitless in which I made the point  That a stock isn't so very different and you know people  In their mind tie the value of a stock to the fundamentals of the company  But it isn't really tied to it. No, it's only tied to it because people say it's tied to it, right?  You can't say oh you can't or maybe you can't tell me anybody who knows this maybe wesley, you know  Can I take those shares of if they weren't cancelled of us steel and go to us steel and say I want to cash this in

Start time: 895.20
End time: 912.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know the answer to that question. Does anybody know? Yeah, but leo, okay if you're going all the way with a history hat on  If you're going all the way back to like the the east india company and stuff like that  When when corporations were first formed the idea was is you had a claim on those future cash flows

Start time: 912.18
End time: 916.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're buying a share of the company and so you share in the profit

Start time: 917.42
End time: 927.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This right the thing that's divorced in modern stocks is that most companies don't pay dividends?  And even the best ones your verizons or whatever pay like, you know, three percent or three and a half

Start time: 927.42
End time: 935.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're not sharing in the success of the company, right? And a lot of historically tech stocks  It's changing a little bit now, but google doesn't pay dividends

Start time: 936.68
End time: 948.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple for years didn't now they do but like the british east india company you would you would get a dividend of 30 percent  Of whatever their net was every year  Right, so that's a meaningful. Yeah

Start time: 949.06
End time: 978.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That means you really have a percentage of the company and and I somehow at some point stock market got the stocks got  Kind of separated from the meaning of that  And when it's first issued the cash you pay for it ultimately goes to the company  But at that point it just floats along depending on the whim of the market  Somewhat divorced from the performance of the company  Right. I mean there's nothing actually tying it to the performance of the company. There's dividends. That's about it

Start time: 980.20
End time: 997.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, and even in that case, I mean because there's common stock and there's preferred stock and common stock is  What we used to think stocks were where you're buying a share of the company. Therefore you have a voice. That's a common stock  Preferred stock is you can get paid a dividend, but you've got no vote. Yeah, look at facebook. It doesn't matter how much

Start time: 998.26
End time: 1028.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stock they issue mark zuckerberg will always have the lion's share and always have control of the company period  They've been very smart that way. So anyway, that's the only point i'm making is  A lot of what we do today in modern finance is fiat  Is faith-based is yeah, uh, you know, i'm gonna invest in this because I think it's gonna go up  And so it's really silly to criticize bitcoin for not being tied to anything when frankly a lot of stuff is not tied to anything  either

Start time: 1029.48
End time: 1073.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, but the truth is that the environments right now is like  Casinos are closed a lot of gambling establishments are closed. The interest rate is really really low. It's not expected to  Increase anytime soon people are looking for ways  To shuffle their money in places to try to get the the strong ups course that they would get yes  It's not surprising that a lot of people are putting stuff in things that we wouldn't in other times do  Have you heard of rally and rallies able you're able to issue your own coin and say hey  I want to thank people who love me. So i'm gonna issue rally. It's a leo coin or whatever. Yeah, wesley coin  Have you heard of the the hotness that is non-fungible tokens right now and you can invest in

Well, it's like  Remember the crypto kitties the right well, it's the same. It's the same people crypto kitties  Started that and then whatever whoever is the company behind crypto kitties.

Start time: 1179.54
End time: 1191.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I would take it as tacit proof  From the church that that this stuff is worthless  It is literally worthless because priests can have as much as they want  Do whatever you want because it's worthless

Start time: 1192.48
End time: 1239.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Are you doing arbitrage?  No, no, no, no, it's all within a brokerage account a a bitcoin a  Cryptocurrency brokerage account but xrp when I bought it was running at about 10 cents  And then it got under a sec investigation for running a unregistered security now that should have killed it  That should have killed any stock any actual financial transaction tool.

Start time: 1311.86
End time: 1323.10

Start time: 1358.72
End time: 1387.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And uh, that would be devastating but in theory leo, that's the argument for  bitcoin specifically  Is it being a store of value that is a hedge against inflation?  And so the ultimate as you know, the padre would probably tell you the ultimate bull case  for bitcoin  Would be it replaces gold if it had if bitcoin had a market cap equal to gold's market cap  Then you'd have bitcoin one million

Transcript:  No, it is all imaginary. I understand  It's all imaginary and that uh, I think that people don't really want to think about that because it would scare the hell out  Of them if they did  Uh, all right more evidence that uh something's happening with bitcoin jay-z and jack dorsey  Which are two things you don't necessarily think of going together have invested 500 bitcoin  Which is 20 what 25 million dollars to make?  Uh to make it the currency of the internet  It's an endowment called  B trust but the b is the bitcoin b with little  stuff it's a blind irrevocable trust so  neither jay-z  Uh, nor uh jack dorsey can can say what happens to it  They're going to hire three board members and the mission of this new  25 million dollar fund is to make the bitcoin the internet's currency  Uh, this is going to be an issue because it's going uphill against many governments  Although  I have to point out and this was a story from a month or two ago  that uh a number of governments have said we should have some sort of stable coin  And that is a intergovernmental currency  lira  Tell me what is okay. Okay. What's a stable coin anybody want to take that one?

Transcript:  Okay, so you do not want  Your currency to be the volatile coin. The volatile coin is fun  And sometimes very profitable if you are investing  But you do not want an an announcement from a company like tesla to suddenly drive the price of your currency up by 25  Or down that should never the up is okay. It's the down i'm worried about right?  precisely and that's that's what so many of us are waiting for because  The you you buy on the dip and then you make profit. Well, we haven't really had a dip  We've been rising since november and it's getting scarier and scarier and scarier. We broke 20 000  Then 30 000 then 40 000 now we're breaking 50 000  That's that and in any other system that is a clear sign of madness and a crash that's coming  but  You need a stable coin where you can pull the money out of the volatile coin  So it can sit when you think it's overheated  When you think there's about to be a dip you need a place to be able to pull the money out so that you you don't  Ride the ride the coin down.

Some people can make a lot of money  And but I worry about the others that money doesn't come from nowhere  Uh, if i'm a billion dollars richards because somebody bought a billion dollars with a bitcoin  correct  Is it a zero sum game? No, because the value can just go on forever, right?

Transcript:  Which is an 18th century title if I ever heard one issued a letter saying federally charted banks could use stable coin  Or any cryptocurrency with relatively stable prices for standard banking transactions like payment activities  And this is happening globally as well national banks all over the world are doing this  Um, so that's what I mean by it's that we're in the wild west because on the one hand  It's being embraced the sec is trying to figure out what to do with this  there are bitcoin bros out there making a lot of money and very few people are facing the  Very real environmental impact. This is a study from the university  of cambridge  Where they're comparing the number of terawatt hours terawatt hours  That are used  To create bitcoin bitcoin is created  by solving hard math problems  And that means you have to have a very powerful computer eating a lot of energy generating a lot of heat  It's actually not too bad the total electricity consumption  By bitcoin is 20 000 terawatt hours and that's only 0.56 of the total global consumption, although  It puts bitcoin kind of on a par with uh, norway

Transcript:  Sorry a stat I saw recently was that um  That one track transaction on the blockchain on the bitcoin blockchain is the equivalent energy use of 32 000  Or maybe it was 320 000 on the visa network. So to do 32 000 transactions versus one transaction is yikes

Start time: 1769.98
End time: 1800.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so it's not just mining we're talking about transactional costs in power, right?  Visa if you do a credit card transaction, it's going to cost about 0.01  Kilowatt hours you do something in the ethereum blockchain, which is a bit more efficient and there's not as much running  It's about 37 kilowatt hours  Bitcoin is now breaking 200 kilowatt hours per transaction. So it's unsustainable  That's the other part of this which is you can't have your currency use up more power than your industry, right?

Start time: 1800.74
End time: 1880.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be a bad thing so this cambridge study though kind of came up with some things that made me feel a little bit  better  anyway, for instance  The amount of electricity consumed by always on but inactive home devices  in a year is  Could power bitcoin for 1.8 years  So if you want to look at inefficiencies turn off your freaking microwave computer and tv  Because they're just suck their vampireing  power  The amount of electricity consumed by bitcoin in one year could power all the tea kettles in the united kingdom  For 27 years. That's just silly a lot of tea. That's a lot of tea. That's just a that's silly  This is I thought was interesting but it puts it in perspective  In fact, if you really want to look and really put it in perspective this little yellow bar here is the total consumption of bitcoin  ranked 31 the number one country  China  Is using considerably more  As is the united states we the united states uses three thousand nine hundred eighty nine terawatt hours  a year almost four thousand terawatt hours a year compared to the  121 that bitcoin consumes and yet  We're using it to do stuff bitcoin is just using it to solve math problems

Transcript:  And you get things like there's a there's an old mining town up in the arctic circle of with in russia  That has become the new bitcoin hub for them because wherever power is cheap. Yeah, wherever. Oh cooling  Oh, that's cooling. It's a cool because cooling is so expensive to get these rigs the power  The problem is the way that they're getting the power  Because it's so remote is they're basically burning oil and coal  So they're burning really dirty power sources in the arctic circle in order to mine bitcoin  That's not going to end well.

I didn't plan on it  But there is certainly a lot to talk about  Let's sum up  Is this is this part of a  I feel like there's a huge economic risk. There's a huge bubble risk here that could  Bring the whole financial industry to its knees this and other  issues with bitcoin  um is that  What do you think is bitcoin on its balance or are cryptocurrencies on balance a positive or a negative father robert?

It's sort of true that bitcoin is anonymous  I don't think it's as anonymous as cash, but uh, it's sort of anonymous  since  one of the ways, you know, it's not anonymous is because we know by looking at the wallet that  400 million dollars in bitcoin has gone through joker's stash wallet since  2015 in 2018 it peaked at 139 million dollars a year sales have dropped over the last couple of years  That's the good news due to better security around credit cards anti-fraud technology people being more careful  joker's stash announced he's retiring  He notified customers in october. He'd been hospitalized or she'd been hospitalized with the coronavirus  In december interpol and the fbi seized the domains used by the site  That didn't matter because they were able to keep going through onion dot onion sites  But he's decided to retire the estimate and this is from elliptic.coa a cryptocurrency site is that  Joker's stash based on their commission about 20 on sales less than apple takes I might add is  60,000 bitcoin  He's retiring  With a nest egg of 2.5 billion dollars  I'd retire too

This is I talked to them a couple of weeks ago  About podium it is a way nowadays  This is going to be hard to describe what they do  But i'm telling you if you're a small business if you're a local retailer you really want to know about podium  We have a little bagel shop  It's fantastic bagels down the road  They could use podium  to  create messages to their customers  Either through their website or through text messaging  that would  Allow them to do so much get reviews  Chat with the customers take podium payments video chat  The podium inbox and all of this is not coming from some faceless corporation. It's coming from your business  It's a way for you to talk with your customers easily effectively to build loyalty to build your business  And nowadays in quarantine, this is an incredible way to operate contact-free  Encourage people to shop local communicate with customers and teammates while working from home  Small businesses need to stay connected with their customers. I actually I won't name the the there's an ice cream shop in town  That uses podium and I get  Coupons it's very effective in my text saying hey, you could save 20 right now. Come on in  You can ask for reviews you can send a text that makes it very easy for your customers to leave an online review  This is a huge tool for small businesses for local businesses  Improving their search rankings. Here's something you should know  98% of all text messages get opened  There is no other way you could communicate with people that with a higher  Response rate phone calls. Nobody answers the phone anymore even email no more than 20 text messages get opened  They work they're welcome  You could put it on your website podium web chat  Let's website visitors text with your team right from your home page  Your team will love it because they don't have to be sitting anywhere to get those texts. It actually comes to their phone  So no matter where they are they can interact with customers if you're like me as many small businesses, you know owner operator  This is this is gold. These are the customers you most want to keep  Podium video chat lets you meet with customers  Podium supports payments so you can be paid fast over text  So if I can pay that for that bagel go in and get it  Get my dozen bagels  Uh all in one text message. That's awesome  Podium is quick to set up you can be on boarded within a day  They've got a great team in place. I was like I said talking to them wonderful people  They can answer any questions walk you through everything. Let me give you some examples  From some local businesses that have benefited  the bridal collection  Lynn who's the owner of the bridal collection?  We don't have to take credit cards in the store anymore. We could do it completely remotely  They've processed over two hundred thousand dollars in no contact payments podium. She says has been a godsend  For us in this journey  America's car mart  collected 21,000 leads  Through web chat before podium says tj who's in charge of digital experience at america's car mart before podium made a contact us form  Could be days before anybody got back to that customer now. Thanks to podium and this text messaging  Our response time has been cut down to minutes  Great for a medical  Office  You know remind your customers. They've got appointments  They can make appointments through the text messaging and then you're going to get reviews south tampa family and cosmetic dentistry  Perfect example, you know as as the customer walks out the door  Hey, I hope you had a great experience. Would you mind leaving us a review here and they walk you through the review?  It's very quick  That's how they got 1200 reviews averaging 4.9 stars stars. Dr. Wyatt the dentist there  So the number of walk-ins as a result of our reviews has skyrocketed  Before we were seeing 50 to 100 new patients a month now. We're seeing closer to 200  This really works. The problem is it does so many things. It's hard to explain  I want you to go to podium.com  Take a look you can get up and running find out how podium can help your business reach more customers  You'll be using it tomorrow. Let's put it that way get started free today at podium.com  It's very affordable and it will transform your business, especially now podium podium  Dot-com  Twit why not use the medium that gets the most response gets opened the fastest 98  open rate  Text messaging do it with podium podium.com slash twit. Thank you podium  for entrusting us with your message, we really appreciate it and thank you twit listeners for  Supporting the show by going to that website  Use that address  podium.com slash twit  Did you see the information article facebook is going to make a smartwatch next year  There's you know, there's this battle going on and I don't know how serious it is, but I really do feel like  There's a battle between facebook and apple facebook's taken out full-page ads and major newspapers saying apples  No, they're smart. They're not saying apple's trying to screw us  With their app tracking technology, but they're saying uh, apple's trying to screw small business  and us  with att  And I think that this is almost like remember the old days with steve jobs going after google or adobe  This is almost like that with mark zuckerberg saying  So facebook according to the information and for people with knowledge  Of the product is planning to do a smartwatch  Which i'm not wearing a facebook smartwatch that sounds that sounds like a recipe for uh,  incredible  Spying  Um, but they they see this as a way to kind of uh, I think they want to end around  Frankly, they want to end around apple. It would use a google an open source version of google's android software  Which makes it very easy for them to develop  Um  I don't know if it'd be as expensive as an apple smartwatch  Or even as a fitbit. I imagine facebook would subsidize it

Transcript:  the um  the this continues to always be the same thing also with amazon is the  We're all paying for the fact that they they were never able to make a phone, right?  Yeah, they're trying to find all the orthogonal ways to get that information  Well or uh to be a little  I don't know whatever towards them  Um to have security to have a platform, you know, it's it's platform insecurity that they can't take a moment  Yeah, they can't take that away from me

Transcript:  I see two parts here  The first part is facebook wants something to leverage against apple because they they see the coming battle with apple right now  It's little shots across the bow  But eventually those two giants are going to go at each other because they both want the same thing  apple really wants  A view into customer habits that facebook wants and facebook wants the screens that apple has so that that's one side  i'm, not too concerned about that what i'm concerned about is the other part which is  In many parts of the world, maybe not the united states, but definitely in asia definitely in africa and parts of europe  Facebook is the internet  The there's no internet that has facebook. It's they get the internet through facebook. That was their internet plan

Transcript:  Well, it's not the service. I mean you might get your service your your connection connection to the internet from someplace else  but people  Think of the internet in terms of where is it on facebook?  Uh, I I have I mean part of my job is to reach these people  And I have to be reminded constantly because I am so anti-facebook. I hate using the platform  And then I have my advisors who come in and say you don't understand if it's not on facebook. It is the platform

Start time: 2904.74
End time: 3034.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You right you won't get them. Here's the it is the internet. This is the internet.org  By facebook  Which is terrifying to me  It's brilliant. I mean if you're facebook, um, there are lots of places in the world where you can't get the internet or it's so expensive  You can't afford the internet that they basically offer  Free and i'm going to put internet in air quotes here because as you said robert, there's some stuff like wikipedia  But really it's facebook. It's a way to get facebook  onto these smartphones all over the world  Um, let's let me just i'm just kind of curious. I see they have their mission statement  The internet is essential to growing the knowledge we have and sharing it with others  And for many of us, it's a huge part of everyday lives  Most of the world does not have access to the internet internet.org is a facebook-led initiative with the goal of bringing internet access  And the benefits of connectivity the portion of the world that doesn't happen see that seems all well and good  india said no  because uh, they said you know, uh, we have plenty of experience with colonialism. Thanks. We've shaken off the yoke of our  British overlords. We're not about to accept mark zuckerberg as our  That's our new overlord  um  Interesting. This is the wall street journal article  Which I think is a little manufactured  Facebook meets apple in a clash of the tech titans. We need to inflict pain. It's got a picture  Of tim cook with a smoking pointing finger emoji  Shooting at mark zuckerberg with a smoking like emoji or thumbs up emoji or maybe that's the poke emoji. I don't know  uh, they quote a  First of all, I don't think it's mark zuckerberg versus tim cook  That makes for good copy in a newspaper, but I don't think it's that personal  Uh, and they and they also this this quote they use from mark zuckerberg  We need to inflict pain  Something he told his team but it comes from 2018  It's not breaking news here  Yeah, that's clickbait. It seems to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although it seems like this is more towards google than apple  Getting into space when you think about the fitbit acquisition and how google has pledged that they will not sell that data for advertising  I'm guessing facebook will not have such a restriction  So being able to tap into people's health information for advertising is something that's extremely  Aventages for them because you won't get that with apple you won't get that with google so facebook can fill in the gap

Start time: 3062.88
End time: 3082.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For people advertisers looking to put money around health and you're absolutely right the competition for facebook is not apple  Apple may be throwing speed bumps at facebook, but that's not the competition. It's google  The the the two if you can buy an apple and google they dominate 90 percent of all online advertising

Start time: 3083.32
End time: 3147.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but that's that's what I that gets back to what I was saying about the  We're paying for the fact that we never bought a facebook phone when they tried to launch one  Like if you know, you know google always has their their moonshots because they're like  We know we're a one trick pony of this advertising game. We need something else, right?  If you think about facebook thing  Remember is steve jobs famously said he's he doesn't like working through orifices, which he meant the the telecom companies  Like facebook has had to go through two orifices this entire time, which is apple and google  and so when you see facebook  Investing two billion dollars to buy oculus because  Vr or control labs they I think they spend a billion dollars on that and that's a brain  computer interface thing  Zuckerberg wants he he he's tired of going through these orifices. He wants his own platform  Now you could say facebook is a platform except for the fact that he has to go through apple  He has to go through ios and android to get to you, right?  So that's always what they're thinking his moonshot is like I need the next whatever the next computing platform is

That's one of the reasons I don't own an oculus quest  Because you have to have a facebook account to use it. So everything you do on that device is immediately piped into facebook  It's interesting because I think people are becoming more aware of this and this is probably where facebook's really worried about apple  Once apple started showing the privacy information about whatsapp  We know millions of people left whatsapp and went to signal and uh telegram

It always comes down to well, but everyone I know is on whatsapp, right?  And even even when we've sat down and have great conversations about well, this is what it means  These are the privacy concerns. It's not just about you. It's about the people you're connected to you're you're potentially becoming a security risk for them  even then  They say okay. Well, i'll download signal, but i'm still going to use whatsapp. Yeah, because that's it's it is so

Amazingly they have rebuilt the old aol walled garden except they've done it without walls  Yeah, they've created a a  Platform a virtual platform or just a combination of services that is so sticky that is so addictive  That if once you're in it, you really have no reason to go out even if someone explains to you all the reasons why it's so bad  Everything that you want is in there.

Yeah, it's just because it's what it's i'm not concerned as much about the security implement  Reasons of not using it because i'm careful  As careful as I can be and so there's also a little bit of safety in numbers  so right if there's a compromise there would be a big stink and hopefully, uh,  It will be cleared up pretty quickly  But a lot of my friends and family who aren't as tech savvy are still on the platforms and it's  almost  Uh a university universal like connector if I need to talk to someone I might not have their new number  Um, they may not be on twitter, but you know your connection on facebook. Yeah, I know I can go there to to send a message  Which is it's just really efficient if there was a way to decouple  Kind of like a windows phone all of that  Into an its own rolodex. I I wish that that was a thing that we could make portable  But right now there's no good alternatives to you know  To unify all the people that I know from various networks and I really don't want to lose touch  With all those people.

Transcript:  For some of these tech solutions. I so agree 100  100 percent  But I have a suggestion an apostle solution it's coming from jack dorsey  He's suggesting he's working on he's looking at ways to create a decentralized  twitter  And they call it blue sky. They've been doing hiring around this  There was an article in the verge  This week twitter's jack dorsey wants to build an app store for social media algorithms  Now i'm reading a little bit into what dorsey has said and what the plans are  But what if and and this also comes from other people who have suggested  What you need to do what facebook needs to do is  Open their apis  But what if instead of a monolithic silo of information called twitter?  Called youtube called facebook  These were federated networks  Where there were many facebook's and you could it wouldn't hurt your ability to talk to your family members or your friends  Because they would be connected through the federation  They could be in facebook south or facebook west or facebook east  Or whatever you call it facebook green facebook blue  That's their facebook with people, you know with  maybe communities of interest  But you can federate so that you can communicate across these barriers in effect eliminating the the walls that divide these  the question of course is well  Why would anybody why would facebook twitter or or google do this?  Because they make their money by being the unique one and only place to go in fact twitter has  Continually moved towards pushing people away from third-party apps towards websites  But i'm hopeful that maybe dorsey sees this as a as a way forward especially given the  threat of regulation  From the government  He says we could make money  Selling our unique  Algorithm  So there's a pool of information owned by a lot of people on a lot of sites  What what he wants to do is build an app store?  That is and maybe other people have apps in there too that says here's westley's app for following the most interesting stories  on the

Transcript:  Giant universe of twitter information. This is where i'm going to gloat a little bit  The last time I was on twitter you suggested this  This was my I called it the tom hanks algorithm or whatever nice guy algorithm. Yes  This is this is my idea and this is not the first time that i've made a prediction on twitter and it's come true  I talked about when the ipad came out how that is going to be  Are you going to keep track of this platform?  for the next  The arm-based max and it came true. I'm just saying that  So you like this idea. This is a winning idea. You invented it. Yeah. Yeah, can I play devil's advocate? Okay

Start time: 3624.96
End time: 3643.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all right, so  Obviously, I love that idea. I love the idea of a federation. I love the idea of companies doing something that's good for society  but  Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to legislate  I think in response to the heat they've gotten with section 230 reform and big tech investigations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they would go willingly but i'm going to quote from the verge article dorsie sees decentralization as a way to  quote address some of the problems around section 230  Twitter's been working on this for a long time. I think it's a good idea  I think it's a good idea to do something that's good for society  I think it's a good idea to do something that's good for society  The problems around section 230  Twitter's been working on this for a year. This is their this is they're actually  I agree you can't force or probably could force but maybe it wouldn't be ideal to force a company to do something that's against their  You know financial interest but if but if he thinks he can find a way to monetize  I think that  I think you solve a lot of the problems  That we'd have and you know what if you want to be a nazi you can go and use nazi facebook  um  And it takes the pressure off of zuckerberg to find the nazis  and if I don't want to see any of that stuff, I don't have to include them in my  Field right, you know, we can't shut up nazis. We can't shut them up

Transcript:  We're seeing this as a tech problem. We're seeing that big tech has a problem with that's a splitting up their services  Yeah, it's not it's not a tech problem. This is a financial problem  The big tech giants are running by the financial rules  You have to show results every single quarter the way that you do that is you make agreements with other networks in order to maximize  The profits and the stickiness of your platform  So unless you change that and you change it so that I don't have to be looking over my shoulder every quarter  Because I need to show quarter over quarter growth  Then no tech company is going to take this seriously they'll pay at lip service  They'll probably give a couple of executives to sit on a board to talk about it  But then when it comes down to quarterly earnings they're going to say  I can't open up my algorithms to you because of course, that's what makes me special

Start time: 3759.62
End time: 3782.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's what jack's saying though is we have special algorithms  And we think they're of value  And if we if we offer them for sale, that's where we make our money because right now twitter doesn't charge anything  But what if twitter charged five bucks a month to use that special secret sauce that twitter has and I got this amazing feed  from the  giant pool of information  Wouldn't they make money?

Yeah for us to store our data  Yeah, if we like california's laws, we can choose to have it stored there if we like texas's laws  Store it there but have a government place that allows us not to participate  in a facebook or google or whatever twitter's  Way of communicating and storing information if we want to say it just make sure that  Hey, this will not be used and it's under the  Protection of the u.s. Government and and we can pay them to store this to do that as a public service  especially if we're talking about  like  E-records for health records if we want to have that stored in a place that we don't want ever to have a question  That it might be either compromised or used in a way that we didn't predict  We need some sort of we need controls  But we need a if if government wants to regulate something regulate that new entity that they create  Saying we will regulate this and this is what will guarantee sad to say will never happen

Transcript:  It's federated twitter and it's funny leo  You have pushed me tonight to be the one that stood up for crypto and bitcoin, which I don't necessarily  And now i'm going to be the one that says  This is 100 cynical  Because the irony is is a lot of the especially the social  Networking companies, but a lot of these big tech companies have made their billions and trillions of dollars  by throwing fencing around the open web, yep, and  Essentially what jack is arguing and and and zuckerberg has argued zuckerberg said to congress, please regulate us  We don't want to make these decisions if you hadn't created these walled gardens around the free and open internet  You wouldn't have these section 230 problems. So essentially what they're trying to craft  Is a cover your ass way out of this where as a perfect example is podcasting and there are people that have there been articles recently  about well, how do you  How do you deal with the the nazi podcasts that are out there and well you can't  Because rss is a free and open protocol.

Transcript:  So yeah, why not try this speaking of the public option, which and I love that phrase wesley  I gotta give you credit for that. Uh, you know that tim berners-lee the inventor of the world wide web has actually proposed such a  Such a thing. It's not exactly a public option, but the idea that people should control their own data that he's got a startup called  Inrupt i n r u p t and the idea is  To create a data silo that you you control you own that's yours  That you then have and you know, maybe it is the u.s postal service that runs the u.s  version of this  Actually tim's  Concept is called solid  Uh a technology for organizing data applications and identities on the web and that's the key  I don't you know, this is so blue sky and it's so hard for people to understand  but basically you create your own data pod  And then you have apps that can access from data from your data pod but have to get permission  and then it can be shared with  Others but only with your permission you control which apps access your data  And yeah, maybe the postal server maybe i'll have instead of a postal box i'll have a postal pod

I'm sorry like ups fedex  And rural where it doesn't seem like it makes financial sense to have service there  Yeah, so it's some sort of backing by government entity that can guarantee that everyone has access to this I agree

They're not going to do a deal with kia  Brian you must have gone crazy covering this story over the last couple of weeks. What is it?

Start time: 4464.74
End time: 4513.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's between that there's i'll tell you what's been happening these last couple weeks is that  I keep calling it, you know smoke around fires and all of a sudden there was a lot of smoke around the the car and then  That got tamped down and they replaced it with smoke around the arvr. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  So right now the the state of play as of whatever time it is tonight february 14th  There's more smoke around the arvr thing  but  My take on the the hunday thing is I mean, and I don't know hunday as a company but like there  it felt to me like  They were slapped down by apple for stuff getting out. That's what I thought. That's what I would not be shocked at all if  Maybe not this month, but sometime soon we see this deal announced

Start time: 4514.48
End time: 4559.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the first thing was hunday said hey, we're talking to apple  And then as soon as I saw that chills went down my spine. I thought oh this is not going to end well  Because you know apple doesn't want you to say in that and true enough three hours later. They said  Forget we said that we're many apples i'm sure talking with everybody we know  And then a week or two later kia, which is a hunday subsidiary and by the way hunday has a very good ev  Platform they've just announced  Uh some really, you know really nice  design  That would be very nice for an apple car, but kia which has a  factory in georgia  which is  You know, whoever if apple's doing a car whoever they work with has to have the ability to make 100,000 cars a year

Start time: 4560.58
End time: 4666.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the goal. Can I let me give you three arguments in favor of this possibly going through?  apparently  They have a lot of capacity there  So this would make sense because I read an article once where they're like well  But hunday's this company that doesn't like to you know, we're not going to manufacture cars for some other company. We're an insular  But at the same time  That's not what they're asking you to do apple saying hey, you've got some spare capacity over here. Let's let's do this  Number two and I got a credit mg sigler for this one  but it kind of sounds like the  When apple made the deal with singular for the iphone  Which is they're not going to tesla. They're not going to mercedes  They're kind of going to somebody that maybe is a little hungry. Yeah  That might be willing to be like, okay, it's your apple car. We'll just we'll just uh manufacture it to your specs  We're fine with that because we're hungry  But the number three what you just mentioned about their platform what you got to understand about their that that ev platform is because  With these electric vehicles, you don't have all of the moving parts the drivetrain all this stuff what what?  These platforms as you're calling them are are essentially the term for it is a skateboard. Yeah  So essentially it's just the battery and the wheels and whatever and then you're able to do  Anything you want on top of it and you can go crazy and that's one of the things i've i've done stories on this where  people are talking about how car design is going to go crazy because  If you get on one of these platforms if you're apple who loves to design  And hunday kia has this skateboard platform that you can basically have carte blanche to do with whatever you want with  I can see that that would be very attractive to an apple if they really are going to do a car

It's really got some nice features 300 mile range  500 kilometers, which is about the same on a single charge  Fast charging  There's a there's a lot of good. This is a very state-of-the-art  Skateboard it's perfect for apple  Whether apple's going to do a car or an ar glasses is unknown. I mean, it's also important to point out  That apple like any company is developing a lot of different potential products doesn't mean they'll make it to market

Transcript:  Can I ask a question? Yeah  I mean I I get  Why you'd want a car as a status symbol, but apple is used to such high margins  Oh, it won't be a cheap car father robert  It's not going to be a cheap car  but I mean you're not going to sell anywhere near the number of cars as you would ipads or watches well  What's in it for them other than other than the cache of being able to say we're also a car company  Most car companies don't make a lot of money.

Transcript:  I did a whole episode on this and it it makes sense if you look at it from this perspective  Yes  Uh car companies usually have around three percent margins in the best of times  And the best run car company in the world toyota has six percent margins. So that's nowhere. Nothing. That's nothing  nothing  however, if you're apple and you're rounding two point  Two and a half trillion dollars or whatever it is in market cap the only way that you can move the needle  To wall street is other large number of things. They have currently the best business in the world, which is  Selling thousand dollar pocket computers to people every couple years  The previous best business in the world was selling people 30 40 50 thousand dollar vehicles every seven years, right?  Every household in in the developed world  um the if i'm not going to get the the the  Numbers exactly right but the the thing that I did in that segment was I quoted from some analysts that said  um, you know the transportation market if you look at it as the global transportation market is something like  20 trillion dollars or whatever  If all apple does is come in at the top end even and get two percent of that  That's ten times the size of the current iphone business  in terms of revenue  So what what else can apple do that would that would you know?  Be ten times the size of the current iphone business

Transcript:  And also I I agree with you and I would throw in another thing is is to understand what apple's  Business really is because it isn't making computers. They even took computer out of the name  It isn't making  pocket computers  It's not making  health  watches  I would submit and I think tim cook has said things kind of along this line  That apple is an experience company. They're they're there to use digital technology to provide experiences  for their customers  and  I think the real question to answer your your question robert is is what is the future of personal ownership for automobiles?  and honestly, uh  I don't think in 10 or 20 years you're going to see personal ownership of automobiles.

It's got a little incense burner or whatever  I don't know what the experience is going to be but that's what but that's what apple would offer. So I think that  It's probably I don't  You know you made a good argument brian that maybe it is a good business to get into  But honestly, do you think in the next 10 20 years?  Personal ownership of vehicles is a good business to get into no, absolutely not. However, two

Apple's got lidar and iphones apple's doing their own silicon now their own chips  um, they're doing these arm-based chips that are good for things like um,  You know self-driving and algorithms and ai and all these things  You can see a scenario where everything apple and this would tie into the arvr headset  Like all of the the work that they're doing on the car could potentially be even if it never creates a car  Money well spent in terms of rnd for all of the other things and vice versa doing an ar headset and learning about lidar

It's one of those things like  You know, i'm a developer advocate for daily  Our api is used for web rtc, which has the component of video and audio people  We've been seeing a huge influx of people trying to build their own audio social network on our platform  Interesting, so I guess we have to scramble to like create these blog posts  I think we're coming out with one next week  The details how to do that, but it's I feel that that's probably going across the board people with like like I mentioned quilt before  There's a huge space  Just like what we're talking about where people were shoveling money into bitcoin because they need  To shovel money into a big bet that they think is going to explode audio is a big bet. It's going to blow up  Not necessarily because people are clamoring for it. It's because people are trying to make it happen  So it I hate this may not be big because people want it but it's gonna be big because investors want it

Where back in june there were 2 000 people on there and we all knew each other and so it was  Cool and fun and interesting and then I forgot about it. So when it blew up again last month  I go on and it's all sorts of you know, it's literally like linkedin or whatever  It's everybody trying to impress everybody else. It's everybody trying to  uh, I don't know get jobs and and and impress famous and rich people, however  so  potentially what i'm waiting to see is  Is it you let everyone in it's not invite only and is it just everyone trying to shout as loud as possible. However  My wife who back in june when she would listen in when I was on there  Dismissed it as there's oh, they're just a bunch of tech people on this is not for me or whatever  She's an architect and now she leaves it on there are multiple architect  Rooms every single day. Yeah, and she leaves it on in the background like it's talk radio  That it's just sort of and then maybe she pipes in if she, you know is so moved or whatever, but  um, I don't know like it's either going to be the thing like  My experience where oh my god, it's kind of gross and I don't want to do this anymore  Or it's going to be like my wife's where it's like I just find my my niche and i'm happy  They're gonna have to

There are ones that for protected people or people who get online harassment  There are going to be so many different ways that people are going to approach this problem  Unfortunately, I think this is the time where your first to market doesn't mean you're going to be the market dominator  Leader, um, if this is they're just going to expose all the problems that people are going to fix when they come out with their own

I use voice communities in discord  It has nowhere near the sort of velvet rope feel  Of of something like clubhouse and and honestly, I understand the appeal of clubhouse  Personally, it's it's not something I think I would ever want to do it. It sounds like  Too much work to reach people that I don't really care about and the funny thing is it's not hard

Transcript:  I mean wesley has a good point the the creating a audio  Conversation like this is actually not hard given the right tools and it seems like the solution to your problem wesley would be for  Individual creators to create their own clubhouses.

Transcript:  The rumor is that the way that they're thinking of monetizing  Is maybe it's going to be clubhouse that does that  Where in the sort of the patreon or the sub stack model where it's like you can own a certain club and it's yours  And you can charge subscriptions for it. You can sell tickets for one-off live events  You can do whatever and just give us a cut like that's one of the rumors of how they might be thinking about  Makes sense making it's a business.

Transcript:  But they don't have the right tools for the on the admin side for it to be worth it  You cannot control even if you can just have people there  There are a lot more tools you'll need in order to manage a group  If you've ever run a community on slack, you can understand all those boltons that were done just to make that go  The same with any niche communities that might have different needs  It makes sense to either build your own or use a turnkey solution that allow you to do that  Rather than use clubhouse, which is limited right now. They're ios  If you use a I mentioned web rtc  But if you use something like that, you would be able on on mobile desktop and be more be able to reach more people  Rather than their limited release cycle  There's there's a lot of things that they need to fix in terms of max room size  And there's a whole bunch of things that if they were going to do that  It they would have to a lot of pressure on the admin side to make sure the controls are there to be able to control

Transcript:  a little bit distributed distributed sainthood  Our show today anyway, we just wanted to get that little historical note in the uh in the record  for this st valentine's st. Valentine of rome day our show today brought to you by  ESET  you know, russell tamini who is our official it guy he's a  He is what's what do they call a russell? He's a managed service provider an msp  So he doesn't work for us. He's a contractor who works for wineries and other companies around the bay area  But we are so lucky to have him russell is kind of the heart and soul of our operation and every time I see him  When he stops by I say russell  Are we safe? It's kind of like that scene with the sir laurence olivier and the dental drill. Are we safe?  And he says yes, we're safe, but I but are you sure russell? He says leo  We are safe. We don't have to worry  And I found out the other day why he says that because we use eset. We've been using eset  for years eset enterprise grade security  That's easy to manage russell likes it because he can manage it from the cloud  And we like it because it has such a light system footprint eset's always been famous for using  Few resources not a lot of memory. They've just introduced something. I'm sure russell will want the endpoint security management platform. They call it eset  protect  One of the main features the new eset protect cloud which offers easy cloud-based management for businesses of all sizes  There's no restriction on seat size. So doesn't matter if you grow or shrink. It's all the same  Eset protect also takes security to a whole new level with a bunch of new bundled products  Featuring enhanced protection against ransomware. Are we safe? Yes, we're safe zero day threats  full disk data encryption capabilities for mac os and windows  And right now you can save 20 on these new bundles  You're not only getting the best in class cloud managed protection against advanced attacks the same kind we use here at twit  You're enjoying a significant  discount 20 off  Eset protect advanced is fantastic for a small business like us for msp's like russell  It has all the security you need russell loves the fact that he can be you know at a winery  You know  50 miles away and check in on us to see how our things are doing with his cloud-based management console  You get endpoint protection. That's really important now because all of our employees are working from home  You get cloud sandboxing. This is one of the things he said pioneered is brilliant  Before an email attachment arrives in our inboxes here. He said completely transparently instantly  Takes the attachment puts it in the cloud in a sandbox  Executes it watch is it watches its behavior in a completely safe way and it can detect a threat  Even a zero day before anybody knows about it. He said protect advanced. It's really great  If you want to go on prem, he said we'll do that too. He said protect can be run on prem  But either way you're getting powerful reliable security based on 30 years of research  And innovation and we've got a free trial and interactive demo for you at business.eset.com  Dot com slash  Twit he said got top ratings and av comparatives endpoint prevention and response  Comparative report they tested nine vendors. He said not only got the highest  Combined prevention and response score in the test but also demonstrated outstanding overall detection and reporting capabilities. They named  Them the strategic leader. That's their top rating signifying a product that has a very high return on investment and low total cost of ownership  plus exceptional  Capabilities remember get your free. He said business trial get that interactive demo business  Dot. He said dot com slash twit  You'll also save 20 on he said protect bundles, but this is a limited time offer. So don't wait  Trust. He said to future proof your business business dot. He said dot com slash twit  So that you can say when your client or your employees or your boss?  Asks, are you safe? Are we safe? You could say yes  We're safe. We use e set. I love e set business dot e set dot com slash  Twit we thank them so much for keeping us  safe  you know when the  original  story from  Bloomberg came out and was then immediately denied by  Many of the companies mentioned this is the super micro hack including apple super micro amazon  Which uses the elemental hardware that uses super micro a lot of people thought bloomberg. You got it wrong bloomberg never retracted  They said we have very good sources  They just on friday  Put out another story the long hack  How china exploited a u.s. Tech supplier?  for years  U.s. Investigators found tampering in products made by super micro  The company says it was never told they weren't doing it  Neither was the public when that first story came out. I said true or not  It is a very important warning about the dangers of the supply chain. You've got to protect your supply chain  Bloomberg now has a lot more details. I think you cannot I think we now I don't care what denials you hear  You cannot deny this story in 2010  The u.s department of defense found thousands of its servers sending military network data to china  The result of code hidden in chips that handled the machine's startup process in 2014  Intel discovered an elite chinese hacking group had breached its network through  A single server that downloaded malware from a supplier's update site  In 2015 the fbi warned multiple companies that chinese operatives had concealed an extra chip loaded with backdoor code in one manufacturer's  servers in each of these distinct attacks  Two things in common china and super micro, which is a  motherboard manufacturer in san jose  They shared one other trait u.s. Spy masters discovered the manipulations but kept them largely secret  As they tried to counter each one and learn more about china's capabilities. I know father robert you cover hacking  And i'm sure you know you had did you?  With the initial super micro report. Did you what were your thoughts at the time?

Start time: 7299.86
End time: 7335.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did so  On both twyatt and know-how. We actually took a look at some of the supposedly affected motherboards from super micro  And we did our own set of tests on them  Really basic stuff, which is we let them run and we watched all the network traffic  Every single packet that was leaving the server for the course of a month. We saw nothing  We saw absolutely nothing. We actually went back to the traces to look for traces of chips that were added  Absolutely nothing now  The the answer the response was well, they didn't modify everything and like you said it was a super micro

Start time: 7335.66
End time: 7360.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to make that very clear. It was in the supply chain  the motherboards would be shipped and then at some point between arriving shipment and arriving at the  End user they were modified  In fact, absolutely blenberg says that neither super micro nor any of its employees has been accused of wrongdoing  Former u.s  Officials who provided information with the story emphasized the company itself has not been the target of any counter intelligence investigation  It's a supply chain attack

Start time: 7360.96
End time: 7412.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, and and as you mentioned we know that that's a vulnerability  Everything that we use from our networking equipment to our phones are manufactured in china  So unless you've got someone there watching every step of the process  There is no way to guarantee that there's nothing added to a motherboard that could be sending data back  Now there are a few weird things in the story that the way that bloomberg reported it they were reporting that  laptops and motherboards were  Being uh, they had malware in the bios and i'm thinking wait a minute  These all all of these machines use uefi which do checksums now  You shouldn't technically be able to do that. Sure you you can drop an extra chip  But if you're trying to tell me that china has developed a way to hack uefi that is undetectable  I'm gonna need more proof than you just bringing on a so-called expert saying oh, yeah, they've totally done that

Start time: 7415.60
End time: 7425.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've covered the story i'm too i'm sure brian, uh both in october 2018 when the original story came out  I was really surprised on friday to see bloomberg double down  On this what's your thought?

Start time: 7426.52
End time: 7460.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I actually hadn't seen that that happened probably posted after I posted my show  um  I mean it I always come back to these  When these things come up or even like with the solar winds thing  Don't we just always have to assume that every that apple facebook?  There's there's spies from multiple countries working there actively  At every factory point  For software for hardware for whatever there are spies working in these factories to inject things like we just have to assume  That that's been the case for years now, right? Am I wrong?

Start time: 7460.96
End time: 7499.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was my point is whether you believe or don't believe the original story from october of 2018  It's clear. This is a potential problem. These supply chain attacks are happening. They've happened over and over again and and  Uh, we may you know, there's a real message that you've got to pay close attention to this stuff  And you can't assume that it because it's arriving in a sealed box. It hasn't been tampered with  um  You know, i'm surprised to see this again in in in bloomberg business week  They have more  sources  Again, they claim, you know sources in  law enforcement in the u.s military

Start time: 7500.66
End time: 7517.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They if if if a story was that controversial  And you went back and reported more and invested more resources in it and then doubled down  Like that's how many how many man hours if this is a year later?  You got to figure that they really feel strongly about this one. Yeah

Start time: 7518.82
End time: 7535.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean and I get that but what bothers me is they doubled down  And they brought in so-called experts  But the article that they wrote doesn't really provide  Any of the technical information we would need as a security community to verify that any of this is actually happening, right?

Start time: 7536.16
End time: 7563.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I always wonder it must be happening with those things though  Are we getting into areas where there is national security things where like they can't name names  they can't  specifically mention an incident because  The nsa or the cia or whoever whomever it is is like no by the way or the fbi  We're actively working on that or the fact that we know that this happened  We don't want people to know that we know that this happened. Yeah, I have a theory that because because this has resurfaced

Start time: 7565.20
End time: 7613.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna it looks to me like the original sources and by the by the way at the time there was some concern  The the original sources were motivated by president trump's animus towards china that maybe this was a planted story  Because nobody was able to confirm it later  Here it is. Now. We are a couple of weeks into a new administration. It looks to me  Like the original sources of the story  Were concerned that that nobody paid any attention and went back to bloomberg and said guys  We gotta we gotta get people to wake up they're not paying attention. Does that not seem credible?  I agree with you robert. They haven't provided  You know come up with one motherboard with that with that chip on it, you know

Start time: 7614.78
End time: 7648.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look this is absolutely credible. I have no problem believing that the chinese government or state-run organizations  Are using the the supply chain to spy  I have seen it in person from a chinese company from huawei, right?  So that that part is that's obvious. Yes, that's going to happen  Where I get frustrated is okay. I I hear you give me something point me in the right direction  So I can do some independent verification and to the point that it might be the nsa stepping in if there was a security letter  They wouldn't have even let them print the article

Start time: 7649.52
End time: 7659.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so well, that's mine that's what I think brian saying what i'm saying is  They don't want to go on record really  But they want to they want to send out send an alarm

Start time: 7660.00
End time: 7677.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's somebody out there whose hair is on fire and they're trying to scream about their hair being on fire  As loudly as they can without showing anybody the smoke  Because maybe they can't yeah, because they would they would be put in jail for  revealing national security things

Start time: 7678.44
End time: 7746.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my guess is that the reason why this was allowed to happen is because  These types of infiltration attacks are probably very low priority  If it's a nation state that's getting into your network  They at least know if they are going to  use that information for mass  like ill  That we would have a target to retaliate  so those are more of a they're using it for economic benefits rather than  Attacking a city or a county or a state or even the nation  It is the actors that are the lone wolves. It's the actors that are  That could just try to sow chaos  Because they know that the repercussions  Um will not affect them or they're not projecting the the harm to themselves that would cause  Because of that, so my guess is that it was an insider that that's trying to say we should prioritize this  Yes, and keeps leaking this information to the press so they get more resources internally. It's just to to reprioritize  these types of attack

Start time: 7747.42
End time: 7799.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As they should as they clearly should be I mean the solar winds attack is another supply chain attack  And we know about that and we know there was a severe consequence to that  At the end of the article bloomberg quotes frank fagluzzi who was the fbi assistant director for counterintelligence  until 2012  He's been you know a private citizen since then but he was willing to go on record with this quote super micros tale of woe  Is a chilling wake-up call for the industry  fagluzzi  Declined to address specifics but agreed to speak publicly about the implications  Of super micros history with chinese tampering if you think this story and this is really the bottom line  If you think this story has been about only one company you're missing the point  This is a don't let this happen to you moment for anyone in the tech sector supply chain  I don't think anybody would disagree with that

Start time: 7800.44
End time: 7841.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an underlying story here and that is  There's a sense of disillusion  Because we've got players including tech companies and and news agencies and the government the u.s  Government that are essentially saying you should be really worried about them spying on you  But don't be worried when we spy on you right facebook will sell all your information  But china they're going to do something really bad with it  And at this point the the average person the reason why this is not getting more more traction the reason why it's been forgotten  after the the posting last year is  People are so fatigued yeah, they get it their privacy is being invaded  They're not exactly sure who's invading it this week, but they just don't care anymore, right?

Transcript:  This article has many more names and many more quotes a lot of more people willing to go on the record  Which I think makes it a little bit more substantive they quote  um  A guy named darren mott who oversaw counterintelligence investigations in the fbi's huntsville office  He said a well-placed fbi con colleague described key details  About the added chips for him. This is back in october 2018 when the original story came out what I was told  This is a direct quote  On the record from darren mott what I was told was there was an additional little component on the super micro motherboards  That were not supposed to be there mott has since retired  He emphasized the information was shared in an unclassified setting the fbi knew the activity was being conducted by  China the ccp knew it was concerning and alerted certain entities about it  Mott said at the time he advised companies that had asked him about the chips to take the issue seriously, so  I always thought it was puzzling that bloomberg would go with his story  If it weren't true  I thought maybe they'd been played  The fact that the on friday they came out with an even more detailed  story tell to me says  They want people to to know this is legit and I think they're again the same takeaway  Uh this these things do happen. We know it from solar winds and others these things do happen
