Transcript:  That we for the longest time did not know where that sound effect came from.  And finally somebody said it's from a Dennis the Menace episode.  Mr. Wilson gets a shortwave radio and that's what he picks up.  Yep.  Which is kind of bizarre.  So before we get to the actual stories of the day, and there are some wacky stories today.  For instance, Intel spending seven point six eight billion dollars on McCaffey of all things.  I'm just going to say right now, I'm going to say it right up front.  We're just going to get out of the way.  I'm not going to whine about buzz on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, let me whine about buzz for a little bit.  My resolution didn't last long, did it?  What would you say if you were you?  You post on Twitter.  What would you say if you were posting on Twitter and thinking it was working fine?  But for six weeks, everything you were posting was visible only to you.  Nobody was a filter.  You think that's what happened?  Yeah, that's what it is.  Because I was complaining about Verizon Google.  Maybe they put me under the Bozo filter.  That could be.

Start time: 315.16
End time: 337.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it's called.  It's what it is.  That's what it does.  Because I was posting on buzz.  I was seeing it.  We used to use a Bozo filter PC mag dot coms forums.  So people think they're posting.  Yeah, you get a Bozo and you say this guy's describing us crazy.  And then you tell him, put him on the Bozo filter and they put him on.  And they put him on and his IP when he posted, he'd know when he would see it but him.  So you are Bozo out for some reason.

Start time: 337.47
End time: 365.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was? Yeah.  And the thing is, I should have noticed because normally there'll be some engagement when I post something.  There'll be comments, there'll be likes, whatever you often dozens.  There was nothing.  It was just dead silence.  And but I was traveling.  I was posting mobile.  So I wasn't really paying that much attention.  And Friday night, I'm looking at this and thinking nobody's there.  Nobody's seeing what I'm posting.  And not only that, I used I was.  Hey, I committed myself to buzz thoroughly.  This was Google Buzz.  Google Buzz.  I put all of my eggs in the buzz basket, so to speak.

Start time: 365.70
End time: 376.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was actually convinced me to put a you convinced me to put a profile on buzz based on I heard.  Yeah, I like Buzz.  Yeah, I like the idea.  I was in.

Start time: 377.28
End time: 383.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the idea because unlike Twitter, where you can't really have a conversation on Twitter, you can try.  But it's not it's not intended for that.

Start time: 384.16
End time: 386.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even with messaging, you can't.  Yeah, it's really hard.

Start time: 386.16
End time: 410.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but buzz is threaded.  You make a post, somebody can comment.  You can I mean, it worked.  So I put a lot of I really put my heart and soul into that thing.  And I in fact, this is the thing that really kills me.  When I start a show, as I just did now, I would put it on buzz.  I would say the show's starting.  You can discuss it here.  You can watch it here.  And that would automatically go to Twitter.  Sure.  So I was kind of counting on buzz to do all this without my knowledge.

Start time: 410.20
End time: 423.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you did something.  You you you did something to yourself.  You must have bozoed myself out.  There must have been a filter that caught something and then you boom, you got to end up end up on the bozo filter.  Well, in the next thing that happened, did you figure out what it was?  I wrote a book.

Start time: 424.20
End time: 522.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Well, here's what happened.  I wrote a blog post late last night.  I should never write blog posts after midnight.  Has nobody should nobody should.  Who do you ever write late late late blog post that you regret?  Oh, absolutely.  I think the thing that I regret most is at the end saying, screw you, buzz.  But I thought the title was quite clever.  Did you you found my lipstick?  Because I've been looking for that.  What the hell?  Who left their anybody anybody missing?  It's one of your.  We have females in the studio.  Yeah, I think it's a little weird.  Was leave. Oh, I think that's Sarah Lane's shade.  I mean, it's a little on my collar.  Interesting.  All right.  So your collar.  Let's get a little straight out of Mad Men.  Do you ever watch that show?  Yeah, I'm addicted to it.  Me too. Yeah.  It's the greatest show.  It's funny because Jason has a thing where they synopsize the plot of a show.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's a Mahalo thing.  And I read the synopsis of the plot and I realized the plot has absolutely nothing to do with the show.  The show you don't watch the show for the plot of Mad Men.  You watch the show for the silences.  They're like, what the hell was that?  Last night on Mad Men.  Don't tell me I'm just I'm not.  Well, it's not a spoiler.  But at the end of the show, it's the last scene of the show.  You watch it carefully.  There's a little old lady walking down the hall.  It's Don Draper's apartment building walking down the hall.  And the guy at the end said, did you get any pears?  And she doesn't answer.  He says, did you get any pears?  She doesn't answer.  Did you get any pears?  And she says, we'll talk about it inside.  And they go in and that's it.  That's it.  That's the scene.  That's why I love that show.  My daughter likes the show.

Transcript:  So, Leo, I got a question for you.  I read your blog post.

Start time: 582.16
End time: 603.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I lost an op size very quickly, which is I've been posting for three weeks and okay, buzz  is broken, but that's not the real point.  The point is no one noticed that it wasn't getting published.  I didn't even notice.  So clearly this is not my failure or Buzz's failure.  This means social media is mindless drivel.  Nobody's listening.  It's an echo chamber.

Start time: 603.92
End time: 604.37
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But here's my question.

Start time: 605.32
End time: 624.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the first time I'm hearing this from the horse's mouth, as it were.  I read a couple of stories about this on other sites and the gist of those stories is that  you're down on social media in general.  I can understand the buzz complaint, but are you extrapolating to social media as a whole?

Start time: 624.28
End time: 626.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, don't you think?  Now, let's be honest.

Start time: 626.16
End time: 629.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the chat room has it right.  What do they say?  I've been right about this all along.

Start time: 630.76
End time: 714.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, John was right and I hate to admit it.  And you know what I really hate?  Okay.  So I think there's a continuum on the internet between the traditional old way of doing  it, which is a blog post, which is what I wrote, where it's your site.  People come to your site, participate with you on your site.  And then there's the other side of the continuum, which is Twitter, which it's their site.  You're posting on their site.  It's a public square where everybody's posting at once.  And it's cloud.  And so, yeah, it's cloud.  Well, it's all kind of cloud, but at least I can back up my cloud.  So there's the continuum.  And it strikes me that neither side is exactly right.  You don't want to just post in your own little corner of the world, but nor do you want to  just kind of put everything that you do out on somebody else's site where you don't control  it.  And it basically turns into ephemera because once it scrolls off Twitter, it's dead.  It's gone.  So I'm wondering if there's something in the middle.  And then I'm thinking, I'm thinking, oh my God, I hate to admit this.  There is something in the middle.  It's called Facebook.  God, I can't tell you how much it galls me to admit it.  But Facebook is you've got your own Facebook page, right, which is your thing.  When you say you like something, you have a circle of larger, ever-winding circles of  friends all the way out from everyone to intimates.  You choose who gets to see it.  People can interact with you on your page, but when they do it, it shows up on their  page.  So it's kind of like the public commons.  So anyway, Julio, go ahead.  What is your reaction to this?

Start time: 715.78
End time: 717.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm trying to understand your point.

Start time: 719.54
End time: 720.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not alone.

Start time: 723.10
End time: 729.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I look at this in a slightly different way.  I just heard you say that if you post something on Twitter, it's ephemera, it vanishes.

Start time: 729.96
End time: 732.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you wrote a book on Twitter.  So you defend Twitter.

Start time: 733.32
End time: 769.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I'm going to defend Twitter here.  I don't look at Twitter as a location.  I have a home page.  I'm setting up a home page at ojezap.com.  I have a Facebook page.  I hate Facebook, but I have a page.  My high school class is planning its next reunion.  They have a page for that on Facebook.  I get all that.  Twitter, and by extension, Buzz, I think, is different.  It's not about the place online.  You're not sticking a stake in the ground.  This is my place on Twitter.  That's not really the point.  The point is the relationships that you forge, the friendships that you make.

Start time: 770.30
End time: 780.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I hear people say that, but do you really forge friendships?  Do you really have conversations on Twitter?  Let's put aside Buzz where there actually are threaded conversations.  You can't really have a conversation on Twitter, can you?

Start time: 780.66
End time: 852.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, Twitter has been one of the single most rewarding elements of my life  in recent years.  I can't overstate the fact.  Forget that I wrote a book about it.  That's not really the point.  My personal experience with Twitter has been hugely rewarding.  I've made profound professional connections, very good friendships.  I constantly find people on Twitter that happen to live nearby that I make a lunch date with  them, forge these incredible friendships.  It's all about the relationship.  If you go to a party, you meet people, you make friends with them, the venue is not important.  The party can be anywhere.  The venue, the location is not the point.  The point is the connections you're making with people.  And those connections that I've made with people have been amazing.  I sound like a big Twitter cheerleader, but as somebody who's married, who has a child,  who's got responsibilities at home, I don't have time to go out into the physical world  and physically make friends.  I just don't have the bandwidth or time or the ability to do that.  Twitter has been an incredible substitute for me.  And it's been one of the single, I can't overstate it, it's been one of the single most rewarding  things in my life as of late.

Transcript:  I met up with a bunch of guys in Portugal using Twitter as a tweet up with a bunch of  locals.  I think there's some valuable uses for it.  We went out shooting photographs with some professionals and we had a good time.  I would have never seen these spots in Lisbon if I hadn't been taken around.

Start time: 869.60
End time: 884.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think absolutely.  There's some value to it.  I'm not saying it's valueless.  I just want to, I have to rethink what its value is because it isn't really a place to  put and create content.  Is it or is it, Julio?  Absolutely not.

Transcript:  Maybe I thought it was.  I thought it was a micro blog, a little blog.

Start time: 890.79
End time: 939.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no way.  Well, let me back up.  As a journalist, as a writer, I take enormous pride in crafting a perfect tweet, a haiku-like  poetry of writing a tweet.  In fact, if I've been known, you know, when I tweet something and I notice a grammatical  error, I get frantic.  I erase the damn thing and rewrite it.  And you know, people get mad at me because they see me tweet twice, but I'm just a perfectionist  when it comes to writing tweets as I am writing anything.  But it's not a micro blog.  content in the traditional sense.  That's what your blog is for.  That is what Facebook is to a certain extent.  Twitter isn't that at all.  In fact, I'm not all that bent out of shape about, you know, my Twitter's disappearing,  although I hear that Twitter eventually will allow you to sort of go back and get all your  tweets and archived and somehow.

Start time: 939.66
End time: 940.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now it's only 3,500 posts back.

Start time: 941.86
End time: 955.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  But I'm not, I just, I throw tweets out there.  It's like having a conversation with somebody to party.  You're not worried about keeping a record of everything you told that person.  That's not really, not really the point.  It's sort of the end result.

Start time: 957.40
End time: 969.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  That's resolved.  So let's move on.  So let's find this news article.  What's this about Apple's unknown hardware?  What are you, where are you looking?  Look, somebody just sent this on the, in the chat room.  Apple's unknown.

Transcript:  What could Apple's unknown hardware be?  A new beta of Apple's iOS mobile software reportedly boasts references to a fourth  generation iPod touch.

Start time: 978.46
End time: 1006.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So people watch their server logs and anytime Apple's got a new product or is testing a  new operating system, they see on the server logs unusual identification strings, unusual  browser agents, things like that.  And if, and an, and a unnamed product has started to surface on, on logs in the last  couple of weeks.  Now we, we're pretty sure Apple's got an event.  I think it's an official September 8th, but that they always do that because they  announced new iPods.  I'll tell you what it is.  I know exactly what it is.

Start time: 1006.56
End time: 1018.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was assuming that the iPod touch a new version with a nice screen was, is coming  up, but is it going to be what I still think they're going to have to do eventually?  Which is an Apple TV.  It's what it's going to be.  You hit the nail.  A real, see I like a screen.

Transcript:  You think it's a screen?  No.  I'll tell you exactly what it is.  And I think the rumors have talked about this.  They've called it ITV, even though that is not a name Apple has a use of.  I don't think they can.  Yeah.  That's a, there's a, there's a Rupert Murdoch or something.  There's a bunch of ITVs.  They can't use, but anyway, whatever they call it.  Uh, it is a slim line box with no storage.  It will run iOS for the new iPhone operating system.  And that's critical.  And it will, in my opinion, but Kevin Rose has a great post effect.  I tried to get Kevin on the show, but he hasn't responded.  You know, he's got him in a rock.  He's busy.  He's busy digging.  Uh, but Kevin says Apple's ITV will change everything.  And I, I agree with him.  I think you're going to see this fall.  We're going to see two big important announcements, Google TV and Apple TV.  Okay.  We'll tell him why, why is this going to change anything?  Okay.  I'll tell you why.  Apps.  One word apps.  So don't I need a screen?  You can hook it up to a screen, but you don't need, but why should I look?  I don't want to buy my TV from Apple.  I got a TV roll around.  Yeah.  Oh, remember what Apple released a couple of weeks ago?  The magic track pad.  What is that?  A Bluetooth wireless track pad big enough to make a keyboard.  If it's on the screen, big enough to pinch zoom, rotate it's wireless.  So it hooks up to the ITV, which is sitting next to your big screen.

Transcript:  It's going to TV with the iPhone interface and apps.  And this is why Google TV is important.  And why I, in my opinion, why ITV is important, because if you want to add Hulu to your TV, you just pay, buy the app.  You want to add HBO, HBO makes an app.  You want to add HBO to your TV.  You just buy the app.  HBO bypasses the cable company sells direct to you for a monthly subscription.  You can add functionality as simply as downloading an app on your iPhone.  This is why Google TV is going to be important to Julio.  You agree?

Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, I'll tell you what I did.  I got the magic track pad and I spent about a couple of days, you know, trying to use it as a computer peripheral.  Absolutely didn't like it.  Uh, you know, the mouse is the right device for that.  But, uh, I have a 16, I happen to have a 60 inch plasma TV in my office.  Um, and I've been playing with a variety of pointing, uh, devices.  Uh, you know, Lenovo has some nice hardware in that category, but I took the magic track pad, uh, and started using it, uh, as a, as a living room device.  I sort of have a simulated living room in my office with an easy chair and so forth.  And I use that as a, as a television input device.  Uh, it's absolutely fantastic for that.  It's that that is the use for that track pad.  I'm, I'm, I'm surmising that that's exactly what Apple is thinking.

You can sort of pick and choose sort of pull in, you know, different elements,  different services, different kind of content.  Well, yeah, it's, it's, but it's a, what you're, it's exactly what you're talking  about.  You're going to be able to sort of customize the experience with pulling in  different things.

And I think it might, uh, set the TV world on its keister because, well, John,  you, you and I, uh, know a little bit about the cable television model.

Transcript:  Well, you know, there's always been the thing that's always fascinated me about  some of these business models that start one way where, you know, cable business  began to CCTV, which was, they were like begging and then they, then all of a  sudden they, they got so much leverage that they could say, Hey, by the way, do  you want to be on our cable?  Right.  First, I were doing them a favor by spreading their single begging them.  Yeah.  Begging them.  Can we do it?  And then they say, well, you know, we got like half your audience.  You don't even know.  You have you ever seen an antenna anymore, buddy?  And then they say, well, maybe you should give us money to put you on.  So they did the switcheroo.  The these companies would love to do the switcheroo back.  You know, in other words, you know, screw you, screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  why should a company like HBO, why should even better, why should a company.  Like Warner Brothers even have to deal with HBO.  Why shouldn't there be a Warner Brothers app that you pay Warner Brothers directly?  And the reason this platform is so successful is because you can add apps.  So Warner Brothers can create an iPhone 4 app.  There's the, the store model is already set up or I think it would work with Google TV as well.  The store model is already set up.  You say, ah, you know, Hey honey, let's, wouldn't you want to get some movies tonight  from Warner Brothers?  Let's see what the Warner Brothers you pay 10 bucks a month, 20 bucks a month,  whatever it is you get Netflix.  Netflix model is a Netflix model and you go direct.  In fact, it puts it, it actually jeopardizes Netflix.  It jeopardizes blockbuster.

Start time: 1353.30
End time: 1390.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It puts a lot of people in jeopardy.  Now the thing that's interesting about this idea is that I don't think it's, they take it,  they, they won't have the guts to take it to the extreme, to the extreme, which is what you can,  if you go to C band, those old fashioned, big giant dishes, they have 4d TV now, which is HD  coming across, which is really 4d.  No, it's the thing is, I think it's called 4d TV, which refers to  classic HD.  Oh, and you get it.  You get a really good HD signal.  Oh, it's not, it's less compressed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what's, what's cool about it is you can find a bunch of programs out there where you  can go to somebody's website and subscribe to HBO for one movie.

Transcript:  Now here's the problem.  How do we get this data?  We get this data through Comcast, through Verizon, through companies that really don't  want to be bit pumps.  They want to sell TV shows.  They want to sell cable.  They want to sell movies.  How?  So what happens?  How do they push back?  Is this why that you're seeing this Google Verizon deal?

Start time: 1436.46
End time: 1452.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to have to buy some of these other operations.  I think that's why Comcast wants to own a network.  They're going to say, look, we're going to have to get out of this bit.  We're going to be the, we'll be the pipe, but we, you know, we still like the content  business, so let's just buy some content companies and just give up on the idea of  just, you know, stealing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not necessarily.  I, you know, I, there's been some talk, some, some recent news about Verizon sort of  getting into app development.  So I'm sorry, I'm referring to Comcast.  So I can, I can very well see Comcast developing an app that will give people the same  content that Comcast now provides on its, it has a web based service where you can access  a great deal of the content that's also available on your television set.  So they have, they already have, they're halfway there.  All they have to do is provide the app that sort of replicates that laptop web experience.  So I, I fully, you know, fully expect Comcast to play along with us.

Transcript:  Well, they've got to figure out a new business model.  I think it's interesting if they become content creators.  Ultimately, this is good for content creators, right?  The, the, it's what you, what you buy is you buy a pipe, then you buy an ITV or a  Google TV that lets you access that pipe, search for content, buy it directly from the  content creator.  And if the content creator is really sharp, this is why Hulu is going to have a big IPO.  They're going to go public any day now, right?  Yeah.  They're going to have a huge IPO because this is, this is the play that I have Hulu plus  right now on my iPad.  It's ridiculous.  It's 10 bucks a month to watch TV shows.  It doesn't make a lot of sense on an iPad, but it does make a huge amount of sense.  Uh, when you're thinking this is maybe on an ITV.

But then he, he, he got on the Netflix app and worked his way through all, you  know, the recent era, uh, Dr.  Who episodes.  He got obsessed.

JC Wayne said, well, if that's the case, why does Hulu keep fighting all the  people like Boxee Box who are trying to put it on their device?  I'll tell you why.  Cause they want to put it.  They want to charge you for the app and they want to charge you rental.  They want to control it.  They don't, they don't want just a connection to the website.  They want to control it.

Should I want the sediment to 52 degrees centigrade?  No.  52 degrees Fahrenheit.  I often confuse those.

And, you know, I will, I will, you know what?  I will, you know, when I was, when we were in Dearborn at the Ford test track,  they were showing me the auto park feature of the flex and they had set it up so  that there were cars all around the story.

Cause of course the car will continue on in idle, but I wasn't paying  attention. So boom, I hit the Fiesta.  This is a big heavy flex.  It's the Fiesta, not a, not a scratch.  That's more miles per gallon highway than the Toyota Yaris.  And it could save you up to $182 a year in gas over the Honda Civic.  Now you know about engines, John.  So you know what this means.  It's a Duratec engine, 1.6 liter Duratec I4 engine.  That's good.  Huh?  I don't know what that is.

Google Verizon deal needs, needs yet another gaping loophole.  What's that?  I don't know.  It's just somebody wanted in the chat room sent this thing.  Well, click on the link and tell us, cause I think that's a picture.  Many people are worried that if the Google Verizon net neutrality  proposal has too many exceptions.  The recording industry is worried that it doesn't have enough.  In a letter sent today to Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, the RIAA and other music  trade groups express their concern that the riddled with gaping loopholes  policy framework nevertheless might put a damper on ISP attempts to find and  filter practical material flowing through the internet's tubes.

Start time: 1929.76
End time: 1979.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I know what they're talking about because it's very clearly says that  there's net neutrality for legal content, which is a huge loophole for Comcast.  Because they say, well, you know, bit torrents often illegal content.  They boom, they kill it.  So it's, it's net neutrality only if the content's legal and it's really  not defined what that means.  That's what that's, that's the loophole they're talking about.  I got another one for you.  You're going to like this.  No, you're going to like this.  A long running dispute between radio broadcasters and the recording  industry over the music royalties has taken an unexpected term.  Here's the proposed settlement that every new cell phone, they want a  federal mandate, this is the recording industry association of America.  They want a federal mandate that every new cell phone come with a built in FM chip.

Start time: 1979.85
End time: 1985.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 2003.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I could tell you, I didn't bring it up on the radio show because I am  on a lot of FM stations, but come on, come on mandating requiring that every  mobile device that is made from now on in the U S have a radio in it.  That's like saying every Ford Soul should come with a buggy whip.  What do you think, Julia?

Start time: 2005.22
End time: 2035.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, for a long time, uh, I was really, really mad at Apple because  they wouldn't put FM radios in their, in their iPods.  I was, I was like curious about that because I love Minnesota public radio.  I'm an addict, but the world, the world is changing.  Um, now, uh, like for instance, an iPod touch or an iPhone, I can drop it into  a speaker dock in my kitchen and I have all these audio apps, I have the Minnesota  public radio app and PR app, uh, to it app, you know, every, oh, anything I want  to listen to is available in app form.

Start time: 2036.08

But, uh, you know, here's the other, the punchline is, uh, I noticed, I just, I  suddenly dawned on me the other day, the speaker dock that I was using in the  kitchen has an FM radio, which I could have, you know, very well tuned to  Minnesota public radio, but I was listening to Minnesota public radio in  app form, I had, you know, sort of train myself to sort of leave the whole radio  thing behind and sort of go into the app future.  And so I'm, I'm, I'm a complete convert in this regard.  And so this FM radio requirement proposal just strikes me as ludicrous.  Oh yeah.

They start taking over the words.  And that isn't what I want.  By the way, Nightflyer has found on eBay and a Kai X 1810 reel to reel  recorder with eight track player.  That's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're asking you for the, the, the, the, it's all on you now.  And while I talk about our friends at carbonite and carbonite pro, which is  an example of a company listening to its consumers, its users and saying, Hey,  Hey, there's something we could do here.  It's carbonite is I've talked about it before.  It's that online backup was automatic.  You put it on your Mac or your PC.  It automatically backs up to the cloud using AES 256 bit encryption, 128  bits SSL it's always there.  You can get to your backup from any machine, any machine, anywhere  you log onto your carbonite account.  They even have an Apple iPhone and a Blackberry app for free.  So, you know, you know, you got a backup, you can look at it on your iPhone.  You can access it.  So everybody loves carbonite, the consumer version.  Carbonite started talking to its customers and they taught, and they  found out that literally hundreds of thousands of their carbonite consumer  customers were businesses were small businesses saying there's nothing  equivalent in business.  This is such a good solution.  Were you, we're, we're going to kind of misuse it in business.  So they said, well, we could do better than that.  And they came up with carbonite pro and I got to tell you, this is a great solution.  Go ahead.  And I invite you to try to look for other comparable solutions.  You won't find anything as good as this.  I know I've looked.  I was sitting with Ken last week and we were saying, well, what, well,  what are some, no, no, that's too expensive.  No, that won't do it.  No carbonite is amazing.  Here's the deal.  Go right now to carbonite pro.com.  You just sign up for free for 30 days.  You really get a sense of what it can do.  Now the way carbonite pro works is there's a centralized dashboard.  He's windows only right now.  I should say for this, which is probably fine for small business at this point.  A Mac version is on the way.  I promise you, but right now for your windows machine.  So you get a copy for every machine in your office, however many machines you've got.  You have a centralized dashboard so you can see which machines are backed up, which aren't.  Here's a nice thing.  Your users, your employees can restore any time they want.  So you don't have, they don't have to make that, you know, that perp walk down to the IT department.  I erased my spreadsheet.  Can you get it back for me?  They can do it themselves.  And as I said, they can do it from any computer.  They log on.  Now here's the beauty.  You don't pay a per seat license.  You just pay for the storage you use.  There's no setup fee, no hardware to buy, no training.  You just install carbonite and you're done.  It just starts backing up.  Very affordable too.  I'll give you some examples.  20 gigabytes to 50 gigabytes is $25 a month.  That means if you had 10 users, five gigabytes each, 25 bucks a month.  That's all.  The prices are great.  The software is great.  It works so well.  I highly recommend you try it and you could try it free for a month.  Just go to carbonitepro.com.  You don't have to use any offer code.  They'll know.  They'll know.  Twitch sent you.  Your data is secure.  It's encrypted.  It's private.  And it's always, always safe.  Just imagine what it would cost if you lost all your data.  Would you, would you still be in business tomorrow?  If you didn't, I know we wouldn't.  carbonitepro.com.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  John C.  Dvorak is here.

Transcript:  I can't believe it.  It turns out it wasn't Callie.  It was Neil, her husband, but Callie was very loyal and never said this.  She could have thrown Neil to the wolves, just like Apple could throw ATT to the  wolves, but they didn't, she didn't.  Neil posted, I can't believe anybody believes this hoax of global warming.  And I said, well, I don't, I don't, you know, you could dispute whether it's  manmade or not, but I don't think it's a hoax.  And I think that you could.  So, so I posted this on our blog.  I was just a comment on her blog.  And you know who stirred the pot?  Your friend and mine, Adam Curry, who started playing clips of me from the show  started, he really wanted to get it revved up and I just ignored it and it went away.  You apparently didn't.

So here's the deal.  You get that mifi card.  We all love the mifi card.  Normally 60 bucks a month from Verizon, 60 bucks a month from Sprint, 40 bucks from Virgin  mobile.  And if it's the same as the other Virgin mobile stuff, I think it's no contract.  It's month to month.  Is it month to month chat room?

I can really, really fly on the thing.  It has a refined appearance.  They did away with the little trackpad, the little dial thing that they had on the right  of the old keyboard.  It's not a quantum leap over the Droid One, but it's an incremental improvement that actually  makes the thing fully usable.  Well, it comes with the physical keyboard and the onscreen keyboard where with the original  Droid, I never use the physical keyboard.  Right.

Transcript:  Android phones are starting to filter into the prepaid space.  You mentioned Virgin a little while ago.  Boost Mobile and I think one or two other of the prepaid carriers are starting to carry Android phones and BlackBerry's as well.  That's interesting.  And it's very interesting.  They're not really great Android phones.  They use an old version of the operating system.  They're a little clunky to use.  But prepaid used to be associated with really crappy phones.  That's starting to really not be the case.  Yeah.

Transcript:  So the Span Air Flight 5022 crashed moments after taking off from  Madrid Barajas International Airport in 2008.  154 souls lost.  New documents from an investigation into the incident are showing.  This is according to MSNBC, that a malware infection may have been to blame.  No wonder now I understand why Intel paid $7.68 billion from McAfee.  According to the investigation, the computer system used to monitor  technical problems on the plane was infected with a Trojan.  As a result, you shouldn't use Windows.  Right there.  There's the problem.  That is the problem there.  As a result, there were no alerts or warnings for three technical issues,  which had they been detected, may have prevented the plane from taking off.  The investigation is still not complete and authorities are trying to  determine just how the malware got into the computer system in question.  Wow, that is quite a story.  Yeah, it's a weird story.

Start time: 3258.48
End time: 3266.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a ground computer, by the way, not a plane-based computer.  Now let's go back and discuss the issue with why Intel bought McAfee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I've been saying for $7-plus billion or almost $8 billion,  you know, when you get to the Bs, $7.68 billion, that's $680 million.  So let's not, let's not, this is cash.  This isn't even stock.  $7,680,000,000 for a washed up antivirus company?

Start time: 3292.42
End time: 3303.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I'm asking you.  What do you think?  I think, I think.  But why did they do it?  They're goofballs.  But why are they goofballs?  Isn't that the right answer?  That's the reason that Intel does everything.

Start time: 3336.53
End time: 3365.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's entirely possible.  But my reaction to this story was essentially, you know, good riddance.  I can't recall the last time I installed a Norton or a McAfee security suite on my computer.  Windows Security Essentials, which is absolutely free, is, you know, more than sufficient.  And so this, this is a big number and it has some interesting implications.  But it's just, it's irrelevant to me.  I don't really care about McAfee or Norton anymore.

Start time: 3365.38
End time: 3376.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's bizarre that they would buy.  Go ahead and get that while I give you this word from Answers.com.  McAfee is pronounced McAfee.

Start time: 3386.48
End time: 3448.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's always been McAfee.  McAfee's claim to fame, and I think he's a marketing genius for this,  was to create a newsletter and a subsystem to promote the idea that you're going to be attacked by viruses.  This is before they became popular.  And this was after Peter Norton said, there's no such thing as a computer virus, if you recall that.  And they're just unimportant.  And McAfee started doing this newsletter.  It was called, it was some security newsletter.  And nobody was selling antivirus software at the time.  So he rolled out the stuff with all these crazy viruses that these kids were mostly developing for old DOS machines.  And the next thing you know, there was a couple of outbreaks, some crazy things happened where people's hard disks were erased  because in those days, the deal was you erased a hard disk.  And the next thing you know, he comes-  That's right. That was our day.  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, he's got an antivirus software company and he's a billionaire.  I mean, I just thought this was the way to do it.  He created the market for viruses, promoted it, and then sold the antidote.

Start time: 3448.94
End time: 3469.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was a programmer at NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City, went to UNIVAC as a software designer,  later Xerox as an operating system architect.  He joined in 78 Computer Sciences Corporation.  This is from his bio on Wikipedia, which we know is authoritative.  Absolutely true.  As a software consultant, later while employed by Lockheed in the 1980s.  See, John, we could have done this.

Start time: 3469.93

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He received a copy of the Pakistani Brain Computer Virus, very early virus,  and wrote the first antivirus software.  He used the Shareware business model, was one of the first to do so in 1989.  In 89, as recently as 1989, he quit Lockheed and began working full-time at his company, McAfee Associates,  which he operated from his home in Santa Clara, California.  So there you go.  Now, when Intel bought it last week, it was doing $2 billion a year in revenue.

Start time: 3500.61
End time: 3518.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it means it's worth $2 billion, actually, maybe $4.  What is the multiple? One year, two years?  One. But for a growth company, it could be up to $10.  But for a business like that, it had to be $1.  You've got to figure antivirus is not on the up-scope.  Two years max.  I have no idea why they paid so much.  It's bizarre.

Start time: 3519.86
End time: 3535.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  McAfee's, in August 2009, the New York Times reported that McAfee's personal fortune had declined.  He was worth $100 million, but the effect of the global financial crisis and recession, he's only worth $4 million now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Transcript:  That's sad.  It happens.  Peter Norton's got a whole museum.  Yeah. Peter became a...  He's an author, a philanthropist.  He did a real good deal, and he's always been an art collector.  Yeah, an art guy.  And so he started his collecting before he even sold his company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why they paid so much.  That's why I think there's something behind this.  They have a patent.  There's some screwball thing.  There's something in the background lurking, and Intel now owns it, and they're going to leverage it.  That's the only thing I can think of.

Start time: 3579.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do also think that the operating system is no longer the vector for viruses.  I think that both Apple and Microsoft have pretty much figured out how to lock down the OS.  Yeah, we're still seeing exploits, but virus authors are moving on to either third-party software like Flash, Adobe Reader, or I think the future, young man, go mobile, young man.  The future for malware is going to be on these little devices.  Yeah, I'm waiting.  I can't believe we haven't seen a big malware attack.  That's going to happen soon.  You agree, Julio?

Transcript:  But Leo, here's a question for you.  You're a big Android proponent.  You love the openness.  It's a wide-open platform.  Apple has its platform locked down.  It takes very great care in what it allows into its ecosystem.  My question to you is, doesn't that make Android more vulnerable?

Start time: 3655.99
End time: 3703.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was such a softball.  I want to thank you, Julio Ojeda-Zapata, for making my life easy.  Just throw me a softball.  See, Apple distributes the illusion of security because you cannot look at hundreds of thousands of apps and say with any certainty that those apps are safe.  Notice, Apple gives you no guarantee.  And in fact, we know very well that apps sneak through the Apple vetting process and do things that Apple didn't intend, whether it's an Easter egg or that app that was unlocking people's iTunes accounts and sending their passwords out to the developer.  These things do happen.  So, yeah, Apple vets apps.  But I don't think that that necessarily makes you any safer.  I think it's purely the illusion of safety.  I mean, truly, do you think Apple can find every bit of malware in every program it looks at?

Start time: 3703.84

Transcript:  It's the Camera Plus situation.  Is that an example?  Perfect example.  Yeah.

Start time: 3709.30
End time: 3732.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a flashlight program that had tethering, would enable tethering if you knew the Easter egg.  That stuff sneaks by all the time.  I mean, you cannot, unless you're looking at the source code, and even then it takes real expertise, you cannot truthfully certify that an app does everything that it says it does and nothing that it doesn't say.  You can't.  So I don't think that that gives you any security.  It's just a matter of time before somebody writes it nasty.

Elliot Schrage, the director of communications at Facebook, saw the movie and said, we don't like it.  I'm sure they don't.  Well, they're women now, though.  Normally Hollywood, won't they make a deal with the public figure that they're going to cover?  I mean, I guess, you know, Richard Nixon, based on a book.  Yeah.

They made a very powerful face recognition engine,  which nobody could use or wanted or bought.  So then they made it a shopping engine where you'd take a picture of a vase  and then you'd find a similar vase.  It was really good software.  Google ended up doing the same thing.  They bought a technology from another company in Picasso.  For some reason, they've now also bought the RIA spinoff called Like.  What's covet.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, in fact, Google said when Goggles came out,  people said, well, can you do face recognition with it?  They said, yes, you can, but we've turned it off.  Why?  Because they don't want people walking down the street  taking pictures of hot chicks and finding their address.  Oh, I never thought of that idea.  Oh, he says.  So the idea of Goggles is...  Let's turn it back on.  Well, you know, this is my point.  The government already knows how to do that.  So why shouldn't I be able to do it with my phone?  Books and DVDs, landmarks, logos, contact info, artwork, businesses,  products, barcodes or text, you take a picture of something.  And like if I were in front of the Eiffel Tower,  I could take a picture of the...  What the heck is that?  What is that?  And then I would know what it is.  Now, it won't work, it says, with animals, furniture or apparel.  That's why they bought like.com,  because like.com does work with furniture and apparel.  Oh.  And you can also use Goggles to translate text from a foreign language.  That's new.  Wow, that's amazing.  So I could take a picture of...  Let's enable search history,  because I think Google needs to know more about me.  And we're going to get started.  So what should I do?  I need to find a picture of some foreign language text.  Where would I find that?

Well, it isn't niche yet, but I think we're not far off.  Now, here's where the turning point is going to happen.  When developers, it hasn't happened yet, but developers start saying,  iPhone or Android, I think we better develop for Android.  That's where all the people are.  When that happens, it's all over.

Transcript:  So here's Facebook Places.  You have to have an iPhone to use Facebook Places.  If you do and you've got the latest version of the Facebook app,  you'll see this new icon.  It's slowly being rolled out for everybody, but here's what you'll get.  You click it.  Your friend's check-ins will be there.  Your check-in, you just press check-in.  You say where you are.  It's very much like Foursquare.  Here's one thing that is a little different and I think is a little creepy.  I can check in, but I can also say, Oh, and I'm not alone.  This guy is with me also.  And I can add him to the check-in.  So in other words, I can check in...  Your buddy.  My buddy.

Transcript:  There was an interesting article about that in, I think it was in New York Times.  I can't remember which newspaper, but somebody wrote an essay,  an opinion piece about how she was at a restaurant.  She checked in and then she went ahead before her dining companions arrived.  She went ahead and checked in all of them.  And then when they arrived, they say, she told them, you know, Hey, I checked you in.  And she didn't expect any objection because all her friends are big Foursquare users and so on and so forth.  Her friends unanimously were pissed at her.  How could you possibly do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, I think you get a warning.  I think I just checked in, for instance, Adrian Lammo into the Twig cottage.  He's not here, but I just checked him in.  I think Adrian would then get a warning on his Facebook saying, Leo checked you in.  Is that right?  But I'm not sure.  And this is the problem with Facebook.  It's kind of Byzantine, all the different settings and so forth.  I thought it looked to me like it was an opt-in thing in general,  that if you didn't opt into places, you wouldn't be using it.  But I've been told by a number of people that no, they were in fact already opted in.  They had to opt out.  So again, once again, Facebook is kind of toying with these privacy settings.  I'm not sure.  Well, they keep it to the only friends setting.  So I could change the settings to make it be broader.  All right.

Transcript:  But you said, you know, is Facebook going to crush Foursquare?  If I were to say Foursquare, I would make an analogy.  The iPad was supposed to crush the Kindle.  I think that's an apt analogy.

I and a fellow classmate who also happens to be called Julio, the two geeks, the two Julio geeks of the class, we built a website for the reunion.  It's very interesting.  Four years later, that whole thing is pointless because all the planning, all the interactions are being done on Facebook, on a Facebook page.
