Transcript:  So Elon on Saturday  Said to address extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation  He apparently was worried as as as his reddit and many others that AI was scraping Twitter data and using it for their  Large language models. We've applied the following temporary limits verified accounts  He shouldn't call him verified accounts people who pay me eight dollars are limited to reading  6,000 posts a day  unverified accounts everybody else  600 posts a day new unverified accounts  300 posts a day and if you're not logged in zero  Almost as soon as he posted this and this is 10 a.m. On Saturday Twitter went down pretty much  Users started seeing rate limit exceeded messages. Every topic was about the topic was about the collapse of Twitter and  That Twitter hashtag Twitter down  Thanks, Elon. Here's the trending topics. Thanks, Elon  WTF Twitter  blue sky  damn Twitter and  Bankruptcy, those are the top six trending in the United States at that time  But what's wild and this came on mastodon of course because you couldn't post on Twitter  But a web developer named Sheldon Chang  Noticed that as he was trying to load Twitter  The scroll bar was jiggling  What does that mean father of when the scroll bar is jiggling like oh it basically means that your your browser is trying to refresh

Transcript:  It appears that Twitter is D dosing itself  That's kind of D does best kind Twitter home feeds been down for most this morning  even though nothing loads the Twitter website never stops trying and  trying  The reason is Twitter's firing off he says and I think he's accurate  I don't think anybody said that's not true ten requests a second to itself  to  Try and fetch content that never arrives  Because they've blocked people from Twitter without logging in so I guess this was only if you hadn't logged into Twitter  This likely created he continues on some hellish conditions  The engineers never envisioned and so we get this comedy of errors resulting in the most epic of self-explanatory  Epic of self owns the self  D dos and then he posts the developer page from his browser and you can see these are requests each of these 20-byte requests  Saying give me the data. Give me the data. Give me the data. Please give me the data  Please give me now if you have a lot of people doing this Sheldon said, of course  I'm a nice person. So I logged out except wait a minute Saturday and evil Sheldon's in charge  So I just stayed there for a little while just watching it

Transcript:  But yeah, somebody pointed out that the contract with Google Cloud expired June 30th  Yeah, that's right  Elon had famously stopped paying Google Cloud except that I saw a story this week that said they made some sort of deal  Google's gonna buy some get some I think free ads and so that's and then they had moved off of AWS, right and so I

Start time: 459.26
End time: 494.86
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  Don't know. I don't part of this was made worse by the fact that they made some changes  Since Elon took over to move more of the services onto Twitter servers  Because Elon didn't want to pay any third parties for services that would normally be provided by third parties  Right  The issue with that is that when you have an integrated page like the Twitter page  Which is calling for 40 different elements at the same time if you now serve out all 40 of those elements every time a page loads  You are D dosing yourself. Yeah, right. And I mean there's unfortunately you could fix that but there's only two coders left at Twitter  So it's gonna take some time. Well, this is it, you know

Start time: 496.32
End time: 513.66
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  We've had this rash of tech layoffs in Silicon Valley of late, yeah  They're just kind of like well Elon's almost a quarter of a million laid off for the moment  It's but you know, it's not exactly. Yeah, I just although Silicon Valley

Start time: 513.90
End time: 527.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know if this is has anything to do with layoffs, but the stock market's been loving Silicon Valley this week  So maybe they said oh, it's good  Your cut your costs and now we want to invest and that's part of the problem because we bow to the

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Its stock jumped as well. Yeah before before we move on I was going to say a thing about the the Twitter  Outage, you know, I was so frustrated with so much of the news coverage about this  I don't know if we have the New York Times article on this your hand  This is like I know Ryan Mack is an excellent reporter. He does really good work. But if you read  It's not this one. It's the other one. It's a  announcing  Twitter's down a worldwide outage. It's it's a if you get on my Twitter you can find it

Start time: 575.42
End time: 584.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, there's quite a few stories in the New York Times about Twitter falling apart  Sure, this is the hard to find the one you're talking about. This is the one from yesterday

Start time: 584.44
End time: 627.94
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Okay on the first if I can get on Twitter  I'll get it and the problem with this is they're talking about it  And if you look at the first I think it's the first five paragraphs. They repeatedly go and  Only cite Elon Musk giving his pretext for why this is but scraping right?  That is not a credible thing  I'm sorry if like at this point anyone that works in the tech industry and reports on the tech industry  Can see a pattern with Elon Musk going back to X dot-com where he will  Talk about a problem that the company is having he will kind of mislead the public about what the actual problem is and a kind  Of like obfuscate what is going on here? So this piece like go through and look at it

Start time: 628.84
End time: 636.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is the main source this has been a problem with the New York Times in every area  100% the last yeah few years

Start time: 636.06
End time: 663.36
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  But this is so like and the Wall Street Journal and mainstream media journal does better than this  Do they but you know in my estimation you read this piece you've got your Roth who is a very credible insider  former former Twitter trust and safety who gave a very  Credible statement about why this was on blue sky these reporters could have gone over there and looked at this  But they're using Musk and just presenting his face of this whole thing to the public

Start time: 664.04
End time: 669.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unchallenged well, that's why people listen to twit. Let's let's hear this story, right? You know

Start time: 670.84
End time: 680.26
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  It's because they don't their purpose is not to write the article their purpose is to gain access to Elon and they know that  Whoever whoever blows the most smoke up his backside gets access

Start time: 680.52
End time: 692.46
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  This is the problem with access journalism  We don't do it is because you will only get the stories that they want to feed you right and it's like yeah  It looks great. Yeah, I got an interview with so-and-so. It's like yeah, but what did he give up for that?

Start time: 778.08
End time: 811.68
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  But my gonna ride that I'm gonna ride into the ground my problem with this is I think a decade ago  You could defend a newsroom like the New York Times  Having a not a deep amount of tech reporting  We're not really knowing this in an era where this stuff is shaping elections, right? I know Ryan Mack is a good reporter  I know  He knows the context around Elon. So I think they owe it to their readers. Look, I'm an Elon Musk critic  I will completely own that don't just put me in there but give your readers that alternate point of view

Start time: 811.94
End time: 838.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm gonna guess that the Times got that article out really really fast  Within minutes of the event and all they could get was Elon. I'm gonna hope let's look that they found other  Sides to that morning when I looked there was nothing this morning, but that was like 10 o'clock  So all we heard from the New York Times was Musk's response, that's correct. Yeah  Well, that is disappointing and obviously

Start time: 839.52
End time: 844.44
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  There was more to say than that. You can't speculate into a definite proof of what's going on

Start time: 844.54
End time: 849.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure, right. So and that's true that Sheldon's post notwithstanding, you know, we don't know is that accurate?

Start time: 850.22
End time: 861.96
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  We don't know we don't know whether it's failing to pay contracts  We don't know if they're trying any things you don't know the software's fallen over and he's a very religious bloke and  We have a duty to actually make sure we get it right as well. And can I say one more thing?

Start time: 862.10
End time: 872.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think anybody cares about Twitter in the real world. There is that it's us  Yeah, I don't know. I bet you half our audience says get on we don't care used to be like that

Start time: 873.02
End time: 885.56
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  Tech used to be a safe sector in that you could talk about tech any way you wanted to and it didn't  Intersect with the normals now it does tech is now a political issue tech is now an overall absolutely  That's really changed

Start time: 886.28
End time: 888.80
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Although whether Twitter or not will remain that way is

Start time: 889.96
End time: 908.64
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  The debate Twitter could totally go this bit the way of my space in Geo CDs one. Oh, yeah  But this conversation is going to remain there's still going to be access journalism  the the instant take the hot take which is the one that everyone wants because that's that starts the water cooler conversation is still going to  Be there and big journalists still shouldn't do it, but they're gonna be tempted to sure

Start time: 909.32
End time: 937.48
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I just think it's a problem for the industry when you have Casey Newton and the platformer is  Consistently going and getting these inside stories of what's going on in Silicon Valley  You have our big news fan like I pay for the Times I pay for Washington Post and I pay for Wall Street Journal  Because I want to fund newsrooms with the resources to go get the story and to report it out  It's consistently these smaller blogs that are going and doing the research and I think that's a real indictment of the big

Start time: 937.80
End time: 950.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interestingly, the platformer doesn't have the story either they don't have any story because they're probably doing what you suggested  Just find out what happened right now something I saw  Yes, Elon Musk greatest, but no

Start time: 952.87
End time: 965.52
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's interesting in terms of how this develops but  with certain  Publications Wall Street Journal Springs to mind. There's a very big access journalism element to that

Start time: 965.92
End time: 1005.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Always been a prominent. So so there's been a problem in the tech sector. Remember that in the in the car in the car automotive  Journalists it was always hard to trust the big car magazines because you knew that in order to do their job  They had to be friends with ward and hundred GM and Toyota and everybody and and it was always an issue with tech  One of the reasons I started twit twit and one of the reasons I worked at tech TV is because we I wanted to do something  Different I wanted to really kind of I thought people deserved  Honest coverage is one of the reasons I don't meet with PR people. I don't sign NDAs. It's hurt us in some ways  We don't get access  But it's in the long run. I think it's more important that we speak as honestly as we can

Start time: 1006.28
End time: 1009.72
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Great totally which is why where I'm I am where I am as well  I mean

Start time: 1023.72
End time: 1044.26
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  I really I think far too many are willing to accept  Giving a good review or taking a press release rewriting it. This is not just the gaming thing  I mean remember when Apple Maps came out and all the people that got advanced  When Apple, you know and Apple plays that game nobody actually mentioned that Apple Maps was

Start time: 1048.08
End time: 1064.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's one of okay no one yes  It's really Apple knows this who gets invited who gets to see the vision Pro who gets to try it on  Yeah, it's very much. They're very aware of who's part gonna give them positive coverage and who's not it's not  Coverage anymore. Yeah, we just we just don't get access

Start time: 1064.80
End time: 1093.64
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I do feel like I just wanted to fend my friends very briefly Jason Shrier has done amazing labor work in the video game industry  Work to Kotaku has talked about the labor abuses and no I'm back in Valentine  Polygon yeah has done amazing work on some of the sexual scandals in our industry  but I agree overall these have served as entertainment magazines that hype up the next big thing and  And there's an audience for that to be honest it's not just the industry I get

Start time: 1094.48
End time: 1115.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Email all the time for people said you used to have fun in technology used to cover the fun stuff and talk about the  New things and the fun things you don't do that anymore  And I think that perhaps we've changed, but I think even the industry has changed and and and so there it is  There isn't like the newest phones  Are no are just incremental. Yeah, there's nothing to get really excited about

Start time: 1116.33
End time: 1129.66
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Well, no one's creating anything anymore  I mean really when you think about Apple Google a bunch of other tech firms  They've just either bought in technology from other people or they're at the rent-seeking point of the technology cycle

Start time: 1130.46
End time: 1148.65
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For stuff that they're also hard to innovate now because yeah, these are matured phones as an example are very mature  I mean if if that's how you feel then the people should celebrate the vision Pro because that is at least an attempt  From Apple to do something new and different  I just spent 13.3 billion dollars trying to get something new and we resoundingly said no

Transcript:  There are like the m1 mac I think all of us huge technology huge step forward this made everyone happy  I didn't see any criticism of that across the industry generally we celebrated that  I do think that this is a tech industry that when praise is called for we will certainly give it  I just think overall I think Aztec has moved from this kind of niche thing to something that's so central in our life and politics  I think it's appropriate for journalists to be more skeptical of these things because it's not toys  This is the fabric of our social contract today. That is the difference, right? It's not it's not the toy store anymore. Yeah, it's life. Yeah

Start time: 1269.76
End time: 1365.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm gonna go ahead and say  Kind of as this story is old as time reddit  Which just like twitter is a platform which normal people like us put our content on  Normal unpaid people like us moderate spend many many hours to moderate  So the real value of twitter is just like reddit is the content  Sure that we have put there, but they provide the platform  Hoffman just like twitter just like Elon said and we're getting scraped to death by AI  I think AI and large language models have been somewhat of a prod in this  Because those companies are suddenly getting all the attention  Based on content they've aggregated from sites like this  I don't hear Jimmy Wales at Wikipedia moaning  I'm sure he was also a victim of this  In any event, Hoffman who wants to do an IPO  They announced an IPO several years ago  They've been really trying to get the public offering so they can get a big exit  They've never made money  Never shown a profit  They were purchased by Conde Nast a few years ago  Conde spun it out as a stand alone company but it was still majority shareholder  I imagine Conde also putting pressure  Hey we'd like to make some money on this  If not through profit then maybe through an IPO  Hoffman now has the burden of  Well let's figure out some way to get some money out of this  So he decides  Kind of similar to Elon, we're gonna charge for the API  And I think really what the decision was very much like Elon  We're gonna get rid of these third party clients that don't show our ads  They are just a cost center to us  Because they're sucking our bandwidth without giving us any revenue back

Start time: 1365.96
End time: 1371.64

Transcript:  And we interviewed actually Jason and Micah interviewed Christian Selig from Apollo  Which is really kind of the poster child for all this  He made a great app, an app I use  Probably most iOS people use  For Twitter, for Reddit, it was a much better app  He had a call early on with Hoffman  And Hoffman said yeah we're gonna charge you 24 cents for a thousand queries  And Steve, I mean Christian did some back of the envelope math  And said well that's gonna cost me 20 million dollars a year  Based on the amount of usage I have  I cannot charge my users enough to make up for that  Which you knew really well anyway  Yeah, well and he had a couple of problems  One is I paid for it but you don't keep paying for it  A lot of people were grandfathered in at lower costs  You know I pay for Twitter too  There's, not Twitter, Reddit Gold or whatever it's called  I pay for Reddit Premium  Yeah  So I mean I want to support them  I want them to do alright  But it sounded like really the plan from Reddit was to kill the third party clients entirely  Almost all of them are gone now  June 30th was the end of the line for Apollo  For Reddit is fun, RIF, for quite a few clients  A few still are around, I don't know how they're doing it  Maybe they raised their prices

Transcript:  Maybe, I mean the thing is these were admin tools which you needed if you were going to be a volunteer moderator  That's right  And Reddit's own tools were pathetically bad  Now they've basically said we're going for IPO  We need all that user data ourselves  And we need all those moderator stuff  And the moderators revolted  And I've got to say I haven't posted with one exception anything on the site  Or submitted anything to the site since it broke out  Because they are, to accuse volunteer moderators of being landed gentry  That was just sickening

Transcript:  Huffman did a publicity tour that was very ham-handed  A lot of bad interviews  And hurt himself badly  And I think the thing people weren't considering is these moderators  Who have been unpaid volunteers and worked really really hard for a very long time  Some moderators shut their subreddit down  The Synology subreddit is now NSFW  Which takes away their ad revenue  Because most advertisers don't want to be on an NSFW subreddit  So moderators are rebelling  A lot of them have left  The people who ran the Ask Me Anythings, the AMAs have all left

Transcript:  So the AMA people left said  If you want to do AMAs, Steve, you should pay the moderators  So there's been a rebellion  And now Reddit is kind of clamping down and firing moderators  For a while Steve was saying we're going to make it so you can vote out  Because he's right  There are users of the F1 subreddit let's say  Who want the subreddit to continue  Who say well you're just getting in our way moderators  And if there were a vote, yeah get rid of the moderators  Because we want our subreddit to continue  iPhone subreddit moved off onto Discord  There aren't any credible third party  This is the real problem  There's no credible third party replacement

Transcript:  The problem with Twitter, the problem with Reddit has been the same thing  They've got to scale too much  They scale to the point where they never can never be profitable  It's not possible for Reddit to ever make money  They took so much investment money  That right now either the investors are going to take a bath  Or Reddit is going to have to clamp down on the very people who are creating the content  Which they use for advertising  That's not possible  They're in a no win scenario right now  Now you can say  I understand businesses have to make money  They have to keep the doors open  I get it  But if you built your model on getting goodwill from the people who are using your service  And that's how you make your money  You cannot then turn around and say  Well we still want you to do the stuff that you did when we had the goodwill  But you're not going to get the goodwill anymore

Transcript:  I think that's well said  And just to add on to that  Two things  One, Huffman is very famously emulating Elon Musk in this case  Like he's come forward  I think he admits it right?  Yeah  Having calls with him  Total fanboy in those interviews  Like wanting to come forward slash costs until it's financially profitable  Choose your idols carefully  So I'm not going to go down the Elon Musk criticism hole again  I just wanted to say that  But the wider point to me is if you really look into this API funding scheme that they've got  I don't think this is a credible vision for the future  Because what they want to do is basically use the Reddit training data for machine language learning  Now there's a whole discussion to be had about bias built into your natural language sets  I do not want my AI trained on Reddit  Trained on Reddit

Transcript:  Look I use it for a reason  I'm just saying that there's going to, in my opinion, there's going to come a point very soon where they've gotten the juice for that lemon  So as far as it being a continuing thing to fund all of Reddit  I just, I think you look at the numbers

Start time: 1717.76
End time: 1736.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That doesn't feel credible  This makes me sad because Reddit and Twitter both were huge resources  Very valuable to the community  Both owned by owners who apparently didn't value that  Or maybe couldn't afford to keep losing money  I mean I understand how that is  You can only lose so much money  I think this is maybe why they're so desperate to IPO

Start time: 1737.02

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Because Uber has been doing this stuff for years  Uber never made money  And allowed people to cash out the initial investors to cash out their stake  And after that they lost interest and you can run it as a loss making service  Right  But with Reddit, I think you're right  I don't see a way for them to fund this  You know you can't do that on Reddit gold purchases  Either you pay for a premium service or the money gets sold off

Start time: 1763.04
End time: 1773.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe that's what Elon or Huffman should do is just say look  We're a paid service  Get over it, that's the way it's going to be  You want it to succeed, I'd pay five bucks a month  Would enough people do that?

Start time: 1774.20
End time: 1788.70
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  That would work with a traditional publication  But the problem is both Reddit and Twitter rely on its users to provide the content that it monetizes  Good point  So you're saying pay me money and then make my content  That doesn't work  Yeah, that's a good point

Start time: 1788.76
End time: 1818.76
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Do you know what I wonder is also a factor here  That they've engineered these apps, particularly Twitter  To be more and more addictive  They bring scientists on to figure out how to keep you scrolling forever  That has a cost that's associated with it  So maybe Elon is onto something with this rate limiting idea  Limiting the number of things you can scroll until you have to pay for it  Maybe something like that  Like there's a free tier where you can just do it a little bit  But if you're completely addicted to the service like I am

Start time: 1819.22
End time: 1853.74
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  But the glory to that is if you submit something then you should get a discount or freebie on that  Fair point  That's interesting  There's a strategy  I've been on Reddit far too long so I've got six digits in comments  Oh my goodness  If they want my comment, my submissions, then they're going to have to pay for them  I'm a journalist, we don't work for free  But I mean just to annoy that many people who your entire business model depends on  I just don't see the rationale behind it

Start time: 1854.06
End time: 1896.74
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So here's a wider question  To a certain extent, Twitter and Reddit and services like this are the public comments in 2023  Like when I was a teen in the 90s, it was the local coffee shop, we would all go hang out there  Today it's these digital comments  And two, I think there's a question to be asked here  Like should these be for-profit companies?  Because it seems to me there's a public stake  Like I have no idea how you get the government to fund something like this where it would be good or well run  But it seems to me that there's a public stake in us having a healthy place to go have conversation  Maybe it's tax credits, maybe it's just giving them money  I think this is very valuable

Start time: 1897.04

Transcript:  The problem is you don't know which of these is going to be winners, which of these is going to win the public  Reddit just came out of nowhere and took over from Dig  Twitter kind of came out of nowhere  Nobody had ever done anything like it  I mean what's the next one? No one knows  And I can guarantee you it's not a government funded or even tax credit backed or even 501c3 thing

And it always seemed to me like it wasn't really sustainable  Yeah  I'm amazed we got 30 years down the road somehow with nobody making any money  And then of course Google figured it out and then it spread like a virus  Oh, you could put ads on these things and you could make money  And then that's been a nightmare

Transcript:  Honestly, I mean we grew up in the times of print journalism  Where if you wanted to start a publication  Before desktop publishing really kicked off in the 80s and early 90s  You had to have access to a full six color printer  And massive costs and massive distribution costs  The internet, desktop publishing came around  An awful lot easier to produce a magazine, you still got to print it out  Internet lowered the cost of entry dramatically  What's now driving that cost of entry up is a matter of scale and deliberate policy  So it's gone sour at somewhere along the line

I don't agree  When you pay out these big deals and you know that you're never going to get an ROI on that deal  It means that you want to move yourself up in the headlines  It means you want to make your business model the primary  This is unsustainable  This is a model we've seen this way, Uber

Transcript:  It's fun grinding though  Because it's so grim  Eww  I have to say there's a lot more story  They have used their time and probably AI  To generate a lot of backstory  A lot of NPCs  A lot of stuff going on  In fact, I realized  Don't talk to anybody  They're going to give you a job  And pretty soon you got all these quests  If you talk to anybody  You know, my father died in the plains

Transcript:  It looks like Canada is going to pass C18  Boo  And already Meta has said  Well, if C18 passes, which is a link tax basically  This is the one where they did it in Australia  They'll back down like they did in Australia  So this came out of Rupert Murdoch who said  You know, hey, mate  You're linking to my content  You ought to give me some money for that  To which Google says  We're driving all the traffic to your content  And you want us to pay you?  Anyway, being legislatures  Get involved in the case of Canada  It's now a law  The government says  Google and other companies will have to pay  For showing links to news sites  Blame Canada  Meta has already said  Well, no more news for you, Canada  In any of our feeds  And Google has just announced  That they are in fact going to remove links to Canadian news  Now, see, how is this good for your  If you're, you know, the Toronto Globe and Mail  They're going to remove links in search, news and discover products  You'll no longer be able to operate the Google News Showcase in Canada  So that's gone  Google's basically said bye-bye  Yeah

Start time: 3783.06
End time: 3812.36
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Okay, so someone on the cold face for this  It's not as bad as it sounds  It all depends on your readership model  So for example  So you get traffic that's not referred from the search engines  We get about less than double digit traffic from Facebook  We get less than a third of our traffic from Google  We get a bunch of direct people because they love the site  They come directly to us  Now, yeah  I can't tell you how  If you're running a clickbait site  How few times I've seen the register.com spot

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I'm guessing that's fairly rare  But I know, like I said  I went to the front page today  Because we were looking for Twitter story  But normally I just see links that I follow  And you're right  You're not on TechMeme  You would be referred a lot by TechMeme  Yeah, I mean, for some reason they've got it

Start time: 3836.76
End time: 3842.68
Speaker: Iain Thompson

Start time: 3842.76
End time: 3846.43
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3870.90
End time: 3903.76
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  They tried it in Spain  Remember, Spain, that was running for eight years  And the Spanish publishers were saying, no, you owe us money  They actually levied a mandated payment  And then Google said, okay, we're going to stop  We're shutting down Google Spain  And they did for two years  And then finally they came back  They changed the law, no mandatory payments  Because they realized they're actually providing us a service  Same thing's going to happen in Canada  There's going to be some publishers who are going to stick to their guns  Because they are insistent that they were right  And the other publishers are going to look at the bottom line and say, wait a minute  Is this really what we wanted?

Start time: 3903.76
End time: 3925.74
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  I think there's a difference in terms of market  Because Australia and Canada are much bigger markets than Spain will ever be  There is a very limited market for Spanish language news  For European Spanish language news, let's put it that way  Whereas Canada, Australia, they've got a bit more clout  It all depends whether or not they hang together or hang separately

End time: 3989.76
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So, I mean, look, I truly don't have strong policy positions on this  But just to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here  You know, the reality is Google is one of the largest companies in the entire world  And they have built a revenue model that is about value extraction  From a lot of different parts of the industry  I can tell you, someone who runs a ton of ads and will run literally hundreds of thousands  If not a million dollars in ads for 2024  You know, we give them and Facebook a lot of money  Because their ad tools are the very best in the business  They've built a essentially a monopoly or a duopoly, I think would be fair to say  That makes it very hard for smaller people in this space to thrive  So don't you think maybe this is not the answer  But, you know, Leo, coming back to the hackers like motto that you were putting up earlier  If you look at what went wrong with that vision  It was the big companies like Google and Facebook kind of interceding

Transcript:  So, to me this is...  So I just searched for the headline of your article about Google  Which we're going to get to, true  And I find the link to the register  I see a snippet  The snippet is not long  It's not even three sentences, it's two and a half  Google accused of ripping off advertisers with video ads no one saw  Now the expert view  That's it  And if I want to read more, I'm going to click that link  I don't think they're stealing anything from you with that snippet

Start time: 4044.60

Start time: 4048.76
End time: 4055.72

Start time: 4056.14

Start time: 4060.77
End time: 4071.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm going to click your link  I mean the only reason this would be costly to you is if I read the snippet  And then said, oh, that's plenty  And didn't go to your site  But this doesn't give me enough to do that

Start time: 4072.27
End time: 4077.72

End time: 4109.76
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  That search engine collects data on the people that do the searches  Which pays for Google's bills  Right  You know, it's kind of like...  You can't build, as you put it, the best advertising engine in the world  Unless you've got a hell of a lot of user data  That's exactly right  And they get that user data from registered readers  From people that go through their site to the register

Start time: 4109.78
End time: 4145.07
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It is so specific that I use that information with list matching  To like find out what articles they've read  What they're interested in  Like it is truly...  When you dig down into it, it is...  It's terribly disturbing  So, look, I'm not...  I truly don't have a strong opinion one way or the other  I just think at some point we're going to have to reckon with a tech industry  That is built in a way that about three or four companies can really succeed  And everyone else is fighting for their life  It seems to me this is having...  It's the American way  Do you think Bing should pay you for a link to the register?

So I've been really, really researching for my job  Kick and Twitch and Rumble and all these platforms  One way they support their shows, this is really interesting to me  There's a major show  Gambling  Not gambling, this is actually ethical I think  So super chats are a non-trivial part of a lot of these large streamers' revenues  So the way it works is you have a fan out there that's watching your show live  And they really, really, really want to have their say on it  So they will spend $100, $200, $500 to have you read a message from them in the middle of your show  And then it's pinned to the top of your live chat as you're going  I think this is an interesting model because it's audience participation  You know, they have skin in the game  I kind of don't like  Well, I mean, I guess that's what we're doing with Club Twitter

It was hanging up but it had been broken  The lights didn't work anymore  It had kind of fallen apart  He said, do you want it?  He said, when you're done with it  I've promised it to the Computer History Museum  They want to put it there  So this was a show for this  When MSNBC launched  It was a joint venture of NBC and Microsoft  They came to Ziff Davis and said  We need a technology show if we're going to be  So I went out to 30 Rock and presented  Along with a bunch of other Ziff Davis people  A show that we wanted to do  I wrote the long 95 page treatment  And it got the site on the air  And I was there for the launching  That's where I got my MSNBC show  That's where I got Miami for the virtual character  I played Dev Null with Soledad O'Brien was the anchor  So I said, yes, we'll come up  Jerry Wagle who was our Chief Operations Officer  Had just got his Ford pickup  His new electric Ford pickup  The Lightning  So we drove up, we got it  Brought it down here  And I gave it to Burke  I said, Burke, can you get this thing working?  It's not in great shape  He opened it up  It was custom made for the site  NBC probably spent $20,000 on this thing  Borman told me, he said  We did the pilot  And Andy Lacks, the head of NBC News called up and said  You need a sign  Get a sign made for the show  So that was basically  I was looking behind you at the moment  Cart Blanche  Yeah, we have a big gear  We have a sign  He said Cart Blanche to do whatever he wants  So he built this sign  It was custom made fluorescent lighting  All the way around  Because fluorescent was all we had in those days  When we got it, the fluorescent bulbs were working  Very Miami boys  Yeah, Burke took it apart  He has been spending many hours fixing this  Because sad to say, David Borman passed away  At the age of 69 last Sunday  Yeah, he was very young  He was a really talented producer  Smart guy  I really enjoyed knowing him  And I'm very grateful  So Burke, I said, Burke  I'd love to talk about David on Twitter this Sunday  Can you get the sign working?

Start time: 5894.06
End time: 5967.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a great question  When we built this, even then people were already doing that  We had a TriCaster that could do virtual sets  And I'm a big believer, and partly because of people like David Borman  That there's something about a physical presence in a physical real space  Where you can tell there's something behind them  In fact, in our old studio there were windows behind us, you'd see cars go by  I remember when we first built the Brickhouse  A listener, a viewer said, I hate this  I just saw somebody walk by with a spoon going to lunch  And I said, yes, because we want to make this a real place  That has a sense of place  And I think that that adds value to it  You know what, it would be a lot cheaper  If we just did green screens and everybody was at home  And we didn't have to have a sense of place  It would be a lot cheaper if we didn't do video at all, to be honest  And if I were starting Twitch today, maybe I'd consider those  Because frankly our financial, our business model is not great  It costs us a couple million dollars a year at least to run the studio  And pay for the staff and all that  And we could do it a lot cheaper  I love what we've done, and I love the site  Same thing, I loved having that physical presence

Transcript:  I have been trying to break more of our organizations away from Creative Cloud  Because a lot of them actually can't even afford Creative Cloud  So like for video, finally DaVinci is decent, it's free, and you can actually buy the more advanced version  Without having to pay a subscription  For photo, it's still GIMP, it's most accessible  But I look at how much money we pay for Creative Cloud even in our small communication shop in Rome  And it's ridiculous

End time: 6694.74
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  And it comes out to what you were saying  When Adobe shifted from being able to buy the software to having to rent it  It's led to some massive disparities  So at one point when they were still selling it in Australia  It was cheaper to fly from Los Angeles  To fly from Australia to Los Angeles, buy a copy of Adobe and then fly back to Australia  And then they jacked that up further when they insisted on class subscription

Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  Well my favorite is the, so they do the introductory pricing  So it's $30 a month, but then you get to the year and it goes up to $59 a month  So every year you have to, actually they've automated it  It used to be you had to call and threaten to quit and then they'd give you another year  Now you threaten to quit on the website and then they forward you to another page saying  We'll give you another you at this, but if you don't do it, if you forget it  You automatically get jacked up

I can't even remember the name of it  Oh absolutely, there are ways to do it  And more and more, what's really interesting on the Apple side  Is there are iPad apps like Affinity  The Serif companies, Affinity Photo and others  That are kind of, I think, eating Adobe's lunch  So I think a lot of, at least on the Mac side  A lot of people are abandoning Photoshop and Lightroom  I had a $10 photography subscription which was Lightroom and Photoshop  And I just checked it the other day  And it doesn't include Photoshop anymore  It's like, dudes  I just, to hell with them  I'm sorry, I'm done with Adobe  There are solutions out there  I think it's Camera One that I use

Let me see the pricing  Because I think it's fairly expensive  Yeah, they do have a subscription  $18 a month  I would pay $300 to download it  But you can get a $300 perpetual license  And it handles all the raw file formats  So if you really want something that is kind of very similar to Lightroom  Sure

Because it's touch, it's kind of natural  The iPad Pro screens are spectacular  Better than most computer monitors  This is a very good photo editor for the iPad  Photomator 3.05 just came out  It does 600 RAW file formats  And I think it's cheap  I can't remember how much  But the Pixelmator folks really do stuff inexpensively  So there are a lot of stuff out there

Transcript:  Yes, believe me, yes, absolutely  But I won't get into those  I will talk about a couple of kind of surprising cases  That didn't get much coverage because of the big Supreme Court cases this week  But first, a word from our sponsor  Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN  We were talking on Ask the Tech Guys about why you would want to use a VPN  And even today there are still some very good reasons  For security, for privacy, to eliminate geographic restrictions  We all spend too much time on our phones these days  Buying groceries, sending pictures to friends  Maybe ordering a car to the airport, father  The scary part is your phone carrier sees it all  They collect data on whatever it is you're doing  Verizon admits to it  They say it so they can, quote, better understand your interests  Hopefully they understand my interests  Really all they want to do is sell your activity to advertisers  And they can, it's completely legal  Stuff like the sites you visited, what you've been on to online  The more they can get on you, the bigger their paycheck becomes  If you want to protect your privacy, your security online, you need a VPN  And I use ExpressVPN  It's easy to use, it's an app  You can use it on iPhone, Android, Mac, Linux, Windows  It prevents your phone carrier from being able to see the sites you visit  And sell it off to third parties, same thing for your ISP  Comcast is not your friend  All it takes is one tap of a button and all of your network data is encrypted and rerouted  Through ExpressVPN secure servers  I am so impressed with how ExpressVPN does this  In order to truly protect you, it's important that a VPN provider not log your activity  We know that  And of course it's in the privacy policy  They've had it audited independently by third parties  But I want to tell you, they go a step further  They use a custom Debian distribution on all their servers  That wipes the drive every night  They start fresh every morning  So there's no trace of your visit  They run their server technology  They wrote it themselves called Trusted Server  In RAM and it's sandboxed  So even if it wanted to write to the hard drive, it couldn't  It starts up just for you when you press the button on your ExpressVPN app  And when you're done, it goes away forever  There is literally no way  Any trace of your use of ExpressVPN can show up on their servers  It protects all your network data  Not just your web browsing  You stay private even when you're using your apps on your phone  Whether you're an iPhone, Android, tablet user  ExpressVPN even works on your routers  They even sell routers  They even sell routers, very nice routers as a matter of fact at ExpressVPN.com slash twit  And the best part is one subscription covers up to five devices at the same time  So your whole family can use ExpressVPN  It's the only VPN I use  When your phone carrier tracks you  That's a gross invasion of privacy  Emphasize gross  You can keep letting them cash in on you or visit ExpressVPN.com slash twit  To get the same VPN I use  Take back your online privacy today  If you use our special link you'll get three months free with a one-year plan  EXPRESSVPN.com slash twit  ExpressVPN.com slash twit  We thank them so much for their support and for making a really, really great product  So, yes, the Supreme Court said  You can discriminate against anybody anytime  You don't have to make a website for them  That was a funny case because nobody had actually ever asked that person to make the website  It was pretty radical

Transcript:  Caltech, which is a private research university in Pasadena  has patents on technologies that increase Wi-Fi speed and range on mobile devices  In 2016, they sued Apple and Broadcom  saying that both the companies were using their patents without license  Millions of iPhones, iPads, and other Apple devices using Broadcom Wi-Fi chips  infringed the patents  Apple and Broadcom did something we actually were thinking about doing  back when there was a podcast patent troll  Our attorneys, we talked with our attorneys about doing something called an intrapartase appeal  which is you go to the patent and trademark office and say this patent's no good  You overturn it  But our attorney said there's a risk  If you do that and the patent office doesn't overturn it, you're screwed  because then the jury sees that and says, you see, it was a good patent  So we didn't do it, thank goodness  Adam Carolla, yeah, I think it was Adam Carolla who raised a lot of money  He did it, no, no, it was the EFF  Adam Carolla and Feynman and Court  But the EFF went to the patent and trademark organization and got the whole patent overturned  So that was a successful case  In this case, Apple and Broadcom went to the USPTO  and the patent office said, no, no, that's a good patent  which is kind of bad news for Broadcom  A jury then, hearing that, sided with Caltech  This was in 2020 and gave a $1.1 billion award split by Apple and Broadcom

Start time: 7483.42

Start time: 7485.98
End time: 7536.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny because it's only because Apple used Broadcom chips, right?  It wasn't even Apple directly infringing  So I really think Broadcom deserves  But anyway, both companies appealed  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears patent appeals, upheld the jury's findings  It did order a new trial on damages, that has not happened  So the $1.1 billion could be adjusted down  In any event, Apple took it to the Supreme Court  In January, the Supreme Court asked the Biden administration whether the appeals should be heard  The Solicitor General in May said, no, please don't take the case  The Federal Circuit did it right  The Supreme Court did not disagree, did not give them cert  So it's over in that regard  All we have left is a trial for how much the damages should be

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, my husband works in patent law biotech  Oh, interesting, I did not know that  It's often frustrating for me because I hear people on my own side, the left, saying stuff that's just wildly inaccurate about biotech patents  You'll hear people say, oh, why didn't we, we funded all of this  Why don't we just have the patents and make them free for everyone?  You're like, I don't think you understand the history of Moderna or how these things come to pass  It's a lot more complicated  So I just wanted to pre-preface this by saying the conversation around biotech patents, I think, is frequently stupid  That said, I have personally never heard an argument for software patents that I have found compelling  I think these almost universally limit competition  And when I read, like, the limits of what Frank does with his job, it's like a certain target protein  It's a certain, like, formula that they're using  It's a chemical process  It's so precise and it's something that they've spent, you know, incredible amounts of money, like, eliminating others to find the one that works  So I think there's a valid economic argument for patenting that  I don't understand, I've never seen an argument for software patents, I think, raises to that level  Am I alone here or do you all agree?

Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  Okay, so from the tech side, the tricky thing about the Caltech patents is  It's an interesting idea  Sure  But it would have no real world application if Broadcom had not made their F-bar filters  The F-bar filters are the actual device that takes the frequency filtering that the Caltech patents apply to  And makes it something that you can actually use  So yes, they did build upon Caltech's work, but it's not as if Caltech actually made the filters  Right

Start time: 7725.38
End time: 7757.72
Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  And this is my argument that for the biotech industry, those patents, they're going through  They're plugging dozens of protein sequences in  They're doing experiments, they're seeing if it works, they're running assays  What you're talking about Broadcom doing is developing a technology  Spending that money doing the R&D in a lockout process for a patent that in my view is essential across the industry  So I just, I don't see the value for this  And I think it's really disappointing this status has enabled this

Start time: 7757.76
End time: 7773.76
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  And the Apple part of the judgment is even more ridiculous because Apple didn't even develop the technology  They bought a chip from Broadcom  So I mean how many times divorced  If I started a business using my iPhone, can Caltech claim that they should get a percentage of that business because they used their patents

Start time: 7774.08
End time: 7794.76
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  The American legal system is a weird thing, but wasn't that basically just doubling the basis  Apple has more money than, I nearly said more money than God, but look who I'm talking to  Three trillion dollar company  And so chucking them in there maybe just in the hope that Apple would pay them enough money for this to go away  Well then where does it stop? Apple was not the only company to use the F-point filters

Transcript:  The case was Counterman vs. Colorado  A guy who was convicted, Colorado has an anti-stalking law  After he sent a barrage of threatening Facebook messages to a woman on Facebook that he'd never met  Yeah  The Colorado law just said, hey, if the recipient of the messages is  Or any reasonable person feels distress, that's against the law  They convicted him, Counterman appealed  Arguing his statements were protected by the First Amendment and did not constitute true threats  So true threats are outside the First Amendment  So in fact, by the way, stalkers know this, if they said I'm going to strangle you tomorrow  I can go after them, that's a true threat of bodily harm, right?  You know this, I'm sure you've talked to the police department  And then they'll go after them  But if you say  You should be strangled  Or here's your home address  It'd be a shame if somebody were to cause some harm  Yeah  Is that a true threat?  So Counterman said that wasn't my intention to threaten the person  The Supreme Court agreed  Yeah  This is the majority opinion  Justice Elena Kagan wrote  The state prosecuted Counterman in accordance with an objective standard  And did not have to show any awareness on Counterman's part of his statements threatening character  That is a violation of the First Amendment  So if a nut job doesn't know that a chainsaw would dismember you

Transcript:  The other thing I would say is, I'll just tell a very quick story  Back during the height of Gamergate, I gave a talk at a college and this kid raises his hand and identifies himself as a Gamergater  And makes an obnoxious comment to a room full of 300 people, whatever, I handled him, I'm a pro, it doesn't bother me  This is why this is important  After this, it was like 11 o'clock at night and I'm there with a female member of the faculty that invited me to speak at this college  And this kid who is, you know, like, he's following us to our car  Oh my god  Just going and being like, Gamergate this, Gamergate that, y'all don't understand, and being so aggressive  And this kid, I don't think he was a bad person, my point is he had no understanding that following two women to their car at 11 o'clock at night was something that made us extremely uncomfortable  It was just free speech  It was him trying to get his opinion out there  So by that standard, you know, he didn't know that what he was doing was threatening  And I think that's a lot of these people that are a little bit unhinged  I think they are truly tuned out from what the consequences are of how their behavior affects others

Start time: 8408.96
End time: 8418.09
Speaker: Brianna Wu

Transcript:  The pilot program currently at 25 airports  The agency has determined its face matching algorithms are 97% effective  Quote, across demographics including dark skin tones  But they would not publicly release the results of their tests  Amazingly enough  Oh, it works, really, you can't see the results  Don't look behind the curtain  That's of course one of the big problems with face recognition  Is how poorly it does with people of color  The pilot program is technically voluntary  It uses what's known as a one-to-one face matching technology to verify that the traveler standing at the checkpoint matches the photo on their physical ID

Transcript:  To come back to this, I'm one of these Democrats who think national security is a very big deal  We do have America as a country, we have enemies out there  And there have been people that have smuggled, even in the Bush administration they found somebody trying to smuggle radiological material into the United States  And they managed to stop it  I am not an extremist with trying to keep our airports safe  I think what makes this a concerning story for me is it's such a quick leap from here to police departments having all this information out there  Particularly when they've got these contracts with companies like Clear AI out there doing that  Something I learned when I ran for Congress is there's a kind of asymmetrical information that the government has when they're pursuing cases  Because they have the resources to go to Discovery and to go into Google and to say, look, we have a geolocation fence of view here  We have this over here that looks kind of like you and they can just run that, run that, run that, run that  Whereas if you're innocent, you're at such a disadvantage versus all these various programs that they have  So I think if they were able to sandbox this off and say to the public, we're going to use this for national security  And it's not going to filter out, I would feel more comfortable with it, but they're not saying things like that

Start time: 9877.42

Start time: 9898.90
End time: 9938.36
Speaker: Robert Ballecer
Transcript:  My biggest concern, and I'm going to piggyback on Brianna's point here, is the government is deliberately bypassing a lot of the Fifth Amendment protections that we afforded  Because they're using a third party  Since the government doesn't own the database, since the government doesn't own the cameras, since the government isn't doing any of the screening or running the software  They're not violating your rights, they're just getting a name at the end  For me, that's the biggest concern because we've seen that happen  That's what Palantir was all about  Give me threat assessment in a way that is violating people's privacy, but because you bought the data and you're a third party company, I don't have to run any civil rights concerns

Transcript:  But I mean lithium got rid of some of the worst effects that we saw with earlier battery chemistries  where you were literally destroying the chemistry every single time you charged it  Which is why it's kind of stagnated because it's stable  Right now it suits most of our needs  It's relatively inexpensive  It's safe-ish to handle  This has actually been one of the biggest holdbacks on battery technology  because we're starting to realize  if you were able to put all the charge that we wanted into a battery  it would be an exceptionally dangerous device  Oh, 100%
