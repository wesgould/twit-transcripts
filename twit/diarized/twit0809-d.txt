And I always like to we've got somebody on his first time on twit.  I want to make sure we've surrounded him in the calm, cool waters of twit regulars.  I thought it was for the hazing and the hazing.  Oh, and Thomas is here, business editor at the San Francisco Chronicle.  But a long time tech reporter from all over.

End time: 407.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So don't like there is a big football game later in the day, I believe.  And it's funny because I always at least for the for a while, we would always say, oh, and guess what tech company is going to be buying a five million dollar ad on the Super Bowl.  Now it's more like guess which tech company is not buying a five million dollar ad.  But remember, what was the dot com that was the first dot com to buy a Super Bowl ad?  Was it pets.com? I think it was pets.com.

Start time: 425.20
End time: 437.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are, in fact, pets.com and type startups now pets.com.  Pets.com's biggest problem was it was very expensive to send kitty litter through the mail.

Start time: 438.17
End time: 442.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's how we get our kitty litter now from Chewy.  You know what? Chewy. Exactly.

Start time: 443.48
End time: 449.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's exact same idea.  There's no difference between Chewy and pets.com.  Yeah, it's timing.

Start time: 450.88
End time: 497.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you want to see the very first dot com Super Bowl ad.  This was 20 years ago.  They paid one point two million dollars for the ad.  Hey, you know, I got to go to a lot of stores to get what you like.  I'll be back.  If you leave me featuring the infamous pets.com sock puppet.  It's not it's not a bad ad, but it was during the tech bubble burst.  Soon after this ad, they launched their IPO by November of that year out of business.  So that one point two million might have given them another week or two runway.

Start time: 497.38
End time: 517.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I can tell you a story about about pets.com.  I actually wrote this up.  I looked at their web traffic and I mapped it to their advertising spend and they were completely divergent.  In other words, like the more they spent on on advertising, the less web traffic they got.  Of course.

Start time: 518.36
End time: 526.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was the opposite story for the for the bubble because you bought audience.  So this is the opposite.  I mean, we've had a number of sponsors.

Start time: 526.20
End time: 557.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll mention names.  Squarespace bought a lot of they were the podcast company for a while.  They bought everybody.  We were one of the first that they bought, spent a lot of money on us.  And then at some point they just got they bought a Super Bowl ad and they hired the dude to do their ads.  And obviously they spent so much they could have bought a two year campaign for what they spent on one Super Bowl ad.  I just feel like it's a status thing.  Is that right?  Oh, and you think it's more of a status symbol?

Start time: 558.04
End time: 598.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think TV advertising for an Internet company in twenty twenty one is brilliant because you break through the noise.  You know, your Instagram and Facebook feeds are just clotted with ads and people talk about it.  There's a buzz factor.  I think advertising in twenty in, you know, in 2000 was stupid because there just weren't enough people online.  Like you have all these people watching the ad who maybe have an AOL dial up account.  They're not going to buy kitty litter online.  So, you know, I think actually there's an argument that now it makes more sense.  Yeah, especially if you have a broad product that like everyone can use and, you know, like Squarespace is is one of those products.  Everyone, you know, probably wants a website.

Start time: 599.24
End time: 604.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's obvious. Right.

Start time: 658.16
End time: 669.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, I think the real problem with Quibi is like it wasn't social at all.  Like you couldn't even take a screenshot and share it.  They like did something to block that.  It was textbook.  Everything wrong about it.

Start time: 669.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Owen and Mike and Jeff.  I was trying I was listening to Clubhouse the other day and I was trying to cast it to anything besides my smartphone speakers.  And apparently you can't.  And in fact, the whole point of Clubhouse is it's live.  You can't record it. You can't listen on speakers.  You have to listen on the phone.  Isn't that just about the same?  It's similar, except for you can do it.

Start time: 697.20
End time: 701.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can put a microphone up to your phone.  You could always do that.  Yeah.

Start time: 702.20
End time: 707.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you could do that with Quibi.  You could all have a camcorder.  But look at it. Look at Instagram.

Start time: 707.38
End time: 714.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instagram is super successful.  And on Instagram, you can't download photos.  You can't. That's true.  You can't even share to your own followers.

Start time: 714.40
End time: 721.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you put a web address in the comments or the you can't click it.  Exactly. It's it's anti-social.

Start time: 722.46
End time: 739.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I think I think the question is like what's the context and what's the environment with Clubhouse and Instagram safety?  Like that feeling of like this is a good place for me to share things because it's not going to be ripped out of context.  You know, that I think is really important.

Start time: 739.88
End time: 749.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you have then you have TikTok, which facilitates sharing everywhere, which is going to be the more successful in the long run.  It's interesting.  Quibi.

Start time: 750.26
End time: 762.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quibi.  Quibi.  Quibi, it's going to be huge.  Oh, one's point about Quibi is exactly right.  If you see something you like, you want to share it.  You can't share it from a conversational site.  You can't. What is a content site?  What is a conversational site?

Start time: 765.36
End time: 767.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about Clubhouse?  Are any of you Clubhouse members?  I am. I'm on Android.

Start time: 769.34
End time: 780.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been I've been getting into Clubhouse big time this week.  Yeah. And and so I invite only its audio only you have.

Start time: 780.32
End time: 781.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's great. It's great.

Start time: 781.20
End time: 822.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great if you are somebody who wants to cultivate audience.  It's actually not a great site for content, in my opinion.  So compared to podcasting, for example, which it has been compared to, it's more like a conference call that you listen to.  Yeah, it's like it's exactly sounds worse.  But it's but the the amount of fluff on Clubhouse is astonishing.  I've gone into so many rooms on Clubhouse and nobody says anything.  Everyone. It's a very it's a very kind and gentle place.  Everybody's very respectful and all that, which is they've tried to deliberately cultivate that.  But in terms of bang for your buck, you can spend three hours.  Are they talking sourdough starters?

Start time: 822.56
End time: 858.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Haven't yet seen that. Yeah, it's nothing good like that.  There's one right now. I know.  Here's Master Bitcoin Today.  There's Sunday Satoshi Service.  There's a lot of Bitcoin.  War. Here's one on cyber warfare, which probably interesting.  Kim Dotcom is in that, which is kind of interesting.  He's the founder of Mega Visual Artists and Creatives Talk and more.  I've listened to a few. You know, it's interesting.  If you look at the global calendar, there's a lot of Chinese.  This is not yet banned in China.  And yeah, not yet.

Start time: 858.22
End time: 860.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be banned by the end of this show.

Start time: 860.20
End time: 890.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's here's here's some Russian.  But I noticed maybe not today.  Maybe they're all watching the Super Bowl.  But during the week, there was a lot of Chinese stuff.  I listened to a number of really interesting shows from people in Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong talking about China in a way that I had not heard in mainstream media.  So that's that safety thing you were talking about, Owen.  They feel like they probably can do it because it can't be repeated or recorded.

Start time: 891.26
End time: 906.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the founders of Clubhouse was actually a reporter who used to who's beat what used to be Hong Kong.  Oh, that explains it.  So they absolutely know that they're going to be banned any second.  If they're still if they're still available in China a week from now, I'd be really surprised.

Start time: 908.62
End time: 923.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There I would love I would love to know, like, if if they're using some service that, you know, China doesn't want to block, like maybe they're using I'm just making this up.  Maybe they're using Trilio on the back end and would break, break too many things if they were to block it.

Start time: 923.30
End time: 938.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember because I did hear what the Clubhouse back end was and it was kind of a surprise.  Maybe that is what's going on.  Because why wouldn't they have blocked it immediately?  I don't remember.  It'll come to me before the show is over.

Start time: 939.56
End time: 945.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe they're waiting and watching and making a list of, you know, of everyone in a clubhouse.

Start time: 946.27
End time: 952.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might they might just see it as being a useful.  Yeah, a useful place to spy.

Start time: 953.20
End time: 973.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the advantage of I mean, I guess audio covers I'm a writer.  So I guess I'm used to typing to talk.  Yeah, I guess most people aren't and are intimidated by that.  So just simply being able to talk to have a conversation.  But but only it's but isn't it like is it is it analogous to talk radio?  It's just only a few people talk and the rest of you listen.

Start time: 973.38
End time: 1053.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like that.  So basically how these things work is that one, two or three people will start a room and they're on the stage.  Nobody else can talk until they until they choose somebody.  And then as they're talking, people can press a button that says that they're raising their hand.  And then the moderators can choose or not choose people who raise their hands.  And oftentimes, because it's still kind of a it's a very chummy kind of Silicon Valley vibe, at least the rooms that I know.  Oftentimes, they know personally know the people who are in the audience and they'll choose those people over people they don't know, for example.  But it's it's kind of like it's tailor made for the for the pandemic because people are at home by themselves.  They don't have the water cooler.  And so it's kind of great to be just listening and participating in this conversation in the pandemic.  Now, whether this succeeds when when the dust clears and we are no longer sheltering in place, who knows?  But right now it's it's it's it's not like talk radio.  It's much more informal and it's much more interactive.  But it's it's still how often do you hear women on it?  A lot of women.  Yeah, there's a lot. So this is another interesting thing about it.  There are there are a lot of women on Clubhouse.  There are tons and tons and tons of black Americans and also a lot of Africans.

Start time: 1054.30
End time: 1057.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Baratunde uses it.  Yeah.  Regularly.

Start time: 1058.46
End time: 1081.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's kind of it's kind of turned out to be a great place for for groups of people who are not who don't have a big presence on sites like Twitter.  And so, you know, including including Chinese citizens, for example.  But there's a lot of foreign language rooms, which is really interesting.

Start time: 1083.30
End time: 1086.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so a lot of Dogecoin rooms right now.  Oh, boy.

Start time: 1088.54
End time: 1095.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I logged on this morning and randomly Trump's former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, was in a room.

Start time: 1095.75
End time: 1155.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I would I would be fascinated.  Now, you might ask, why are you talking about this random Silicon Valley startup?  Well, for one thing, it's a unicorn.  But for another thing, this past week, Elon Musk showed up and then Mark Zuckerberg showed up both on the stage of a talk show that is apparently a regular Clubhouse.  When Zuckerberg showed up, there was a Musk was when Musk showed up.  I think they had 5000 people in the room.  They spun off a second room of 5000 and then a third room of 5000 people.  So, you know, it had been promoted ahead of time.  The other thing that's interesting is it's a Andreessen Horowitz venture.  And a lot of Andreessen Horowitz companies end up there, you know, funded companies end up there.  And so it's another one of Andreessen Horowitz has also started their own publishing empire.  And I think this is part of part of what they're doing.

Start time: 1156.24
End time: 1161.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As Benedict Evans, who used to work there, said it's a media company that makes its money as a VC.

Start time: 1161.24
End time: 1173.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  VC. Yeah, we should mention it's Mark Andreessen, who, of course, created Medscape and it's a venture fund.  Are they late stage, early stage angel?  I think they're a big VC, right?  They're a normal big VC.

Start time: 1173.20
End time: 1189.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they do almost everything, but they're primarily early stage.  Early stage.  Like they like to spot startups and kind of, you know, anoint them.  And I think that's definitely happening with Clubhouse.  It's the fact that we're talking about Clubhouse interrelated to the fact that Andreessen Horowitz.  They've been anointed.

Start time: 1189.44
End time: 1195.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Zuckerberg and Elon are all, they're all in that club.

Start time: 1196.37
End time: 1198.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Andreessen is on the board of Facebook.

Start time: 1198.49
End time: 1214.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right.  Interesting.  I think that's the one kind of shady thing that you should be aware of is that it is actually part of a venture capital firm's cloud that they can get you on Clubhouse and they can, you know, get you in their podcasts.

Start time: 1215.71
End time: 1228.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to be said that it's invite only.  So somebody who's a user and who has built up some points by using can invite you.  Otherwise you can't get in.  And it's only iPhone.  So if you have an Android phone, there's no Android app.

But, you know, I can never get enough Jarvis in my life.  That's for sure.  And brand new.  And we're going to Ormelio.  Owen Thomas, business editor at The Chronicle, but with a long heritage, long enough to remember  many of the companies we've just showed you.  And what exactly?  I never heard about Epidemic.com.  That is not a good name for a viral marketing company.  Well, not these days, no.  I don't think then it was a good name.  Oh, gosh.  Our show today brought to you by my favorite VPN company, ExpressVPN.  Nowadays, everybody, and Jeff, don't say anything, but people are a little nervous about who's  watching you when you're online.  You might be saying, oh, I'm going to use incognito mode.  That doesn't hide you from anybody, especially from Google.  When you're using incognito mode, if you're doing a Google search, they know it's you.  No one likes to be watched.  Big tech knows where you're going.  They know where you've been.  And you know what?  It's none of their business.  But when you use a VPN, you're hiding your IP address.  And ExpressVPN, really, the only, there's no question you need a VPN.  The only question is which one?  And that's why I'm here to tell you about ExpressVPN.  ExpressVPN is simply put the best, the most secure VPN.  They do zero logging.  And I can prove it.  Not only have they been audited many times with Pricewaterhouse, Cooper, their privacy  policy exactly spot on.  PWC even vetted their trusted server technology, ExpressVPN, and vetted this to make sure that  there was no way they could log in.  You would know it when you spin up your VPN server.  ExpressVPN loads the trusted server in RAM.  And it's sandboxed, so it can't write to hard drive.  When you leave, it's gone.  It closes.  It leaves RAM.  There is zero trace, literally zero trace of your visit.  ExpressVPN never logs traffic data, DNS queries, search queries.  It is private.  Absolutely.  It really works.  And it does all this without slowing your connection.  Look, you don't want to free your cheap VPN.  You want a VPN that invests in their servers and their bandwidth and their technology.  That's ExpressVPN.  Number one rated by CNET and Wired.  And speed is important because you don't want to feel like, oh, I'm using this VPN and I'm suffering.  In fact, you could put ExpressVPN not only on your phone or your computer, you could put it on your router.  It supports a great number of routers.  And your entire home network will be protected.  And the speed is so fast you'll never even know.  160 locations, 94 countries, very fast, fast enough to watch HD video.  So that's another great use for ExpressVPN.  You want to be you want to get some English TV, just go to England.  Come out of the come out into the world in London and then fire up your Netflix.  And all of a sudden you can watch Netflix UK.  Same thing in Japan.  It's really an amazing solution.  So stop handing your personal data over to your Internet service provider or any big tech company.  Protect yourself with the VPN I use to keep me safe online.  All you have to do is go to ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  They spell it out.  E-X-P-R-E-S-S. Another reason I like them.  And VPN is spelled VPN in case you want to know.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  You'll get three extra months when you buy a one year package.  It is my VPN is the one I trust.  It's the one I recommend.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  We thank you so much for supporting.  You're supporting to it too when you use that special address.  So do me a favor and and use that ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  OK, we could talk about Apple.  We could talk about Google.  But I think we should talk about since we mentioned AWS.  Amazon.  Jeff Bezos kind of a surprise that happened during twig this week announced.  He's stepping down as CEO of Amazon.  He said in a letter that he will be spending more time with his money.  No, he'll be spending more time with his philanthropies and with his space firm  Blue Origin and the Washington Post.  I don't think related to that, but Marty Baron, the editor, is he the editor in  chief executive editor chief executive editor?  He's boss also stepping down at the end of the month.  Do you think Jeff Bezos is going to take over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's the richest man in the world or at least the second richest, depending on  where Elon is this week.  Amazon went out on a bang.  He went out on a bang with their best quarter ever, which I'm sure Jeff had  something to do with.  So the question I think a lot of people are by the way, they also went out with a  $62 million fine for stiffing delivery drivers on their tips.  Some people say that's really what's going on as Jeff sees the attacks on big  tech and like others like Larry Page and Sergey Brin, he's decided now's the  time to take his money and get out.

Start time: 1758.45
End time: 1780.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think I think you guys had it exactly right on twig.  This is it seems sudden, but it's actually been very gradual.  He hasn't actually been running Amazon completely for a long time.  And so the distance between where he was at as CEO and where he's going to be at  as the executive chairman is not that far of a distance.

Start time: 1780.90
End time: 1795.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one thing I've heard some people say is, oh, he's still running it from  executive chairman.  So he has some, you know, some distance from the point of view of regulators.  Do you think he's still going to be puppet master or do you think he hasn't  been in a long time?

Start time: 1796.26
End time: 1864.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He'll be puppet master on the big, big decisions.  But I think his successor is knows exactly how he thinks and is very going to  be very successful because it's the same kind of ruthless strategy that they've  had for everything.  But really, Amazon is a whole bunch of different businesses, each of which is  extremely complex.  And so he really hasn't been running the day to day of any of these businesses,  but he has been involved, of course, in the biggest decisions.  And he'll probably continue to be involved in those big decisions.  Obviously, his weight on the board is going to be gigantic.  So, you know, I think this makes a ton of sense for Jeff Bezos.  He's he's conquered the world.  And now he wants to, you know, I think he wants to do the ego stuff.  I mean, he he's getting his butt kicked in the space race with Elon Musk.  He doesn't like that.  He's going to want to spend a lot more time and money on on on Blue or on Blue  Origin. Yeah, Blue Origin.  Blue Origin. And he's going to want to do a bunch of other things like that as  well. So I think it makes perfect sense.  And I really I think that for very careful Amazon watchers, this is really  not that big of a surprise.

Start time: 1880.26
End time: 1927.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he owns a big chunk of Amazon.  Of course, he's going to care about the stockholder.  Right. Yeah.  I mean, you know, he's he's not going to step back completely on things like,  you know, big acquisitions.  But I think in terms of like the day to day and in terms of being the the  person who Congress calls to calls to the carpet, he can say, I'm not the  CEO. Get Andy and he'll talk.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I think also Andy Jassy is a very competent executive.  And, you know, I do wonder if there was an opportunity maybe to be CEO  somewhere else.  And this was part of the deal to to keep him there.  No specifics, but it is a pattern.  It would explain some of the timing.  Yeah. And, you know, why keep Jassy there?

Start time: 1928.53
End time: 1947.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. To keep Jassy.  Oh, interesting. Yeah.  A W.S. is a huge success.  Andy, Andy Jassy, the new CEO was running A W.S.  You could say it's a reward for doing such a good job with perhaps Amazon's  biggest division.  Or that's an interesting theory.  Maybe it was a way of keeping Jassy from going somewhere else.

End time: 1990.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I don't recall any any clashes or friction there, but Jassy was the  one who kind of really made it a made it a business.  I mean, I I've been writing about Amazon Web Services when it was the system  they use to put affiliate links on your website.  I mean, they call that Amazon Web Services.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 2064.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was he was part of a crew of of MBAs who were brought on to Amazon, really  their first big batch of non-technical hires.  And, you know, those are folks like Jason Kyler is now running Warner Media.  There's a lot of really talented people who kind of got in in that early crew.  And I think they brought a lot of discipline to Amazon.  One of the criticisms of Amazon back in the Amazon bomb days is like there wasn't a  focus on the profitability of individual items.  You know, there just wasn't a lot of discipline.  It was a lot of grow big, grow fast, which is probably the right move in those, you  know, land grab days of the early Internet.  But he's one of the people who brought rigor, I think, to Amazon.

Start time: 2064.86
End time: 2103.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's also some I mean, and maybe this is from Brad's book, but it's also from  Wall Street Journal article.  He was the along with Jeff Bezos, the guy who thought up AWS.  I mean, he's not some guy they brought in to run AWS.  He joined Amazon in 97 when it was still just selling books.  He was Bezos's technical.  This again, according to the Wall Street Journal, technical assistant in the early  two thousands.  He was in that famous meeting in Jeff's living room where the idea for AWS was  cooked up.  So he can take some ownership in that.

Start time: 2105.22
End time: 2124.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's got enough technical credibility.  I mean, Bezos is not a technologist.  No, he's an hedge funder.  Yeah.  So, you know, in terms of having that technical credibility, that kind of product  cred with Amazon's workforce, which is really important for recruiting and morale,  I think he's got it.  I would guess.

Start time: 2125.32
End time: 2193.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe somebody knows better than me, but that what you're what they're looking  for at Amazon is not necessarily technical ability.  You can hire engineers.  It's that strategic thinking that Bezos is so famous for.  I mean, the very concept of Amazon is somewhat brilliant.  Apparently, when he was a hedge fund manager, he was trying to think of, well,  what's a business that the Internet is going to completely explode?  And he this was a I've read this in an interview or maybe it was in Brad Stone's  The Everything Store.  He said no, I was a speech he gave Ben Thompson refers to it on Stratecary,  actually, was a speech he gave in 1997 or 98.  He said.  I the biggest bookstore in the world, physical brick and mortar bookstore in the  world can only have a few hundred thousand volumes.  There are two and a half million books in the world.  This is one business only that can only be done right on the on the Internet.  And it was that insight, that strategic insight.

I was looking for the first best product.  I chose books for lots of different reasons, but one primary reason, and that is  that there are more items in the book space than there are items in any other  category by far.  There are over three million different books worldwide in all languages.  The number two product category in that regard is music.  There are about 300000 active music CDs.

Transcript:  The other thing Bezos came up with and it's not a completely new concept, but I think  he really you know, he really maximized it is the flywheel.  And that's the idea.  Yes.  You have a business that feeds another business.  And Amazon Web Services is part of that Amazon Prime.  All of these things don't exist in a in a vacuum.  This is the famous Bezos napkin diagram as as illustrated by Ben Thompson in his

Start time: 2386.22
End time: 2396.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2399.08
End time: 2429.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, with Prime, it's that you've got this this user base and you can add things.  You can add video.  You can add audio.  You know, you can add music and it makes the subscription more valuable.  It makes people more likely to get it and to not cancel it.  And that in turn funds all these new businesses.  So I think Amazon's such a mighty flywheel now that Bezos probably feels like he can  step back and work on other things.

Start time: 2430.32
End time: 2466.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just not it's not just other businesses as well.  The heft of Amazon and the number of products that they move through have to be delivered  has given Amazon the power to force all delivery systems to deliver overnight.  And so I think that's the biggest reason why people buy things on Amazon.  They know that Amazon has a credit card in their address already on file.  It's like a one click thing and they know they're going to get it tomorrow.  That that's killer.  And who else can do that?  I mean, when I think about buying something that's not on Amazon, I thought, well, this  could take two weeks.

Transcript:  Mike, we've done research with newspapers that have commerce offerings and media that  have and they've found without a doubt that a prime logo available for you know today  is a huge driver of sales.  If you don't have it, it's a huge depression.  Really?  Oh, how interesting.  Yeah.  And so what the funny thing is for media, if you want audience, you're stuck with Google.  If you want to advertise or Facebook, if you want to advertise, you're stuck with Google.  If you want to do commerce, you're stuck with Amazon.  That's why they get resentful because they never built this stuff on their own and they're  and they're and they're stuck with the big guys.

Transcript:  It might be an interesting opportunity for Amazon right now as Google steps back from  steps back from Stadia a little bit.  They closed down their independent game design studio, which has two effects.  One means there won't be any original games for Stadia from Google, which is probably  minor, even though they did hire Jade Raymond from EA, the creator of Assassin's Creed.  I mean, they hired a really talented group of people and they're all back on the street.  But it also the second impact is it shakes people because they've seen Google cancel  things before and probably given there's a lot of competition for Stadia gives people  second thoughts about subscribing to Stadia, especially when Amazon is one of the companies  competing against Stadia.  And they asked Andy Jassy how important gaming is to Amazon.  And he doubled down.  He said, really?  Yeah.  He said, we are committed to making video games.  This after a Bloomberg profile of Amazon's game platform.  Responding to Bloomberg report about turmoil in the gaming division, Andy Jassy told the  staff he sees a bright future ahead.  And I imagine Google's stumble with Stadia probably informed some of that as well.

Start time: 2589.26
End time: 2600.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  video.  Right.  Yeah.  And so and so but but I think that, you know, what's very clear over that we've learned  over the last 10 to 15 years is Amazon is so good at entering new markets, they almost  always hit it out of the park.  And when they do enter one, they really know what they're doing.  Unlike Google, which, you know, throw something against the wall.  If it sticks, it usually doesn't stick.  And then they they close it.  Amazon, you know, if they get into game development, it's they're going to be in it for the long  term.  They're not going to.

I mean, back in 2012, I was writing stories about what a mess it was, how they were trying  to recruit people from Zynga of all.  Oh, no, no.  And couldn't get them.  I couldn't get them, which tells you something.  I mean, this Bloomberg article is reflects a state of affairs that's been going on for  almost a decade.  And Andy Jassy, you know, clearly feel some loyalty to this guy that he put in charge,  Mike Frisini of Amazon Game Studio.  But they have not had a strategy.  They have not had a hit.  I think, you know, I think Jassy's ascension would be a great time for them to say, you  know, to reshuffle the ranks and move this Mike Frisini guy out.  I think it is time.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The headline from Jason Schreier and Priya Anand at Bloomberg, Amazon can make just about  anything except a good video game.  Video games hard.  It's a very weird business.  It's not anything like movie, movie studios or anything else Amazon might have tried their  hand at.  Although let's not forget, Amazon does have a very famous failure in another tricky category,  the Fire Phone.  Yeah.  But this is what this is what Bezos said.  It actually says it.  It's on every shareholder letter.  Ben Thompson called it out.  We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability  of gaining market leadership advances or advantages.  Some of these investments will pay off.  Others will not.  And we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.

Transcript:  Yeah, because there's some interesting rumors from the information and Bloomberg about Apple  in all of that.  Let me take a little break.  Boy, you guys are smart.  I'm having fun with this one.  Thank you so much for joining us, Owen.  I hope you will make this a regular stop now, because it's great to have you not just when  there's a Super Bowl on.

Transcript:  Oh, and Tom, you know, in past years, we've actually had Europeans on Super Bowl Sunday  for that very reason.  But even now, you can't even get Europeans anymore.  So we had to get Owen Thomas, business editor at the San Francisco Chronicle, but a longtime  chronicler of what's going on in tech.  It's great to have you here.  Jeff Jarvis, I don't need to introduce him from Buzz Machine dot com, our regular host  on This Week in Google and Mike Elgin, longtime friend of twit, former news director, now  traveling the world from his home in San Jose.  I'm sorry.  It's good.  You're going to get out there.  Maybe we'll meet in Barbados.  I'll convince Amira.  We've got to go to Barbados.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Oh, that would be the beach.  Let me talk about Zip Recruiter, our sponsor, a fantastic place to go to hire your employees.  If you are in a position now to be hiring, first of all, God bless you.  We need more companies like you in America right now.  But I think the time is rapidly coming when we're going to start to get back to work,  get back to business.  And I want you to think about when it's time to hire, I want you to think about Zip Recruiter.  You know, companies are starting to figure out how we can survive in this epidemic from  working remotely to pivoting their business models to moving to Barbados.  Performing art companies are streaming.  Right.  We've seen Broadway.  We've seen opera streaming, symphony concerts.  Clothing companies are making N95 masks and hospital gowns.  Our liquor distillery down the street is making hand sanitizer, Griffo.  I like their hand sanitizer because it smells like whiskey.  It's good.  Brands are spending more on e-commerce advertising because I think online sales are going to  be coming back big time.  Amazon's results.  So hiring is coming back.  And if you are in charge of hiring, you're probably thinking about this with a little  trepidation because it's hard work.  Hiring means you're going to be pestered, pelted with phone calls, emails to your inbox  unless, unless you do Zip Recruiter.  Zip Recruiter makes hiring faster and easier.  I want you to go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  You can try it free.  Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate within the  first day.  That's because they use technology to match prospective employees with your job.  It also makes it really easy.  All of the applications come into the Zip Recruiter interface.  The resumes are reformatted so you can scan them easily.  You can use screening questions, true, false, multiple choice, even essay to eliminate people  who don't fit.  They'll help you narrow down the right candidates fast.  It makes it the easiest way to hire.  We know that because we have used Zip Recruiter for years to hire.  I remember when we lost our bookkeeper and poor Lisa who will do it if we don't have  somebody doing it was depressed.  She said, I'm going to have to do the bookkeeping in addition to everything else.  I said, Zip Recruiter just posted.  It was breakfast by lunchtime.  Before lunchtime she started getting, oh, this, oh, this candidate's really good.  This one's really good.  This was literally three or four really qualified candidates within an hour or two.  Now, I can't promise you that, but 80% of employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a  great candidate within the first day.  Find out for yourself.  Right now, try Zip Recruiter free.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  Thank you, Zip Recruiter, for helping us, helping Lisa.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  And thank you for helping us by using that special address.  ZipRecruiter.com slash TWIT for twit.  Let Zip Recruiter take the tough job of hiring.  Qualified candidates, off your plate.  ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.  Oh, you brought up something I thought, oh, this would be a great subject for our next,  oh, augmented reality.  So Bloomberg and the Information, both publishing the most details yet we've seen about glasses  coming from Apple.  And this was an information exclusive.  New mixed reality headset details, swappable headbands, eye tracking.  Mark Gurman also had a lot of details.  At this point, I think it has to be kind of at least somewhat true.  They're saying $3,000, at least that's the price Apple is discussing.  They're also saying...  It makes Google Glass look like a good piece.  I know.  You can get two pairs of glass.  Don't tempt me.  I don't want to make that mistake again.  So these are, it's interesting, these are mixed reality, at least according, again,  this is all rumors.  And I should also point out, they're probably, these prototypes probably do exist in the  Apple labs.  We've heard enough about it.  But that doesn't mean Apple will ever come to market with it.  Apple prototypes a lot of things.  They're always looking for the next big thing.  They need to find another iPhone.  But I think this makes kind of sense.  Tim Cook has said many, many times in analyst calls and speeches, augmented reality, augmented reality.  He really thinks it's the next big thing.  The rumor is this device has 12 cameras.  It has a accompanying thimble that you put on your finger.  The cameras recognize motion.  You can use your fingers.  They also show you the outside world.  So that's why this is not a virtual reality.  You're not sealed in.  But you see the world around you as well as superimposed information.  Dual 8K screens, the best I've seen from anybody, including Oculus, is 4K.  So this is a lot higher resolution.  That's a good thing, by the way, because you're only a few inches away from those screens.  You want to make them look good.  Mike, go ahead.

Start time: 3164.60
End time: 3201.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I talked to Alex Heath, who got the scoop for the information about 45 minutes after this went live.  And so the thing to keep in mind is that there are variations in the prototype you saw.  So, for example, the most cameras were 14.  Wow.  Most of the prototypes had at least a dozen.  So the 8K screens is not 100% certain that that's what it's going to be.  There's good reasons for that.  That's expensive and it drains battery really fast.

Start time: 3203.20
End time: 3218.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's going to be an issue, too.  In fact, the early prototypes we heard, I don't know if Alex talked about this, the early prototypes we heard made your neck strain because they were so heavy that it would push your head down.  That's not good.  What else did Alex tell you?

Start time: 3218.64
End time: 3274.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the other thing that we were sort of going back and forth about was the fact that the because they saw a very high res render and they were a little bit more expensive.  They saw a very high res render and they were allowed by the source to do a cartoonish low res version.  Oh, yes.  But but the render they saw did not have a top strap.  Now, typically, VR glasses that are heavy have a strap across the top of your head to help support the weight, whereas this does not, which suggests maybe it's pretty light.  Another thing that's really interesting about this is that you talk about all those cameras.  Some of them are for looking at the outside world for augmented reality and mixed reality.  Some of them are pointed at your eye gaze.  So the 8K display, you're not looking, you're not getting 16K coming at your face.  What you're getting is high res where you're looking and low res where you're not looking.  Well, that makes sense.

Start time: 3274.60

Transcript:  That's kind of how your eyes work.  There's only a very narrow cone of acuity and almost everything else is very fuzzy.

Start time: 3282.28
End time: 3350.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And so this is called foveated rendering and the trade.  That's how the fovea works.  That's right.  Yeah.  And so the other thing that's very interesting and you hit upon it, whereas these are these are set up for virtual reality.  And Apple has been very negative about virtual reality in the past and very, very, very positive about augmented reality.  So I think there's a pretty good chance that they're not going to be super into virtual reality,  that these glasses are going to be used for augmented reality, constantly showing you what's in the real world.  Again, with mixed reality, it's going to combine virtual and augmented reality and also 360 video, which these will be great for.  But I think I think what we can look forward to is a transition from sort of the precursor to augmented reality, which currently exists in the iPad and the iPhone.  There's all kinds of development going on with with AR, all kinds of apps available for AR.  This is going to transition to these high end glasses.  In fact, there's some speculation this may be a kind of developers version to get the developers going.

Transcript:  It doesn't seem it doesn't seem like there's anything really happening, but there might be an opening.  I mean, people are, you know, to the extent that it launched into this kind of feeling of Facebook fatigue, like all of that is.

Start time: 3434.66
End time: 3445.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Moran was at Facebook and path originally was only 50 friends and then it expanded to what, 150.  But it was like a very limited Facebook and more private Facebook.  Right.

Start time: 3446.52
End time: 3458.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one of the things that had going for it is that Facebook's mobile app was pretty bad at the time.  Right.  And path was all mobile.  I love to watch.  You know, I don't think someone will have that window again.

Start time: 3458.40
End time: 3492.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think it bears to to since we brought up Google Glass, you have to point out the major difference besides the quality and all that stuff.  Google Glass was a heads up display.  So right.  The so you move your head.  The little screen that's floating in front of you moves as well with your head.  There's it's not anchored in any reality other than possibly proximity.  So it could bring up content if you're like in a room or whatever.  Whereas the Apple glasses we didn't mention, I don't think it has LIDAR so it can map 3D spaces in front of you.

Start time: 3492.93
End time: 3498.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3499.28
End time: 3507.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the way I would express that is that those devices have it because their glasses are going to have it.  So this is part of the sort of getting the world ready for this.

Start time: 3507.28
End time: 3523.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is also how Apple works, which is they slowly introduce features into other products to perfect them and then they can go to the next level.  In fact, it's widely considered that the the Apple Silicon, which they originally put in the iPhone and the iPad that in the Macintosh is is also critical to this.  Can I tell you what I think?

Start time: 3525.02
End time: 3553.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I tell you what I think is going to be the killer app for these this this platform?  Apple has something called Bionic Virtual Meeting Room technology, which they patented.  And so picture picture, you can have a meeting and you don't want to do another zoom call.  So you put on these goggles and the other people in the meeting are represented by Memoji avatar avatars that are 3D holographic and in the room that you're in.  So they're sitting around in your space physically.

Transcript:  Well, the other part of this news is that Apple is targeting 2025.  By the way, these glasses are targeted for next year.  But the light version, where you're actually looking through physical glass instead of looking at an 8K monitor for each eye, is 2025.  That's our target.

Start time: 3679.20
End time: 3705.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it'll be much more than that.  It'll be like the augmented reality where 3D objects are anchored in space, like HoloLens or whatever.  And it'll be very, very high tech.  But we're talking three, four or five years where even the first versions of these hit.  But when they do hit, this is the thing that's going to replace smartphones as the main computing device that people use.  Clearly what Apple thinks.  Yes.

Start time: 3706.90
End time: 3749.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good news for Apple is that they're making another big bet on hardware that I think is going to be much smarter in the long run.  And that's AirPods.  And I think AirPods are actually going to be the thing that augments reality far more than any of this video, you know, this video vision dependent hardware.  Because I mean, right now you can right now you can have Siri read your text messages to you while you're listening to something and do something else.  And I think if you think about building on that experience where it's not interruptive, then, you know, I just think there's a lot more there's a lot more room for for growth there in audio.

Start time: 3750.24
End time: 3819.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but in the augmented reality space, you're going to get 100 percent of what you get through earbuds because you're going to have the audio.  You're going to have haptics.  So there's actually going to be an element of haptic.  There's haptics in this prototype, by the way, and you're going to get the visuals as well.  So in terms of turn by turn directions, yes, you can have it talk to you, but you are going to want to see those arrows floating in space telling you where to go for children's applications.  They're going to want their Disney characters dancing all over the house for, you know, whenever you're moving around in the world, you just want information popping up and all this kind of stuff.  I think that the I think you're right that augmented reality is going to be super, super powerful, especially as the AI gets better.  But but but I do think that the way to look at Apple's augmented reality and virtual reality mixed reality project is that it will combine the best of the iPhone, the Apple Watch and the Air Pods and all the things that you can do with those devices into a single interface with the addition of holographic video.  So it's really all those things coming together, I think.

Start time: 3821.61
End time: 3836.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're right, Owen, that the audio is going to be a big part of this and spatial audio.  Clearly, that's what they're going for.  But couldn't it also be a technology like LIDAR that they're developing for down the road, a killer product that would include all of the above?

Start time: 3837.34
End time: 3865.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think I think that they're going to have to create a lot of contextual technologies so that they know where you are and what you're doing at a given time.  And then they prompt you to display something and they're going to take that strip away the video part that requires a lot of hardware.  Put that into the audio product and make that super smart, super helpful, the right information at the right time in your ear and you know, and abandon the video hardware.

Start time: 3865.60
End time: 3886.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's one other thing that might confirm this, which is that Apple clearly cares about health.  The Apple Watch turns out to be a health device as much as anything else.  And an in-ear piece of hardware has all sorts of access to health information that even a watch doesn't have access to.  So we fit in with that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think the glasses, the glasses we're getting to in five years will be almost as light as anybody's plastic prescription glasses.  Right.  They'll be great on a treadmill.  But I think that the larger point is that we're really talking about timing because all user interfaces in the entire history of user interfaces have always gone toward having the computers and the technology work harder so that the human,  to match up with human nature and human expectations.  Human beings are visual.  The idea of having 100 percent of the sort of augmented content coming in to be interpreted through language is awesome.  I would love it.  But I think that it's even more awesome for human nature to have a visual representation of things as they're running around.  And I really think that they're going to be sports versions, sunglass versions, lots and lots of versions.  And I also think that it's going to be so powerful that people with perfect vision will start wearing glasses just so they can get it.

It's, you know, it's just outpaces everything you've ever done before.  There has to be intense pressure from stakeholders and customers, frankly, to do the next big thing.  Right, Owen?  I think that that's a lot of what these rumors we're seeing is about is that Apple is striving mightily, spending a lot of its big multi billion,  hundred billion dollar cash hoard on trying to find the next big thing.

Start time: 4022.96
End time: 4031.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know what?  I wouldn't buy a car Apple manufactured.  It would be a brand.  I mean, it's not the brand.  So here's the reason Kia.  And I think this is what Owen's about to say.  And by the way, this is a rumor that comes out of a Korean site.  This is, you know, as sketch a rumor as you can get, although it kind of follows on a Hyundai, which is Kia's parent company,  announcing foolishly that they were talking to Apple.  Shortly, I'm sure anybody who saw this, I certainly didn't thought that was strategically stupid.  And they immediately retracted it within an hour.  Oh, no, I'm sure Apple's talking to a lot of people.  I'm sure they got a call from Cupertino saying, hey, if you want to do business with us, here's lesson number one.  Shut the hell up.  Nevertheless, Kia Hyundai have a kind of mature electric platform that's fairly well known.  They've been doing electric cars for a while.  You need a manufacturing partner.  Like you said, Owen.  True, true.  And, you know, if according to the rumor, Apple wants to make 100,000 vehicles per year when they release this in three years,  you're going to need somebody like Kia who knows how to do that.  It took Tesla quite a while to ramp up to that size.  Go ahead, Owen. I'm sorry.

Transcript:  Oh, also Ford, Toyota, General Motors, like they've got too much ego.  They're busy.  Even if they had spare manufacturing capacity, they would not want to cede the ground to Apple.  Think about when Apple got into the iPhone.  Oh, Verizon said, no way.  Yeah, they partnered with Singular.  It wasn't even AT&T.  It was like the also-ran of wireless companies.  That's why it's so good to have your historic perspective here.  Singular was willing to do what Apple wanted.  And I think whoever ends up making an Apple car, if there really is going to be an Apple car,  is going to be someone who is willing to cede ground to Apple.

Transcript:  Kia also has a factory in Georgia, the United States, not Tbilisi.  So that's a big selling point these days for Apple.  So they could make these cars in the U.S.  It would probably be, I'm sure, it would be electric.  The question is, would they also be self-driving?  Or how self-driving they would be?

Start time: 4173.26
End time: 4285.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there'll be a self-driving as every other car,  which the whole industry is going towards self-driving gradually.  So they'll be right along their width there.  But I think that Apple, if people are still confused about why Apple will get in the car industry,  I think Apple understands that in the future, a car will be primarily a content consumption experience.  The transportation part of it is kind of a commodity.  So who cares? Your body is going to be shuffled around. It's no big deal.  Cars resemble each other so much these days in terms of their internals and their functionality.  All that stuff is commodity.  What isn't commodity is the experience, the user experience, the customer experience,  the content consumption experience, why your body is being moved around.  And so I think that people have a hard time getting their head around that reality.  But once you accept that, that once you're in a self-driving car or mostly self-driving car,  your mind is on other things besides watching the road, right?  So you're going to be doing VR experiences.  You're going to be listening to music, watching concerts, chatting with people in HD video and all that kind of stuff.  Apple is not going to cede 30% of people's content consumption life by not being in the cars.  They're going to make sure they're going to make sure they're in the cars.  Neither will Google or Amazon or any of them. Yeah.  Exactly. And so I think that's the key insight that tells us why they're getting in the car business  and also why it's conceivable that they would partner with a company like Kia,  which is a subsidiary, I think, of Hyundai.  It doesn't matter as long as you have batteries that work and you have the factory capacity and all that kind of stuff.  It doesn't matter who the car maker is.

It's said that the railways would have done better if they'd understand that they weren't in the railway business.  They were in the transportation business.  Is it safe to say Apple's core business is experiences, is delivering experiences?

Transcript:  Apple is in the content business.  So half of their, well, not half, most of their business is in the content consumption experience business.  And the minority of their business is in the content creation business.  That's the way I think is a good way to understand Apple.  Or experiences is another way to put it.  It's about they're in the content business.

Start time: 4418.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their hardware facilitates, brings you the content, those experiences.  And it makes perfect sense if they're going to develop a car.  It's a content vehicle.  It's a phone with wheels.  Yeah.  Why Hyundai unveiled, in fact, this is Roberto Baldwin writing.  We've got to get Roberto back on the show.  He now works at Car and Driver.  Hyundai unveiled in December their EV platform.  They plan to have 23 global electric vehicles by 2025.  The platform, which is called EGMP and it's Hyundai and Kia, can deliver as much as 600 horsepower,  which means they can do high performance as well as get around cars.  They're targeting 310 miles of range.  This is a competitive, they call this in the business sled that you can build a car on that goes right up against what GM's doing.  In fact, one of the things you're going to see on the Super Bowl, if we ever get to watch it today,  is GM basically making the announcement that they are turning into an electric vehicle company.  They announced this at CES.  You'll also see Audi responding to the Will Ferrell commercial.  I can't wait to see both of those.  So it's pretty clear that the big three automakers, I'm next week going to take a delivery of an electric Mustang.  At last!  Finally, the big three automakers are clearly seeing the future as electric.  Apple is, and it makes perfect sense that Apple would go with somebody who has a platform, manufacturing ability, a factory in the US.  Even if this rumor is wrong and it's kind of coming from a less than reliable source,  it makes so much sense that I think it's probably true.

Transcript:  Well, I hope you will consider making this your podcast in future.  It's great to have all three of you.  Our show today brought to you by Barracuda.  Boy, this is the time for Barracuda.  Barracuda is perhaps one of the best known enterprise security companies in the world.  They do a great job.  They also do a lot.  In fact, if you go to their website, Barracuda.com slash twit, read the blog.  They do a lot of research.  And one of the things they've noticed is that the number one way to target companies these days is email, email, email, email.  Hackers are always looking for the weakest link in your security, and it's almost always your email security.  What does that mean?  Well, they can inject malware into your network.  They can spearfish you.  They can do account takeover, conversation hijacking.  In fact, Barracuda has identified 13 types of email threats.  And honestly, every one of these is a risk for you.  You want to know, are you effectively protected against all 13 threat types?  And that's where Barracuda's new threat analyzer tool comes in.  This is something free you can do right now.  You've got to know if you're not fully protected in all 13 of these vectors, cyber crooks are going to figure it out and they're going to hit you.  That's literally what they spend their time on.  That's their full time job.  And when they find that gap in your security, they just choose the right threat type.  They customize it.  Boom.  You are potentially losing millions of dollars.  Your reputation in the market.  It's a dangerous place out there.  And here's where it gets hard with hundreds of highly targeted personalized threat variants emerging every single day with many different kinds of on prem and cloud based email systems.  It can be really challenging to figure out where you are vulnerable.  OK, this is the pitch.  Go to barracuda.com slash twit.  It's a very simple.  We were just showing it on the screen.  If you're watching the video, multiple choice quiz about your email security setup, they call it the Barracuda threat analyzer in two minutes.  Roughly, you can generate a custom report telling you which threat types you are most vulnerable to.  And of course, look, Barracuda sells protection.  They're going to give you great recommendations in every area and what you can do to protect yourself against your particular vulnerabilities.  This is free.  It's easy to use.  No pressure.  Barracuda's December spearfishing report founded 12 percent of all spearfishing attacks are business email compromise.  That's up from seven percent the year before.  These attacks are growing.  Why?  Because they work.  According to the FBI's most recent Internet crime report, business email compromise led to over three point five billion dollars in losses last year.  The government of Puerto Rico lost two point six million dollars in one attack.  If you watch Shark Tank, you know Barbara Corcoran.  Her employees were paid a fake invoice, a four hundred thousand dollar invoice that came in through the mail.  They call it email impersonation.  It looked like a vendor.  They paid it.  Unfortunately, they found out they recovered the money.  Not so lucky.  The independent school district in Texas made fraudulent payments over a whole month of more than two point three million dollars.  I shouldn't laugh.  That's that's horrible.  That's horrific.  Does your email security protect against that and all the other attacks?  Barracuda threat analyzer.  Try it today.  It's free.  Takes a couple of minutes.  You'll get a full report showing exactly what you need to do to secure your email.  Barracuda threat analyzer.  Just take a couple of minutes at Barracuda dot com slash twit.

And of course, thank you for supporting the show by going to that address.  Barracuda dot com slash twit.  Let's see.  We've covered a lot of territory here.  Have I run out of stories?  Never.  Never.  We did.  We covered a lot of stories, though, with little sides like yours, Jeff.

It'll just stop.  I don't.  Google's threatening to leave Australia.  In fact, Microsoft jumped on that threat.  Google's manager for Australia testified, as you probably know, if you watch our shows, the Australian legislature is considering charging Google for the next year.  Google says you do that.  We're leaving.  Microsoft actually had a meeting on Monday with the prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, saying, you know, Bing is really good.  I asked on Wednesday, remember this, Jeff, I said, well, who would Australians blame for the fact that they're going to leave Australia?  You know, Bing is really good.  I asked on Wednesday.  Remember this, Jeff, I said, well, who would Australians blame?  Would they blame Google or would they blame the legislature if all of a sudden Google search disappeared and a surprise?  I got a few emails from Australians who said, you know what?  We would we would blame Google.

And, you know, when you go onto Google News itself, there are no there are no ads.  So, you know, getting getting from the point of Google shows snippets of news to Google makes money is really quite a leap.  And I'm not quite sure how the Australian legislature is kind of justifying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't matter because we're told to do what they did it.  Well, they haven't done it yet.  And the legislation is going through now.  You think it'll pass?  Part of the answer to your question, Nolan, is that in the original legislation, the platforms were forced to negotiate with the publishers.  If they couldn't reach agreement, they'd go to my uncle Vinnie, the arbitrator, and they'd meet over the barbie and the arbitrator would just dictate something.  And Google said from the beginning, this is ridiculous.  It's ridiculous. In any in any normal market, the publishers would be paying us because we send tremendous value to the publishers.  But all you're allowing to happen here is that we have to pay the publishers.  So the policy. Oh, OK. OK. You can negotiate that, too.  That's OK. That's the debate, though.  I'm doing that. That's the debate, though. Which way does the value flow?

End time: 5274.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to see the search results. What's also offensive about this, and we all know this from our industry, is that is that if newspapers had to pay for the sources of their content, they'd go bankrupt.  You know, I can't talk. You know, if Owen called me, no one wouldn't call me because he knows better.  But if he called me to do a story and I said, oh, my rate is. Yeah. Hang up the phone. Yeah. Right. Right.  And so I did. I did a post. We talked about this on Twig. I from doing a book on the Gutenberg age.  And as part of the research, I came across this fascinating thing I didn't realize is that newspapers from the beginning in the U.S. employed people they called scissors editors and newspapers under the Postal Act of 1792 were allowed to send to exchange newspapers with each other for free for free.  And the and the policy decision here was to spread news. It was a good thing. And the newspaper editors were all happy with it.  They took and they gave and it was OK. The only thing that pissed them off was if they didn't get credit.  But that was it. Otherwise, they shared back and forth. And this is the basis of the entire industry.  Every newspaper reporter reads other newspapers and says, oh, it's a story idea. I think I'll take that.  And the hot news doctrine doesn't exist. So you can do that under the under copyright.  And they copy each other all the time. BuzzFeed had the story of the two colored dress.  How did suddenly five thousand media outlets around the world have the same story because they rewrote BuzzFeed?

End time: 5343.20

And then before that, news ballads were distributed by singers coming into town singing the news ballad about the witch having burned the town.  That's like the town crier. Yeah.  And then you buy the song so you can sing it with your buddies in the bar or at home.

Transcript:  Here's why I thought it must be fictionalized because ten cents. That's way too much money.  That's a lot of money.  If a movie cost a nickel in 1920, I don't think people are paying ten cents 60 years earlier to hear Tom Hanks read the news.

Transcript:  Penny, Max. Penny. Yeah, maybe a penny.  Jeff, can I throw a wrench in here?  How does this shift to subscription news change the equation?  I mean, does that does that rebalance things with publishers at all?

Start time: 5430.53
End time: 5495.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think so because it's all about conversion.  Right. Don't you know, I'm sure you hear that all the time.  The reason The New York Times can get as many as seven million digital subscribers to news and food and crosswords is because it has 60 million on the Web and a frequent user, a frequent user of The New York Times.  They had to change that when they started the paywall.  It used to be that they'd get you ten pages a month to say, hey, you should pay up and nobody hit it.  Ten a month a month.  So the frequency of use is very low so that if you can get any sampling whatsoever, you're better off.  And so they're going to give up sampling here.  The other thing that interests me in this story is so Google's right to pull out Google out of Australia.  Facebook is threatening to say we're going to disallow both publishers and users from putting news on Facebook.  What fascinates me about that is a bet Facebook is half wishing this happens.  And then they kind of say, good pets and parties.  That's it. This controversy stuff.  God, we're the happy place again.

Transcript:  Five.  There's a lot of data on this now.  And if you know, when Google started to subscribe with Google, which they did in partnership with newspapers, Google got smart about this.  And and and and subscribe.  We started working with product people, the newspapers, the FTS on presentation early on and the FT working with Google data.  So Google had data about FT zero free ads.  Free. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  You have to do.  They don't. What the FT does is that they meter it based on what they know about you from their own data.  And we're talking about the financial times.

Transcript:  They're too smart.  But that was Google helped them do that.  Well, I have to say, and this is again, important data point for Australian legislators.  That's exactly how I know what my paywall limits are on all of these things, because I use Google News and I get sent to these local articles.  I haven't bought the Chronicle yet, Owen, but I will now.  But I did buy the Santa Rosa newspaper and the Petaluma newspaper.  And I got to them through Google News.  So I think Google is definitely generating traffic and revenue.  But here's the thing about it, Owen.

Transcript:  So let's say that that that that the law passes and Google actually leaves Murdoch's in better shape than ever because Murdoch has the brands.  He has half the media in Australia.  Doesn't hurt him.  Didn't hurt him in the least.  In fact, you try to start a new brand.  Good luck.  Australia, you're doomed.  You're doing I had a tiff with the head of the Australian Guardian the last couple of days on Twitter because the Guardian to Mike and I love the Guardian.  I've worked with the Guardian.  I've written for the Guardian.  I'm ashamed of the Guardian that they are in league with the devil Murdoch on this.  And he goes, well, I don't understand.  And Sir Tim Berners-Lee testified about the damage this will do to the entire Internet, especially the Web he invented.  And this Guardian biz guy said, well, fine.  He knows things about the Web.  He doesn't know anything about competitive policy.  Jesus.  He just flicked away.  The guy who really understands the Web because he invented it.  Well, and a nihilistic, cynical business is is tying in with Murdoch on this legislation and Murdoch also.  Let's not forget.  I know I rail about Murdoch on Twig.  That's all I do.  So I only have so many spiel.  So I'll do it here, too.  But he the ruin of Western democracy in the English speaking world is also wants to destroy the Internet.  And that sounds kind of emotional, but it's true.  He is he's shot against it in every single opportunity because he sees it as competition.  He to Owen's point, he believes in a firm concrete paywall.  He doesn't want any of this Internet junk.  And that's his business model.  And the Times of London has one hundred sixty thousand subscribers.  The New York Times has seven million.  The difference is Murdoch's religion.

Transcript:  We're seeing a lot of that.  That's one of the complaints against the new California Privacy Act was that Facebook has enough money to adhere to this law.  So they love the law because it would regulatory capture.  It's regulatory capture would only hurt the little guys, not the big guys.  I want to take a little bit of a break.  And then I'm if you seem to have saved the high blood pressure stories for last.  But if you really want to get upset, let's talk about Amy Klobuchar and.  And her new attack on Section 230.  It's the Democrats turn there also.  She's also got a new antitrust bill.  She's proposing neither of one of these has yet been got out of committee.  But I think it'll be very interesting to see what happens.  Meanwhile, I'm going to say, you know, soy un hombre hombre sincero.  I am an honest man. Is that right?  I'm learning. I'm learning from Babel.  I'm learning Spanish. I did French with Babel.  I love Babel is a great way to learn.  It's the number one best selling language learning app because it's fun.  Bienvenido.  Oh, I'm going to ruin my lesson.  I probably should stop right now.  Encantada.  It is the easiest way to learn with just Encantada.  Encantada. Isn't that a great one?  Encantada.

Transcript:  Yeah. And you already know German, but a great way to polish.  One of the things Babel does BABBEL.com.  And of course, I'm doing it on the phone.  I like to do a lesson when I get up and then I do a review when I go to bed.  So that way I'm kind of, you know, in just 15 minutes a day, I'm slowly learning a language.  But then as you get better and better, that gets harder and harder.  They even have and this is so cool.  They just introduced this live conversation groups that it's kind of like clubhouse in the language that you're learning.  So you can because that's the hardest thing is you learn the vocabulary, you learn the grammar.  But then you've got to do it in with people talking at real speed.  Native speakers, language lessons designed by humans.  Unlike the language classes you might have taken in high school, Babel designs their courses with real world conversations in mind.  It's very practical things you'll use in everyday life like and cantata or and cantata or hello, how are you?  And of course, building up to tourist languages like how can I book a room?  Or I'd like two more beers, please.  And then eventually you're really speaking in the language.  And as I said, you're you're going to be able to speak with native speakers in the real environment.  Other language learning apps use AI for their lessons plans at Babel.  Lessons are always created by real language experts.  They have 100 language experts on their team.  Their method has been scientifically proven to be effective.  I consider it so it's a great way to learn 14 languages right now.  Spanish, French, Italian, German and others.  Actually, with Spanish, you can either learn Spanish, Spanish or Latin American Spanish, which I'm learning the Latin Americans.  I think it's going to be more useful.  And then they have a speech recognition technology built in.  They use a very nice platform that helps you improve your pronunciation and accent.  And it's really good.  Babel's amazing right now.  In fact, Mike, you probably should use this as you travel around.  When you purchase a three month Babel subscription, you'll get an additional three months for free.  Six months, you can be pretty fluent in the language for the price of three.  Just go to Babel dot com.  Use the promo code.  B-A-B-B-E-L dot com promo code.  Tweet three extra months free.  Babel is language for life.  And I think everybody should learn a couple of extra languages.

Transcript:  You absolutely have to use something like Babel because everywhere you go in this world, everybody not only speaks English, they want to practice their English on you.

Transcript:  Well, and you know, I speak French pretty well.  Thank you, Babel.  And my experience has been, yeah, they'll speak English.  You can speak English anywhere.  But when you speak the language of the country you're in, it changes your experience.  You get a much more genuine experience.  It's a much better way to do it.  And frankly, nowadays, I mean, knowing Spanish in California is a must.  It really is very useful.  I use it all the time.  And all I can say is in cantado.

Transcript:  You know what?  It's funny because I have a friend.  She was learning French because she was going to France.  We met up with her in Paris.  I never had the heart to tell her her French was awful.  She should have used Babel.  Her pronunciation was not even close.  And she went into a store with Lisa and the lady wouldn't even talk to her.  She tried and tried.  And the lady was like offended that whatever it is you're speaking, it ain't my language.  So Lisa has learned a few phrases like, do you speak English?  I'm sorry I don't speak French.  And it worked out fine.  But I like speaking French, especially when I'm in France, I like to be able to speak French.  It's just courtesy to courtesy.

Transcript:  Mark Warner has introduced a new section to 30 reform bill.  Just briefly, I think everybody who listens knows because we talk about it a lot.  Section 230 is the section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which essentially what is it?  The twenty three words that created the Internet.  What is six?  Six. It's a set.  It's it's it's a beautiful in its minimalism.  But it essentially says that you are if you are Twitter or Facebook or Leo Laporte, you are a platform, not a publisher.  You cannot be held liable for the speech on your chat room, on your blog comments, on Facebook or Twitter.  And moderating them does not make you a publisher.  You you do not have the onus of being a publisher just because you moderate the content.  The fact that you could, in fact, quite quickly, anybody sues you for if somebody sues me for something, something somebody says in my chat room and people have threatened and I go to court.  All I have to say is, Your Honor, Section 230 protects me and it's summarily dismissed.  It's a real protection against those kinds of frivolous lawsuits.  And it makes it possible to have blog comments and Facebook and Twitter and a chat room and all of that.  So just quickly there.  And if you want to know more, there's a wonderful page on Section 230 on Tech dirt dot com that is it says you've been forwarded here because you're clueless about 230.  I think we should all send links to Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar and Maisie Hirono, the senators who are sponsoring the Safe Tech Act Safeguarding Fraud Exploitation Threats Extremism and Consumer Harms Act.  Masnick says is one of the worst Section 230 bills I've seen and we've seen some bad ones.  Really awful ones.  There's a lot of things bad.  For instance, it takes that defense that 230 provides against lawsuit from an affirmative defense to one to a defense to kind of like fair use.  So you would still have to go to court and you would have to defend yourself.  You'd have to pay a lawyer.  And then, yes, you know, it's the biggest, most consequential change, according to Masnick, is it takes the famous 26 words of the current law removes the protections entirely.  If money changes hands, in other words, advertising, and then it changes it from an immunity to a merely affirmative defense.  So I got that backwards.  It's not an affirmative defense.  Now it's an immunity.  It would become an affirmative defense.  But he says that it basically wipes out all of the benefits of 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So go ahead, Mike.  Let me just take a devil's advocacy.  And I've actually been dying to talk to Jeff about this for a long time.  But then I will sit back.

Start time: 6517.73
End time: 6518.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a question.  So let's start.

Start time: 6520.20
End time: 6575.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's start with a basic free speech trope.  OK, yelling fire in a crowded theater.  OK, if you do that, that's not protected speech because you're putting people in danger.  If somebody whispers to you that there's a fire in a theater and you say he said there's a fire to the whole theater, then the amplifier is the person liable.  Now, let's take this to Facebook.  I agree that just allowing somebody to publish something, a social network like Twitter or Facebook should not be held liable.  But if they amplify it, in other words, if a source of content that has 100 people subscribing says something and then Facebook's algorithms redirects it from the 100 people and sends it to a million people, should Facebook not be liable for that amplification?

Start time: 6577.03
End time: 6651.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me add a few things on this.  One is that there is a bill from Tom Malinowski, who happens to be my representative in New Jersey, that tries to do that, that tries to say if you amplify, is what you're going to get in trouble.  Everybody's trying to slice 230 like it's a bologna.  I'll take this slice off.  You take that slice off.  Right.  So Foster says that took off the child porn and sex trafficking slice.  Somebody wants to take off the amplification slice.  Somebody wants to take off this slice.  It's going to get sliced down to nut and honey.  But so there are variants of that.  But the problems then become a fewfold.  One, define what's bad.  Right.  What's the bad speech?  What's the problem?  We're going to litigate that like crazy.  So two, Mike Masnick himself said if this law passes, he has to shut down Tech Dirt because the harassment cost to you to then fight over these legal issues will be such that you will allow the victim to be able to do that.  It will be such that you will allow no one outside to do anything that might get you in trouble.  So I listened for the 87th time to Joe Scarborough.  I wake up at eight o'clock before eight o'clock in the morning, six o'clock in the morning.  I turn on the TV and there's Joe Scarborough yelling about Section 230.

Start time: 6652.54
End time: 6658.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to sue Facebook.  I want to sue Twitter.  Oh, really?  He's against 230.

Start time: 6658.20
End time: 6671.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew I didn't watch that show for a reason.  He voted for it.  So 230 was Ron Wyden's addition to the CDA.  Yes.  Very specifically to protect the Internet.  I mean, he knew exactly what he was doing.  No, I'd go even farther.

Start time: 6672.20
End time: 6765.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was even smarter than that, Leo.  It was brilliant legislation because it was to protect the public conversation.  That's a better way of putting it.  Because if you didn't have 230, you ended up with one of two extremes.  Either there's no public conversation because nobody wants to be liable or there's really, really crappy public conversation.  Everything is parlor because you don't want to moderate it because you get to become more liable.  It's all about liability.  So I made a video, by the way, to Joe Scarborough on YouTube, a little five minute video.  I put it up on the rundown and and he called.  I was credit.  He called.  Yeah.  And he said he said he's going to order Jeff Kossoff's book, which I recommend to you all, which is the 26 words that created the Internet.  I said, have on Jeff Kossoff, have on Mike Masnick, have on Daphne Keller and and and lawyers who really understand this stuff.  But please have someone on to explain this to you because the emotional aspect here is somebody should sue them.  Somebody should sue Facebook out of business.  Well, yeah, that may well happen.  And with you, when you sue Facebook and Twitter out of business, you also take with it Black Lives Matter and me too.  And you take with it the voices were never heard in mass media.  So mass media is delighted with this.  Murdoch would love this, too, by the way, because it gets rid of all of that cacophony that I would call democracy and they call noise.  That's the problem, Mike, is that is that you you buy by emotionally wanting to go after liability here for for for what reason?  For what end?  Just because you want to punish somebody.  That's what this is about.  And then it takes with it a lot of other things.

Start time: 6766.94
End time: 6779.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, personally, I think that the one of the reasons so there's been the great canceling or whatever you want to call it, where all the social networks got rid of all the QAnon people and got rid of Trump and got rid of all this stuff.  230 allows them to do very importantly.

Start time: 6781.52
End time: 6785.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why the right doesn't want 230 because 230 protected them in doing so.

Start time: 6786.80
End time: 6821.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My fear is I think people don't appreciate certain aspects of democracy or free speech.  One of the aspects of democracy people don't appreciate is that by having all everybody involved, they're they're inside the tent instead of outside trying to destroy the system.  And same thing with free speech.  You want everybody to be free to speak as as much as possible.  But I feel like the amplification, the automated amplification and the game of the ability to game the algorithms.  Right now.  Yeah, exactly.  Right now.  What are we doing? We're amplifying things right now.

Start time: 6821.63
End time: 6838.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So we're doing that.  That's what media has always done.  That's just what media has done for a long time.  It amplifies.  Emilio, the editor of The Chronicle, decides what to put in The Chronicle.  Oh, and the business editor decides what to put in the business section.  They amplify.  It's what media has always done.

Start time: 6839.20
End time: 6899.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A human does that, but a human is very difficult to game in the same way.  So you have this.  There's an industry called PR.  Don't you do that.  You have info wars and all these who are who are devoted to the project of figuring how to game algorithms while nobody's paying attention and have all these runaway things.  Then you have the Facebook recommendation engine.  You know, Facebook itself did a study to find out what the number one reason is, why people join extremist groups.  And the number one reason was Facebook was explicitly recommending those groups to people.  And then they got rid of, you know, said, OK, well, don't do anything about it.  Mark Zuckerberg himself personally said, don't don't take action on this.  Just let this keep happening.  Then they got caught and they changed it and all that stuff.  But my point is that I would love to see people be able to have the bubble of free speech to be much larger, to have more extreme content, but not have that content amplified and converting people into extremists.

Start time: 6899.30
End time: 6972.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other version of that, Mike, is like so then you end up with a world of billboards.  Then this notion that there is some kind of definition of neutrality out there where they're not allowed to select things on the basis of what they know about me.  Then all I have is a huge river of crap.  What Facebook does, in fact, do is try to find the things that I'm more interested in.  Now, that gets demonized like they made Jarvis into a radical.  He didn't use the screen like this.  It was only because of Facebook he does this.  Right. And that's the argument that's made.  Believe me, I've always done this.  So so it gets demonized.  But in fact, it's a service.  It's relevance.  Mass media was a one size fits all product.  We've lived there.  I've had that.  I don't think it's any damn good.  And the other problem here is that there is this presumption that, oh, my God, Facebook's successful.  It's awful.  Horrible things happen.  The numbers don't back that up.  The numbers, you know, the research doesn't back it up.  We're not in filter bubbles.  We're not as bad as it seems.  Now, what we do want for the platforms is data to researchers to understand what the impact is.  We need that.  And I will argue strengthlessly for that.  But we don't know right now.  And so there's a lot of emotional presumption that something must be done.  We must 230 is the cause of all of our ills.  Before 230, we were a great country.  We were racist at all.

I don't think that really took a chunk out of their earnings, though.  So I'm not sure if that's really going to be, you know, the thing that reigns them in.  It didn't.

I know Peter Thiel was publicly known to be gay in a very large circle.  We should put out as well.  So.  Yeah.  Which doesn't give me a special right to write about one's one sexual orientation.  But the thing I wrote back then was that people are people in Silicon Valley are being very  when I bring up this topic and it seems unenlightened to treat to treat gayness as something for  you know, for Bowdoin that we can't talk about when many people know, right, you know, that  Peter Thiel is gay.  Many people know that I'm gay.  You know, I don't need to broadcast it and say I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm out for it to be OK.  You know, I feel like coming out is something we do for.

All the history you bring and you bring that, I'm sure, difficult history.  But if you don't mind, talk for a minute about the chill, the legal chill that you live through  that your colleagues live through.

Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, to be clear, I left Gawker Media in 2009.  The the lawsuit was, I believe, six years later and we didn't learn, you know, no one  involved learned of Peter Thiel's involvement in funding the lawsuit.  It was a lawsuit by Hulk Hogan against it wasn't about to deal right now.  No, no, no. Yeah.  And he just funded.  Yeah. Peter Thiel used a strategy called litigation financing just to harm Gawker, not because  he was interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had no particular interest in Hulk Hogan except that that privacy lawsuit was a vehicle  for him. And I think it's you know, I think it's a very real chill.  You know, Gawker filed for bankruptcy because of particular quirks of Florida law and the  way that, you know, a decision basically had to be immediately paid out before an appeal  was heard. Wow.  And, you know, again, this was part of like a deliberate strategy to place the lawsuit  in Florida so that they could go down this go down this path.  And, you know, we think of the United States as having fairly media friendly laws, but  the, you know, the fact that, you know, a lawsuit like this can be pursued even, you  know, even though it was, you know, Gawker believed it could be overturned on appeal,  meaning, you know, meaning that, you know, the original decision was not sound.  It's it's scary. And, you know, let's go back to Mike Masnick talking about the legal  risk from overturning Section 230.  He's basically saying his website could not operate because, you know, because the legal  uncertainty is just too great.

I would just eliminate all other hosts.  No, that's really it's it's more than fanciful.  It is a chilling effect.  And and I'm actually thrilled that you're here on because that you you have direct  experience of exactly the kind of thing we're talking about.  And it put Gawker out of business.

A couple of really quick stories before we wrap things up.  This, I thought, fascinating.  Governor Sisolak of Nevada, Democrat, has announced a plan to launch  innovation zones in Nevada to jumpstart the state's economy by attracting  technology firms.  Among other things, the zone would permit a company with large areas of land like,  say, Tesla, which has the Gigafactory in Nevada, to form its own government  with the same authority as a county, including the ability to impose taxes,  form school districts and courts and provide government services.

But I wonder if that's really where we're headed.  This is, he said, tax benefits.  We'll just leave it at tax.  Yeah, exactly.  It's Larry Page's island.

Start time: 7429.28
End time: 7448.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  This is Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, proposed essentially a zone free of  regulations so that tech companies could kind of experiment and figure things out.  If you remember, Google had a floating barge at one point and people were wondering,  like, is that so they could take it out to sea?

We need to have other things.  I think Nevada is saying the casino industry may not last forever.  We need another way of generating some revenue.  We got a lot of desert.

Transcript:  What if we just?  I mean, it just, you know, I think self-driving cars is, you know, is a big real-world  illustration of this, where, you know, we've had a competition, kind of a race to the  bottom among states to see which, you know, which state can regulate them the least and  thereby attract testing.  Well, what did we get for that?  We got a, you know, a woman killed by a robot car in Arizona.  That's what they all do, the testing.  I think it's a tremendously, you know, it's a bad enough idea to have a situation where,  you know, states within this country, counties within states, like, compete with each  other to be, you know, to say who can who can be the most lax in a regulatory scene?

Start time: 7522.84
End time: 7535.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Devil's advocacy, how many people were killed by human driven cars?  Good point.  But I mean, the self-driving car thing is all about getting to a point where far fewer  people die in cars.  Yeah, true.

Start time: 7536.04
End time: 7553.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Mike, I think I think I'm going to agree with Owen on this one, because I think that  the problem was it wasn't a Google car that killed the person and the person was going  across the street.  But it was it was it was another company that was kind of rushing through this.  They found a place where they could rush better.  Right.  Google's taken a lot of care about this.  Uber has since left that category.

We've been going two hours.  The other story, 23andMe, this is everybody's worst nightmare is going public with aid  from Richard Branson.  They've got your genetic material and now they're going public, folks, with a SPAC.  What's a SPAC, Owen?  I had you on specifically to explain this.

Start time: 7581.10
End time: 7593.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A SPAC is a special purpose acquisition corporation.  We used to just call them blank check companies.  So this is a company that has literally no business.  It's just some money.

Start time: 7593.48
End time: 7596.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In this case, it's Richard Branson's VG Acquisition Corp.

Start time: 7596.65
End time: 7655.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  I think of it as like a big pot of money.  And according to the rules of the of the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange, it's  actually legal to take a company like this public.  You disclose to investors that, you know, we have a pot of money.  We're going to put it in a trust.  We're going to look for something to buy and then we're going to buy that business.  We're already public.  We're trading and we're going to match our ticker symbol together with their business.  And suddenly you've got a company.  How is that different from an IPO?  Well, one thing it does let you do is you can buy essentially earlier stage companies,  companies that might not be mature enough or like, you know, their financials might  not look quite right for a conventional Wall Street IPO process.  You know, on the other hand, you are putting, you know, you're still putting retail  investors at risk when, you know, when you buy into these companies.

Start time: 7655.20
End time: 7683.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also the privacy concern because now who owns the spit is going to be the  question. And by the way, I have not one but two vials of spit in the rack at 23 and me  because I bought some more.  The ticker symbol, which should be spit, honest, but it's OK.  It's me, M.E. and it will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  So they've gone public without really going public.  It's fascinating. I don't understand.

Start time: 7683.76
End time: 7691.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Owen, in a case like this, would they have gotten more if they'd gone public in the  IPO path?

Start time: 7693.50
End time: 7721.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it's a SPAC is in some ways more like an acquisition for the target  company. So a lot depends on how much money they've raised, what their investors are  expecting and, you know, the really technical details about the capital structure, which  I won't get into. But there may be reasons why it's actually better, especially for the  venture capital investors to go through to go through a SPAC.

And so this is just an easy to build project.  It's designed for kids nine and up.  But even if you're an adult, you want to make something that's private and it's  powerful. It does way more than an Amazon Echo does because it will literally do  anything you teach it to do.  It's just a fantastic product.
