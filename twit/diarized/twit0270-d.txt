We aren't giving you the breaking news, we're kind of chewing it over, mulling it over and  explaining what it all means.  So I like to get on the show people who can actually do that.  I'm here with Harry McCracken from Technologizer, former editor in chief at PC World, right?  That's right.  And he's kind of going on his own and it sounds like it's going really well.

Transcript:  Well, you know, I was talking with a friend, Sarah Lane, who knows pretty well knows M.G.  Siegler.  And I was talking about blogging.  Well, before I do that, let's introduce another blogger, but also a real live newspaper man  Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.  He's at blogs.cron.com slash tech blog and a regular on the show.  Hey Dwight.  Hey, how are you doing, Leo?  Nice to see you again, Harry.

Start time: 152.32
End time: 159.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to see you, Dwight.  You guys know each other.  Oh yeah, we've hung out at CES and we interact on Twitter all the time.

Start time: 159.68
End time: 172.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a, it's a, the tech journalist world is a small world, which is fun because we  all know each other and we get, and when you go to conferences, that's what used to be  great about Comdex is you'd see people once a year that you know, and it was always so  much fun.

Start time: 173.44
End time: 181.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I'm not sure I would describe in the chaos of the CES press room that it's  a small world, or at least it's a very compressed world.

End time: 212.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not anymore.  Yeah, that's true.  But I was talking with Sarah about her friend M.G.  Siegler, who writes for TechCrunch.  And you know, the world of the newspaper man was, you know, you could, you could take a  weekend off.  You'd have assignments, you'd have a beat.  You didn't have to work 24-7, right Dwight?  I mean, it's my imagination anyway.  It was, there was a hierarchy.  You had copy editors, you had editors, you had an assignment desk.  And so you, you weren't, it wasn't all on your shoulders, was it?

Start time: 213.54
End time: 223.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to a certain extent, you were always on call.  I mean, I've, no matter what beat I've done, I've always been, you know, ready to jump  in if something happened.  Right.  Yeah, but that's the fun of it.

Start time: 223.64
End time: 243.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're covering news, when I remember we had you on and there were, was it tornadoes  or floods going on in Houston?  And you said, well, you know, acts of nature allowing, I'll be able to do it.  That's fun though.  That's the fun thing about being a news, a news person is when there's breaking news,  you cover it.  That's right.

Start time: 243.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a certain amount of adrenaline, although what's interesting is before the advent of  the web, you know, you'd covered it, what you did appeared the next day in print.  And now you do it as it happens.  And that's a very different experience than, than it was, you know, back in the day.

Start time: 260.44
End time: 280.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that's what I was observing.  And I was thinking, boy, I kind of feel for people like MG and you too, Harry.  Now, MG works for TechCrunch, but it's very much like you're on your own.  You know, you, you, you're, you don't have a quota, apparently at TechCrunch, but boy,  if you don't publish every day, if you're not constantly on the story, you know, you're  going to be shunted aside.  And Harry, you're pretty much the guy at, at Technologizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I do have a few other folks who write for me, but you know, I spent most of my career  doing monthly computer magazines, which are the worst possible training ground for the  web because we literally would work on an issue sometimes for six months from the time  we came up with an idea until the time we shipped it out the door and we made everything  perfect.  And you just don't do that on the web.  The quality comes more from the speed and from evolving and refining things and having  them be absolutely flawless.  So it's been a great education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, MG and Sarah took the day off yesterday to go to a concert on Treasure Island in San  Francisco.  And I, and, and I knew I could just feel how anxious MG would be that what if something  happens?  I'm out of touch.  I've got to be here 20 that nowadays being a blogger is a 24 seven job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not too long after I started my site, it was Labor Day in 2008 and the news leaked that  Google was doing the Chrome browser.  And that was perfect for bloggers because the people who have real day jobs working  at large media companies had the day off.  And so they did not leap on the story of Chrome, which was pretty huge.  And even though it was theoretically a holiday for me, I did leap on it.  And that was one of the kind of a seminal moment, the start of my site, because I had  the story earlier than most people simply because I don't get to take the day off.

Start time: 364.00
End time: 366.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's got to be a burnout factor though, too, right?

Start time: 366.96
End time: 384.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a challenge.  So my goal is not to write the most stories.  It's to write stories that people care about.  And I think ultimately that's a better path to success.  And it's also a better path to not killing yourself.  If you just try to grind out 30 stories a day, you will kill yourself and the stories  won't be very good.  Right.

Transcript:  I mean, I just feel like, not to slime Mike Harrington, but anybody who runs a big tech  blog is just kind of going to burn those kids out as fast as they can.  And then the next group comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, look, J.C.  Lerner does a really good job, by the way, of doing a lot of stuff, but doing really  good stories.  He's one of the few people who seems to be able to do both.

Start time: 409.22
End time: 418.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree.  He's a great writer.  He's very insightful.  And he publishes not just every day, but you feel like he's publishing every hour.  If there's a story, he's always on top of it.

Start time: 418.92
End time: 435.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's on top of it.  Yeah.  I just checked his Twitter page and it's no longer there and maybe it was somewhere else,  but he used to have a tagline under his Paris Lemon name that said, Blogger for life.  And that sums him up pretty good.

Start time: 436.06
End time: 465.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He might have moved from Paris Lemon to MG Siegler.  I don't know.  No, he's still there.  He's still there, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, he's still there.  Anyway, I don't know how we got into this.  I just thought it was how much has changed.  And Dwight, you're a good example of somebody who's had to move from news.  And actually both of you are moved from newspaper or a magazine reporter to this new fast paced  world of the blog.  And it's very different.  Now here's a guy who hasn't changed a thing.  He's just he's the same old curmudgeon he always was.  John C. Dvorak, welcome.

Start time: 479.04
End time: 489.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have a proto blogger.  I mean, you were and and unlike a newspaper guy who had editors in a hierarchy, you've  always been kind of on your own.  Nobody tells John C. Dvorak what to do.

Start time: 491.13
End time: 503.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, generally.  I mean, they will kill stuff once in a while.  Really?  Well, that's come on.  Right.  I know what my audience is and you know, it's happened in the past.

Start time: 503.56
End time: 508.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you ever had a story where you knew it was a it was a factual but they did they just  didn't have the guts to publish it?

Start time: 511.05
End time: 556.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not really.  I mean, I've had the incidents where, you know, when I was writing from Forbes, for  example, which has layers of edits and actually I wrote for the New York Times freelance,  some freelance articles, and you have to sit there with the editor who's who's going  through the database to make sure that your usage is OK, that somebody else has done it  before. I remember doing this one article and and I used the term.  Hitting on referring to the action at Comdex where the show goers were hitting on the  booth babes.  And so the editor and I go, oh, hitting on hitting on.  I don't know if that can be used.  That's very colloquial.  So she goes into the database and she says, oh, bonanza, Frank Rich has used the term  you're good.

Start time: 560.00
End time: 563.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 564.72
End time: 570.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He could get it. He can say whatever he wants.  Like a definitive guy.  If he writes hitting on, they put it in.

Start time: 570.62
End time: 595.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  There is an online newspaper just checking to see if I could find the link because Jeff  Jarvis had this. There's a newspaper that's now online that puts at the bottom of every  story a correction form.  I've seen this.  So that I mean, how so how do you feel about that as a writer?  That I mean, it seems to me that's that's actually a good use of the Web, right?  Instance. It sucks.

Start time: 595.32
End time: 650.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't like that.  No, I don't think we have to do bookkeeping.  These are articles like the guys just said a minute ago.  You know, you're writing it.  So you don't have all these layers of edit now.  Now we're going to be bookkeepers and keep.  Oh, I use the instead of ah.  And I used and instead of a I mean, what do you word is it end?  I mean, I've gotten to arguments about this.  The great thing about the Web is you made a mistake.  You change it.  Right. I don't know what there is to make where there's documented that the earlier  version, you know, 10 minutes ago was a little different or had a different wordage.  This happens in the newspaper business with the three star and the Bulldog edition.  They don't put necessarily they will change an article.  Yeah. If somebody is defamed and they have to put a correction, this person is not a  pervert. We're sorry we said that.  But the fact of the matter is, if you don't, you know, when you go from one edition to  the other, you don't say what you've changed.  Sometimes the story is not even in the second edition.  I don't like it.

Start time: 651.24
End time: 673.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Comments under under a stories are de facto  exact correction forms.  And so exactly.  And so one of the reasons why they may be doing that is to keep the correction stuff  out of the comments that may be like a diffusion mechanism to keep, you know,  corrections of about wording and so forth out of there.  But but one of the things I could.

Start time: 674.34
End time: 683.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've talked to the editors about this, and that's not the reason they're doing it.  They're doing it because they think they need to be on the record that a mistake with  your an error and punctuation was made.

Start time: 684.86
End time: 688.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the comments, do the correction show up automatically or they vetted first?

Start time: 688.86
End time: 692.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm trying to find this link and I can't I can't find it.

Start time: 692.18
End time: 693.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an interesting. They don't like this idea.

Start time: 696.62

Start time: 698.82
End time: 704.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DeVore. So if you make a mistake, you'll see it in the comments.  And I think that's that's probably good enough.

Start time: 704.80
End time: 726.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of places they turn off the comments because they don't want to they  don't want to face this challenge, right?  It's a look at no matter what, it's a difficult transition from this.  You know, Stephen Levy says I do I do slow journalism like slow food.  You know, that's the new slow food movement.  He says I do slow journalism and he does because his books take his most recent  book took seven years. So that's really slow journalism.

Start time: 727.10
End time: 772.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, a lot of I was listening to one of the sports talk shows.  They have a couple of writers that talk to each other.  Pardon the interruption.  And one of them said that, you know, he hates to sell idea of blogging and putting  stuff out there without editors going over it and other editors going over it.  He's just not used to that. He doesn't like the idea and he doesn't want to do it.  And I can see people getting into that, but it's being too dependent on your editors.  The weird thing about this is that writers, I think, genetically complain bitterly.  I always did, even when I was an editor.  But writers complain bitterly about editors dominating everything and then ruining  their copy and ruining their jokes and doing all these bad things.  And then they're given the opportunity to do this straight up writing without a  bunch of middlemen. And then they won't do it.  They complain.

Start time: 773.66
End time: 794.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what about fact checking, though?  I mean, you know, the New Yorker is famous for its very high quality fact checking on  even the silliest little trivial details.  And I think that that's what this newspaper that Jeff was talking about was using this  form for as a fact check form.  Do you think that's an inappropriate use?  I'm not talking about punctuation, but just saying, hey, that's incorrect.

Start time: 795.70
End time: 821.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that, all of a sudden, if you have good readers, like Dwight said, if you have  a comments field and smart readers, they will fact check you better than any professional  fact checker could ever.  I agree.  Because no matter how good a single fact checker is, they have to call other people and verify  things. And if you have thousands of readers, you have experts on everything.  And my readers certainly, when I get something wrong, usually within a couple of minutes,  they chastise me and correct me.  I agree.

Start time: 821.46
End time: 832.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that while I am far from perfect and I get things wrong all the time, because we  have this active chat room and this active participation, I think we almost always get  it right eventually.

Start time: 833.66
End time: 865.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me say something about fact checking.  And I think the guys will back me up on this if they've done any writing for the national  press. When I started off, fact checkers were everywhere, especially throughout the 1980s.  By the time the 1980s ended and the collapse had already begun, and really before the web,  the newspapers and magazine collapse had begun, thanks to television mostly, the fact checkers  were the first guys to get fired.  It's like firing the makeup people at tech TV.  They were the first to go.

Start time: 865.54
End time: 870.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they were. And the result is, as you see, not far from salubrious.

Start time: 871.08
End time: 884.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And at some point, there were no fact checking.  There was no...the editors would do a little minor fact checking and say, you know, I remember  this. But there was no...there used to be serious fact checking where they would go  out and call people.  And that died at least 20 years ago.

Start time: 885.36
End time: 921.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I found the link. This is Jay Rosen, actually, put this on his Twitter.  And it's the Litchfield County, Connecticut, Registered Citizen.  So it's a very small local paper.  But they say since launching an easy to use online fact check form in May, readers have  made well over 100 reports to us about local news stories that contain incorrect information,  correct context to the point of being misleading or missed, quote, the real point, end quote,  of the story altogether.  That's pretty, pretty interesting for a small paper, a small town paper that cannot afford  a fact checker or probably even very good editors.  That's probably not a bad idea.

Start time: 921.60
End time: 925.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this again is misleading because nobody has fact checkers anymore.  Right.

Start time: 926.16
End time: 928.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do they have comments under their story?

Start time: 928.54
End time: 950.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, they do. But they also have a special form.  And I think you're probably right, Dwight, that this was just to get the fact checking  out of the comments and into a fact check form.  It says, tell us what was wrong, title of article, email address.  I think it's kind of to separate them out.  I don't think that's a bad thing. But I think you're right.  I think, Harry, the comments really, that's what comments ultimately do so well, is balance  an article.

Start time: 951.00
End time: 993.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are still a few fact checkers out there.  I just recently started writing for Time and for online for time.com.  I am my own fact checker.  But I have something in the print issue this coming week.  And there are fact checkers involved when it goes on paper at time.  I also wrote something for Discover recently and got fact checked for that as well.  But I have to say, I laid off the fact checkers at PC World quite a long time ago.  So John is quite right.  In a lot of cases, they went away a long time ago.  And they were fact checking is dangerous because if you know somebody is going to be checking  every fact for you, you might get sloppy.  If you know you're working without a net, you're ultimately more likely to get things  right in the first place.  A lot of TKs in there.

Start time: 994.56
End time: 1006.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think PC World got massively more inaccurate once we started telling the editors  and the writers that it actually was their responsibility to be correct, which kind of  was not the message we gave them when we had a couple of fact checkers on staff.

Start time: 1008.08
End time: 1049.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's right, which is a reverse effect that you'd expect it to get worse when it  actually gets better.  And it didn't hurt that Google and the internet came along and can be kind of a quasi.  Because sometimes the real danger isn't so much like you're writing something up in a  field that maybe there's a couple of things you don't know about.  You can look it up on Google and then you can actually fact check yourself by looking  it up again.  In other words, following more than one source.  The real problem, the problem I've always had occasionally, rare, but it happens to  every writer.  You swear you knew a fact to be solid and you don't even think to fact check it because  the guy's name is spelled with a B and there's no B in his name.

Start time: 1052.86
End time: 1066.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do that all the time.  Of course, I'm live, so it's always a thought process.  And sometimes I'll hedge my statements if I'm not sure of it.  But if I'm sure of it, I'll emphasize it and that can very easily bite you in the ass.

Start time: 1066.84
End time: 1094.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it happens.  And of course, you find out about it pretty quickly in the comments and you scramble to  correct it.  And of course, the good gag, I don't know if Dwight ever does, I do this on the blog  occasion, it's kind of funny.  You get somebody with a long winded explanation to why something is wrong in the blog posting  and you go back and change it and you do nothing else.  So this is a dirty trick that bloggers do constantly.  So the guy who has the comment, he looks like an idiot because there's not, it doesn't  reflect what the post looks like.

Transcript:  And then there's what Molly Wood calls the literal net.  Well, now I'm sorry in episode 232 of Star Trek, it was very obvious that the nuts and  bolts were all screwed from left to right, not right to left.  You should have known that.

Start time: 1110.48
End time: 1131.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's good to give your commenters credit because it gives them some props for  checking it.  Also, they may come in and be, may come at you kind of angry and with a chip on their  shoulder.  And then when you correct it and say, hey, thanks, I appreciate you keeping me honest  or give me the right information, they kind of go, oh, yeah, yeah, I mostly do that.

Transcript:  But Harry's got it right.  Harry's got it right.  He, you do the stories that people really care about.  You don't just do something necessarily because you have to be on top of it.  I have editor duties as well as writer duties and some management duties.  And so I can't do every story.  So I try to pick very carefully a tech blog, ones that I think the majority of people will  be interested in or that are, or are generally are just the most interesting.  And Harry does, does the same thing.  You know, he, he focuses on the writing and, and, and does a lot more.  That's true.

Transcript:  For the last few months, I've been doing a lot of posts which are maybe one to three  sentences long.  I noticed that they're just there to hand off the reader to somebody who's done something  that's long and interesting and says it at least as well as I ever could.  And that works really well.  My posts tend to be either really short and simply say, here's something fun elsewhere,  go read or I'll do hundreds of words in a lot of cases.

Transcript:  We're going to talk about the new Windows Phone.  Harry was there. You were at the event and also a big Facebook event.  There's been a lot going on this week.  There's lots to talk about.  I'm so glad we've got this panel.  What a what a prestigious panel of experts here.  Harry McCracken, former editor in chief of PC World now at Technologizer.com.  Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle and the tech blog at blogs.  Cron.com. John C.  Dvorak, who is, of course, John C.  Dvorak and and need no introduction.  What were you doing there?  Was that a little hand gesture? Yeah.  OK. Aye, aye, Captain. Aye, aye, Captain.  Before we go on, though, I do want to talk a little bit about our friends at Carbonite  and their creation, their new creation Carbonite Pro for small business.  If you are a small business and you do not have a disaster plan,  you are headed for disaster.  Let's face it.  Think about all that data you've got on the computers in your office.  The bookkeeping, the client lists, all of those things.  What would happen if they if the office burned down and you lost it all?  You got backups right next to the original computers.  Those are gone, too.  You got to have offsite backup.  But on the other hand, offsite backup requires a lot of, you know, attention  and perhaps an IT professional.  This is where Carbonite Pro is so great.  Carbonite uses the great consumer technology developed for Carbonite.  But puts it in a business environment with Carbonite.  You have unlimited backup per computer.  And in fact, it turned out a lot of people were using that for their businesses.  Carbonite Pro is designed around the idea of kind of as many users as you want.  You only pay for the storage that you need.  Better a better solution for business.  It's offsite. It's automatic.  Your individual users can restore their data from Carbonite Pro,  not just by from the original computer, as with most backups, but from any computer.  Anytime you get online, you log into your account.  There's your data.  You can even use a free iPhone and BlackBerry app.  It's secure, uses AES 256 bit encryption if you choose to protect your privacy.  Of course, SSL is always used during backup.  So even if you have an open access point, you don't have to worry about it.  And the price is right. 20 gigabytes, $10, 100 gigabytes, $75 a month.  So you could have 100 desks each with two gigabytes each.  It costs you no more than $100 to backup.  I mean, that's that's remarkable.  Very affordable, very effective.  It's online backup for your small business.  And it's very important if you don't have a strategy, try it free for 30 days right now.  Carbonite Pro dot coms got a central dashboard.  So, you know that all the systems are backed up.  Carbonite Pro dot com 30 days free.  Give it a try today.  It is an absolutely vital solution.  Windows Mobile, you were at the announcement, Harry.  I heard you ask a question, I think. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, to me, Windows Phone 7 is fascinating just because it actually is new  and in Vendo, that's not a wannabe.  It's not just a carbon copy of the iPhone or Android,  but it's also getting into the game rather late.  At least it seems to be getting in late.  I think we're probably still ultimately really early in the history of smartphones.  And I'm just really curious  how easy it is for anybody to get traction with a new platform.  I actually think it's quite good from a user interface standpoint.  It's to me better than Android.  And I can certainly see somebody walking into a phone store.  And it's not implausible.  Somebody might prefer this user interface to the iPhone.  But Microsoft was kind of asleep at the wheel for years.  And it's kind of, you know, in the worst case scenario,  it's kind of like the Zune all over again.  Zune was always a good product a year after you wanted that.  So they came up with a hard drive player once the world had moved on to Flash  and a Flash player once the world had moved on to touch screens  and a touch screen player with no apps when the world had moved on to apps.  And that's the worst case scenario.  But the best case scenario is that there still is room for at least  a third major platform.  What do you think? What do you think?

Transcript:  No, I haven't gotten a hold of one yet.  I'm going to try to.  I'm sure it's fine.  It's just that as a phone, I'm sure it does everything you want it to do.  There's probably a few gotchas.  I'm I'm not more than a little amused by the fact that it hasn't got cut and paste,  which seems to have been the main complaint about the iPhone  when it first came out and that people harped and harped and harped  on cut and paste, cut and paste.  Here we are. What? Four years later,  Microsoft brings out a phone with no cut and paste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's you know, one of the things that Microsoft has said about  Windows Phone, mobile Windows Phone seven is that  there's a huge number of people yet who have not picked up on smartphones.  And they see this as allure to  aimed at people who are still using feature phones.  The problem is that they're still marketing it with the pricing  that is typical of Android and the iPhone.  It's still going to be a two hundred dollar phone and the various data plans.  And one of the reasons people are still holding off and holding on  to their feature phones is that they don't have those added costs.  And I think if you're trying, if Microsoft really wanted to lure  that huge base of people who haven't bit yet,  they would lower the price, both of the hardware and work with the carriers  to make the data plans less.  I've I've tried a Windows Phone seven and and I really like it.  I think it has it's very, very appealing.  And Microsoft now understands that part of the appeal of a smartphone  is not just what it does, but kind of there's an emotional appeal to it.  So it has almost a sense of whimsy and a very much a friendliness  that was completely missing from the really geeky  Windows Mobile six point five, which was real computery.  This is this is very attractive.  I think the masses are going to really be interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with both products in the same year, because the kin was just  totally out of contact and out of touch with anything  anybody would want.  And Windows Phone seven is way better than that.  And I can't quite see why they couldn't figure out  that it was not worth doing the kin.  And they should have just put even more effort into getting Windows  Phone seven out quickly.

Transcript:  Harry, Harry and and Dwight, correct me.  This was my impression.  I haven't touched it yet, but just looking at what I've seen  and looking at the ads, it looked like one thing that was very different  from Android and iPhone was that it's not so app centric.  You know, Android and iPhone, really, you live in the apps.  You don't do anything that's not inside an app.  It looked like Windows Phone seven.  Of course, they don't have as many apps, but it looked like the operating system  was very much more foreground.

Start time: 1744.84
End time: 1772.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit. I mean, they they integrate with Facebook  and your contacts from various places and you can check status updates.  And so far, without an app, it's all just a tile.  Right. Which can also dead.  I mean, the challenge there is it's it's hard to be as good at doing Facebook  as Facebook is at doing Facebook. Right.  And I think Microsoft has said they're not doing this instead of apps.  They're doing it just so.  If you want to get in and get out quickly, which is a line they've used a lot.  You don't need to launch the app.

Start time: 1773.18
End time: 1820.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that was the big pitch.  In fact, let me show a little bit of the one of the ads  for the new Windows Phone seven.  These ads feature people staring into their phone and kind of missing out on life.  Here's a guy at the beach, a girl in the shower, woman running,  a massage therapist who's looking at her phone instead of a massage.  A guy who's on a seesaw and his poor kid's stranded.  A woman saying, look at me.  And her boyfriend is busy looking at the phone.  And sharks coming and he doesn't know.  And then he drops the phone in the urinal.  Really?  He's on a roller coaster.  She runs into somebody.  He sits on somebody.  She walks into somebody.  She falls down the stairs.  He's at a wedding, but she isn't.  Surgeons looking at phones.

Transcript:  Well, you know, like you said, I actually did a column about this ad.  And like you said, Leo, and I quoted you in this column.  You should pay more attention.  The I quote you in this column saying  only Microsoft would highlight its competition in an advertisement.  Yeah, you don't see a Windows Phone in that ad.  No, you're just seeing these.  But what's really kind of sick about that ad  is the fact that Microsoft doesn't recognize that what they're exhibiting  in that ad, which I believe is true.  It's a bunch of people preoccupied with their phones.  And we see it all the time.  Is that this is a major societal trend.  They're not going to buck it because I mean, people aren't.  They don't. People aren't using these phones so they could get in and get out  and get on with what they were engaged.

They don't know how to market anything.

Transcript:  I think they are catering to non-phone geeks.  I mean, if you look at the percentage of Americans who have smartphones,  even today, a pretty high percentage of them are people who are kind of tech nerds.  And Dwight's right.  They're going to have to convince people to spend two hundred dollars  plus eighty dollars or whatever a month,  which for a lot of people is still a pretty high price tag.  But I think they are looking at the great untapped market of people  who aren't just aren't doing this at all yet.

Start time: 1978.56

I can't remember the exact name of the product, but it was just a brain dead word  processor that was just a horrible piece of crap.  And and I asked them about what their marketing theory was on this.  Well, who's going to buy it?  This is this product is designed for people who don't like computers  and don't like word processing.  Great.  You can see the logic.  I was just like dumbfounded that what you're so in other words, you want to sell  to people that probably don't even have a computer.  You're trying to sell it to people who don't want it.  Yeah. And no, it wasn't word star 2000.  It was called easy. We had some stupid name.  Yeah. Well, we don't remember it, obviously.  Yeah. Well, I can. I've written about it.

They don't have cut and paste.  It looks sexy to me and I'm not offended by the casting for third party apps.  But I can see people are pretty serious about phones, finding this appealing,  especially if they ramp up the third party apps pretty quickly.  So there are nine models.

It's that you had the whole event.  You had commentary running commentary while the event was going on.  I thought it was a beautiful piece. Thank you.  And there was, you know, there was a lot of people watching it,  but I don't think a lot of people appreciated that.  What you did, the way you did it was absolutely outstanding.  This is how I want to give you some thank you.

Transcript:  It's very nice of you. This is kind of how we want.  Look, this is where I want to take the network, which is live coverage  of breaking events we never covered a Microsoft event yet.  So I thought, well, I'll get up.  I don't know why they had it at 930 Eastern Time, 630 Microsoft time in the morning.  But I was there. Harry obviously took it even more seriously.  He flew out. Had I known Harry, I would have gotten you gone because it was.  But this is how I think we'd like to do this from now.  And we'll probably do it on Wednesday with the Apple coverage,  which is kind of the Mystery Science Theater, three, two thousand coverage,  which is we're just sitting in the audience watching and snarking.  That was funny. Yeah, it was fun.  And I think it is the idea is that you get to watch the event.  And of course, if you want to watch the event, you can watch the stream clean.  You don't need us.  But to get some background as as you're watching the event.  So that's our goal.  I don't know if it was the best thing we've ever done, but I think that is where we.

Start time: 2193.52
End time: 2224.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did the last one, which I think was a response to the fact that  the room is full of live bloggers.  And you just might as well.  If you mean Apple, I think the idea for Apple was initially they did stream  initially, then they stopped a few years ago.  And I think their idea was we want to control it so that when we put out the video,  it's nicely produced.  And then they realized we can't control it because there's too many live bloggers  doing it anyway. And then there's this moron Leo, who actually turned his laptop  around and streamed it.  So we better just stream it ourselves kind of.  I hope they do stream it. I do, too.

Start time: 2225.08
End time: 2244.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, when you're when they don't stream it,  the most important thing I do is kind of tedious, which is to report  price tags and exact specs and so forth,  which is kind of boring.  I'd much rather that Apple took care of that stuff and that I could do  commentary and analysis and the stuff you're not going to get otherwise.

Start time: 2245.26
End time: 2254.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you.  So you'll sit in the audience. You're one of the live bloggers.  You'll sit in the audience, you'll live blog it and people will refresh  technologizer over and over again.  The people they don't have to.

Transcript:  They had so many people covering using Cover It Live.  So live blogging, you know, Gadget does it, NGadget does it,  Gizmodo does it, Harry does it.  So what I do is I like get a dashboard of them and all.  And that's what we'll do on Wednesday.  I have Andy and Ako is actually in the event.  Alex, Lindsay, Tom, Merritt and I will be sitting in the studio either.  There'll be a stream which, you know, when we didn't we asked Apple  for permission to rebroadcast the stream, what we did with Microsoft.  And they said no.  So what we did is we kind of watched  and hoped that others were watching the stream and then listening to us,  you know, doing their own mix down of the two.  So we'll either do that or cover or watch Harry and we'll report what Harry's saying.  And then we'll do Mac Break Weekly right after.  I don't think this one is not at Urbabuena Center.  It's not at Moscone West.  It's at One Infinite Loop in the town hall, which only holds, I think, 250, 350 people.  So it's a small event.  As usual, Apple gets a ton of press.  You know, Microsoft and Facebook and and Cisco,  all three of them had events.  Was it on Monday? All three of them had it.  Or when was it? Wednesday.  There was one day when everybody had an event  and nobody knew these events ahead of time, there was no buzz.  Apple, all they have to do is send an invitation out to 150 people  one week before, and the whole blogosphere is a buzz with.

Transcript:  Hello, I am Ralph de la Vega.  Well, it's interesting because AT&T, you know, has already kind of telegraphed  that they're going to lose exclusivity of the iPhone sooner or later.  And I think we all agree it's probably January.  The Wall Street Journal is basically floating Apple's own leak

They're going to launch the Samsung Focus on November 8th.  That's the one, by the way, everybody agrees is the one to get.  Have you played with that one, guys?

Transcript:  Come on. It's a little clunky looking.  And then there's an LG with a slide out keyboard, although it is kind of unclear  to what degree Windows Phone 7 is designed for landscape  as opposed to portrait mode.  There are some things that even though the keyboard is horizontal,  the user interface is not.  Oh, it doesn't rotate around.  Not in a lot of places it does, but not everywhere you'd want it to be.  And I think you're right. The Samsung is the cool one.  It has an OLED screen.  So the colors are really intense.

T-Mobile also has two models, an HTC model and a Dell model  later in November. All of them will be 200 bucks with the usual two year  contract on AT&T or T-Mobile.

Transcript:  Now, there's what was one interesting and kind of funny thing  that Microsoft did where they had where they were touting  how what a good game device this is.  You know, they're clearly going after that same. Right.  And and one of the things that they did in some of their marketing  was they had the icon for the Angry Birds.  And Rovio came out and said, Nope, we don't have a plan to do  an Angry Birds version.

Start time: 2562.38
End time: 2611.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, I talked to Paul Therotte about this and he said, well,  it was a third party that created this ad and they just snipped out  icons without really kind of thinking about it.  And Microsoft, this is a case where, John, you're right.  A CMO would have been all over this, would have said, wait a minute.  Do you have permission for these icons or a fact checker? Maybe.  And Rovio was quick to tweet no.  But on the other hand, if the phone's a strong platform,  that Rovio's already got Angry Birds, they in fact, a huge success.  Angry Birds for Android came out this week and they didn't offer it on the.  Oddly enough, they didn't offer it on the Android marketplace.  They offered it on the Get Jar  marketplace and immediately brought the Get Jar server down.  So they moved it over to Google's Android marketplace.  And they're claiming one million downloads of Angry Birds in the first day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's ad supported. It's got ad mob ads in it, which I'm not.  I'd prefer to play a pay a buck ninety nine and not have the ads, to be honest.  But I think they're doing an experiment  because it is not free, but it is ad free on the Apple platform.  It's free ad supported on the Android platform.  It's an interesting experiment. I think these guys are pretty sharp.  They've made a lot of money, too, because they've got an iPad app

Transcript:  Yeah, it's just it's kind of like one of those stories.  It just doesn't die ever.  But before we get to that, you may smoke them if you've got them, gentlemen,  because I want to talk a little bit about Squarespace dot com.  No, you can't smoke. You're underage. Squarespace.  Squarespace dot com.  It's the place where exceptional websites begin.  If you've kind of thought, well, I'd like to try a blog or a web page  or maybe you have one, but you're not really thrilled with the service  that you're using.  Perhaps they put ads on your site or there's, you know, yourself hosting  and there's all sorts of security updates that you have to apply  and you have to check all the time.  I want you to take a look at Squarespace dot com.  One of the things that Squarespace does, it's a combination of hosting and software.  So the Squarespace folks, they've got a really sophisticated  Java based hosting solution that is just guaranteed  to give you bandwidth no matter what happens.  I mean, I've never been able to bring a Squarespace site down.  We've we've aimed all the big guns at the Twitter army at it and nothing.  But they also have the best content management solution on top of it.  And one way to tell how good Squarespace is, is to go to the Squarespace dot com  site, Squarespace dot com slash twit and take a look at the examples.  These are sites, both blogs, photography, portfolios, businesses  that people have created using the Squarespace platform.  And unlike other solutions,  no two Squarespace sites look alike.  You start with their great Squarespace templates,  but you're completely able to customize so that that Squarespace site  it reflects you.  This is a photography portfolio I'm showing right now.  Just just fantastic.  A lot of photographers use Squarespace.  You start with their beautiful templates.  You can drag and drop so you can make it look without any design  training or background.  You can make it look fantastic.  You can add forms, you can add portfolios.  And then if you know CSS, if you're a JavaScript or CSS wizard,  well, the sky's the limit.  Anything you want to do, you can do.  I just I think Squarespace is remarkable.  I want you to take a look at it.  You could try it free for two weeks.  And when I say free, you don't even need there's no obligation, nothing.  You don't even need a credit card.  Just go to Squarespace dot com slash twit.  And right there on the front page, you'll see a big button  that says try it for free, no credit card required.  And all you have to do is name your site, give it a password, an email address  in case you forget the password and then do the capture.  You're done.  You've now got a Squarespace site and you've got it free for two weeks.  You can even and I like this import all the existing data from your site right now.  If you've got a blog or a website, it supports all the major APIs,  including movable type WordPress, type pad and blogger, which means almost  any site can be imported right in, including all the comments.  They've got a great iPhone app makes it really easy to not only post,  but moderate comments and see your stats.  Like I can go on and on, but I just want you to try it right now.  Go to Squarespace dot com, set up a site for free if you decide to buy.  Sites start at twelve dollars a month and you'll get 10% off for the life  of your site with the offer code twit Squarespace.  It's the secret behind exceptional websites.  Squarespace dot com.  Use the offer code twit to save 10%.  Really is a great way to do a website.  Our inside twit blog is there and almost everybody I know,  Sarah Lane, Kevin Rose, they all have Squarespace blogs.  It really is the place to do it.  All right. You were also Harry.  In fact, you even asked a question.  That's how I knew you were there at the kind of was it was a surprise.  We were doing one of our shows and my producer, Eileen Rivera, comes running  and says, you know, they're streaming something from on the Facebook page  with Microsoft. And I thought, oh my God, has Microsoft bought Facebook?  Well, they already have a five five.  They already own a chunk of a five percent stake in it.  And this was a Facebook Bing thing.  Is it a big deal or is it a minor minor thing?

Start time: 2895.24
End time: 2928.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think it's a medium sized deal in terms of the benefit now.  Now, if you search on Bing,  it will do a module in a lot of cases.  It shows stuff your friend liked and whatever you searched for.  So if you search for cars  and your friends have given a thumbs up to articles about cars somewhere,  you might see those.  You'll see restaurant reviews they liked and so forth.  If you search for a name, it will try to look at your network of friends  and their friends to get you the person you were searching for,  especially if it's a name that multiple people have.  So it's it's social.

Start time: 2928.76
End time: 2940.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the it's that kind of buzzword social search where your  your search is applied against your social graph, your friends.  And the result that comes out has additional information  because of what your friends like and use and so forth.

Start time: 2941.40
End time: 3012.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the long term potential is more interesting  because the better they get at kind of weaving this into how they figure out  whether something is relevant to you, the more interesting it is.  One thing they talked about that sounds interesting, which they're not doing yet,  is if you search for restaurants and they look at Facebook  places to know which of your friends have actually checked in at a restaurant,  they'll say, well, if that friend has actually been to that restaurant,  they probably know more about it than somebody who hasn't.  And so that person's opinion gets more important.  So I find the general idea of of integrating social stuff  into search really exciting.  And what they've actually done so far is interesting, but it's not transcendent.  Any privacy concerns with this?  Yes. I mean, a lot of the questions in the audience were about that.  Basically, it's turned on by default.  It's not something you need to opt into.  But they kind of do a balloon the first five times you go to Bing  that say we're doing this and in that balloon, there's a one click  opt out option and you need to be logged into Facebook for it to happen at all.  And nothing goes the other way.  So Facebook doesn't know anything about your Bing searches,  even though Bing knows about some of your activities on Facebook.

Start time: 3014.42
End time: 3020.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is basically what Facebook has already done with Pandora  and Yelp and some other sites, right?

Start time: 3020.50
End time: 3025.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an instant personalization, which kind of got them into trouble.  And when they launched it a few months ago, it was spooked the hell out of me.

Start time: 3025.94
End time: 3033.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I noticed that they've made the banner smaller.  But when I first went to Yelp, it said, hey, Leo, the poor,  would you like to know what your friends like on?  I said, how do you know it's me?

Start time: 3034.10
End time: 3036.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3037.62
End time: 3047.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you when you opt out, Harry,  does it opt you out of seeing your friends or does it opt you out  of your Facebook items showing up and being?

Start time: 3048.48
End time: 3067.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's opting out of I believe it's up and out of you seeing the feature.  And actually, that's a good question in terms of  whether your buddies can see what you liked.  That would be the bigger privacy concern.  And I believe you can opt out of that, too.  You might you might have to do that on Facebook rather than on Bing.  But I'm not positive.

Start time: 3067.62
End time: 3081.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things that somebody asked is, well, if I search for an illness  and then my friend, my Facebook friends  like on the three of these articles come up, it's like revealing to me  that my Facebook friend has this illness.

Start time: 3081.72
End time: 3096.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg was at the Microsoft event.  And he said something which to me, you know, is correct,  which is the act of liking something in Facebook is saying,  I want other people to know about this.  So if you want to keep something confident, I like it.  Don't don't like it.

Start time: 3097.68
End time: 3111.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And yeah, it strikes me as reasonable.  He made a point saying, we're not putting anything on Bing  that you couldn't find out just by going to Facebook.  It's only the stuff that people have published publicly for everyone.  So if you go to Facebook, even if you don't have an account,  you can see all this data.

Start time: 3111.54
End time: 3119.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it is all about what you're liking.  And so I think essentially, if you don't want people to know what you like,  then don't press that like button anywhere on the web and you'll be fine.

Start time: 3119.60
End time: 3140.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is a creepy factor, though, isn't there?  Regardless of, you know, Mark can say over and over again,  well, you know, it's nothing that people don't already see.  Bing isn't sending us any information.  And my rational mind goes, OK, so that's fine.  But there's nevertheless this visceral creepiness  that it feels like it knows something about me that it are still getting

Start time: 3140.64
End time: 3164.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their heads around it.  Also, this is a three way integration because it involves Bing,  it involves Facebook, and it involves all these other sites  that have the like button of which obviously there are vast numbers,  including technologizers.  So you might be on Bing, which is using Facebook  to show you what your friend liked at CNET or Yelp, Urban Spoon or something.  And I think that's kind of new.  The fact is not two way integration, it's three way.

Start time: 3166.08
End time: 3202.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Harry, one of the one of the things that really bothers me about  the way Facebook has been approaching these new features is that  they are always opt out. Yeah.  You don't opt into anything.  That was one of the big issues with groups is that you could be pulled  into any group and be associated with any group, regardless of whether  you really wanted to be associated or not.  And and the same thing is true with the thing with Bing.  I think that that it's much more socially acceptable  to give people immediately option of whether you want to participate  before ultimately pulling them in against their will.  What may be against their will.

Start time: 3203.46
End time: 3221.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's also true with places because your friends can check you into places  without asking your permission ahead of time.  And you're able to opt out of that feature, but it's turned on by default.  And I think it's pretty clear that as Facebook adds new stuff,  they'll they tend to make you opt out rather than opt in. Right.

Start time: 3221.96
End time: 3240.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was not able to find in the in Facebook settings after groups launched  anywhere in the privacy settings,  a link where you can say generally, don't let people pull the groups.  That's kind of weird.  I would have thought that was another one that really that's freaked people out.

Start time: 3240.46
End time: 3275.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And again, Facebook's response is the same, which is, well,  only your approved friends can add you to a group.  So you shouldn't have a friend that would do that mischievous thing to you.  They seem it's almost as if Facebook has a view  of how you should be using Facebook.  And as long as you adhere to that view, you're OK.  But should you do something like Jason Calacanis did,  which is friend everybody would ask him up to the limit of five thousand.  That's how Jason got added to.  And by the way, Mark Zuckerberg as well, got added to a NAMBLA group.

Transcript:  Well, that was done by a friend of Mike Errington's,  who set it up just for that purpose to kind of show what would happen.  That was actually set up to do that, to make that great gag.

Start time: 3294.86
End time: 3312.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, I think this is the big issue is that.  There's a little bit of a little tiny bit of a big brother  thing going on on Facebook where we know what's best.  You know, I keep hearing Mark say things like, well, we know you want to connect  and we're just doing what you want.

Start time: 3313.98
End time: 3335.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's yeah.  Facebook, more than most large companies, is willing to tick off its users.  I think Mark Zuckerberg is very confident about his vision  and he thinks we'll all follow along, even if we haven't yet.  And, you know, over and over again, when they really get people upset,  they do backpedal a little bit.  But they clearly would rather push the envelope  than to do something that nobody is going to get upset over.

Start time: 3336.94
End time: 3349.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's the story that just won't die.  This is from Mashable in the Wall Street Journal, AOL  and several venture capital firms are in talks to buy.  Yahoo! John, you believe it?

Start time: 3351.66
End time: 3448.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I believe that I know.  I mean, I think I think there's a rumor going.  There's a couple of rumors going around.  One is, of course, that Microsoft's thinking about it again.  And another one is that AOL is going to do a deal.  And the other one is, oh, some private equity companies are going to buy them up  because there were so much money.  And the whole thing doesn't really sound right when you start really looking at it.  Because who the you know, the economy is not what it used to be.  There's a lot of issues.  I outlined most of this in that column in Market Watch and then kind of  just walked away from it.  But I also think that, you know, I don't think it's possible for AOL,  which I think the best rumors AOL and and and Yahoo getting together  because it could be called a who which would be funny.  So for that reason alone, I think it would be cool.  You know who?  So but, you know, the culture, the clashes, clashes of the culture.  I mentioned the fact that, you know, both these guys are kind of out of touch  with the mainstream, what's really going on.  And they're neither one are considered hip and happening.  We've done this on this show a number of times.  You've done it, Leo.  Others have done it that if somebody comes out with an AOL email address,  they're seen as losers and out of touch.  And these kind of images, which are both they're plaguing both companies.  You know, Yahoo is the company that can't do a buyout of anybody.  They got a bunch of bonehead companies they bought.  They don't know what to do with them.  They buy broadcast dot com for three billion dollars and they drop the ball on that.  I mean, these are not the I don't see that these are not cherries,  you know, waiting to be plucked.  Either one of these companies are there, you know, kind of old fashioned.

Start time: 3448.90
End time: 3458.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But let's not forget that Yahoo is publicly held.  The investors were, I think, a little perturbed that Jerry Yang did not sell to Microsoft.  They wanted that 31 bucks a share or whatever.

Start time: 3459.02
End time: 3470.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which also is another mistake they made.  They could have gotten out smelling like a rose, although I stick to my original thinking,  which is this never would have got past the the Justice Department.

Start time: 3471.00
End time: 3487.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, I guess, yeah, it does depend.  Although AOL and Yahoo right now are really content companies.  That's I mean, Yahoo doesn't even do its own search anymore.  Bing does the search.  So they're they're aggregators of blogs, of content.  Isn't that what AOL has become?

Not than yours, than the Mashable story or the Wall Street Journal story.  According to Bloomberg, they've talked to three people familiar with the matter.  Doesn't that mean they're in one of the two companies?

Transcript:  is working with Goldman Sachs to help defend against possible takeover attempts.  While the Sunnyvale Company has not received an offer,  Yahoo has been working with advisors for about two weeks to field any such approach.  And they've talked with private equity funds,  including Silver Lake, about a possible bid.  I don't understand if they haven't talked to anybody about a takeover,  but they're talking to Silver Lake, isn't that about a takeover about a takeover?  So there's a contradiction in that sentence.

Transcript:  A big battle between Cablevision and Fox brewing in parts of New Jersey,  Long Island and Connecticut.  Kind of I have a feeling we're going to hear these these these wars are going to escalate.  Further and further as they are pressured by companies like Google TV and and a la carte sales and Apple.  Apparently, Fox said to Cablevision,  We want to double the amount of money you pay us or more the amount of money you pay us per subscriber.  Cablevision said no freaking way.  They turned off channel five, the local Fox affiliate who happens to broadcast the Giants games.  And then Fox pulled its stuff off Hulu for Cablevision customers.  They said, well, in that case, you can't watch Hulu Fox content on Hulu if you're a Cablevision IP address.  Then they turned it back on.  They're still at the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, neither one is thinking about the customers.  They both are thinking about the bottom line, which I can't blame them.  And I think that as customers start moving away and start using companies like Cablevision  as excellent, really a good deal on bandwidth with Optimum Online.  And I remember talking to Cablevision executives.  They seemed like smart people at the time who said, you know, we don't want to sell  people just bandwidth.  We want to sell them premium services.  We can't even survive selling bandwidth.  But that's what's happening.  And that's what all these companies, the pressure that's on these companies is  customers are just saying, well, that's fine.  No problem.  I'll just watch a la carte.

Start time: 3793.64

I mean, all they have to do is collect money, you know, just send bills out.  I mean, I don't see why they can't make money.  Maybe if they have to get rid of some people that, you know, that have nothing to do with  anything, but they got to do more than what they're doing in terms of serving the public.  I just don't know.

And again, you're absolutely right, Dwight.  I mean, the people who get screwed here are the cable customers who can't watch their  football game.  They did the last time they did this was what?

Transcript:  The other disturbing thing about this is that they were able to reach into Hulu and just  say, no, you can't do that.  And if you think that the cable providers and the content providers are going to stand  by and let things like Internet services like Hulu, you know, kill off their cash cows.  That's kind of an example.  That was just a little one.  That was a small nuclear weapon.  Is it a net neutrality issue?  Yes.  Yes, that's exactly what that was.  I think the FCC should be very interested in that.

Isn't Fox one of the partners in Hulu?  Partner?  Yes.  But Hulu is a separate company.  It's very confusing.  Right.  Yeah.  They're involved in it.  Yeah.  But I bet you Hulu got a call from Fox saying, look, you better say you did this in order  to stay neutral.  Notice the word neutral.  Well, we're just preserving neutrality because otherwise we're screwed.  I really feel for people who live in the cable vision area.  But I just think in the long run, all this does is hasten the demise of cable television  for everybody.  It seems really self-destructive.  Yeah.  But that's what happens, isn't it?  When you get look at the record industry, look at the movie industries.  Look, that's what happens when you get up against it and your business,  your old business model is starting to fail.

And it was full of parents.  And in the breakfast area in the morning where they have the free breakfast,  there were four people at one point.  I counted with iPads.  And these were parents.  I was astounded at kind of this is middle American parents  and they were kind of looking up sports scores and checking the news.  And people were crowded around looking at them.  And I saw them in restaurants going up to on the way up there from Houston  and on the way back.  I was just kind of amazed, you know, getting out of kind of the  metropolitan area where I am and going into middle America and seeing iPads everywhere.  Apple really has got a hit on its hands.

Transcript:  My first reaction to the iPad was that I didn't need to have it.  I remember you were you were underwhelmed when you saw it.  Right.  But I use it more and more.  And I wouldn't call it an amusement.  Increasingly, it's becoming the primary way I read if I want to actually read something on the web  or watch video.  I've become addicted to the to the TED Talks app, which lets you watch the TED videos that  have been available on the web forever.  But I'd much rather sit in an easy chair with my iPad and watch these videos that way.  And I learned something.  I'm also addicted to Flipboard, the app that lets you look at links on Twitter as a magazine.  Right.  And so I find myself using it as a reader and a media consumption device.  I don't like trying to do email on it.  I don't like necessarily just randomly surfing the web, but I do enjoy consuming media on it.  And I would be sad if someone took it away from me.

And I have 14 tabs open in my browser.  To me, the iPad is fantastic as a replacement for Sunday newspapers.  I use it a lot more on the weekend than I do during the work week.  And actually, I'm not sure why, but I like doing email on it.  I think maybe just because it's kind of simpler and it's not overwhelming like Gmail or Outlook.  That's the one productivity thing I do more on my iPad than any other single thing.

And I believe I make plenty of money.  I don't need to.  It's not.  You don't need to give me extra money because you give John money.  But I just I thought it was very interesting.  I think there were at least about two or three dozen people who thought, oops.  I had to give.  Nobody gave me $333.33.  I will say that.  I was at Blog World yesterday in Las Vegas.  That was a lot of fun.  And one of the boos there was Ford.  Ford was giving.  It was kind of fun.  They were giving test drives.  I drove the 2011 Mustang 5.0 and now I want to trade in my 2010.  I love it so much.  And I drove the new Ford Edge and boy was I impressed with that.  Ford is really on a roll.  We want to thank them for their support of all of our Twitch shows.  I was really glad to drive this new 2011 Edge.  It starts with a great design in the exterior and you'll see this with.  I saw the focus.  The next year's focus.  That is beautiful, too.  The design they're doing now, very fluid and aerodynamic.  The focus is going to be an international car.  The same car all around the world.  They've never done that really before.  I think they've just got designed down.  And of course inside the Edge looks a lot like my Mustang with this very clean,  classic look.  The instrument panel now they use this MyFord Touch in there.  And so you've got three screens with the MyFord Touch.  You've got a big, I think it's seven or eight inch GPS screen.  But you've got two small screens where you and one of them is a tachometer.  And one of them is like control center for your music and climate.  It's so cool.  Just beautiful fit and finish.  They're really solid cars.  It is best in class with the legroom in the second row.  I went back and sat in the back seat.  Love it.  You can get the panoramic vista roof.  That's an option with the forward panel that tilts or opens fully plus a fixed rear skylight.  So you get great air and light in the front and the back seat.  They did the same thing in the Edge that they did with my Mustang with the ambient lighting.  So you have seven color programmable ambient lighting.  It's standard and limited and sport and available on the SEL.  You program it.  And so some days I'm in a purple mood.  So the ambient lighting is purple.  Some days I'm in an orange mood.  But you're not giving up on fuel efficiency.  It's got the 3.5 liter TI-VCT V6 engine.  This is the new engine that they just,  they've done such a good job of it.  285 horsepower with unsurpassed fuel economy for its class.  The Edge has an estimated 27 highway miles per gallon.  They've also got the Edge Sport for performance.  That's got 305 horsepower, 280 foot pounds of torque, sport tuned suspension,  22 inch polished aluminum wheels is the one I drove, performance tires and more.  It was so much fun.  We were going down Las Vegas Boulevard and Lisa was driving the 2011 Mustang 5.0.  I was driving the Edge and we drag raced and it was so much fun until we got stopped.  My Ford Touch, which is brand new.  They announced that at CES in January.  I'm just kidding.  We didn't drag race.  What else in here?  You know about the SYNC.  The Touch is basically SYNC Plus.  So you can keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road,  but you get to choose your music.  It also has now these five way switch pads on the steering wheel, two of them.  Oh, it's an eight inch screen I see here.  Really gorgeous.  You can switch between the touch commands and the voice commands on the fly.  Also, by the way, the My Ford Touch is expandable,  which means you can do things like Pandora, Stitcher, Slacker radio.  Really incredible.  Two USB inputs, an SD card slot, RCA AV input jacks.  You can get an available mobile in-car Wi-Fi hotspot through a USB installed air card  or the USB mobile broadband modem.  I mean, I can just go on and on.  This is really...  But you know what you should do is you should go to your Ford,  Lincoln or Mercury dealer and test drive a Ford today and look at the SYNC.  Look at the My Ford Touch.  And if you're interested in a sport utility vehicle, take a look at the Ford Edge.  This is the highest tech Ford out there and well worth a test drive.  The 2011 Ford Edge looks good, drives great, great efficiency.  Thank you, Ford, for supporting this week in tech and for that great car.  I had a blast driving.  My wife now wants one.  We were thinking the flex.  Now she's driving the Edge and she really likes it.

Transcript:  Well, this appeals to me.  The new, my Mustang and the new one looks very much the same.  I think the only difference I could tell is instead of a matte finish  on the Ford Touch, they had a glossy finish on the Ford Touch.  But otherwise it was the same, but it's a classic look.  They've really gone back to the classic muscle car, very clean,  all analog gauges.  I just love it.  Masculine.  Masculine.  Well, you drove my car.

No, this is-  My wife and I just had a discussion about this with cars.  She says that there are certain cars,  you just, they feel like a man's car when you're in them.

It is a Wi-Fi iPad bundled for 120 extra dollars with a Mi-Fi that is locked down to it  and a bandwidth deal that is not spectacular.  But it is a deal with Verizon.

Apple's social music service, which is blocked currently by Facebook.  Apple reportedly spoke to Facebook for 18 months trying to work out a deal with ping.  Launched it with Facebook Connect.  And Facebook pulled the switch and said no.  Steve Jobs said to Kara Swisher that the terms were so onerous we couldn't agree to them.  So according to the Times...  And he should know.  Yeah, onerous terms.  You're the king of it, aren't you, Steve?  According to the Times, Jobs is trying to charm Zuckerberg with a little home cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The most interesting thing about it,  he goes into detail about what he thinks Steve's principles are for success.  But the most interesting line in the whole thing, he says,  is that they haven't talked and that Steve is still pissed,  still angry, and he doesn't want to piss Steve off.  Interesting.  What difference does it make?

End time: 5215.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is Scully doing these?  He's an investor, right?  Yeah, he's an investor.  So he doesn't...  But he's still nervous about getting on Steve's bad side.

Start time: 5215.88
End time: 5236.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's ridiculous.  What a wimp.  Can I say something about that laundry list?  That was...  He put a list of things he thought were interesting about Steve Jobs and why he's successful.  There's one...  I didn't think the list was that interesting overall,  but there was one thing on there I think that was good, it should be noted,  which is that Steve Jobs doesn't believe in focus groups.

Start time: 5236.72
End time: 5284.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep, no focus groups.  Steve said, how can I possibly ask someone what a graphics-based computer ought to be  when they have no idea what a graphic-based computer is?  No one's ever seen one before.  Scully said, Jobs believed that showing somebody a calculator, for example,  would not give them any indication as to where the computer was going to go  because it was just too big a leap.  He appraised Jobs for beautiful design.  He appraised Jobs for always looking at things from the perspective  of what was the user experience going to be.  He also looked at the supply chain, the marketing, the stores.  He's still doing it.  And that's what...  That's Scully's main point.  He's a micromanager, but...  But Scully's main point was that the principles that he knew from way back when,  that Jobs were first principles, still there, still remain.

Start time: 5285.44
End time: 5305.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the one that's interesting to me still,  because I know that big corporations in this country in particular...  They live on focus groups.  ...are cowed by focus groups.  And Steve is absolutely right, and anybody who's sensible is right.  You can't focus group new ideas to such an extreme  that you're going to get any good information from these people  because they don't have anything.  There's no frame of reference.

Start time: 5305.66
End time: 5357.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. That's a good point.  I don't do focus groups either, John.  Really?  I think this is the auteur theory of creation.  You get the best creative result if you let somebody with a great vision  create his vision.  And promote their vision.  And promote their vision.  It's interesting though that such a team effort as a technology,  when you're making an iPod, you've got designers,  you've got the supply chain, you've got the suppliers of the parts,  you've got so many pieces in this machine  that you normally don't think of it as an auteur,  some one person controlling it.  Very few people have the dominant personality that Steve Jobs has  that's required to do this from soup to nuts.  I can't think of anybody else like this.

Transcript:  Other words used to describe Jobs by Steve and by John Scully.  Perfectionism, obviously.  Vision.  He believed the computer was eventually going to become a consumer product.  That was an outrageous idea in the early 80s,  but Steve was thinking about something entirely different.  He thought the computer was going to change the world,  and it was going to become what he called the bicycle for the mind.  He was a person of huge vision.  Minimalism.

Start time: 5448.00

Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  He did, didn't he?  He said cities will be redesigned because of the Segway.  Whoops.  Well, you can, you know, you can look,  I don't think anybody's ever said Steve hasn't made some mistakes.  I think the, let's see, the cube.  Next was a mistake, really.  I mean, he really insisted that people, how many next cubes were sold?  Thousands?  It was like, in the low tens of thousands or something?

Transcript:  Hire the best.  That's true.  Sweat the details.  On one level, he's working to change the world.  The big concept.  At the other level, he's working down at the details of what it takes to actually build  a product and design the software, the hardware, the systems design, eventually the applications  and peripherals.  I'm not that great.  He was also adamantly involved in the advertising design and everything.  Go ahead, Harry.

Transcript:  I was just going to say one of the great unanswerable questions of computer history is what would  have happened if Jobs had never left?  Would he have not learned from the next experience and therefore had problems, which he didn't  when he came back, maybe a little bit humbler, or would he have accomplished even more, even  quicker?  So you didn't have this long period where Apple was nowhere near as being as much of  a force in the industry as it was during Jobs regime one and Jobs regime two?  I have to say, I think-

Start time: 5556.86

I think he did a little bit while ago and my eyes opened kind of wide when he said he  got that because John Scully is this figure, which no matter what you think of him, he was at  one of the truly monumental points in tech history.

And the result, this is a freedom of information request.  The government released a handful of documents, including a May 2008 memo  detailing how social networking sites are exploited by the FDNS.  I never heard of this.  The office of fraud detection and national security.  I don't even know who that is.

Transcript:  They're really open about that.  Anytime you go to any Google event, they say that the future of Google is a future that's  focused around mobile stuff.  So I think putting Marissa Meyer in charge is putting somebody who's been a key person  in the past of Google into the thing where they're basically putting their major bet  moving forward.

So they, they get it as well.  Finally, we'll wrap up with this, uh, sad story.  The end of one of the great mathematicians, 85 year old Benoit Mandelbrot passed away on Thursday.  He's the guy who created the Mandelbrot set and really coined the term fractals and applied  the concept of fractals.

Transcript:  A man named Benoit Mandelbrot was born.  He's the same with your mathematics and his unique geometrical insights.  Nothing well equipped to face those demons down.  You saw that infinite complexity could be described by simple rules.  Use the giant brain to turn the game around.  And right below the star, star vision innocent.  A bulbous point in the form of a picture pencil up and he wrote his secret down.

Transcript:  By the way, if any of you are mathematicians and you're just waiting anxiously to come  up to me afterwards and point out the fact that the equation is not quite right.  That I actually described the Julia set and not a Mandelbrot set.  I already know that so you don't have to come up.  This is amazing.
