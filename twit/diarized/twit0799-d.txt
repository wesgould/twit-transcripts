And the news on the left here on my left, oh Dr. Owen JJ Stone.  And really the only reason you're here Owen JJ Stone this week is because you own a PS5.  And I'm just so jealous.  I'm one of the coveted few.  The few, the proud, the PlayStation 5 owners.  So it's great to have you.  Also to my right, Mr. Mike, not politically, just well maybe you're a little to my right politically.  Unlikely.  Unlikely.  Possibly.  Mike, you're right.

Transcript:  You and I.  Two out of the three.  Actually, Georgia Dow was scheduled to be here.  She's a little under the weather.  We hope she'll feel better soon.  I don't believe it's COVID.  I think it's a piece of bad turkey.  Actually, no, she's Canadian.  Their Thanksgiving was last month.  There's no excuse.  No excuse at all.  So you came back from Mexico.  You've been in Oaxaca for the last few months.  I've been watching your pictures of beautiful food and people and a beautiful city.  I'm so jealous.  What was the COVID situation down there though?  I was worried.  It was amazing.

Transcript:  You know, it's like everybody's watching the distance and wearing masks.  And the great thing about Oaxaca, it felt like July, Leo, was summery.  All the restaurants have no roofs.  They're sort of like these little open area restaurants.  You go through the door and you're outside again in a courtyard.  And the tables are all far apart.  And it's easy to maintain distance.  And we had an entire compound to ourselves.  And so we just didn't make physical contact with anybody.  And we did a lot of social things, but everybody's super aware of it.  So it's just great.  And there are almost no cases in the city.  That's nice.  Mexico has been a hard hit, I know.  Oh, Mexico certainly has.  But mostly northern Mexico, the indigenous areas are super good.  So the indigenous groups sort of wall it off and they govern it themselves  and try to avoid people coming and going.

Transcript:  We, a few Christmases ago, spent the Christmas week at Puerto Escondido,  which is the province of Oaxaca, but it's on the ocean.  Beautiful area.  Really love it.  Sao Letos is there, the great surfing spot.  And it was, we had it all to ourselves.  The beach was kind of empty until the day after Christmas.  And then a thousand buses full of Oaxaque√±os came and basically moved in.  And apparently the week after Christmas is the week not to be on the beach in Mexico.  Learned it the hard way.  Everybody came.  But I love it.  And the food is great in Oaxaca because it's South American.  A lot of fresh fish.  Really amazing food.  And I'm sure your wife Amira went crazy because it's kind of her style of cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And in fact, we spent Day of the Dead with an indigenous Apoteco friend of ours who we were the only foreigners within like 150 miles.  And we just walked around their village and we did some cooking together.  We ate a lot of stuff.  We did all the Day of the Dead stuff.  She ritually purified us with incense.  And it was amazing.  But the thing about Oaxaca State is that 50 percent of the population is indigenous.  And so this is one of the reasons the food culture is so various and traditional.  They barely have bread.  They're super tortilla forward.  Yeah.  A lot of fresh stuff.  And in the case of our Zapoteco indigenous friend, they literally grow or raise every bite they take.  Like everything.  They raise the animals.  They grow their own corn.  It's just an amazing food culture.

Start time: 510.66
End time: 533.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I was going to hope you didn't ask me that because it's going to make you really upset.  Do you know how I got one?  How?  The internet scam of America right now is for people to have a friend that works at a Best  Buyer anywhere to get the PS5s off of a truck.  Right?  Yeah.  All of your popular Instagrammers or Twitter people are raffling off PlayStations and things  like that.  Right?  So I bought a raffle ticket for $25 and I want to pay...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the new scam right now.  The raffle thing is amazing.  Some people do it for $50 and they take less entries, but they're still...  It's more than eBay or anything else.  And you know what the cutest thing about that is?  On top of that scam, there's a double scam of if you just get one PS5, you take a picture  of yourself with it, you do the raffle.  If you have a big enough following, you make five grand, then you need to go buy one off  of eBay for $1,000 and have it drop shipped to the winner.  So for four grand, you never even touch the PS5, which would be $5,000.  I'm just telling people this is what the scam is.

And everybody, I go to Reddit and everybody goes, thanks a lot, nothing for nothing, Walmart.  I don't know.  I just...  It's all right.  Every store gets two.  You can wait until after Christmas.  I'm going to be fine.  Well, what I wanted it for...  $4,000 off of eBay.  The hot game, I think, of the year, maybe of the decade.  A lot of times these overhyped hot games end up being terrible, but I'm very excited about  Cyberpunk 2077, starring Keanu Reeves.  But that's not why I'm excited about it.  But it's coming out December 10th, and I'm going to play it, not on a PlayStation 5,  not on an Xbox Series X.  I'm going to play it on my new Mac...  My real pride and joy, my new Macintosh MacBook Pro 13.  How, you may ask, Leo, how could you possibly play that game?  It'll be interesting.  Owen's doing an impression of how the game is going to look.  So it's Stadia.  It's the Google Stadia, which is their streaming game playing platform.  They are offering a preorder of Cyberpunk 2077.  Chrome is native on the M1.  Chrome 87 has actually been compiled for Apple's platform.  And I'm hoping...  I'm thinking I'm plugging into the ethernet.  You know, I have a gigabit service.  Maybe this will be good.  I'm joking.

Cyberpunk.  Really interesting article.  I did not know this.  You probably did.  You're a serious gamer.  In the Atlantic this month about a guy named Mike Pondsmith  who created Cyberpunk in 1988, but he didn't write a novel.  He didn't write a book.  He wrote a bunch of games, role-playing games, Dungeons and Dragons type games.  There are now 50 books, more than 5,000 pages.  According to the Atlantic, it's one of the most extensively and fastidiously imagined worlds in fiction.  And it is the inspiration for Cyberpunk 2077, which I had no idea I should have known.

Transcript:  Wait, what? That's a thing?  That's a thing.  I've got a game, Uncle Leo. I've got a game.  I've got it written out. It's a book this thick.  I've got sketches, layouts. It's called Hustle World.  I'm about to go sell my book.  You need Hustle World.  If they can... Oh, man. You know what?  Because I'm never going to do it and I don't know anybody, so I just put it out there so somebody wants to contact me.  Hustle World.  Basically, you get to be...  You get to be a cop, so you go up through the police ranks, or you get to be a street person, you go up through the ranks.  And each place has a mafia, and then the cops are trying to take down the mafia, and then you can have people that are spies in the mafia,  or you could go... If you're really smart, you send your kid to go work in the police force, and then he helps you scam and get stuff in.  But it's a whole thing about hustling, and you can either be on the good side or the bad side.  Sometimes you're corrupt on both ends.

Transcript:  Cyberpunk 2077 looks like something that might bring me back in, especially since it will be available on the Mac that I'm going to be buying.  There you go.  I love the cyberpunk genre. Back in the 90s, I was super into the cyberpunk music culture.  Back then, it was super raw, super, super raw.  I used to love that stuff, but I sort of moved on from that as well.  I still love the whole cyberpunk aesthetic.  In fact, I really love, I'll admit it, the cyberpunk subreddit, which is full of mostly fan-based imagery that's very cyberpunkish.  I think it was Mercedes or BMW. One of the big motorcycle manufacturers just came out with a cyberpunk-style scooter.  Which looks so cool.

Transcript:  This is the subreddit you were talking about.  For me, it started with Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash, which has perhaps the best first chapter in science fiction history.  It goes downhill from there, but it's got a great first chapter.  I'm a huge Neil Stephenson fan, but everybody, even Neil Stephenson fans admit he has a hard time finishing stories.  Then of course, William Gibson's Neuromancer is perhaps the pinnacle of cyberpunk literature.  1984. Brilliant. I believe it was written in 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not so much that, but you'd find friends that were into that.  Then that's what got me into it because I was so much into the whole role-playing lore and worlds and stuff that people were creating.  I was like, oh, there's a game you can play. I'm like, what game is that?

Transcript:  It's an unboxing of the AT. I don't know what makes it so cyberpunk.  I like it though.  Yeah. I suspect we're going to see, especially in this kind of dystopian world we live in now, a resurgence of cyberpunk over the next year.  Get ready. But you can trace it back to some degree to this guy.  Let me read you a paragraph from this Atlantic profile.  Again, this is a black man named Mike Pondsmith who wrote all this stuff.  Pondsmith, now in his 60s, has been known to wear his own cyberpunk uniform, black leather jacket, black jeans, motorcycle boots, mirror shades.  That's kind of the thing. Classic. Classic. And a Japanese sword.  Yeah, right. Today at home in the suburbs of Seattle, he's in a black t-shirt and regular spectacles.  It's fitting we're speaking over Zoom, the kind of now ubiquitous telepresence technology that felt futuristic in Blade Runner in 1982.  But here's the quote. Writing, Pondsmith tells me, is a lot like basically eating a pound of dough, a whole pepperoni, a couple of pounds of mozzarella and a bunch of spices, then throwing up a pizza.  He's right. I've literally done that.  His oeuvre, which is again tabletop D&D gaming, is published by a company called All Our Talsorian Games.  And a Polish video game developer, CD Projekt Red, contacted them in 2012 about adapting the cyberpunk D&D games for this game, Cyberpunk 2077.  So I thought it'd be worth mentioning this guy Pondsmith because he deserves credit for what we're all about to enjoy. Me in 12 frames per second splendor.

Transcript:  I got my M1 on Tuesday or Monday, Monday, I guess. So I've had it for a little less than a week.  I got the MacBook Pro 13 inch maxed out 16 gigs. That's all you can get at the top.  Two terabyte SSD. It's fast. It's really fast. As long as you're running.  Well, it's fastest if you can run native apps and those are few and far between app. All of Apple's stuff is updated.  And then the hardcore Apple developers, people like Cable Sasser at Panic Software are quickly pulling pushing out M1 universal binaries.  I think I term the terminal program I use is so there's that there's that layer of, you know, yeah, these are optimized for and they really I mean they launch instantly.  Microsoft Office, the beta is available.  I think Microsoft is not ever going to do anything too snappy on a Mac platform, but it's available.  And then there's a second layer, which is stuff that is running an emulation under Rosetta 2.  When you run your first Rosetta 2 x86 application, it installs Rosetta.  It takes a while. The first time any application runs, it cranks through it so that it can do adjust in time.  Actually, it's not just an advanced compilation of some of it. So it'll run faster. This only happens once at the beginning.  And those run pretty well. But what people don't talk about, you were talking about the fact that, you know, there's no discrete GPU.  There's no, you know, it doesn't have ray tracing. It doesn't have, you know, a Xeon with 18 cores or anything.  But for what it is, it's extremely snappy.  For what it is, it is amazing.  What the hell is that on your forehead? Is that an apple?  It's my apple sticker.  I have a notch haircut, but I'm covering it up with my bangs.

Transcript:  And it was one of the first things that I could put my 8K on, not raw, but I could put 8K on from my camera.  And just like how people show you in their little YouTube videos, it just streams and it plays.  The minor stutter, whereas my beast machine, I had to run proxies to run the 8K raw.  So I was already impressed with that. And then once it dropped, I was like, all right, I know I have to get one.  Again, to what I said earlier before we started to show, not for like movie making stuff, but for regular people, for YouTube people, for like on a budget people.  This thing is game changing. Like for if you get 700 bucks, you can get the base model of a mini and you could be in there like swimwear without headaches and processing power or editing.  Editing videos alone, part of it is amazing. And if you're a photographer, you make audio, it's just going to be butter.  They've created a huge problem in the market.

Transcript:  If you are using kind of mainstream apps, especially if you're a Mac, you know, hardcore Mac guy and using Mac apps, you're going to love it.  You're going to love it. It's going to be, I think it's so one of the things I expected to really love it.  I've been one of those people saying this is a revolution. I still think it is.  And you know, Owen, when you get to the M2 or the rumored M1X with a 16 inch MacBook Pro and the M2 next year, a three, and you're having many more cores and many more GPU, you're going to you're going to really see some amazing stuff.  This is clearly a family that has a lot of headroom, a lot of room for growth and is going to rapidly outpace what is now a 30 year old architecture, the x86 architecture.  So we can say that. But there are going to be some growing pains.  And I was I'm actually a little bit less excited about it now that I have one because of two things.  One, it's going to be a while. For some reason, it's going to be a while before a lot of the edge case tools even work.  I was surprised at how few development tools I use don't even run.  Lisp won't run. I just now got a development version of EMAX that works.  And if that's fully native, I use a tool called racket doesn't work.  A lot of stuff just won't run. And I think it's not merely that it's ARM architecture because most open source tools have an ARM version.  Apple has taken this opportunity to super lock down the Macintosh.  And I think this is actually going to be a bit of an issue going forward.  It is not an open platform anymore. They asked Linus Torvalds, what do you think of the new M1, the creator of Linux?  He said, I'd love to run Linux on it. I'm guessing we will never get it running on it because of Apple's T2 chip at security.  The way they're locking this thing down, it is kind of hostile to, I think, to outside developers.

Transcript:  Their bridge, you can see it coming from the fact the way the phones work with the App Store, that they want everything to work in an App Store environment.  And this is the final countdown for that to start happening to where they can say, OK, you want to come back in and play? These are the new rules.  It's a walled garden.  Yeah. And I mean, before you didn't have that issue because it was Intel.  But now they really can say yes, no, yes, no. And they're probably going to slow roll that too because they want to wait until they get more better processors and things like that out into the market.  So again, we've been having issues over the last, like, what, two years with people wanting to sue Apple and have the ratios change, the percentages change.  I can only see this getting worse for them as some kind of quasi monopoly in this market for what they're allowing on their systems.

And I feel like I read it's going to future Hands on Mac episode, but I read, speaking of Neil Stephenson, he wrote a wonderful book about 30, 20 or 30 years ago, I guess 20 years ago, called In the Beginning There Was the Command Line.  And he talks about Windows and Macintosh and Linux. He actually mentions BOS, so that dates it.  But one of the things he says is he said, imagine a crossroads with four car dealerships.  There's the car dealership that's making bicycles, basically.  And then across the street, along comes this dealership. That's Windows. Along comes this dealership. Actually, that's DOS.  The dealership across the street that's making these very sleek automobiles. They're kind of futuristic.  The DOS guys look across the street, say, oh, and they make a moped. They put an engine on the bicycle and they say, see, and it's slowly gotten better.  Now it's kind of a family station wagon, but it breaks down a lot. It needs a lot of gas. It's burning oil.  Meanwhile, across the street, you've got these snooty people using these very slick, high performance, kind of closed universe things.  And then there's a bunch of hippies in yurts and tents who are building Linux and they're making these amazing RVs and they're putting them on the side of the road saying, they're free.  Come get them. They're free. They work really well. They're open. They're free.  But people go, no, no, you hippie. I'm going to go buy a station wagon or one of these.  And he says later, he said, oh, you know, actually, the Mac isn't so bad. I'm starting to like it.  But I think actually that that future that he described is becoming more and more real, that we're now seeing three distinct paths.  I've talked a little bit about this before, but now having used the M1 for a week, I have a much clearer vision of Microsoft really doesn't care what you use.  They're going to virtualize Windows, Windows Virtual Desktop with the very bad acronym WVD is coming next year.  And that's what I think a lot of businesses will end up using with some sort of cheap, thin client, kind of like Stadia, but not for games, for business software.  Apple's making what is essentially an appliance play, just like the phone, just like the iPad. Their computers are going to be appliances.  They'll work great. They'll be secure. And as long as you don't want to deviate, you know, that command line, that whole Unix thing.  And then there's there's going to be these funky as Linux machines that will maybe run on, you know, some people are speculating, maybe Qualcomm will look across the street and say, oh, we could do that and make something like the M1 because they've always focused on low power over performance.  And but but essentially Linux is going to be the last bastion of the hippie, the open source, the freedom developer, because Apple's going to just lock it down more and more.  And that concerns me, frankly.

I mean, again, I two years ago, I switched back to Windows because she just was looking better.  And I'm not going to switch back to Apple to Apple like M2.78 blows my brain out because again, right now, proxies or whatever, I can render five or 10 lines of 4K and 8K and I can sit here and work on my machine.  I can't do with these M1s yet. I don't care what nobody says.  So the future cool. But right now, I love the fact that I got all this RAM in here.

I mean, I don't think I mean, Leo, you said that you found it disconcerting  that the hippies are getting even more open and they know that's good.  Mac is coming. That's good.  The world's divided even further than it used to be.  But I don't think that's disconcerting at all.  I think that, you know, for the vast majority of people, of course,  it's going to be computing in general.  The experience is going to be an appliance experience.  They don't care about. They'll be happy.  They don't care about the M1.  They don't care about the details, just they want to do everything  that they want to do and they don't want to think about it even further.  Then there are two kinds of power users.  There's the super technical.  I want to build everything, do everything from scratch, understand everything,  control and customize everything.  Those people will be on Linux.  And then there are the power hungry maniacs like Owen.  They're just drunk with power and they need like, you know, terabytes of storage  and massive quantities of anything they want and don't want to be stopped.  And I actually think it's kind of a beautiful thing that we have at least three options  generally for different personality types, different work styles,  different types of people.  And I just think it's a beautiful thing.  I will say, though, as a Chrome, as a Pixelbook user and a Mac user,  as a Pixelbook user and a Chromebook user, which I'm going to move to Apple,  next move is going to be to an Apple laptop,  I think it's gotten to the point where the Pixelbook and the Chromebook,  the high-end Chromebooks, this is one of the best places to run Linux these days.  I agree.

We're talking about Apple.  I don't know what to make of this story  at all. Apple's  head of global security,  you'd think a guy would be pretty buttoned down,  has been  indicted,  indicted by the Santa Clara  County Sheriff's Department.  The California court  has indicted Thomas Moyer.  He's accused of offering  iPads to the Santa Clara County  Sheriff's Office in exchange  for concealed carry permits for  four Apple employees.  In a  famous iPad for  concealed carry trade.

Start time: 2249.83
End time: 2360.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this story because it lends itself  to such delicious tabloid  headlines. No kidding.  Apple busted in guns for iPad  schemes.  It's just so fun.  But basically the details are less  salacious than that.  I mean, it still appears  to be criminality. But apparently there are a couple  of people in the Sheriff's Office.  Of course, in California, sheriffs  get to decide who gets gun permits  of various types. And they have  wide discretion. There are some counties you cannot  get a gun at all.  These guys were apparently  using their ability to  withhold permits to get  little benefits for the department.  And when Apple came  to get four gun permits,  they basically said, well, if you want those  permits, we'd really love some iPads.  And so, Apple,  so they said, we'd love  essentially $70,000 worth  of iPads for you to get four concealed  carry permits for security guards  at Apple. And  it appears  to be that Apple may have  said, okay.  And before  the deal went down, the Sheriff's  Office found out that there were  search warrants  to pursue this criminal  charge. But it's really,  I don't think, this isn't a matter  of Apple's head of security  going to the Sheriff and say, hey,  how about some iPads for some?  No, it was the  impetus was the Sheriff's  Office, which was demanding this  in exchange for something that Apple felt like  they really needed.  In a, you know, security  for big tech companies,  I think, what is it?  Zuckerberg, Facebook  spends millions of dollars a year  just on Mark Zuckerberg's personal  security.  A few iPads, big deal, right?

Start time: 2361.61
End time: 2400.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple says,  after learning the allegations, we conducted  a thorough internal investigation and found  no wrongdoing.  We should point out that  Laurie Smith, who  is the Sheriff,  has been accused in the past  of deliberately  withholding permits to carry concealed weapons  until applicants did favors  for her.  The local NBC affiliate did an  investigation in June that found donors  to Smith's re-election campaign  were 14 times more likely  to get concealed carry permits  than those who didn't donate.  So this sounds like a long time  little shakedown.

Start time: 2401.18
End time: 2436.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, they police themselves,  Mike, so I'm not worried about it.  And  not for nothing, if anybody can really look into  something, it's Apple. Like when Apple wants to look into  something, they don't check text messages,  they got to record a phone call. They got everything.  Yeah. They got GPS data location,  how long did you spend in their office?  You couldn't have put that deal together in 3.5  minutes. So we know that you didn't do it.  But that kind of thing,  I'm from the East Coast. So in New York, you hear about  this kind of stuff all the time  around carry concealed permits.

And I have to say that  my experience and the experience of everybody  reviewing these things is  it's very impressive with what Apple  has done with a first generation  chip.  The thing to watch before you go buy one is  are the tools you use going to be native?  If they are, you're going to have an amazing experience.  That's what I think.  Apple is  talking to Foxconn  and others,  Pegatron, another supplier,  about moving production  out of China as China gets  more uncertain as the  trade war goes on.  And in fact,  a Biden presidency will not change  that according to Bloomberg.  They're talking about moving  to  anywhere but China.  India, Southeast Asia,  the Americas, Foxconn.  Apparently,  not only politics, but also China is  getting more expensive. Maybe that's tariffs.  But Vietnam and India are  proving competitiveness.  I wish they would look at  opening plants in the US. I really do.  I don't know why they don't.

Transcript:  Well, a couple of things.  First of all, this is part of a longer  trend that's been accelerated by the coronavirus.  People are realizing that  consolidating everything in one country  is super risky and that you  want not just to get out of China,  but to be in multiple locations.  Diversify.  It's a little more expensive. But one of the  reasons China is getting more expensive is simply  because there is a saturation  among their workforce. It's actually difficult  now to hire  qualified people in  China. And so the wages are going  up in China. China is emerging  as an economic power  and wages go up. So this is just part  of the normal, this is one of the beautiful  things about capitalism. It takes a very  poor country, raises them up,  feeds a lot more people,  and then they move out because  they have all, and then they become  consultants or whatever.  You talk about the Americas, specifically  the two most likely places in the Americas  are Brazil and Mexico,  great places for manufacturing.  The United States is a horrible place for  manufacturing. Americans  make way too much money  and are way too  entitled  to do this kind of factory work.  You have to have a super  motivated and yet  super educated and yet relatively  low paid  workforce in order to do the kind of factory  work that China set the mold  for. And Americans just don't want  to do that stuff.  They just want to get paid for it.

Transcript:  They just want to get paid for it.  That kind of stuff makes me really  mad because they want to pay these people  nothing and have to put nets up on their buildings  so people don't jump out of their windows  making Nikes and phones and all this  kind of stuff, paying them nothingness.  So let's move to another country where people have  nothing, work them to the bone and give  them nothing. So we would do the work  here. People used to build cars here and  build everything here, but  we also care about our environment, we  care about the waste that goes into our  water system and how our kids are going to survive,  but we're sure happy to go send it off to China,  fog up their things, have them wear  a mask ten years before everybody else,  and now move it on down to another country.  So I mean, there's just grand scope on  this whole Americans don't want to do the job  thing. We want to do the job, we want to  dump properly, we want to dump right for  the  ecosystem, and we want to get paid for  that money because you know we got to have the profits.  This shoe only cost you $13,  Nike, bought, sold, and shipped.  But we only paid the person 30 cents a day  now we're going to sell this shoe for $250,  hopefully hit the opposite  market and goes for $1,000.  So again, I'll shut up again, but that's  the scope.

Transcript:  If I was paid a better living wage, it'd be easier for me  to afford the hike that's going to come up on this  also. The fact that wages haven't gone up  in the last 20 years and people are fighting and complaining  about that, keeping most average Americans  in poverty making under $34,000 a year  is the problem. Buying this phone is not the issue.  I could buy this phone all day. My daughter's got  an iPhone 11 Pro, 256 gig.  I dropped $1,300 on my kids.  A lot of people can afford a phone,  a one-time purchase, but if you're making more  money, you can afford the cost  and what uptake for that if you didn't have  to have the greed and the money you're making.  Bezos out here in the pandemic  making a billion dollars won't give people two weeks  sick leave when they get corona. So it runs  rampant through their system. You know, you're going to  get somebody a $300 bonus, you could give  somebody $1,000 or $10,000.  It wouldn't hurt your bottom line one bit. Your wife  took half and you still out here balling.  But it's not about that. It's not about taking care of people.  It's about greed and profits  and stocks. So again, America would  do the job if you were properly paid for the job  and the job was done the right way.  But we have politicians, we have people paying  money to hide their money overseas. They don't even want to pay  taxes. There's a whole other issue besides  Americans not wanting to do a job  that they should do if they got paid properly  for it. There's an advantage also

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in China. Part of it is, you know, the  Chinese workers get $100 a week. So that's  certainly a part of it.  There's also an advantage because  you've got areas  where everything is made.  It's quick to ship. You could do  just-in-time production. They've  created regions.  In other words, there's a logistic advantage  to manufacturing in  China.  That's why I find it interesting that  WisTron, Pegatron, Foxconn, they're all  thinking about moving out of China. Because a lot  of the suppliers are still going to be in China.  I guess they're also in Taiwan and they're also in Korea.  That's part of it. There was a study  of, I think, a year ago  or two years ago that said  a made in America iPhone would cost $2,000.  So $1,500 more?  Yeah, $500 more.

So again, it's always the  thing of, I'm a small business owner, so I know  the complaint of not wanting to pay people and the  price you could pay people. So I do know  there's a threshold for that, but it's really the biggest  scam in the world to act like you can't  afford to pay people. And oh, the price is  where everything's going to go up. Yeah, but your wages went up, bro.

So if you're a company competing with other  companies and you have the choice to  have something manufactured in China,  like everything is manufactured in China,  or manufactured in the United States,  you're either going to price  yourself out of the market or you're not.  And if you price yourself out of the market, you're out of business  and therefore companies that are  willing to pay for U.S. wages don't  exist because they go out of business because their  prices are too high.

Transcript:  people embrace  the concept of the boycott  for real.  If the  consumer public stopped  buying things based on  this thing is the cheapest thing you  can buy, then everything  would change. But that's not the case.  Look at airlines, for example.  Flying used to be awesome,  and now it's horrible. Why? Because people  just go and buy the cheapest ticket.  They don't buy based on what  has the best food or the best service or  the nicest people or whatever.  To cut back to meet the  actual demand of actual consumers,  they have to  make everything cheap and horrible.  That's exactly what happens in manufacturing.  People buy based on the lowest  price, and therefore, things  are manufactured in sweatshop conditions.  In China,  they're being increasingly  by literally slave labor,  where they're using these  Uighurs. They round up by the  millions based on the fact that they're Muslims,  and they put them into forced  labor situations. They're major  American corporations that are actually having things  manufactured by  slaves,  basically.  Nobody gives a crap.  I think we should all, as  consumers, do a reset and say,  let's buy the stuff that is  where the people working in  the factory are making  a living wage, where there's no  exploitation, and  so on. That will  create a market for humane  manufacturing, whether it's in the U.S.  or otherwise.

It's the Uighur Forced  Labor Prevention Act, which  would require U.S. companies to guarantee  they do not use imprisoned or coerced workers  from the  Uighur majority, the Muslim minority,  in Xinjiang.  Apparently, according to the  Washington Post, Apple's  actually lobbying  against this.  Of course they are.  Apple, of course,  which makes a lot of hay about  saying, no, no, no, we do everything we  can to make sure that the workers  are treated humanely, and  they're paid fairly.

The quicker way to just have peace on Earth  would just be to take money out of  politicians' pockets and not be able to fund  the lobbyists and do that stuff. If we did that,  we'd have a lot more fair system. And the other  scam, I want to talk about what Apple is.  They run that stupid commercial and tell me,  oh, the box is thinner, and we're going to help  the environment by not putting a power brick  in the box because there's already a  million power bricks inside the ecosystem.  And taking 55,000 cars  off the road. And yes, and inside  this box with this phone is a cable that  goes to a USB-C. Mind  you that every phone previous to this  had a USB power brick  to it. So you still go  and buy a new one.  And they just lie to you  to make it because we care about the environment  and we're going to save 400,000 trees  by not giving you something.

It's my guess they're not  lobbying to make the protections for  many of your companies stronger.  Yeah. I doubt it.  Yeah.  Now, I'm depressed,  but there's some good news.  Remember that Foxconn plant  in Wisconsin? They got huge  tax breaks for.  They broke the ground for.  It's going to be employing millions of people  by now.  Not actually doing anything.

Instead, Amazon  has  gone on a hiring spree  in the last 10 months.  new employees  mostly  working of course in  warehouses.  Some of them outside  the US and India and Italy.

And that doesn't happen because of  everything that goes on with business. But  he could give these people  a little bit of stimulus in his own company  that would change their lives and their  lifestyles. Instead of giving a hundred  million dollars imaginary to the environment,  you know, when he says, oh, I'm giving $10 billion  to help save the rainforest with  no plan, with no outline, with no  nothing. You just put this out, you get pressed  and people say, oh, so you care as well the environment.  How about you put that money back into the people  and just help them?

Eight hundred ten thousand workers in the United  States, about 85% of them are frontline  employees in warehouses and operations.  They earn the minimum  wage in all  Amazon plants, regardless  of what the state minimum is, of $15  an hour. That's more  than a retail job, but it's lower than  typical warehousing jobs.  Amazon said this week it would pay  bonuses of $300  for full-time employees, and $150.  It sounds so small.  And I have to say,  my daughter, who works full-time  for Trader Joe's and makes  what she considers a living wage,  it's the minimum wage,  it's not a living wage.  It's very hard to live on  the minimum wage,  at least in Marin County of California.

So, for example,  the people who work at Amazon,  you can say, well,  if it's so horrible, just go get another job.  Well, Amazon itself has  destroyed  many of the types of companies  that they would otherwise work at.  And again, it all boils down to  the individual choices of consumers.  All of us, myself included, I'm  100% guilty in this regard,  just go to Amazon, they got my address,  overnight delivery, credit card,  I can read it. And so, we just  all just reflexively go to Amazon,  and our own convenience  and our own desire  to pay the lowest price  overwhelms our  sort of  collective humanitarianism.  We really should be buying through all kinds  of other retailers, and if we did that, not only  would those companies do better,  but those employees  who work at Amazon would have other  places to work.  Again, that's not going to happen. People are  more self-interested than they are  interested in contributing  to the greater good. People want these jobs.

Like if you actually took the time  to learn how to code, they're offering really  great wages for those jobs if you want to  take the time to either get educated  or educate yourself and get one of those jobs.  That's one of the things that they're hiring  for also. They're looking for coders on all  levels, and that starts at like  $54,000 to $100,000.  It's just one of those things  where it's like I know you could do  better, and I just see  the things that they do  on a micro scale of the way they can  crush businesses because  now they are so big.  Just a little inside science.  With their returns now, they basically  consolidate everything off, and they've  branched out to multiple different  stores to where instead of just returning  through Amazon, you take it to a store  and they consolidate and ship it all back.  Well, they go to the store and they say, hey, we've got this new  thing. We're going to bring people into your store.  We're going to give you a dollar,  say a dollar per item, right?  The store's like, okay, cool. I've never dealt with Amazon.  Whatever. The first three months, they're like,  boom, we're making all this money. This is great.  We're also doing a lot of extra work.  After six months, Amazon's like, eh,  you know what? We're going to go put them in four other stores.  If you don't lower your price by  67, 75%,  we're just going to cut you out.  Now you're like, you don't buy all these supplies, you've got  all this different chain, you've trained all these people  into this stuff. I guess I have  to accept the 30 cents  on the dollar now because what am I going to do?  Say no and then not get  anything. So they're so strong  that they affect other  businesses like UPS  shipping, like FedEx shipping, the post  office. They are just unindating  America. I don't know about the world,  but America, they've got their hands  on everything right now. And it's  a technical marvel. It's impressive.  But it's also really greedy.

Regular people found out  that at Halloween, you don't have  to go into a store to return your costumes.  So for the last two years, every  year after Halloween, the next day  and for the next week, at two of my stores  low, we return two, three thousand costumes.  Family of f**ks come in and return  every single costume. Because you  don't have to walk back into Walmart, into the Halloween store  and be embarrassed and say, oh  well, it didn't fit. Like you  wore it out on Halloween. You know you wore it to a party.  And then you walk out embarrassed. But  the computer doesn't know. So you buy  it on the 15th and you make sure you got the  extra 15 day window. And every one of their  mom is returning Halloween costumes  to which they're just going into what? A waste  pile or something?  You know they're not selling them again. Yeah.

Transcript:  I don't want to pop  your bubble here. I'm reading  Jonathan Alter's wonderful new biography  of Jimmy Carter.  And this was the last time this happened.  You may remember... The best ex-president we ever had.  You may remember Richard M. Nixon  impeached before  he got kicked out, resigned.  Gerald Ford took over.  And in 1976, a couple of years  later, Ford ran against Carter. And  Carter's whole thing was, in fact, his  slogan was, I will never lie to you.  He ran on  integrity. He ran  on telling the truth.  Perhaps to his detriment, because four years  later, a guy, a Hollywood  actor, who instead of  telling the truth, just said, everything's  going to be okay. It's  a golden era in America.  It's morning in America. He won  and ran again  in another four years. And it  arguably was senile by then.  Didn't matter, because it wasn't  that Americans had  wanted integrity in the office.  They didn't. They turned on Jimmy Carter.  They said, we don't like you. You're too honest.  Malaise. Oh, yuck.  They wanted  somebody who would lie to them pretty.  And that was Ronald Reagan  for eight years.

Transcript:  Well, the difference between the  two, you have to  have to make this distinction.  Nixon's  and Trump's corruption  was self-dealing.  It was designed to help themselves  in the case of Nixon and Trump politically  and in the case of Trump  financially. In the case of  Reagan,  love him or hate him, Reagan's  cheating and lying was  in the service, was a misguided  attempt to help the United States.  The Iran-Contra scandal  was designed  to cheat for national  security. It wasn't designed to cheat  for personal gain.  No, absolutely not.  Money or any of that stuff. So I'm going to  give  Reagan a relative  pass because he  was not lining his own pockets.  Whereas I think the  in the last four years,  it's not just the Trump administration or the people  around Trump or  the Senate or anything.  In general, there's been a sickening,  rampant  lying and cheating in the culture  in general. And I think  a lot of people feel the way I do.  Fed up with it. Absolutely fed up  with it. How do we get away from the liars and the  cheaters? And I think that  we have to come to  understand the fact that  ethics and morality is something  that you work  on. It's like going to the gym. You have to  work on it. You have to think  about it. You can't just reflexively  reward the liars and cheaters.  Otherwise, they grow in the culture and they  become out of control, which is  exactly what's happened. So I think we're in  a totally different era than the Nixon  era or the Reagan era.  We're in a whole other  place right now, especially with the  recession and the coronavirus  and all this stuff. We've all suffered. I think it's really  changed us as a culture.  I think everybody  ought to join  those of us who are  super interested in re-embracing  ethics  and civic

If you go over your cap,  $10 per 50 gigabytes,  up to $100.  Imagine your internet costing  $100 more every month.  And here's the,  and I used to get in such arguments with  Dvorak over this. He's not here to defend himself.  But I'm just going to say,  it's my opinion, there is no  technical reason  at all for data  caps. It doesn't  solve any problem.  They'll say, oh, you know, your neighbor's using  too much. That is not true.  It is not a way  to protect their network  at all. It's a way  to extract more money  out of you. It's extortion.  And it is particularly aimed at  those of us who undermine  Comcast's business model by  streaming Netflix  or Amazon Prime or iTunes  or whatever instead of paying the  cable bill.

And one of them  is to provide an alternative  in various markets.  So we'll see what the reality of that whole service  is in terms of the pay, in terms  of the bandwidth and all that kind of stuff.

Transcript:  Competition is key.  And the FCC  has essentially created these duopolies.  The cable company  is a monopoly in your town. It's a regional  monopoly. The phone company,  the ILEC, is a  regional monopoly. And those are the two internet  service providers for almost 90%  of Americans.  Incidentally, you might say, well, how do you  know, Leo, that  they don't have to do these data caps?  They say they have to because  bandwidth is limited. And Dvorak and I used to  get in this argument. I said bits is  water. It doesn't cost  them more to give you more water.  They'll make more bits.  And the proof is in the pudding.  For 60 days during the coronavirus  pandemic, back this past summer,  they lifted caps.  They were nice.  They said, you're going to be zooming. You're going to be doing that.  That only lasted two months.  Did the internet collapse?  Did everybody die?  Were we unable to get online? No.  In fact, since they've turned those caps back on,  I noticed Amazon's down a lot more.  Microsoft's down a lot more.  There was no side effect  to eliminating caps for two months.

OK, we're just going to charge you whatever  dollar amount it is. But now it still works.  The internet hasn't fallen apart  because now every cell phone service offer is  unlimited and now with their fake 5G  in most places, the internet is still fine.  It's just great.

They're just using our service  so much more than these other people.  There's got to be a way to extract all kinds of money  out of these people. And they just  can't stand the fact that there's such a  divergence of  consumption for  their product. And logically  they think, well, we've got to just  make some mint out of these people. We've got to  improve our, you know, sort of how we look  to our  shareholders and  show growth. Let's just screw  these guys. They're overusing  it. But the reality is that just when you  offer a public service like that, that's what you're going to  get. You're going to get super users.  You're going to get people barely use anything.

They know that at  first they were in denial for a long time saying  no, no, no, we're not worried about cord cutters.  Now they know the time is  rapidly approaching when people will stop  getting their TV services and just do  it over the Internet. Their whole plan  right now is, well, we're going to make the Internet  as expensive as cable TV was  so that we can maintain our profits.

I bought you just for football.  I got to cancel them and pause them every once in a while.  Then you got HBO, give it out, HBO,  Mac. Now there's too much streaming.  And if the cable company said, hey, look,  we're going to bundle this and give you  this, then I'd probably go back to cable  because cable just got so outrageous  that now  when you add up 32 subscriptions, you know what I mean?  I'm cheating. I'm not paying everything.  I got one person with Netflix, got another person with  Disney.  We're out here, we're in a coalition,  but I'm saying there's too many subscriptions going on right now.  So if the cable companies cut down,  they'd make all that money back.  They could switch the pendulum around for themselves.  But they'd rather just try to work for internet.

Transcript:  The number of paid TV households  buying cable peaked in 2010,  10 years ago,  at 105 million.  It's been dropping ever since.  By the next couple of years,  it'll probably be down to 72 million.  It's widely  expected it'll end up half  of that. There'll still be people using  cable TV for a while,  but it's slowly going away.  And actually, I think the trend is  actually accelerating because I look at  anybody under 25,  and their entire  content comes from YouTube.  They don't watch cable  TV.  So, Nick  at Night viewership down 24%,  AMC down 22%,  FX down 21%,  USA Networks 19%,  TBS down 16%,  TNT down 14%.  It's across the board.  And so these companies are  scrambling. Now, Starlink's interesting  because I think Starlink might be expensive.  They're launching  satellites like crazy. Just launched another  60 last week.  They are currently charging $99  a month.  But up front, you have to pay $500  for the satellite dish.

But we  do know that the satellite dish  is super expensive.  They're taking a bath.  They're selling at below cost.  Yes. And so there's  some  uncertainty there that  we don't know about. But I think  that in the end, I think it will be  a kind of  expensive service.  But with the trend of people  moving out of cities and moving  to rural areas, to me,  one of the biggest  reasons why  you don't want to build a house in the middle of  nowhere is internet connectivity. It's just  awful out in the sticks.  And now with the improvements  in solar power,  and now with the internet based satellite  like Starlink, you're going to be able to  buy a piece of property in the middle of nowhere  with no infrastructure.

So you can at least get  your phone to work. But there's no cable going out your way  or anything like that.  There might be. However,  my brother has a piece of  property just six miles  west. And they have  nothing out there. They have no  and he just can't  wait to get Starlink. They don't  have their phones. Their cell phones don't work.  They don't get cable. They don't get  anything. And yet,  they are building a house there and they're  living on this property and they do have  electricity. They're going to build a septic system.  They can have everything  except for the internet connectivity,  which of course is their whole livelihood.  It's kind of the dream, living off the grid.  Totally.  And there's a  sort of  self-reinforcing phenomenon  that's happening as we  speak. So people are moving out of cities.  Richer people are moving out of cities.  People with jobs that they can do online  are moving out of cities.  But you gotta have internet to do that.

Transcript:  Yes. But what's  happening with all this flight from cities  is the cities are going to  become less desirable places  to live. These are the people that support  the yuppie,  the hipster coffee shops  and all the cool things that makes living in a city  so great. And so city living  is going to  get worse, which is going to inspire  more people to leave the cities, which is going to  make the cities even worse, etc.  So we're going to see, I think, our  major cities turn into what they were in the 70s,  which is horrible  places to live.  And I think a lot more people are going to be living in the  sticks. And I think that Starlink  is an underappreciated factor  in the flight from cities  and the embrace of the wilderness  living in the middle of nowhere.

Transcript:  because he's going to live, live there.  We're going to do a cabin where we live there  sometimes when we're not traveling.  But he is absolutely betting  on that. I mean, you know, they  are looking at a million other  options. There are no good, I mean,  there's connectivity within like half  a mile away. And there are ways to  beam that with a partnership  with somebody is a complicated, problematic  situation. But they're really  looking forward to  satellite internet.  In our case,  you know, we'll figure out the best  option for internet. We will get internet.  But we're not really, really depending on  it. Once this thing is  a known commodity,  once people really understand how Starlink  works, I think you're going to see  the real estate market in the middle  of nowhere just completely take off  because there is there are times  we spent six months looking  for a really great piece of property.  And there were  three quarters of the places we looked at were like,  oh, wow, they are so far  in the middle of nowhere that that is  that is just not going to happen.  But once  Starlink comes online, all  of those properties become desirable  to lots  of people. They're cheap. They're  beautiful. They're in nature.  They have everything going for them except  internet connectivity. And Starlink is  going to change that.

It feels like  Elon, you know, I feel like  Elon, he made money in  PayPal. He basically took  that money, put it all on red.  He put all his chips on Tesla.  And it paid off. It entered the  S&P 500. And suddenly  he's the second richest man in the world.  Obviously, I own a Tesla.  I think what he did is great.  He jumped started  electric vehicles in  the world.

This time  three Americans and  a Japanese astronaut, the Japanese astronaut  said it was the best  he's been on Soyuz. He's  been on the old American  flights, NASA flights. And now  he's one of the few people who's been on all  three. He said he's  a connoisseur apparently, space flight. He said  this is the best ride he ever had. Best ride.  Oh, by far.

Start time: 6039.67
End time: 6230.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. Yes. Thank you so  much. So Kevin  makes this.  This is a chatterbox.  What this is, is essentially  an Amazon Echo type device  that anybody over the  age of eight or nine can  make themselves. So there's a cardboard outer  box and you can customize and get another one. They're  very inexpensive for the outside parts.  And then you  put the electronics in there. There's a proprietary  hat in there for the  audio. There's a very importantly,  there's a button on the top. So  it doesn't  listen unless you push  the button. So it's not listening. It's very private.  And chatterbox, neither  chatterbox nor any of the services that chatterbox  relies on, knows who  is using the service. It's perfectly  private. Do not feed your  kids into the Amazon  privacy violating machine.  It's also illegal for schools  to do that because there are laws protecting  kids from privacy violations.  So once they've built this,  they can use a very easy to use  tool builder to build skills.  Chatterbox doesn't do  anything until you teach it  how to do each and every thing.  And so for kids under lockdown  who are using this right now, they absolutely  love it and their parents love it because it's  endless learning  and playing by developing  skills. And with each  skill, chatterbox gets smarter.  And so you  push the button, button you  turn on the lights. It does more  than an Amazon Echo does, theoretically.  It leverages  all kinds of services through APIs,  teaches kids what APIs are.  It uses  Wolfram Alpha. It uses  all these different brilliant  services for the weather, for this,  for that. You can communicate. You can make  calls. You can send texts. You can do  all kinds of things.  And it's just a brilliant, brilliant product  for kids who are looking  for STEM education,  who are learning, they're learning language  skills because you have to craft exactly  what you say and what it says back.  So you're thinking about language and how to communicate  clearly. It's just the most fantastic  educational product in history.  And here's the part that I mentioned  earlier. Starting Cyber Money  Monday, which for Chatterbox lasts  the entire week, you can get 25%  off. Nice.  So that's going to be at hellochatterbox.com  starting  probably today or tomorrow. He's going to  put up that information.  But I highly recommend  this, whether  you're a child or not, whether you have a child or not,  it's just a fun, fun,  fun project. It's pure fun.  And you end up, at the end of the day,  you end up with something like an Amazon  Echo without the Amazon part  and all the  privacy violation that goes with that.  So I highly recommend it.  And it's just a wonderful  thing. And it's just, you know,  he initially was going to spend  2020 selling this to school districts.  They're not  showing up for work for the most of the year. So he's  been selling it to parents whose kids are in lockdown  and need projects that will  keep their mental  stimulation going. So it's just a  fantastic product.

Transcript:  interesting. It's very  efficient. And, you know,  the secret  sauce is in the interface  and the software and also the  audio hat that  just makes building  something. You know, everyone will say, prepare  kids the future, teach them how to code. That is  false. That is wrong.  Kids are not going to be typing  code in the future. They're  going to be interacting with artificial intelligence  voice agents as  the main interface for  computers. And so you've got to, if you  want to prepare kids for the future,  prepare them to fully understand  what voice-based  AI is and how  it works. And that's what Chatterbox does.  Nice.

Gastronomad.net.  Can't wait. Can't wait.  We're ready to travel.  Our show today brought to you by  Forward Networks. I spent  some time with these guys.  And I am so impressed  with what they did. They started...  They were four PhD students  at Stanford  about seven years ago.  And they were...  They created a way  to model networks in software.  To model networks in software.  Forward Networks  basically delivers you a digital  twin of your network.  Completely accurate mathematical  model in software.  It can go out.  It can survey the network  for you automatically.  It can build this. And then imagine  what you could do  with this software model.  You can verify your network is configured  correctly. You can verify that it's  in compliance with policies. That it's behaving  as you expect it to.  And if you're considering  a change in your network,  and boy, I wish more network operators  would use this, because  how many times have people changed their  BGP settings and  brought the internet down?  You could run the change against  the software model so you know  what's going to happen.  This ensures your network is  healthy and agile and you don't  get those embarrassing misconfigurations  that can ruin your day.  Here's some of what Forward Networks does.  They have a dashboard that gives you key network  insights, visualizations. We're looking at them  right now on the screen that are easily  consumable, exportable. You can  automatically create an always  accurate network diagram  with full details about the topology  of your environment. It searches network  behavior configuration and state  network-wide with an intuitive and  powerful tool. It's basically spidering.  You can perform end-to-end  path analyses across your network  both on-prem and in the cloud.  You can proactively identify  potential connectivity violations.  You can make sure your network is  configured and behaving exactly as intended.  And again, this is on-prem  and in the cloud and with virtual overlay  networks. You can set, check,  and customize policies.  They create this thing called behavior  diffs.  If you've ever done a text file  diff, you know what we're talking about.  You create behavior diffs that will give you  side-by-side comparisons in one  quick view of configuration file changes  for any device between points in time.  You can immediately see what's  going to happen. 50% faster  resolution of network trouble tickets,  90% faster fixes related  to audit processes,  33% reduction in aborted network  updates due to identified errors.  Imagine being able to, just like a Google  search, search your network for  what's causing problems.  Some of the biggest companies in the world  use forward networks.  In fact, PayPal,  they were having issues with their network.  They thought they would build it themselves. Instead, they  found forward networks and they  said, oh, look, all we needed was this  software model that can  find trouble spots, saves us time and money.  They've worked with  Telstra, Verizon,  Bank of America, several  large government agencies we can't  name. Get network automation  and verification for your intent-based  network with forward networks.  You're going to be so glad you heard this show and  found out about this.  Go to forwardnetworks.com  slash twit, forwardnetworks.com  slash twit. They've got a podcast  Seeking Truth in Networking. Isn't that a  great name? You can download it anywhere  you get podcasts, search for it,  Seeking Truth in Networking or go to  forwardnetworks.com slash  twit. When they explained  this to me, I was so excited.  This is brilliant. Your business depends  on it and you've got to see the  demo. Forwardnetworks.com  slash twit.  Try it. You'll be amazed.  So who knew? Black Friday  was yesterday, or Friday.  And Cyber Monday is Monday.  Adobe,  this is one of their little sidelines,  they, every year they  follow online sales  in real time.  At 80 of the top 100 retailers  covering some 100  million SKUs. They said  on Black Friday, U.S. consumers  spent, the number is  in, 9 billion  billion dollars.  That's up 21 percent  over last year.  I guess  that's not a surprise. We've been buying everything  online more and more every year.  Forecast was somewhere between  8.9 and 9.6 billion.  So maybe it wasn't as high as they thought it  was. It was, in fact, the  second largest online  spending day in U.S. history. But  wait, Cyber Monday says  hold my beer. We'll see what  it's like tomorrow. It's all Cyber

Start time: 6711.08
End time: 6746.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I fully don't understand how that  quantifies as real.  Because with massive  job loss or... Who's  spending this money? Yes!  Who? Because  I was in Philly two weeks ago  and I was like, there was a line  and this is not even a joke. There was a line eight blocks long.  When I got to my friend's house, I'm like,  what are they selling at this store over there?  He's like, what are you talking about?  We drove back around and it was a food line.  It's a food line. It was eight blocks long.  And people were there with cart baskets  of food for Thanksgiving. I'm like,  it didn't even dawn on me that that's what it was. I just  thought people were lining up to buy something.

Start time: 6747.40
End time: 6822.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are two things happening, I think.  Yeah, there are two things that are happening.  First is that one of the  interesting cultural moments we're in right now  is a kind of  lockdown fatigue.  So after  months and months and months of people spending  a lot less than they normally would  because of the uncertainty, because of the  possibility of recession and job loss  and all that kind of stuff. I think people are  at this point, sort of in  this frame of mind of like,  you know what? Screw it. I'm going to spend some money.  And the other part of it is there are new  fears about a coming surge  in the coronavirus. More uncertainty.  You can't find toilet paper anymore at Costco.  And people are  also hoarding. So it's  the  pandemic fatigue. It's the Thanksgiving  holiday. And it's a new  surge in hoarding  that is driving a lot of this stuff.  Plus the holidays are coming.  So I think it makes a lot of sense  that people are spending a lot more. What I  do think also makes sense is that  when we look at the entire year,  there's not going to be a huge uptick.  I just think that the spending has been  redistributed from the middle of  the year to this  part of the year where people just  buying things they  otherwise would have bought months ago.

Transcript:  I feel like there are two Americas  now.  There's the America, and I'm sad to say  I'm in this, I'm not sad to say, but it's  kind of, I feel  guilty to say it. This part  of America that's still making money, we're making a lot  less. I think Twitter made millions  of dollars less this year, but we still make enough money  to live well.  And we didn't spend on  eating out and travel, so we do have  discretionary income. That's one  half. But then there's the America,  one in four Americans are suffering  food insecurity right now. Out of  work, out of  unemployment benefits at the end of December,  no stimulus check, no hope,  landlord saying you gotta  pay the rent.  I feel like this is, it's  the divide between the have and have  nots has never been more  stark.  And it's terrifying to me.

Start time: 6877.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also didn't think about, like,  so me and my daughter, we go to the movies,  we see every movie, even if they're horrible movies.  And I was thinking to myself, you know,  I'm just gonna buy a huge TV  and then we'll just sit home  because we're watching everything at home. I have like  55 inch whatever, it's not, because it's not a big  deal. I was like, I'm gonna go out and buy me a 85  inch TV just so we can sit home and watch our  movies. I don't need this TV, but I was gonna  buy it. And I think about it, that's the thing  like your, your money shifts, right?  So the people, the artists are working and do have money.  You're not able to go out and eat. You're not  able to go out to a football game  or a baseball game or like I have season  tickets and such. There's certain things you can't do so  you do have income shift.  So I guess people could spend more money because they got  cabin fever. I didn't think about it that way.  But that is something that probably happened  a lot, obviously, because the numbers are so high.

Start time: 6923.06
End time: 6936.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure that's where the 26%  came. But I worry  about another 20%,  29% of households  with children that  don't know where their next meal is coming from.  Yeah, and it's gonna get worse.

Start time: 6937.12
End time: 6999.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are gonna be evictions.  There was an initial  surge in relief and  forgiveness and so on for  rent payments and mortgage payments  and all that kind of stuff. But that's gonna come to an end  at some point. Hopefully  there'll be politically  driven solutions to that  coming problem. But  right now  we're not aware of what those are.  So it's gonna get worse before it gets better.  But I also think that, Leo,  that you shouldn't apologize  for your success. You are doing your  part because you  pay your people a good  wage. You are a great guy  to work for. And so you're doing your part.  If everybody did what you did, we wouldn't have these problems.  But again, ultimately I think it's political.  It's a political  problem and it's a political solution.  Something happened. I saw a chart  recently that something happened  in, I believe, 1972  where the success  of companies and the wages  were about the same  and they diverged.  This is an amazing

And yet, 71-72,  you could see right here  that prior to 72,  compensation  and productivity matched.  Two lines going up  together. Then all of a sudden,  for some reason, this divergence,  productivity continued  going up and up and up.  It's up 246%  since 1972.  Actually, no, it's more than 100%  since 1972, 150%.  But compensation  flattened out. This is what you were talking about,

I'm worried about Cook  who's got money out the wazoo  hidden in other countries and saying,  well, we need more tax breaks and we need more  credits because we've got to build a spaceship in the  middle of the forest that only occupies  2% of our company.

Transcript:  I would guess that  the number one  cause of all of this  is globalization, which we  weren't really talking about it in the 70s.  But it was starting to happen.  It was happening, yeah.  Yeah. And so I think that  globalization, as  Owen was intimating,  is something where  you can play different economies off  of each other. You can  design it in California  and then manufacture it in Shenzhen  or whatever. You can manufacture it in a very  cheap place and then sell it in a very  rich place and then you can  mess around with all  this kind of stuff. I mean,  we complain  a lot about the  nature of commerce  in the United States, but my  God, you should see it in other countries, Leo.  We travel to a lot of countries  where  the locals literally  have no access to anything  except the lowest quality,  cheapest garbage you can imagine.  Their soap, their blankets,  their clothes, their shoes,  everything they see,  everything they get is just  the worst kind of toxic  polyester garbage.  So we've seen it actually happen  in Morocco, for example,  which has this amazing  culture of  textile manufacturing, Berber textiles  and so on, and people selling it and all that stuff.  Well, now you see those being replaced by  made-in-China versions, knockoffs  of the traditional culture.  And so the  indigenous people, it's also  happening in the Americas, indigenous people  are selling  Chinese knockoffs of their own  culture's patterns  for pennies.

You look at  the politics  of populism.  Again, I don't want to get into politics  or name names, but basically  the populism  is essentially railing  against lower wages  being made, stuff being made  abroad instead of here.  That's just the tip of the  iceberg. And again, I think that's

This is blue and magenta  mixed together. He would take  requests  for color mixing.  He said, you know, I thought this would  be a good way to help market our paints.  It is a good way. It is a good  way. Millions of people,  1.2 million followers  ToneStir paints. He got fired  because he was  making TikToks on the job.

Transcript:  Hey, our show today brought to you by  ExpressVPN.  It's actually  right up the alley of what we were talking about.  Which is internet service  providers, predacious  preying on  their customers.  Comcast, AT&T.  They're actually collecting  information about what you're doing and selling it on to  marketers. Making big money from  spying on you. So we've talked about VPNs  before for security reasons.  It's a great reason to run a VPN.  But there's also a privacy  factor. You don't want  people to see what you're doing online.  You need to use a VPN, especially  if your internet service provider's  snooping on you. That's why  I love ExpressVPN. Couldn't be easier  to use. And now remember,  if you do choose a VPN, they're  going to have the same potential to spy  on you as your ISP. You're just  kicking the can down the road. That's why  I only use ExpressVPN.  These guys  absolutely respect your  privacy. So much so that they invented a new  server technology they call Trusted Server  that runs only in RAM,  spins up when you log in,  cannot write to the hard drive, it's  sandboxed, and then spins down, disappears  when you log out. There is no  trace of you ever using it.  And we know that's true not only  because they have independent auditors,  PricewaterhouseCoopers,  checking their privacy policy,  checking the Trusted Server technology, making  sure it works. Not only because of that,  but also because from time to time,  law enforcement from countries  with no knock warrants, or no  warrant at all, will come and take the servers hoping  to find evidence of  things people have done on ExpressVPN, and  there's never anything on there.  They never have found anything.  They don't log. So your privacy is  100% protected. Your security  is 100%. Everything you do  is encrypted and protected. And with  servers all over the world, ExpressVPN  is fast,  but it can also put you in any country in the  world, which means you can watch Netflix in the  UK and binge all the Doctor Who  episodes you want. Netflix  in Japan and binge all the anime  episodes you want. It's so fast  it works with HD streaming.  It's easy to use. The apps are available  on every platform. You can even put  ExpressVPN on your router,  making sure your whole household is  protected. And you know what's great?  It's so fast they'll never even notice.  Nobody's going to say, oh, wow,  it's slow, but we're secure. You don't have to  say that anymore. Not with ExpressVPN.  Your data is your business.  Protect it with the best VPN  on the market today. ExpressVPN.com  slash twit. It's the only one I use.  Visit ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Get three extra months of VPN free  when you buy a year.

Start time: 8009.00

Transcript:  on this. I will debate you. So,  the news story is a couple of weeks ago  we all got emails saying, hey, look,  we've been giving you free, unlimited storage  on Google Photos.  But, you know, we're not  going to do that anymore. Starting in June  of next year, June  5th, I think, 4th, whatever, 1st.  1st.  Everything you upload is going to start counting  against your total amount of storage. And if you  need more, you can buy Google One.  You only get 15 gigs free. Everything  you got there up to now,  in fact, anything you upload now,  all the way to June 1st, is  going to stay free forever.  Right? Right. What's wrong  with that? They gave us a lot of notice.

Start time: 8050.49
End time: 8167.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what's wrong  with it. So, first of all,  I have 22 gigs of  photos and videos on Google Photos.  But I also pay  for the storage. So it's not going to cost  me personally anything. But I have  recommended Google Photos  to lots of people, millions of people  over the last  five years. And so, when  they rolled this out, they said  they were offering free, unlimited  photo storage. And we accepted  them  dragooning all of our  loved ones into their facial recognition  system. We accepted them  compressing it so that when we  download a version of the photo, we  get a compressed version. It's not the original.  We accepted  buying into their ecosystem  all the stuff that we did.  And we did it because they said it was free  and unlimited. And  we made a decision about where  to put our photos based on the  deal that we had with them  that we would do our part, all the  things aforementioned, and they would  do their part. It would be free and  unlimited. And now they come along and they're  saying, okay, well, now we're going to  charge you. Now, the amount they're charging is  actually very low. It's a low price.  And I have the feeling it's not about the revenue  from charging people for photos.  It's more about getting your  into their system  with your credit card and all that kind of stuff  the way Amazon does. Nevertheless,  a deal is a deal, and  they broke the deal. Now, we have many,  many people have gigabytes  and gigabytes of data. It's actually  too much to download. People say, well,  just go to Google Takeout. You can just  launch a thing. So I've asked  a lot of my newsletter readers  if this works for them.  And a shocking number of  them have said they've tried  it and it simply doesn't work  for lots of people, including myself.  You cannot  download your own photos.  You can download them one at a time.  I have 22 gigabytes. I've downloaded all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people, many people are able  to do it and many people are not. Some can't.  What happens with me, and I'm using  a Google laptop, I'm using a Pixelbook,  right? I go in there  and I initiate the process  and literally nothing happens.  It's just, okay, we'll notify you.  I don't even get a notification.  I don't get anything. I don't get the download.  I don't get nothing happens.  It doesn't work. They've...  And so,  they either have to...  For people for whom this doesn't work,  they need to send you a free hard disk with all  of your stuff. Or, as far  as I'm concerned, this is technically  a financial crime. It's  bait and switch. They  basically said, you know, people  are taking photos with the knowledge  that it's free storage, right? So people are  taking ten times more photos than they  otherwise would have. And they've chosen  this service that was free. And now  they've got more  data  than people can download. And in many cases,  the downloads don't even work  at all. So I think this is a...  This is something that  really demands  a lawsuit. But if you don't upload

Transcript:  Every single photo that my dad ever  took when he passed away, I uploaded all  those immediately. I am  I do photography and videography. I do  stuff for companies. Everything that  I've ever done gets backed up  in two ways. In the Google Photos,  and I also get a hard drive, and I back  up and I send it to my friend in California who  is a local, and I send it to my friend in  Wisconsin. And it's safe, so I got, you know, by  Coastal in case he goes off the road.  So you're good, you're good.  So, but Google right now  can literally just charge me  whatever. I gotta do it. So I mean,  Mike, I hear what you're saying, but they did  get their stuff and they said, hey look, at this  time we're going to stop, but you keep everything  free. So if I stop right now, I'm happy  with just eight TBs, 12 TBs.  I got to set it up because I'm about to start uploading  some more stuff. I got current, so I got to upload.  Thank you everybody at Google. I know I'm an abuser.  You know, I don't want to get in the way.  Holy cow.  I worked that system to the  boat. I also pay a little $20 a year for  100 megabytes a gig.

Transcript:  I think Google does take a hit  when they cancel something like this or change  something. But honestly,  because you got burned,  we all got burned by Google+.  There's been a lot of things Google's canceled.  Google Reader. But  come on. I mean,  they were giving away a free service.  If YouTube went away,  I guess the one  point you make that I think is  genuinely  an issue is you did give  them these photos, which they got a  lot of value out of with  ML training.  That was the whole reason for it, I'm sure,  from Google's point of view. We want to train  our artificial intelligence.  They got some value out of it.  But I don't think it's unfair  to say, hey, look, we can't afford to do this  anymore. In six months, we're going to have to charge you  a not unreasonable amount for  cloud storage. But everything  you put up there, including all of Owen's  nine terabytes, will stay there for  free forever. That seems

If they would have said I had to pay for all that  I got up there, oh, man, I'd be burning this  house down with you, Mike. I'd be right  there to pitch for it. But they gave me  a time frame and said, now, again, I got to see what the  price is because I'd still be uploading. So  I got to figure out what's going on. But I'm thankful  that my stuff is up there with the Google's  quote unquote safe and sound.  Mike, do you feel like maybe

Transcript:  So here's the theme  that this feeds  into. Google is  really unskillful.  They have passionate users  and time and time again, they launch a new  thing and they say, hey, passionate users,  check out this new thing. And then people get  super invested in it. I  I've personally spent hundreds  of hours interacting with Google photos  and I'm very invested in it. I have this thing called  the Nice Book, which was my replacement for  Facebook. I've gotten all my readers  to be subscribers of this thing.  I've gotten everybody involved  in this and I've promoted it. I use it  for Gastronomy  Experiences. We take professional quality photos  and we share them through Google Photos.  So our customers of our business  actually  we've said you have to, you know,  this is where all the photos and videos from  this experience are.  And so I don't  mind that they  have something that's free and then they monetize  it. What I mind is they  didn't tell us that at the beginning.  In the beginning they said  free and unlimited. And they  made everybody believe that this  is always going to be free.  Now, I've always been nervous about this because  I know that people like Owen are abusing  this horribly. I actually thought I  was an abuser.

Transcript:  I'm trying to use  non-Amazon  sources for the things that I buy.  I'm trying harder to do that. But that  is not for that reason. But my point is,  there's a heavy, heavy lock-in when your  most precious data, your photos  and videos of your family and all that  kind of stuff, are being  held hostage  in this...in  undownloadable quantities  and in some cases literally undownloadable  because their mechanism doesn't work and no, they don't have  tech support.  And you're just kind of stuck.  This is...I used to...  before I was a tech journalist, I was a regular  journalist at a newspaper and we used to do a lot of stories about  local businesses that would do  bait and switch. One of the first stories I ever wrote  was about a motel  in the town that I lived in that said,  oh, it's $29 a night and you could never  get that $29 room.  They'd get you off the freeway, get you committed, you  waste your time finding the place, you go in,  you park, you go inside and they're like, well,  you know, that room...those rooms  are taken but you can get this other one for  $59.95. And they  paid a huge fine for  bait and switch. That's exactly what Google is doing.  It's a bait and switch.  They told us the deal was one thing,  they got us all committed, and now  they're saying, now that you're committed, we're  changing the deal. And I  think that people should be angrier than  they are. That's...  Well, people are angry. There are a lot

And so, if you're  an active user, like everybody  who listens to this podcast is,  you shouldn't, you probably don't, but  you shouldn't trust Google  as far as you can throw them. They are an  unreliable company that just doesn't  not give a crap  about you. And they're proven  once again. I can't

And I, you know, Google  Stadia is a good example. I think a lot of people  are very reluctant to  go all in on Stadia. When you  buy a game on Stadia,  that's theirs. If Stadia goes away,  that 60 bucks I paid for  Cyberpunk 2077 goes  away too. I don't get a copy I can  download and play on some other  machine. That's it, right?

I don't know. It's like 50 bucks a year  or something, but I feel like  I want to support a good  it's better than Gmail, frankly, a good  IMAP server and  support it and trust it.  Now the thing about Gmail is there's not really any lock  in on any email program.  You can easily move over to another email program.  You should not  use a Gmail  address or a fast mail address or a hotmail  address as your main address. You should have your own  domain. Right.

Of course, they were  given one week back in August, but  they've been given another one  week.  So the Treasury Department told  CNBC that CFIUS,  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.,  had granted an extension to allow time to  review a revised  submission. Remember, it was Oracle  with some help from Walmart  that was trying to acquire  TikTok from  ByteDance.  And then TikTok, we talked  about this a couple of weeks ago,  said, hello?  Hello?  Is anybody there? What happened?  Should we still  sell? And then CFIUS said,  oh, yeah, sell.  TikTok  has no comment. I don't know what's going to  happen. We're going to have a very interesting  this story from CNBC was published today  four hours ago. So we're going to have a very  interesting  week. But you're right.

Transcript:  It's kind of depressing.  Because the week I took off was the best  twig in years.  A couple of obituaries.  Sad stories we're going to end  the show with. But that's where I usually  put them at the end of the show because we want  to remember these people.  Darth Vader has passed away at the age of  85. David Prowse,  who was the big tall guy  in the Darth Vader costume,  a 6'6  former bodybuilder.  He was in the original trilogy.  And he passed away at the age  of 85. Much beloved.  And then speaking of beloved,  there is an entrepreneur  who I think probably we all  knew. We certainly all  encountered from time to time.  Tony Shea.  He created Link Exchange  when he was just out of college.  Sold it to Microsoft for hundreds of millions  of dollars.  Took that money and founded Zappos  in 1999.  On one simple principle.  The customer comes  first. He sold it 10  years later to Amazon for  more than a billion dollars. Continued  to run it until this summer.  When he retired  at the age of 46.  Sad to say,  Tony, who was beloved by our  community, passed away.  It sounds like it was a house fire.  Which is really on  Thanksgiving, which is really tragic.  If you want to  read  about what a great  fellow this guy was,  O'Malek has written a really good  obituary at om.co.  He of course  knew Tony very well.  So did so many people in our community.  I only met him once at a South by  Southwest. He had a  Zappos bus with a full  bar that he was driving around Austin.  It was so much fun.  I'll never forget it.  He was quirky. He was innovative.  He was quite  brilliant. He really  cared about  customers.  He also cared about his employees.

Transcript:  The thing that I ranted about earlier  hurts my heart even more  knowing that somebody like him existed in  the ether that gave  so much and did it  not just because of the goodness  of his heart, but because he knew it was right and he knew  that it would make a business better.  He knew that treating his employees the right  way, treating the customers the right  way. I mean, down to the little things.  There was a story a long time ago about  a guy who called Zappos customer  service by accident instead of a pizza  place. The guy ordered the guy a pizza  for him anyway.  The mindset of  this man to instill from the top  to the bottom is what I wish  humane business  would be. Yes, we're going to make a profit.  Yes, we're going to make money, but we're going to do  it by servicing the people  that want to work with us and servicing  the people that work for us. And if  we started with that, if this guy,  we could just multiply him and have him run everything,  rest in peace, we would be much better off.  He did an amazing job.  He created an amazing company and  culture, and he touched so many lives  of people that worked for him, under  him, that are going to go off and do other  great things and hopefully take his  lessons and his spirit and his essence with  them into the future.  So again, rest in peace, Tony.

Transcript:  My friend Jason Rapp  tweeted about  Tony Shea.  Apparently, at one point,  13,000 Zappos  customers orders were one day  late. He sent  them an email. He still had the email, and Jason  tweeted it. This is embarrassing.  He made an apology  and said, instead of your order being delivered  July 8th, as we promised, it's now expected  to be delivered July 9th, if this is  causing you undue hardship, please  call our customer service line.  We will bend over backwards to make it right.  If it isn't causing you undue hardship, but  is just extremely annoying, please  call us and ask whoever answers  the phone to do something weird or embarrassing  like sing I'm a little tea cup  or do their best  audio impression of a cute little kitten.  You trusted us and we failed.  That's customer service. He often said  Zappos is a customer service organization  that just happens to sell  shoes. He was very  instrumental in the revitalization of downtown  Las Vegas.  46, way too young.  And a huge loss to our industry.  RIP Tony Shea.  And I think we should wrap it up on that note.  I want to thank you so much Mike Elgin for being here.  Even though you're in the dark.  The lights are off.  The furnace is off.  There's no food on the table.  I'm so sorry.

Transcript:  I'm going to probably be moving it somewhere.  Just out of a kind of protest.  But I'll figure that out  and announce whatever it is I'm doing.  Because it has a few thousand people  who follow that pretty regularly.  But I would also like to  let people know that  this pandemic will end.  And we will travel again.  So our first one is going to be  Provence this summer.  Gastronomic experience.  Followed by Prosecco and Barcelona and Oaxaca.  You say something about Oaxaca  because we just spent a month  a long time in Oaxaca.  And Oaxaca  you can't book anything  for Day of the Dead in Oaxaca.  That's like Rio  for Carnival, right?  It's the epicenter of  Day of the Dead celebration.  And we booked the very best place to live.  We booked the city's top chef  to give a personal cooking class.  We are going to have  the most amazing Day of the Dead ceremony  in October of next year.  So if you want to do Oaxaca  this is the way to do Oaxaca.  But I would encourage everybody  to sign up because  travel is coming.  It's coming back.  We're going to have a vaccine  and we are going to travel.  We're also specializing these days  in pandemic safe travel.  We've actually developed  this thing called the Safe Travels  Manifesto.  We're hoping everybody will embrace this.  It's basically  a long list of things, not that long,  but it's a list of things to do  about how to fly,  how to go to restaurants,  how to go to hotels and  Airbnbs, how to travel  without spreading the pandemic  and without getting a virus.  So we're hoping everybody will embrace that.  Wonderful.

Transcript:  Everybody's been this way. This year has been a rough year.  I'm just saying, I know if I'm upset,  I know other people upset.  If you get to me, you've gotten to everybody.  But the end of the year  is coming. The holidays are here.  Don't look at the whole quarantine  thing as a bad thing.  So many times in your life, you've been too  busy to spend time with your family or  your loved ones or call and check on people.  Right now, you have nothing else to do.  Call that friend you haven't talked to in a  long time. Send those text messages  out. Make sure that you  reach out and touch the people beyond social  media that matter somewhat in your life that you  miss sometimes because right now,  they might need that phone call from you.  They might need a message from you.  And if you're home and you're stuck with your kids,  I just order myself up.  Hello, Chatterbox  from my daughter. Oh, good.  I also have her running on Code  Kingdoms because I still do believe in coding.  So get one of those two things. If not both  of them for your kids, get them educated  for the future, not just because you're homeschooling.  You might as well homeschool for something  that they might need to know to teach them about some taxes  or some banking and stuff like that. But spend  this quality time together  doing stuff that makes you happy  and create new traditions. I didn't have  a turkey this year. I made a meatloaf  turkey and it was delicious. We might forgo  turkeys for the rest of existence.  I don't know. So look inside yourself.  I know it's been down, but we're on the way  up because it's holiday season. Put a smile  on your face. Do something that makes  you happy for you because that's all  that we can do. I love you guys.  I appreciate being on the show. Thank you so much for having  me, Uncle Leo, and happy birthday.
