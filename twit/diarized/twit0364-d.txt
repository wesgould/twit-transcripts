End time: 362.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course and I know when Patrick Norton used to go to Defcon, he would never bring any technology  With him. Did you not were you able to not get hacked is the question?

Start time: 363.52
End time: 392.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not get hacked but that's only because I basically turned everything off  Defcon wanted to establish a secure network  So they actually had two different Wi-Fi networks that could log into the first was actually quite secure  It was a very popular network and it was a very popular network  It was a very popular network. It had a VPN tunnel to the outside world  So no one else at the conference could see you it was using WPA to and you had to download a certificate  But even then most of us didn't log in they had a second network

Start time: 394.08
End time: 399.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which they called free range and that was basically take your life into your own hands connect to this and you will get hacked

Start time: 400.36
End time: 408.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a wall of shame, right where people who get hacked get their stuff put up on the wall  And in real time it shows usernames and passwords of people

Start time: 416.18
End time: 475.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's plugged in right now. So this is known as an inhuman badge  So the human badges, which is what the attendees were wearing were all white and then you had speakers vendors artists  Media and goons and they had different colored badges that were called inhuman  And actually they did a fantastic thing today  At this conference they wanted to emphasize the social nature of the conference  In fact several times dark tangent who runs the conference and lost who actually created this  They wanted people to to actually talk to someone else. They said look you're on your computer  363 days a year  Why not go ahead and talk to someone who's real standing next to you?  And so what they did was they put a gaming aspect into the badge  There's a crypto challenge there was actually created by the lost in which the the participants at the conference had to decipher a  Cryptological challenge. Well, it was embedded into the badges. Oh, you lost me, didn't you? No, but you're if you think

Start time: 480.88
End time: 563.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See he's a priest so he has early information. All right, we'll get we'll get Robert back. This is really cool, though  There were 21 total different shapes 21 unique styles each of these is a circuit board running a propeller  32-bit multi-core processor with an infrared LED and receiver for badge to badge communication  This is by the way from the parallax forums Ken Gracie writing about the DEF CON badges a bank of eight LEDs  USB circuit for data access and programming each  Attendee receives two ps2 adapters and a VGA connector  So it's kind of like the Raspberry Pi. This is a small computer  They can actually go to the hardware hacking village and turn their badge into a computer system  three triple-a batteries were supposedly could run the badge for the entire conference and  Then at the DEF CON opening ceremony  They got information about the challenge  That's what Robert started to talk about before he was cut off by the NSA and I guess this looks like a  Terminal the people people are using to start that this is really cool. This is really really really cool  We're still into DEF CON Leo. I have not I'm scared. Have you I have not been anybody else

Start time: 564.12
End time: 584.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff or Ken if you've been there now haven't been but my my colleagues go every year  I was gonna go last year, but you said your colleague got hacked this year. Yes. Yes. He  What's he he is the IT director and head of security for his company?  So I don't know how I'm hoping that it was ironic that he actually was making a joke

Start time: 584.96
End time: 596.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it didn't look like it to me his Twitter account was starting to post some garbage  Yes, I'm scared, you know and Patrick was very took always took it very seriously  He said he would never go with a computer because he knew he just do a little too

Start time: 597.70
End time: 617.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if I would go I would go with a computer that  Essentially was wiped clean and dedicated only for use there  Right, and it may actually be easier with something like an iPad or a smartphone  You know if you can get on your own own networks, you know your broadband network  But yeah to to log into the free range. I think that would be be a real challenge to stay

Start time: 617.86
End time: 627.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unhacked on that. Yeah, that'd be fun. I mean if you go with your own LTE connection you turn the Wi-Fi off  How would hope you could you get it? I hope you would be safe, but I don't know maybe

Start time: 629.50
End time: 633.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is a Robert with his badge did you did you ever figure out what the hack was Robert?

Start time: 634.66
End time: 655.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, actually. So what you had to do  You would synchronize your badge with as many other people as you possibly could and every time you synchronize the badge  You got another bit and at the very end it would unlock the next crypto key for the challenge and it would tell you where you  Should look in order to to go to the next level. It was a little bit of a ready player one in the game

Start time: 656.35
End time: 679.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like fun  So tell me what we learned because every year at DEF CON and black hat before it back hat is the official  Kind of more more business oriented  Convention right and then DEF CON is the more hacker or any convention, but every year people bring their best exploits  And you hear about all sorts. I remember we heard about how people could use a power port to break in the motel room  electronic locks

Start time: 680.96
End time: 747.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else did we learn at DEF CON? Well, this was an interesting year because I think the most  exploity if I can coin a term  Presentation was NFC and it was shown how you could  Basically hack the NFC of an NSA phone or an NFC tablet in order to take over the device  But the presenter made it very clear and he showed us an example that this was a proof of concept  The device would basically be have to be in a state that it would never be in a million years in the wild  So I think DEF CON this year moved a little bit away from the exploits because we had a special visitor  It was general B. Alexander the head of the NSA  Whoa first time there. Yeah, that's so strange. He came in to actually speak to DEF CON Wow  He's become a friend of the the leader of DEF CON dark tangent and he basically said look  We know you're gonna hack we know that you are some of the most skilled hackers in the country  So if you're gonna hack why not hack for your country? So there was a little bit of a rah rah pitch  I'm not not really sure how that went over that though. I think that's not a bad idea

Start time: 748.52
End time: 762.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that nothing good can come of a friendship between the director of the NSA and dark tangent. However  But  But I think that that's actually a good call to hackers to say well, you know, you're gonna hack  Why don't why don't you do it for good not evil?

Start time: 764.02
End time: 789.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and they actually had a table in the vendor area where you could get more information and it was empty for the first  Three or so hours of the conference, but then people started trickling over to the table just to get information  We're ridiculing them, but I think there's there's actually a general interest in doing something constructive or  Perhaps speaking a bit more conspiratorially. They just wanted access to all the toys that the NSA has

Start time: 790.56
End time: 804.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well traditionally at DEF CON and black hat there's always been feds there  You know, it's always kind of where feds and hackers would meet a lot of FBI agents and so forth  Because they're looking for information about what's going on too. They want to keep their ear to the ground

Start time: 804.96
End time: 828.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and Alexander made it very clear. He had a presentation before Congress earlier this year in which he said look if  You want us to be able to compete with with cyber hacking cyber cracking and cyber terrorism  We need to recruit the best and guess what the best are found at events like DEF CON  Yeah, so we need a little bit of leeway in in bringing these people into the fold

Start time: 828.46
End time: 833.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do a spot the Fed did they do spot the fact it was too hard to find the Fed this time the spot the Fed  contest

Start time: 835.04
End time: 854.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  General Alexander was off limits for spot. Okay  Yeah, they do it every year if any of you have never been to DEF CON  I think the best way I could describe it is picture CES  Crossed with South by Southwest  Crossed with Burning Man. I mean that's really honestly the best combination I could think of that sounds so awesome

Start time: 856.10
End time: 863.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So but I'm sorry go ahead  I was just wondering if that if the challenge the badge challenge you said somebody did solve it or

Start time: 864.60
End time: 927.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's been solved the weird thing was  When we got the badges the day before there were a group of us who sat outside  The hallway for what's called the hardware hacking village, which is the official place where people go to modify things and learn how to solder  Well, there was about 12 of us and we just started hacking through the code. We dumped the binaries of the badges  It helped that I had a press badge because my code was different. So we were able to do differential analysis  But we figured out about 60% of the contest before the contest even started  That's that's sort of what you get at DEF CON and what we found out was the crypto challenge wasn't just on the badge  This pointed you to a page that said that the lanyard that the Crip  Was  Actually part of the challenge awesome  Which then told you that the floors the way that the floors were arranged and the decals on the floors were part of the  Challenge which told you that the signs were part of the challenge  It was this wonderful Easter egg hunt of crypto. It sounds like this is a very fun conference

Start time: 927.60
End time: 929.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the 20th DEF CON. Have you been to others?

Start time: 931.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The last one I went to was DEF CON one what wrong?  So were you a little baby hacker then I was I wasn't even in the seminary yet  So these sort of bookends of hackery here. Wow, that's so cool. And did anybody think you were a fed?  There's actually a very high-ranking DEF CON personality who goes by the nickname priest  So they thought you were he well the people who were new thought that I might be priest the people who had gone to DEF CON  And knew what priests look like he's incredibly tall and incredibly not olive-skinned  They thought that I was trying to impersonate priest  So I actually had a goon who threatened to beat me up that which that was kind of fun. He had a goon badge  He had a goon badge. Oh, yeah goons are these people who they're volunteers security guys come the security guys  They set up they basically do anything the organizers ask them to do  Absolutely fantastic  I mean if any of those goons are watching right now you you people keep that show running if it wasn't for you DEF CON

It's too complex for the online audience  It's too difficult. This is the quote  NBC says they told the LA Times the ceremonies are quote  complex entertainment  Spectacles that do not translate well online  Because they require context  Which our award-winning production team will provide for the large primetime audiences that gather together to watch them

They literally and they made a it was almost as if they were celebrating their ignorance Meredith Vieira says oh  This this is the cringe moment for me because you know, they had these LCD screens on the seats, which is cool  So they even though people are sitting in the seats  They still can do display in the seats like they did in China at Beijing was beautiful  She said there are 70,000 LCD panels on these seats. I have no idea what that means and I it's like  Does it not seem a little bit?  Retro to say oh technology. I don't get it  Everybody gets it now Meredith. It's no longer cool to admit that you're an ignorant  Externative technology. I understand. They don't know who Tim Berners-Lee is I wouldn't expect that

I know Tim Berners-Lee sir  Tim Berners-Lee is a man who invented the World Wide Web  You can't put put one person, you know and say this person invented the internet  There's too many people involved but you can say one person invented the World Wide Web and it's this guy and he's British  And he's sitting there with the next cube which I would have loved if they had said oh and sir Tim is  typing on the original  next cube computer that he invented the World Wide Web on and  He's going to tweet they didn't even understand that he was tweeting that he's now going to tweet a message to the world via his cube  They didn't say any of that. They said well, we don't know who he is. Look on he they said Google him  Was there was they think this was what this too complex?  Holy cow. The the trending hashtag was shut up Matt Lauer  Twitter  Is is NBC at fault or is this just the way the Olympics is it's so expensive NBC spent  I don't know what they spent must have spent millions and millions of dollars for the rights to broadcast

Transcript:  There's so much about the Olympics are sort of dominated by the expense like like the fact they're going around to pubs  In the UK and telling them they have to be careful about using words like London and summer in 2012 on their little chalkboard signs  Because it's illegal the IOC will sue you because it might tick off the beers that are sponsoring or McDonald's or whoever

Transcript:  unbelievable  Well to be to play kind of devil's advocate. Please do I'm waiting for a sensible as the old media guy  I  think NBC probably should have shown the the  Opening ceremonies when it happened. Yes, and probably should have done the you know  The stupid commentator thing the kind of the clueless commentator thing and then repeated it for prime time

Start time: 1572.64
End time: 1589.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have done the other way. I would have said let's do an unedited  Because by the way, they cut parts out so they could put more commercials in but let's do an unedited live stream without commentary  So people that's a that's a small there's still plenty of people gonna watch on primetime television gonna want want Matt and Meredith

Start time: 1589.22
End time: 1661.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are gonna want the commercials or watch it with just the Twitter stream on the screen. Let the Twitter's that be great  He let it let it be the commentary. But the problem is is that NBC and other  Big media companies have to serve two constituencies  they have to serve the people who have Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts and who are kind of  Active media users and then they also have a huge audience  Who's there people who are completely unaware that this controversy was going on until it showed up in television news stories or in their  newspapers or you know in some other form the traditional media that they follow and those are the ones who gave NBC  Huge ratings that that evening. Oh, I watched because I had to you watch it yet  But also I think the complaints about what was happening during the day and people not being able to see it drove a bigger  Maybe to NBC  So imagine what would have happened if you had had say that live stream and people tweeting about it, right?  And they told their friends. Oh, you'll see this this evening, right?  And then they had done it you probably would have had even a bigger audience  So NBC hopefully will learn something from this and this is probably the last Olympics where we'll see anything like that's what I'm thinking

Start time: 1661.70
End time: 1673.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four years from now. Well, here's the other thing is that you might say well  This is media has to do it this way to but the BBC  Broad is basically doing everything live online without commentary. They're doing it all

Transcript:  Version or whatever you can you can tell that that NBC partly gets it because they have made available all of this live stream  Content although, you know, there were still moments like there are some things that they're not showing and are delaying off of the live stream  And but so they kind of get it. They kind of know what they need to do, but they're just not quite there yet  You know, it's like it's it's a love affair and they're not giving it all, you know  You don't get anything real in a relationship until you give all and so it's a very unsatisfying relationship right now for NBC and its online audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So wait, are we not are we not just under the impression that this was about making sure that they got the ad dollars or the?  The the worth of the ad dollars for the advertisers  I mean like Apple paid who knows how much for their opening ceremonies ads and everybody else paid who knows how much for their opening ceremonies ads  And if I could have watched it five hours earlier or if I could have watched the non  Idiot-proofed feed someplace else then I wouldn't have seen the Apple ad right  I mean, it's so I don't also they're gonna get everybody to watch one thing at one time  I mean the only way to do that it seems to me is to make sure that they can't watch in any place else

Start time: 1765.68
End time: 1776.22

So so here's a question suppose that they had had done to broadcast suppose  They had done a live daytime when it happened broadcast and then I wouldn't do it as a broadcast  I take advantage of the Internet do it on the Internet only do it on the Internet  Yeah, but you still drive it interestingly from social media drives people to say you need to see this tonight  If you missed it, I think that you would get more viewers, right?

Transcript:  You'd make more money  Yep  so  Gizmodo has a good article how to watch every second of the Olympics which tells you how to basically get around  The restrictions NBC's placing on it, but at the beginning Brent Rose writes in 1996  176 and a half hours of the Olympics were broadcast  Not not the Internet obviously broadcast in 96 this year  between broadcast and Internet NBC is gonna put  5535 hours of Olympics  Online so you got to give them credit they are doing that. I do give them credit for that  I think it's really annoying and I think it's only because comcast owns NBC that they're saying you by the way  You have to have a cable or satellite or you have to have an account and have to be paying for MSNBC or CNBC  Or you cannot watch online and then so what people are doing is what Gizmodo is telling them how to do which is use  a proxy and watch it on the BBC  That seems like a bad it's probably illegal and  Probably doesn't work so well either, but and there are pirated streams. Yes. There's a lot of them out there  So in four years think that this is one thing that makes the Olympics and presidential elections by the way very interesting from an internet  Point of your technology point of view four years is a long time  So what did we predict will happen?  four years hence

That's what we need  NBC says anything that has a camera on it. We will at least stream if not broadcast  But I have to think well for instance that okay the opening ceremonies which were admittedly bizarre  but fun to watch they cut out a whole section so that  What's his name the guy from Ryan Seacrest could interview Michael Phelps like that's not gonna happen later anyway  Why don't you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're never gonna get them to be as honest as you want them to be though, right?  I mean if we assume that the reason they didn't put the opening ceremonies any place except in prime time is because they wanted  advertisers they said that they didn't show the the seven seven  Tribute which was I mean for people who missed it and who haven't heard the stories  They they part of the opening ceremonies were a tribute to the people who died in the bomb blast on  July 7th of 2005 just a few hours after London was announced as the location for the 2012 Olympic  That's pretty tasteless to cut that  Well, it wasn't geared towards an American audience is the quote that I heard and of course  Not geared towards an American audience and how many things do we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, i'll tell you why that happened. So that happened. No, there's a reason for that  Because it's a credit card charge and what they want to do is aggregate more than one if they can if they did it for every  Charge, you know that it costs them more so they want to get as much together. So that's true. That's always been the case  itunes  Receipts will come every few days, but when you buy something at the apple store  As an example you get your receipt before you get home

Transcript:  You know you mentioned that it's mostly for newer macs, but I was able i've got a mid 2007  iMac that's what i'm using right now and I was able to install it without a problem on that  That's the latest that's the oldest  iMac that will go on and I have a mid 2008 or mid 2009  MacBook pro, but I had problems installing it on the on the macbook pro when it installed  I kept getting this error message saying that  The file was corrupted or couldn't be verified and not to redownload it which I did three times  It turns out that for some odd reason it came it was it was saving to the disk with with incorrect permissions  So I had to go in and manually set the permissions on the file to allow read write and then it would work and then it  Stalled fine  But i'm using it on a five-year-old mac and it's great. Awesome. It's not is it faster  It's it's not faster, but it didn't slow it down initially  It was running a little slow, but that's because the spotlight indexer runs when you first install it  But now it's just it's like butter. It's as good as as I mean  I've not had a performance hit on this five-year-old mac with any of these os 10 updates  Each one has just has it's continued to be  Very fast for a 2000 mid 2007 iMac

Transcript:  Pretty happy with the update the big changes and I and I too have installed a number of machines by the way little little pro tip  Instead of downloading the almost five gigabyte file on every single machine. I just I looked at my comcast. I'm at  248 of the 250 gigs i'm allowed and i've got another week  Left so it's a good thing. I didn't do this. I downloaded on one machine  You'll get before don't install it because it erases the install file as soon as you've installed it  Which I think is kind of apple's shouldn't be doing that. I don't know why they're doing that  But they do to save space I guess  But before you install it open up you can right click or control click on the file the install os 10 mountain line file  And browse through the contents of the package and you'll find a file about a 4.7 gig file called install  esd  Dmg that's actually the installer you can copy that out and I did I put it on usb key  And then you move around from machine to machine  And uh, and that's the installer so that you can get the installer out of there  But you have to do it before you run the install because it deletes it at the end of the install

Start time: 2504.78
End time: 2520.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a very cool  apple script called lion disc maker that will  Create if you don't delete that will create either a usb key or a dvd installer  You just run the disc and it extracts everything for you and creates it

Start time: 2521.42
End time: 2635.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a simple thing if you've used disc utility to make a bootable usb key  I just didn't want to waste because it's a now it's a 4.7 gig usb key  I didn't want to waste the space. I guess you could put other stuff on it later, but it's going to erase the key  Anyway, that's handy. So big differences  The most notable one is there is now a notification center over on the right that will tell you  And right now it's only it's mostly apple programs that work. Although sparrow and chrome both will do notifications  I noticed in chrome you can turn on website notifications, which is kind of interesting. You'll get calendar  Reminders birthday reminders you'll get email notes that kind of thing  So this is very much like ios the notification center in ios, but is now part of os 10  Another big change that's a little bit more under the hood, but you might notice right away is gatekeeper, which is a security  a change to os 10  And it's kind of interesting what it does if it's in the security and privacy system preference pane  Is that where it is? Yeah under general  It's uh, it changes the way applications are installed on os 10. I think this isn't a bad idea, but it might bite some people  There are three different settings the most insecure is the one you've been using which is you can download and install apps from anywhere  the new default is you can download and install apps only from the mac app store or  Developers who have applied for and received a certificate from apple  Proving their identity which is also a good way to protect you because bad guys generally don't do that  And then the highest security setting  Uh, which has to be manually set as mac app store only, you know if you have kids or  Relatives who don't understand computers that might be a good setting but it bit me immediately  It's funny because i'm used to downloading apps all the time and you download an app  And then when you try to run it it says sorry, you can't run it

Start time: 2635.36
End time: 2638.24

Transcript:  Good, they do tell you which I like. Yeah, most developers don't they do tell you apple tells you when you do try to run an app  you downloaded  Um, all you have to do is right click or control click on the app and select open and it will then open it  One time for one time only even if it's an unprotected third party. I didn't know that because yeah  Yeah, and that's handy because normally what you would do is say i'm gonna change that setting and you don't really don't want to do that  I think normally  To uh to reduce the security

I was I was confused actually  I thought I had accidentally clicked on something else and I went back to system preferences and hit it all again  And then you know the second time it showed me the mac app store. I was like, oh, okay  So we're finally going to start doing that

Transcript:  If you go as apple users who want to do under the apple to software update  What would normally launch a system preference pane called software update actually launches?  The app store and you might say well, no, that's a mistake  But in fact now all updates for the system are coming through the app store  Interesting article. I don't know if you read this from marco armit the guy who wrote insta paper  Um, and he's saying the mac app store's future of irrelevance  He's pointing out that app that postbox which is a fairly well-known mail application has pulled out of the mac app store  And he says a lot of developers are pulling out because of things like there's no paid upgrades  Uh sandboxing is required  So in in order to be compatible with sandboxing you may have to remove some features  There's no demo versions available. It's just some significant  Uh restrictions in the app store that developers are increasingly upset with  And and this is what I thought was interesting marco  Points out as many of us who use the mac app store and use max  Have always said which is the mac app store is so great  i'm actually buying apps a second time unnecessarily just because I want the updates because of the convenience because I can install on my  Machines he says in the first year mac app store before sandboxing. I bought as much as I could from it  As a customer the convenience was so great. I even repurchased a few apps I already owned  But now i've lost all confidence that the apps I buy in the app store today will still be there next month  Or next year the advantages of buying from the app store are mostly gone now  He's concerned. I think and as others are that the app store  By being so restrictive is going to end up not being the go-to place for mac apps

Transcript:  There is some stuff that works fine on ios, which is more of a challenge on the mac like for instance  Issues with demo apps on ios are not as big a deal because if something is 99 cents big deal, right?  Just buy it and no tragedy if you don't like it and mac apps are not like that  You know that they still cost quite a bit more  And uh, you're probably going to be much more interested in trying them before you buy them  i'm very curious also what this means for windows 8 because  at least with the mac you have a choice between the mac app store  And buying stuff the old way and microsoft is saying that for windows 8 metro apps  You're that'll only go through the windows store  And so you're really hosed if that doesn't do what developers need that means if you're buying on the windows rt their tablet

I just that's quite right from from what you're telling me though  I mean, it seems like there are two  I mean people complain about the things like the mac app store or or the ios app store people used to complain about the ios  App store about how how curated everything was but I think we've sort of gotten on board on ios that that's really  Just for the general consumer and so we're kind of okay with some of the restrictions there or we've gotten used to it, right?  It's the whole car truck thing that jobs talked about. I mean are we are we trying to are we trying to  Kid proof and I don't mean kid proof  But I mean are we trying to kid proof the computing computer operating experience as well for all the people who are coming in for the first  time stupid proof it  And stupid.

I mean one of the things about mountain line is more and more like ios windows 8 is a is a perfect example more and more like  a tablet os  I think we are moving in that direction and I you know, unfortunately  Those of us here and those people who watch the show are exactly the wrong, you know  These are the we're the ones who want power and are and are willing to sacrifice

Transcript:  Uh ease of use for power. I think apple sort of got it right with with mountain lion. You can do  You get a choice this middle road. Yeah  Uh, or you can go the old way and do whatever you want or you can go super conservative and uh,  And the default is not super conservative and the one that's right most apple's centric  It's in the middle and um  As long as that's not a step towards a more restrictive future. I think it's just fine

Transcript:  with with windows 8 and you know my microsoft already is taking so many risks from the interface to  The approach to the way it works and the way documents work on it that to say that we're only going to allow you to get  um  These metro apps through our store may keep developers from developing metro apps or they'll develop apps for both sides  And you'll be able to get you know do much more with the traditional windows  Style apps and those will continue to be  Much more favorable to consumers  I think it's a you know microsoft  I think has a lot more to lose with the way it's it's doing its model than the way apple is

Start time: 3070.32
End time: 3134.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean because I mean think about the way the ios app store started right we had a year without it  And and certainly there were there were jail breaks and there were apps that people could install that way  But we had a year of of like sort of chomping at the bit and saying well  This is a great thing, but I wish it could do more so then when they opened up their app store  There wasn't like the uh, but I want to be able to get the app someplace else from most people most people were like  Hey, look super monkey fun ball or whatever, you know, one of the first like that was the first one. You're right  Right. Yeah, I can't remember what it was called. That's what I always call it  But I mean, so I mean so microsoft's looking at that and saying well, that's what apple did  But it's not exactly what apple did what apple did was gave you something that basically had like  12 things that it could do and it did them really beautifully and then you really couldn't do anything else with it  And so then when they opened up their app store people weren't grousing about not being able to get stuff any place else  For the most part people are saying look at all the new stuff that I can do  And so for for microsoft to start with that, you're right. I mean that does seem like they're just sort of putting themselves  Uh behind the eight ball or between a rock and a hard place or between the silla and caribdis take your pick  Silla and caribdis.

Transcript:  But they're not doing that anymore. I think teshiba and lenovo and everybody's still need to prep their machines and  And they're all working on you know machines which haven't been even been announced yet for windows 8  They need to make sure they work and remember with windows vista  One of the main reasons the experience was so bad with vista out of the gate was  That the um the companies that make the hardware did not have enough time to check their drivers  And so they had a miserable experience based on that  So I think having a window for verifying the stuff works is actually smart

Transcript:  Yeah, when when uh when journalists have asked the executives of microsoft, um, you know exactly what uh  How their hardware partners are reacting to it. They kind of smile and wave. Oh, they're fine. They're fine  No problems, but in their sec documents  They said under the first item under the the risks for this quarter  Are that uh the oems may not be very pleased that they're doing this and could cause disruption  In the relationship with the partners and certainly there were some  um, I believe uh, acer was not happy and publicly stated so and and  And microsoft didn't even tell its partners it was doing this until you know a day or two before the announcement of the surface  And there was reason for that. They didn't want these guys  Complaining before the event and and I think that that uh, you know again  There were all these huge risks that microsoft is taking with with windows 8 and this is just one of them  gabe, uh newell who is with um,  Who's the ceo and co-founder of valve used to work at microsoft thinks windows 8 is going to be a catastrophe for the um  For the windows ecosystem and he's he's trying to double down on linux as a uh, as a oh, yeah  Come on really?

Transcript:  I mean, you know  Obviously when they talk about the product transition and they're and they're trying not to say that it's going to be a new iphone  But then they're perfectly willing to talk about all the talk about a new iphone is, you know, killing sales for this quarter  Although I read a really interesting piece  Um walter picheck and this is actually sort of born up in the at&t stuff walter picheck said yeah  The problem isn't that people are waiting for the next iphone the problem is at&t and verizon and everybody have linked in their upgrade cycles  He said um in one of his notes and I can't remember where it was might have been business insider  He said in the note that he sent to uh to uh to investors or to clients or to whoever he sends notes to his mom  His fifth grade girlfriend, maybe  He said in the notes that that he sent that that he thinks that at&t probably would have sold just as many iphones  They would have actually  beaten  Eventually if they hadn't linked in the upgrade cycle and he's probably I mean maybe he's right and at&t doesn't care  at&t actually said in their in their earnings notes  Um that yes part of the way that they were able to keep cost down was by lengthening  The amount of time that people have to wait for another iphone  So i'm sorry. I just went like four different places there. I know I think it's interesting

Transcript:  In fact, uh, you know samsung both apple and samsung, uh had their uh quarterly earnings calls this week  Apple sold 26 million iphones in the quarter past samsung almost double that  Now that's including a variety of phones not just the galaxy s3  But I wonder if if I know all the analysts everybody's saying the iphone 5 or whatever they call  It's going to be the next big thing. It's going to be huge. It's going to sell better than any iphone previous  There's pent-up demand people have been waiting for years for this the fact that apple had to say we took  You know less of a we took a little hit this quarter because we didn't sell as many because everybody knows there's a new one coming  Uh, I think despite all that I don't I think it's a more competitive environment than it has been in the past  And I just think that apple is this is not an automatic. Maybe it is is it

Yes, but you know if if indeed the the next iphone looks like that  Prototype that uh that you showed  That's boring  It is that's yes, that's boring. That's not what I want to see from apple  I want to see something really new and different and exciting and it's at least this thin  Yep, you know and at least uh with a screen that's at least as nice as that only has to be that big because there's a problem with  With big screens and your thumb, you know  But uh, it needs to be bigger than what it is and it needs to be nicer than apple might have lost its mojo

Start time: 4066.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you say? Well what it needs more than anything else is lte. I mean, yeah, they're really behind in that regard  If you have an iphone with lte, that's kind of all the excitement  I want that will be such a big improvement as long as I can keep the battery life good

Start time: 4078.20
End time: 4089.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At&t is still catching up, right? But you don't want to buy a new phone. Yeah, you're not gonna buy a 3g phone  Yeah, you're right  And so I think the big challenge for apple is everybody else is willing to ship an lte phone with terrible battery life  I think apple will only do it if they can make a battery which is huge  I mean some of the rumors about the new iphone is that the screen is thinner  My guess is they will take as much as possible that extra space and make the battery larger  Even the connector being smaller might be so the battery can be larger  They really don't want to say that we have an lte phone, but the battery life is 30 lower

You know, i'm seriously thinking most android apps are cheap or free  Most android apps are free  I went through and totaled how much i've spent over time, but that's a lot of work. Most people don't do that  No, but you're aware of it subconsciously  I mean if you if you've bought for example, if you bought each one of apple's uh, you know pages and keynote and  Numbers if you bought each one of those for ios, that's 30 bucks  And while each one of them at 9.99 isn't that much i've spent 30 bucks on productivity apps  Am I going to have to go and do that again?  for android  so i'm  so the apps are a factor when you're thinking about making the leap and  And I may end up doing it, but that that is in the back of my mind an issue

It was just kind of stalled out and I I sold my apple stock that I bought  After the ipo  But so I don't necessarily I think it's too early  But I think what we're learning is that facebook is just another business internet business supported by advertising, right?  Which is hard to do right and I think people kind of were dazzled by  You know facebook's history and the movie and and certainly its growth, you know, it's got you know  Almost a billion users, but at the same time monetizing them is not easy with advertising

It's like it like went from it went from  Um, forgive me because i'm not a print journalist. It went from reporting to sort of like a short story  Like well, here's what would be neat and here's why it could happen. Can't these two kids just get together in technology

Yeah  So there was a story about uh an explosion at an apple supplier, right?  Or a gas leak at an apple supplier this weekend one person dead four people injured or five people I guess dead one of them  no fight  One person died four people are injured, right?  And then when you read more into the story it turns out that that same company catcher is also a supplier for dell and for  Hp and lenovo and I cannot remember who the other one was and then come to find out it was actually something that happened in their waste  Uh water treatment facility had nothing to do with anybody's manufacturing at all, but a number of reputable  news organizations said  uh explosion or a gas leak at apple supplier  Endures and kills and it's sort of I mean it's it's it's link baity and it's sort of awful  And it's a terrible story and the thing is it's a tragic story  And it's something that we should if we're interested in that kind of thing  We should pay attention to but just splashing apple's name on the front of it when I mean

Start time: 4973.58
End time: 5009.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's clearly a bid to get views right and it has nothing to do with the story  And i'm seeing that more and more  I expect it from blogs. That's that's you know, mashable. Of course, they're gonna have link bait  Tech crunch, of course, it's gonna have link bait but from the new york times the wall street journal. I hate to see that. I'm just  Maybe I have an illusion about these guys that uh, I don't know  Houston chronicle would never do that would they dwight?

Transcript:  um, you have a story apple is you know  The that company does supply things to apple you want people to pay attention to it  And so the editor says or maybe the reporter says, uh, put apple in the lead and so apple goes in the lead  The reporter may actually have written it with you know straight and the editor sees oh  This is apple, you know, let's put them in the lead  the the more ethical thing to do would be  um  You know to write the story strictly that a supplier for apple and many other if you want to do that  And then make sure you make clear very high up  You know that that it was wastewater and that it wasn't involved in the manufacturing process and you do that in the second graph  That's probably the better way to do that story and still get the point that this is part of apple  the other thing is is there's a there's a  Backstory involving apple and safety and the previous explosion in the foxconn plant  And so I think that people you know  They want to invoke kind of that that memory of it the whole issue of safety in this  But and you know, it's all it's all in the writing and it's all in the presentation and and the way that story was structured  Yeah, that was not correctly done

Even though it has been debunked at least as far as the mike daisy part is concerned and certainly apple has done some stuff  And I don't mean I mean, I don't mean to make it sound like well apple can do no wrong because certainly they can  Um things at foxconn have been bad for a long time  I especially by our standards but by you know, the standards of some of the people that work in china as well  but I mean it just it just it just felt like it was part of that same thing, oh here's apple not given a  Explodive deleted about their workers again  And you know when there was really a lot more going on and very little if any of it had anything to do with that one

Apparently overloaded network is affecting television coverage because commentators can't get information  From the gps  Satellite nav or anything it's all broken because everybody's tweeting and of course what happened when they asked that a bunch of angry brits  tweeted it  What do you mean we can't use twitter  A network issue caused by hundreds of thousands of fans this they said this would be the twitter olympics and it is  Hundreds of thousands of fans lined the street of london to cheer the british team on sending messages from their twitter  He said the uh, the uh, ioc spokesman said if you could just spread it out a little bit  Of course if you want to send something we're not going to say don't you can't do it  It's just if it's not urgent just please kind of take it easy  That was literally this is the quote. It's just if it's not an urgent urgent one, please kind of take it easy. We don't  That's kind of amazing I can only imagine the strain on the network from all of that stuff and youtube I guess is doing  a lot of this stuff  um  I did want to give credit  To uh nick uh bilton for a good bits blog piece on craigslist. Did you read this?  um  Pointing out the craigslist and uh has really transformed  Advertising and actually put some newspapers out of business by replacing their classified ads with the free craigslist website  They've not been so friendly  To people who want to aggregate or in some way, you know, take the information from craigslist and make it more easy  They use as a case in point eric de menthon a 27 year old programmer  Who built an application that placed craigslist apartment ads on an online map  So you look at the map you say I want that neighborhood you can quickly find the listing something craigslist did not so he made  Something he called pad mapper. There it is  Last week craigslist served him with a lawsuit claiming an infringement of copyright and trademark  But de menthon said i'm kind of disappointed I was always a great admirer of what craigslist is doing  I'm, just trying to help people save time and in fact  Law firms lawyers say he's not violating any there is no trademark or copyright on classified advertising  Furthermore craigslist said oh, we only go after sites that hurt our servers that use our bandwidth and this pad mapper does not do that  pad mapper actually  uses search results  Uh  Is not hitting craigslist at all. They're using a service called, uh,  three taps  That does that goes it goes to search it's google they're using google's uh bandwidth  So it I think is a provocative article we we actually tried to get craig on  This week in google and he his people said that  Mr. Newmark is not doing any interviews and now I think I understand why  Doesn't want to really talk about this  Good article nick on that one any comment  Nothing to say you're uncharacteristically silent
